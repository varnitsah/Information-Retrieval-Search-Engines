stranger      a fable      hunting the deceitful turkey      the mcwilliamses and the burglar alarm      the mysterious stranger    chapter 1  it was in 1590winter austria was far away from the world and asleep it was still the middle ages in austria and promised to remain so forever some even set it away back centuries upon centuries and said that by the mental and spiritual clock it was still the age of belief in austria but they meant it as a compliment not a slur and it was so taken and we were all proud of it i remember it well although i was only a boy and i remember too the pleasure it gave me  yes austria was far from the world and asleep and our village was in the middle of that sleep being in the middle of austria it drowsed in peace in the deep privacy of a hilly and woodsy solitude where news from the world hardly ever came to disturb its dreams and was infinitely content at its front flowed the tranquil river its surface painted with cloudforms and the reflections of drifting arks and stoneboats behind it rose the woody steeps to the base of the lofty precipice from the top of the precipice frowned a vast castle its long stretch of towers and bastions mailed in vines beyond the river a league to the left was a tumbled expanse of forestclothed hills cloven by winding gorges where the sun never penetrated and to the right a precipice overlooked the river and between it and the hills just spoken of lay a farreaching plain dotted with little homesteads nested among orchards and shade trees  the whole region for leagues around was the hereditary property of a prince whose servants kept the castle always in perfect condition for occupancy but neither he nor his family came there oftener than once in five years when they came it was as if the lord of the world had arrived and had brought all the glories of its kingdoms along and when they went they left a calm behind which was like the deep sleep which follows an orgy  eseldorf was a paradise for us boys we were not overmuch pestered with schooling mainly we were trained to be good christians to revere the virgin the church and the saints above everything beyond these matters we were not required to know much and in fact not allowed to knowledge was not good for the common people and could make them discontented with the lot which god had appointed for them and god would not endure discontentment with his plans we had two priests one of them father adolf was a very zealous and strenuous priest much considered  there may have been better priests in some ways than father adolf but there was never one in our commune who was held in more solemn and awful respect this was because he had absolutely no fear of the devil he was the only christian i have ever known of whom that could be truly said people stood in deep dread of him on that account for they thought that there must be something supernatural about him else he could not be so bold and so confident all men speak in bitter disapproval of the devil but they do it reverently not flippantly but father adolfs way was very different he called him by every name he could lay his tongue to and it made everyone shudder that heard him and often he would even speak of him scornfully and scoffingly then the people crossed themselves and went quickly out of his presence fearing that something fearful might happen  father adolf had actually met satan face to face more than once and defied him this was known to be so father adolf said it himself he never made any secret of it but spoke it right out and that he was speaking true there was proof in at least one instance for on that occasion he quarreled with the enemy and intrepidly threw his bottle at him and there upon the wall of his study was the ruddy splotch where it struck and broke but it was father peter the other priest that we all loved best and were sorriest for some people charged him with talking around in conversation that god was all goodness and would find a way to save all his poor human children it was a horrible thing to say but there was never any absolute proof that father peter said it and it was out of character for him to say it too for he was always good and gentle and truthful he wasnt charged with saying it in the pulpit where all the congregation could hear and testify but only outside in talk and it is easy for enemies to manufacture that father peter had an enemy and a very powerful one the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old tower up the valley and put in his nights studying the stars every one knew he could foretell wars and famines though that was not so hard for there was always a war and generally a famine somewhere but he could also read any mans life through the stars in a big book he had and find lost property and every one in the village except father peter stood in awe of him even father adolf who had defied the devil had a wholesome respect for the astrologer when he came through our village wearing his tall pointed hat and his long flowing robe with stars on it carrying his big book and a staff which was known to have magic power the bishop himself sometimes listened to the astrologer it was said for besides studying the stars and prophesying the astrologer made a great show of piety which would impress the bishop of course  but father peter took no stock in the astrologer he denounced him openly as a charlatana fraud with no valuable knowledge of any kind or powers beyond those of an ordinary and rather inferior human being which naturally made the astrologer hate father peter and wish to ruin him it was the astrologer as we all believed who originated the story about father peters shocking remark and carried it to the bishop it was said that father peter had made the remark to his niece marget though marget denied it and implored the bishop to believe her and spare her old uncle from poverty and disgrace but the bishop wouldnt listen he suspended father peter indefinitely though he wouldnt go so far as to excommunicate him on the evidence of only one witness and now father peter had been out a couple of years and our other priest father adolf had his flock  those had been hard years for the old priest and marget they had been favorites but of course that changed when they came under the shadow of the bishops frown many of their friends fell away entirely and the rest became cool and distant marget was a lovely girl of eighteen when the trouble came and she had the best head in the village and the most in it she taught the harp and earned all her clothes and pocket money by her own industry but her scholars fell off one by one now she was forgotten when there were dances and parties among the youth of the village the young fellows stopped coming to the house all except wilhelm meidlingand he could have been spared she and her uncle were sad and forlorn in their neglect and disgrace and the sunshine was gone out of their lives matters went worse and worse all through the two years clothes were wearing out bread was harder and harder to get and now at last the very end was come solomon isaacs had lent all the money he was willing to put on the house and gave notice that tomorrow he would foreclose     chapter 2  three of us boys were always together and had been so from the cradle being fond of one another from the beginning and this affection deepened as the years went onnikolaus bauman son of the principal judge of the local court seppi wohlmeyer son of the keeper of the principal inn the golden stag which had a nice garden with shade trees reaching down to the riverside and pleasure boats for hire and i was the thirdtheodor fischer son of the church organist who was also leader of the village musicians teacher of the violin composer taxcollector of the commune sexton and in other ways a useful citizen and respected by all we knew the hills and the woods as well as the birds knew them for we were always roaming them when we had leisureat least when we were not swimming or boating or fishing or playing on the ice or sliding down hill  and we had the run of the castle park and very few had that it was because we were pets of the oldest servingman in the castlefelix brandt and often we went there nights to hear him talk about old times and strange things and to smoke with him he taught us that and to drink coffee for he had served in the wars and was at the siege of vienna and there when the turks were defeated and driven away among the captured things were bags of coffee and the turkish prisoners explained the character of it and how to make a pleasant drink out of it and now he always kept coffee by him to drink himself and also to astonish the ignorant with when it stormed he kept us all night and while it thundered and lightened outside he told us about ghosts and horrors of every kind and of battles and murders and mutilations and such things and made it pleasant and cozy inside and he told these things from his own experience largely he had seen many ghosts in his time and witches and enchanters and once he was lost in a fierce storm at midnight in the mountains and by the glare of the lightning had seen the wild huntsman rage on the blast with his specter dogs chasing after him through the driving cloudrack also he had seen an incubus once and several times he had seen the great bat that sucks the blood from the necks of people while they are asleep fanning them softly with its wings and so keeping them drowsy till they die  he encouraged us not to fear supernatural things such as ghosts and said they did no harm but only wandered about because they were lonely and distressed and wanted kindly notice and compassion and in time we learned not to be afraid and even went down with him in the night to the haunted chamber in the dungeons of the castle the ghost appeared only once and it went by very dim to the sight and floated noiseless through the air and then disappeared and we scarcely trembled he had taught us so well he said it came up sometimes in the night and woke him by passing its clammy hand over his face but it did him no hurt it only wanted sympathy and notice but the strangest thing was that he had seen angelsactual angels out of heavenand had talked with them they had no wings and wore clothes and talked and looked and acted just like any natural person and you would never know them for angels except for the wonderful things they did which a mortal could not do and the way they suddenly disappeared while you were talking with them which was also a thing which no mortal could do and he said they were pleasant and cheerful not gloomy and melancholy like ghosts  it was after that kind of a talk one may night that we got up next morning and had a good breakfast with him and then went down and crossed the bridge and went away up into the hills on the left to a woody hilltop which was a favorite place of ours and there we stretched out on the grass in the shade to rest and smoke and talk over these strange things for they were in our minds yet and impressing us but we couldnt smoke because we had been heedless and left our flint and steel behind  soon there came a youth strolling toward us through the trees and he sat down and began to talk in a friendly way just as if he knew us but we did not answer him for he was a stranger and we were not used to strangers and were shy of them he had new and good clothes on and was handsome and had a winning face and a pleasant voice and was easy and graceful and unembarrassed not slouchy and awkward and diffident like other boys we wanted to be friendly with him but didnt know how to begin then i thought of the pipe and wondered if it would be taken as kindly meant if i offered it to him but i remembered that we had no fire so i was sorry and disappointed but he looked up bright and pleased and said  fire oh that is easy i will furnish it  i was so astonished i couldnt speak for i had not said anything he took the pipe and blew his breath on it and the tobacco glowed red and spirals of blue smoke rose up we jumped up and were going to run for that was natural and we did run a few steps although he was yearningly pleading for us to stay and giving us his word that he would not do us any harm but only wanted to be friends with us and have company so we stopped and stood and wanted to go back being full of curiosity and wonder but afraid to venture he went on coaxing in his soft persuasive way and when we saw that the pipe did not blow up and nothing happened our confidence returned by little and little and presently our curiosity got to be stronger than our fear and we ventured backbut slowly and ready to fly at any alarm  he was bent on putting us at ease and he had the right art one could not remain doubtful and timorous where a person was so earnest and simple and gentle and talked so alluringly as he did no he won us over and it was not long before we were content and comfortable and chatty and glad we had found this new friend when the feeling of constraint was all gone we asked him how he had learned to do that strange thing and he said he hadnt learned it at all it came natural to himlike other thingsother curious things  what ones  oh a number i dont know how many  will you let us see you do them  doplease the others said  you wont run away again  noindeed we wont please do wont you  yes with pleasure but you mustnt forget your promise you know  we said we wouldnt and he went to a puddle and came back with water in a cup which he had made out of a leaf and blew upon it and threw it out and it was a lump of ice the shape of the cup we were astonished and charmed but not afraid any more we were very glad to be there and asked him to go on and do some more things and he did he said he would give us any kind of fruit we liked whether it was in season or not we all spoke at once  orange  apple  grapes  they are in your pockets he said and it was true and they were of the best too and we ate them and wished we had more though none of us said so  you will find them where those came from he said and everything else your appetites call for and you need not name the thing you wish as long as i am with you you have only to wish and find  and he said true there was never anything so wonderful and so interesting bread cakes sweets nutswhatever one wanted it was there he ate nothing himself but sat and chatted and did one curious thing after another to amuse us he made a tiny toy squirrel out of clay and it ran up a tree and sat on a limb overhead and barked down at us then he made a dog that was not much larger than a mouse and it treed the squirrel and danced about the tree excited and barking and was as alive as any dog could be it frightened the squirrel from tree to tree and followed it up until both were out of sight in the forest he made birds out of clay and set them free and they flew away singing  at last i made bold to ask him to tell us who he was  an angel he said quite simply and set another bird free and clapped his hands and made it fly away  a kind of awe fell upon us when we heard him say that and we were afraid again but he said we need not be troubled there was no occasion for us to be afraid of an angel and he liked us anyway he went on chatting as simply and unaffectedly as ever and while he talked he made a crowd of little men and women the size of your finger and they went diligently to work and cleared and leveled off a space a couple of yards square in the grass and began to build a cunning little castle in it the women mixing the mortar and carrying it up the scaffoldings in pails on their heads just as our workwomen have always done and the men laying the courses of masonryfive hundred of these toy people swarming briskly about and working diligently and wiping the sweat off their faces as natural as life in the absorbing interest of watching those five hundred little people make the castle grow step by step and course by course and take shape and symmetry that feeling and awe soon passed away and we were quite comfortable and at home again we asked if we might make some people and he said yes and told seppi to make some cannon for the walls and told nikolaus to make some halberdiers with breastplates and greaves and helmets and i was to make some cavalry with horses and in allotting these tasks he called us by our names but did not say how he knew them then seppi asked him what his own name was and he said tranquilly satan and held out a chip and caught a little woman on it who was falling from the scaffolding and put her back where she belonged and said she is an idiot to step backward like that and not notice what she is about  it caught us suddenly that name did and our work dropped out of our hands and broke to piecesa cannon a halberdier and a horse satan laughed and asked what was the matter i said nothing only it seemed a strange name for an angel he asked why  because itsitswell its his name you know  yeshe is my uncle  he said it placidly but it took our breath for a moment and made our hearts beat he did not seem to notice that but mended our halberdiers and things with a touch handing them to us finished and said dont you rememberhe was an angel himself once  yesits true said seppi i didnt think of that  before the fall he was blameless  yes said nikolaus he was without sin  it is a good familyours said satan there is not a better he is the only member of it that has ever sinned  i should not be able to make any one understand how exciting it all was you know that kind of quiver that trembles around through you when you are seeing something so strange and enchanting and wonderful that it is just a fearful joy to be alive and look at it and you know how you gaze and your lips turn dry and your breath comes short but you wouldnt be anywhere but there not for the world i was bursting to ask one questioni had it on my tongues end and could hardly hold it backbut i was ashamed to ask it it might be a rudeness satan set an ox down that he had been making and smiled up at me and said  it wouldnt be a rudeness and i should forgive it if it was have i seen him millions of times from the time that i was a little child a thousand years old i was his second favorite among the nursery angels of our blood and lineageto use a human phraseyes from that time until the fall eight thousand years measured as you count time  eightthousand  yes he turned to seppi and went on as if answering something that was in seppis mind why naturally i look like a boy for that is what i am with us what you call time is a spacious thing it takes a long stretch of it to grow an angel to full age there was a question in my mind and he turned to me and answered it i am sixteen thousand years oldcounting as you count then he turned to nikolaus and said no the fall did not affect me nor the rest of the relationship it was only he that i was named for who ate of the fruit of the tree and then beguiled the man and the woman with it we others are still ignorant of sin we are not able to commit it we are without blemish and shall abide in that estate always we two of the little workmen were quarreling and in buzzing little bumblebee voices they were cursing and swearing at each other now came blows and blood then they locked themselves together in a lifeanddeath struggle satan reached out his hand and crushed the life out of them with his fingers threw them away wiped the red from his fingers on his handkerchief and went on talking where he had left off we cannot do wrong neither have we any disposition to do it for we do not know what it is  it seemed a strange speech in the circumstances but we barely noticed that we were so shocked and grieved at the wanton murder he had committedfor murder it was that was its true name and it was without palliation or excuse for the men had not wronged him in any way it made us miserable for we loved him and had thought him so noble and so beautiful and gracious and had honestly believed he was an angel and to have him do this cruel thingah it lowered him so and we had had such pride in him he went right on talking just as if nothing had happened telling about his travels and the interesting things he had seen in the big worlds of our solar systems and of other solar systems far away in the remotenesses of space and about the customs of the immortals that inhabit them somehow fascinating us enchanting us charming us in spite of the pitiful scene that was now under our eyes for the wives of the little dead men had found the crushed and shapeless bodies and were crying over them and sobbing and lamenting and a priest was kneeling there with his hands crossed upon his breast praying and crowds and crowds of pitying friends were massed about them reverently uncovered with their bare heads bowed and many with the tears running downa scene which satan paid no attention to until the small noise of the weeping and praying began to annoy him then he reached out and took the heavy board seat out of our swing and brought it down and mashed all those people into the earth just as if they had been flies and went on talking just the same an angel and kill a priest an angel who did not know how to do wrong and yet destroys in cold blood hundreds of helpless poor men and women who had never done him any harm it made us sick to see that awful deed and to think that none of those poor creatures was prepared except the priest for none of them had ever heard a mass or seen a church and we were witnesses we had seen these murders done and it was our duty to tell and let the law take its course  but he went on talking right along and worked his enchantments upon us again with that fatal music of his voice he made us forget everything we could only listen to him and love him and be his slaves to do with us as he would he made us drunk with the joy of being with him and of looking into the heaven of his eyes and of feeling the ecstasy that thrilled along our veins from the touch of his hand   chapter 3  the stranger had seen everything he had been everywhere he knew everything and he forgot nothing what another must study he learned at a glance there were no difficulties for him and he made things live before you when he told about them he saw the world made he saw adam created he saw samson surge against the pillars and bring the temple down in ruins about him he saw caesars death he told of the daily life in heaven he had seen the damned writhing in the red waves of hell and he made us see all these things and it was as if we were on the spot and looking at them with our own eyes and we felt them too but there was no sign that they were anything to him beyond mere entertainments those visions of hell those poor babes and women and girls and lads and men shrieking and supplicating in anguishwhy we could hardly bear it but he was as bland about it as if it had been so many imitation rats in an artificial fire  and always when he was talking about men and women here on the earth and their doingseven their grandest and sublimestwe were secretly ashamed for his manner showed that to him they and their doings were of paltry poor consequence often you would think he was talking about flies if you didnt know once he even said in so many words that our people down here were quite interesting to him notwithstanding they were so dull and ignorant and trivial and conceited and so diseased and rickety and such a shabby poor worthless lot all around he said it in a quite matterofcourse way and without bitterness just as a person might talk about bricks or manure or any other thing that was of no consequence and hadnt feelings i could see he meant no offense but in my thoughts i set it down as not very good manners  manners he said why it is merely the truth and truth is good manners manners are a fiction the castle is done do you like it  any one would have been obliged to like it it was lovely to look at it was so shapely and fine and so cunningly perfect in all its particulars even to the little flags waving from the turrets satan said we must put the artillery in place now and station the halberdiers and display the cavalry our men and horses were a spectacle to see they were so little like what they were intended for for of course we had no art in making such things satan said they were the worst he had seen and when he touched them and made them alive it was just ridiculous the way they acted on account of their legs not being of uniform lengths they reeled and sprawled around as if they were drunk and endangered everybodys lives around them and finally fell over and lay helpless and kicking it made us all laugh though it was a shameful thing to see the guns were charged with dirt to fire a salute but they were so crooked and so badly made that they all burst when they went off and killed some of the gunners and crippled the others satan said we would have a storm now and an earthquake if we liked but we must stand off a piece out of danger we wanted to call the people away too but he said never mind them they were of no consequence and we could make more some time or other if we needed them  a small stormcloud began to settle down black over the castle and the miniature lightning and thunder began to play and the ground to quiver and the wind to pipe and wheeze and the rain to fall and all the people flocked into the castle for shelter the cloud settled down blacker and blacker and one could see the castle only dimly through it the lightning blazed out flash upon flash and pierced the castle and set it on fire and the flames shone out red and fierce through the cloud and the people came flying out shrieking but satan brushed them back paying no attention to our begging and crying and imploring and in the midst of the howling of the wind and volleying of the thunder the magazine blew up the earthquake rent the ground wide and the castles wreck and ruin tumbled into the chasm which swallowed it from sight and closed upon it with all that innocent life not one of the five hundred poor creatures escaping our hearts were broken we could not keep from crying  dont cry satan said they were of no value  but they are gone to hell  oh it is no matter we can make plenty more  it was of no use to try to move him evidently he was wholly without feeling and could not understand he was full of bubbling spirits and as gay as if this were a wedding instead of a fiendish massacre and he was bent on making us feel as he did and of course his magic accomplished his desire it was no trouble to him he did whatever he pleased with us in a little while we were dancing on that grave and he was playing to us on a strange sweet instrument which he took out of his pocket and the musicbut there is no music like that unless perhaps in heaven and that was where he brought it from he said it made one mad for pleasure and we could not take our eyes from him and the looks that went out of our eyes came from our hearts and their dumb speech was worship he brought the dance from heaven too and the bliss of paradise was in it  presently he said he must go away on an errand but we could not bear the thought of it and clung to him and pleaded with him to stay and that pleased him and he said so and said he would not go yet but would wait a little while and we would sit down and talk a few minutes longer and he told us satan was only his real name and he was to be known by it to us alone but he had chosen another one to be called by in the presence of others just a common one such as people havephilip traum  it sounded so odd and mean for such a being but it was his decision and we said nothing his decision was sufficient  we had seen wonders this day and my thoughts began to run on the pleasure it would be to tell them when i got home but he noticed those thoughts and said  no all these matters are a secret among us four i do not mind your trying to tell them if you like but i will protect your tongues and nothing of the secret will escape from them  it was a disappointment but it couldnt be helped and it cost us a sigh or two we talked pleasantly along and he was always reading our thoughts and responding to them and it seemed to me that this was the most wonderful of all the things he did but he interrupted my musings and said  no it would be wonderful for you but it is not wonderful for me i am not limited like you i am not subject to human conditions i can measure and understand your human weaknesses for i have studied them but i have none of them my flesh is not real although it would seem firm to your touch my clothes are not real i am a spirit father peter is coming we looked around but did not see any one he is not in sight yet but you will see him presently  do you know him satan  no  wont you talk with him when he comes he is not ignorant and dull like us and he would so like to talk with you will you  another time yes but not now i must go on my errand after a little there he is now you can see him sit still and dont say anything  we looked up and saw father peter approaching through the chestnuts we three were sitting together in the grass and satan sat in front of us in the path father peter came slowly along with his head down thinking and stopped within a couple of yards of us and took off his hat and got out his silk handkerchief and stood there mopping his face and looking as if he were going to speak to us but he didnt presently he muttered i cant think what brought me here it seems as if i were in my study a minute agobut i suppose i have been dreaming along for an hour and have come all this stretch without noticing for i am not myself in these troubled days then he went mumbling along to himself and walked straight through satan just as if nothing were there it made us catch our breath to see it we had the impulse to cry out the way you nearly always do when a startling thing happens but something mysteriously restrained us and we remained quiet only breathing fast then the trees hid father peter after a little and satan said  it is as i told youi am only a spirit  yes one perceives it now said nikolaus but we are not spirits it is plain he did not see you but were we invisible too he looked at us but he didnt seem to see us  no none of us was visible to him for i wished it so  it seemed almost too good to be true that we were actually seeing these romantic and wonderful things and that it was not a dream and there he sat looking just like anybodyso natural and simple and charming and chatting along again the same as ever andwell words cannot make you understand what we felt it was an ecstasy and an ecstasy is a thing that will not go into words it feels like music and one cannot tell about music so that another person can get the feeling of it he was back in the old ages once more now and making them live before us he had seen so much so much it was just a wonder to look at him and try to think how it must seem to have such experience behind one  but it made you seem sorrowfully trivial and the creature of a day and such a short and paltry day too and he didnt say anything to raise up your drooping prideno not a word he always spoke of men in the same old indifferent wayjust as one speaks of bricks and manurepiles and such things you could see that they were of no consequence to him one way or the other he didnt mean to hurt us you could see that just as we dont mean to insult a brick when we disparage it a bricks emotions are nothing to us it never occurs to us to think whether it has any or not  once when he was bunching the most illustrious kings and conquerors and poets and prophets and pirates and beggars togetherjust a brickpilei was shamed into putting in a word for man and asked him why he made so much difference between men and himself he had to struggle with that a moment he didnt seem to understand how i could ask such a strange question then he said  the difference between man and me the difference between a mortal and an immortal between a cloud and a spirit he picked up a woodlouse that was creeping along a piece of bark what is the difference between caesar and this  i said one cannot compare things which by their nature and by the interval between them are not comparable  you have answered your own question he said i will expand it man is made of dirti saw him made i am not made of dirt man is a museum of diseases a home of impurities he comes today and is gone tomorrow he begins as dirt and departs as stench i am of the aristocracy of the imperishables and man has the moral sense you understand he has the moral sense that would seem to be difference enough between us all by itself  he stopped there as if that settled the matter i was sorry for at that time i had but a dim idea of what the moral sense was i merely knew that we were proud of having it and when he talked like that about it it wounded me and i felt as a girl feels who thinks her dearest finery is being admired and then overhears strangers making fun of it for a while we were all silent and i for one was depressed then satan began to chat again and soon he was sparkling along in such a cheerful and vivacious vein that my spirits rose once more he told some very cunning things that put us in a gale of laughter and when he was telling about the time that samson tied the torches to the foxes tails and set them loose in the philistines corn and samson sitting on the fence slapping his thighs and laughing with the tears running down his cheeks and lost his balance and fell off the fence the memory of that picture got him to laughing too and we did have a most lovely and jolly time by and by he said  i am going on my errand now  dont we all said dont go stay with us you wont come back  yes i will i give you my word  when tonight say when  it wont be long you will see  we like you  and i you and as a proof of it i will show you something fine to see usually when i go i merely vanish but now i will dissolve myself and let you see me do it  he stood up and it was quickly finished he thinned away and thinned away until he was a soapbubble except that he kept his shape you could see the bushes through him as clearly as you see things through a soapbubble and all over him played and flashed the delicate iridescent colors of the bubble and along with them was that thing shaped like a windowsash which you always see on the globe of the bubble you have seen a bubble strike the carpet and lightly bound along two or three times before it bursts he did that he sprangtouched the grassboundedfloated alongtouched againand so on and presently explodedpuff and in his place was vacancy  it was a strange and beautiful thing to see we did not say anything but sat wondering and dreaming and blinking and finally seppi roused up and said mournfully sighing  i suppose none of it has happened  nikolaus sighed and said about the same  i was miserable to hear them say it for it was the same cold fear that was in my own mind then we saw poor old father peter wandering along back with his head bent down searching the ground when he was pretty close to us he looked up and saw us and said how long have you been here boys  a little while father  then it is since i came by and maybe you can help me did you come up by the path  yes father  that is good i came the same way i have lost my wallet there wasnt much in it but a very little is much to me for it was all i had i suppose you havent seen anything of it  no father but we will help you hunt  it is what i was going to ask you why here it is  we hadnt noticed it yet there it lay right where satan stood when he began to meltif he did melt and it wasnt a delusion father peter picked it up and looked very much surprised  it is mine he said but not the contents this is fat mine was flat mine was light this is heavy he opened it it was stuffed as full as it could hold with gold coins he let us gaze our fill and of course we did gaze for we had never seen so much money at one time before all our mouths came open to say satan did it but nothing came out there it was you seewe couldnt tell what satan didnt want told he had said so himself  boys did you do this  it made us laugh and it made him laugh too as soon as he thought what a foolish question it was  who has been here  our mouths came open to answer but stood so for a moment because we couldnt say nobody for it wouldnt be true and the right word didnt seem to come then i thought of the right one and said it  not a human being  that is so said the others and let their mouths go shut  it is not so said father peter and looked at us very severely i came by here a while ago and there was no one here but that is nothing some one has been here since i dont mean to say that the person didnt pass here before you came and i dont mean to say you saw him but some one did pass that i know on your honoryou saw no one  not a human being  that is sufficient i know you are telling me the truth  he began to count the money on the path we on our knees eagerly helping to stack it in little piles  its eleven hundred ducats odd he said oh dear if it were only mineand i need it so and his voice broke and his lips quivered  it is yours sir we all cried out at once every heller  noit isnt mine only four ducats are mine the rest he fell to dreaming poor old soul and caressing some of the coins in his hands and forgot where he was sitting there on his heels with his old gray head bare it was pitiful to see no he said waking up it isnt mine i cant account for it i think some enemy it must be a trap  nikolaus said father peter with the exception of the astrologer you havent a real enemy in the villagenor marget either and not even a halfenemy thats rich enough to chance eleven hundred ducats to do you a mean turn ill ask you if thats so or not  he couldnt get around that argument and it cheered him up but it isnt mine you seeit isnt mine in any case  he said it in a wistful way like a person that wouldnt be sorry but glad if anybody would contradict him  it is yours father peter and we are witness to it arent we boys  yes we areand well stand by it too  bless your hearts you do almost persuade me you do indeed if i had only a hundredodd ducats of it the house is mortgaged for it and weve no home for our heads if we dont pay tomorrow and that four ducats is all weve got in the  its yours every bit of it and youve got to take itwe are bail that its all right arent we theodor arent we seppi  we two said yes and nikolaus stuffed the money back into the shabby old wallet and made the owner take it so he said he would use two hundred of it for his house was good enough security for that and would put the rest at interest till the rightful owner came for it and on our side we must sign a paper showing how he got the moneya paper to show to the villagers as proof that he had not got out of his troubles dishonestly   chapter 4  it made immense talk next day when father peter paid solomon isaacs in gold and left the rest of the money with him at interest also there was a pleasant change many people called at the house to congratulate him and a number of cool old friends became kind and friendly again and to top all marget was invited to a party  and there was no mystery father peter told the whole circumstance just as it happened and said he could not account for it only it was the plain hand of providence so far as he could see  one or two shook their heads and said privately it looked more like the hand of satan and really that seemed a surprisingly good guess for ignorant people like that some came slyly buzzing around and tried to coax us boys to come out and tell the truth and promised they wouldnt ever tell but only wanted to know for their own satisfaction because the whole thing was so curious they even wanted to buy the secret and pay money for it and if we could have invented something that would answerbut we couldnt we hadnt the ingenuity so we had to let the chance go by and it was a pity  we carried that secret around without any trouble but the other one the big one the splendid one burned the very vitals of us it was so hot to get out and we so hot to let it out and astonish people with it but we had to keep it in in fact it kept itself in satan said it would and it did we went off every day and got to ourselves in the woods so that we could talk about satan and really that was the only subject we thought of or cared anything about and day and night we watched for him and hoped he would come and we got more and more impatient all the time we hadnt any interest in the other boys any more and wouldnt take part in their games and enterprises they seemed so tame after satan and their doings so trifling and commonplace after his adventures in antiquity and the constellations and his miracles and meltings and explosions and all that  during the first day we were in a state of anxiety on account of one thing and we kept going to father peters house on one pretext or another to keep track of it that was the gold coin we were afraid it would crumble and turn to dust like fairy money if it didbut it didnt at the end of the day no complaint had been made about it so after that we were satisfied that it was real gold and dropped the anxiety out of our minds  there was a question which we wanted to ask father peter and finally we went there the second evening a little diffidently after drawing straws and i asked it as casually as i could though it did not sound as casual as i wanted because i didnt know how  what is the moral sense sir  he looked down surprised over his great spectacles and said why it is the faculty which enables us to distinguish good from evil  it threw some light but not a glare and i was a little disappointed also to some degree embarrassed he was waiting for me to go on so in default of anything else to say i asked is it valuable  valuable heavens lad it is the one thing that lifts man above the beasts that perish and makes him heir to immortality  this did not remind me of anything further to say so i got out with the other boys and we went away with that indefinite sense you have often had of being filled but not fatted they wanted me to explain but i was tired  we passed out through the parlor and there was marget at the spinnet teaching marie lueger so one of the deserting pupils was back and an influential one too the others would follow marget jumped up and ran and thanked us again with tears in her eyesthis was the third timefor saving her and her uncle from being turned into the street and we told her again we hadnt done it but that was her way she never could be grateful enough for anything a person did for her so we let her have her say and as we passed through the garden there was wilhelm meidling sitting there waiting for it was getting toward the edge of the evening and he would be asking marget to take a walk along the river with him when she was done with the lesson he was a young lawyer and succeeding fairly well and working his way along little by little he was very fond of marget and she of him he had not deserted along with the others but had stood his ground all through his faithfulness was not lost on marget and her uncle he hadnt so very much talent but he was handsome and good and these are a kind of talents themselves and help along he asked us how the lesson was getting along and we told him it was about done and maybe it was so we didnt know anything about it but we judged it would please him and it did and didnt cost us anything   chapter 5  on the fourth day comes the astrologer from his crumbling old tower up the valley where he had heard the news i reckon he had a private talk with us and we told him what we could for we were mightily in dread of him he sat there studying and studying awhile to himself then he asked  how many ducats did you say  eleven hundred and seven sir  then he said as if he were talking to himself it is very singular yes very strange a curious coincidence then he began to ask questions and went over the whole ground from the beginning we answering by and by he said eleven hundred and six ducats it is a large sum  seven said seppi correcting him  oh seven was it of course a ducat more or less isnt of consequence but you said eleven hundred and six before  it would not have been safe for us to say he was mistaken but we knew he was nikolaus said we ask pardon for the mistake but we meant to say seven  oh it is no matter lad it was merely that i noticed the discrepancy it is several days and you cannot be expected to remember precisely one is apt to be inexact when there is no particular circumstance to impress the count upon the memory  but there was one sir said seppi eagerly  what was it my son asked the astrologer indifferently  first we all counted the piles of coin each in turn and all made it the sameeleven hundred and six but i had slipped one out for fun when the count began and now i slipped it back and said i think there is a mistakethere are eleven hundred and seven let us count again we did and of course i was right they were astonished then i told how it came about  the astrologer asked us if this was so and we said it was  that settles it he said i know the thief now lads the money was stolen  then he went away leaving us very much troubled and wondering what he could mean in about an hour we found out for by that time it was all over the village that father peter had been arrested for stealing a great sum of money from the astrologer everybodys tongue was loose and going many said it was not in father peters character and must be a mistake but the others shook their heads and said misery and want could drive a suffering man to almost anything about one detail there were no differences all agreed that father peters account of how the money came into his hands was just about unbelievableit had such an impossible look they said it might have come into the astrologers hands in some such way but into father peters never our characters began to suffer now we were father peters only witnesses how much did he probably pay us to back up his fantastic tale people talked that kind of talk to us pretty freely and frankly and were full of scoffings when we begged them to believe really we had told only the truth our parents were harder on us than any one else our fathers said we were disgracing our families and they commanded us to purge ourselves of our lie and there was no limit to their anger when we continued to say we had spoken true our mothers cried over us and begged us to give back our bribe and get back our honest names and save our families from shame and come out and honorably confess and at last we were so worried and harassed that we tried to tell the whole thing satan and allbut no it wouldnt come out we were hoping and longing all the time that satan would come and help us out of our trouble but there was no sign of him  within an hour after the astrologers talk with us father peter was in prison and the money sealed up and in the hands of the officers of the law the money was in a bag and solomon isaacs said he had not touched it since he had counted it his oath was taken that it was the same money and that the amount was eleven hundred and seven ducats father peter claimed trial by the ecclesiastical court but our other priest father adolf said an ecclesiastical court hadnt jurisdiction over a suspended priest the bishop upheld him that settled it the case would go to trial in the civil court the court would not sit for some time to come wilhelm meidling would be father peters lawyer and do the best he could of course but he told us privately that a weak case on his side and all the power and prejudice on the other made the outlook bad  so margets new happiness died a quick death no friends came to condole with her and none were expected an unsigned note withdrew her invitation to the party there would be no scholars to take lessons how could she support herself she could remain in the house for the mortgage was paid off though the government and not poor solomon isaacs had the mortgagemoney in its grip for the present old ursula who was cook chambermaid housekeeper laundress and everything else for father peter and had been margets nurse in earlier years said god would provide but she said that from habit for she was a good christian she meant to help in the providing to make sure if she could find a way  we boys wanted to go and see marget and show friendliness for her but our parents were afraid of offending the community and wouldnt let us the astrologer was going around inflaming everybody against father peter and saying he was an abandoned thief and had stolen eleven hundred and seven gold ducats from him he said he knew he was a thief from that fact for it was exactly the sum he had lost and which father peter pretended he had found  in the afternoon of the fourth day after the catastrophe old ursula appeared at our house and asked for some washing to do and begged my mother to keep this secret to save margets pride who would stop this project if she found it out yet marget had not enough to eat and was growing weak ursula was growing weak herself and showed it and she ate of the food that was offered her like a starving person but could not be persuaded to carry any home for marget would not eat charity food she took some clothes down to the stream to wash them but we saw from the window that handling the bat was too much for her strength so she was called back and a trifle of money offered her which she was afraid to take lest marget should suspect then she took it saying she would explain that she found it in the road to keep it from being a lie and damning her soul she got me to drop it while she watched then she went along by there and found it and exclaimed with surprise and joy and picked it up and went her way like the rest of the village she could tell everyday lies fast enough and without taking any precautions against fire and brimstone on their account but this was a new kind of lie and it had a dangerous look because she hadnt had any practice in it after a weeks practice it wouldnt have given her any trouble it is the way we are made  i was in trouble for how would marget live ursula could not find a coin in the road every dayperhaps not even a second one and i was ashamed too for not having been near marget and she so in need of friends but that was my parents fault not mine and i couldnt help it  i was walking along the path feeling very downhearted when a most cheery and tingling fresheningup sensation went rippling through me and i was too glad for any words for i knew by that sign that satan was by i had noticed it before next moment he was alongside of me and i was telling him all my trouble and what had been happening to marget and her uncle while we were talking we turned a curve and saw old ursula resting in the shade of a tree and she had a lean stray kitten in her lap and was petting it i asked her where she got it and she said it came out of the woods and followed her and she said it probably hadnt any mother or any friends and she was going to take it home and take care of it satan said  i understand you are very poor why do you want to add another mouth to feed why dont you give it to some rich person  ursula bridled at this and said perhaps you would like to have it you must be rich with your fine clothes and quality airs then she sniffed and said give it to the richthe idea the rich dont care for anybody but themselves its only the poor that have feeling for the poor and help them the poor and god god will provide for this kitten  what makes you think so  ursulas eyes snapped with anger because i know it she said not a sparrow falls to the ground without his seeing it  but it falls just the same what good is seeing it fall  old ursulas jaws worked but she could not get any word out for the moment she was so horrified when she got her tongue she stormed out go about your business you puppy or i will take a stick to you  i could not speak i was so scared i knew that with his notions about the human race satan would consider it a matter of no consequence to strike her dead there being plenty more but my tongue stood still i could give her no warning but nothing happened satan remained tranquiltranquil and indifferent i suppose he could not be insulted by ursula any more than the king could be insulted by a tumblebug the old woman jumped to her feet when she made her remark and did it as briskly as a young girl it had been many years since she had done the like of that that was satans influence he was a fresh breeze to the weak and the sick wherever he came his presence affected even the lean kitten and it skipped to the ground and began to chase a leaf this surprised ursula and she stood looking at the creature and nodding her head wonderingly her anger quite forgotten  whats come over it she said awhile ago it could hardly walk  you have not seen a kitten of that breed before said satan  ursula was not proposing to be friendly with the mocking stranger and she gave him an ungentle look and retorted who asked you to come here and pester me id like to know and what do you know about what ive seen and what i havent seen  you havent seen a kitten with the hairspines on its tongue pointing to the front have you  nonor you either  well examine this one and see  ursula was become pretty spry but the kitten was spryer and she could not catch it and had to give it up then satan said  give it a name and maybe it will come  ursula tried several names but the kitten was not interested  call it agnes try that  the creature answered to the name and came ursula examined its tongue upon my word its true she said i have not seen this kind of a cat before is it yours  no  then how did you know its name so pat  because all cats of that breed are named agnes they will not answer to any other  ursula was impressed it is the most wonderful thing then a shadow of trouble came into her face for her superstitions were aroused and she reluctantly put the creature down saying i suppose i must let it go i am not afraidno not exactly that though the priestwell ive heard peopleindeed many people and besides it is quite well now and can take care of itself she sighed and turned to go murmuring it is such a pretty one too and would be such companyand the house is so sad and lonesome these troubled days miss marget so mournful and just a shadow and the old master shut up in jail  it seems a pity not to keep it said satan  ursula turned quicklyjust as if she were hoping some one would encourage her  why she asked wistfully  because this breed brings luck  does it is it true young man do you know it to be true how does it bring luck  well it brings money anyway  ursula looked disappointed money a cat bring money the idea you could never sell it here people do not buy cats here one cant even give them away she turned to go  i dont mean sell it i mean have an income from it this kind is called the lucky cat its owner finds four silver groschen in his pocket every morning  i saw the indignation rising in the old womans face she was insulted this boy was making fun of her that was her thought she thrust her hands into her pockets and straightened up to give him a piece of her mind her temper was all up and hot her mouth came open and let out three words of a bitter sentence then it fell silent and the anger in her face turned to surprise or wonder or fear or something and she slowly brought out her hands from her pockets and opened them and held them so in one was my piece of money in the other lay four silver groschen she gazed a little while perhaps to see if the groschen would vanish away then she said fervently  its trueits trueand im ashamed and beg forgiveness o dear master and benefactor and she ran to satan and kissed his hand over and over again according to the austrian custom  in her heart she probably believed it was a witchcat and an agent of the devil but no matter it was all the more certain to be able to keep its contract and furnish a daily good living for the family for in matters of finance even the piousest of our peasants would have more confidence in an arrangement with the devil than with an archangel ursula started homeward with agnes in her arms and i said i wished i had her privilege of seeing marget  then i caught my breath for we were there there in the parlor and marget standing looking at us astonished she was feeble and pale but i knew that those conditions would not last in satans atmosphere and it turned out so i introduced satanthat is philip traumand we sat down and talked there was no constraint we were simple folk in our village and when a stranger was a pleasant person we were soon friends marget wondered how we got in without her hearing us traum said the door was open and we walked in and waited until she should turn around and greet us this was not true no door was open we entered through the walls or the roof or down the chimney or somehow but no matter what satan wished a person to believe the person was sure to believe and so marget was quite satisfied with that explanation and then the main part of her mind was on traum anyway she couldnt keep her eyes off him he was so beautiful that gratified me and made me proud i hoped he would show off some but he didnt he seemed only interested in being friendly and telling lies he said he was an orphan that made marget pity him the water came into her eyes he said he had never known his mamma she passed away while he was a young thing and said his papa was in shattered health and had no property to speak ofin fact none of any earthly valuebut he had an uncle in business down in the tropics and he was very well off and had a monopoly and it was from this uncle that he drew his support the very mention of a kind uncle was enough to remind marget of her own and her eyes filled again she said she hoped their two uncles would meet some day it made me shudder philip said he hoped so too and that made me shudder again  maybe they will said marget does your uncle travel much  oh yes he goes all about he has business everywhere  and so they went on chatting and poor marget forgot her sorrow for one little while anyway it was probably the only really bright and cheery hour she had known lately i saw she liked philip and i knew she would and when he told her he was studying for the ministry i could see that she liked him better than ever and then when he promised to get her admitted to the jail so that she could see her uncle that was the capstone he said he would give the guards a little present and she must always go in the evening after dark and say nothing but just show this paper and pass in and show it again when you come outand he scribbled some queer marks on the paper and gave it to her and she was ever so thankful and right away was in a fever for the sun to go down for in that old cruel time prisoners were not allowed to see their friends and sometimes they spent years in the jails without ever seeing a friendly face i judged that the marks on the paper were an enchantment and that the guards would not know what they were doing nor have any memory of it afterward and that was indeed the way of it ursula put her head in at the door now and said  suppers ready miss then she saw us and looked frightened and motioned me to come to her which i did and she asked if we had told about the cat i said no and she was relieved and said please dont for if miss marget knew she would think it was an unholy cat and would send for a priest and have its gifts all purified out of it and then there wouldnt be any more dividends so i said we wouldnt tell and she was satisfied then i was beginning to say goodby to marget but satan interrupted and said ever so politelywell i dont remember just the words but anyway he as good as invited himself to supper and me too of course marget was miserably embarrassed for she had no reason to suppose there would be half enough for a sick bird ursula heard him and she came straight into the room not a bit pleased at first she was astonished to see marget looking so fresh and rosy and said so then she spoke up in her native tongue which was bohemian and saidas i learned afterwardsend him away miss marget theres not victuals enough  before marget could speak satan had the word and was talking back to ursula in her own languagewhich was a surprise to her and for her mistress too he said didnt i see you down the road awhile ago  yes sir  ah that pleases me i see you remember me he stepped to her and whispered i told you it is a lucky cat dont be troubled it will provide  that sponged the slate of ursulas feelings clean of its anxieties and a deep financial joy shone in her eyes the cats value was augmenting it was getting full time for marget to take some sort of notice of satans invitation and she did it in the best way the honest way that was natural to her she said she had little to offer but that we were welcome if we would share it with her  we had supper in the kitchen and ursula waited at table a small fish was in the fryingpan crisp and brown and tempting and one could see that marget was not expecting such respectable food as this ursula brought it and marget divided it between satan and me declining to take any of it herself and was beginning to say she did not care for fish today but she did not finish the remark it was because she noticed that another fish had appeared in the pan she looked surprised but did not say anything she probably meant to inquire of ursula about this later there were other surprises flesh and game and wines and fruitsthings which had been strangers in that house lately but marget made no exclamations and now even looked unsurprised which was satans influence of course satan talked right along and was entertaining and made the time pass pleasantly and cheerfully and although he told a good many lies it was no harm in him for he was only an angel and did not know any better they do not know right from wrong i knew this because i remembered what he had said about it he got on the good side of ursula he praised her to marget confidentially but speaking just loud enough for ursula to hear he said she was a fine woman and he hoped some day to bring her and his uncle together very soon ursula was mincing and simpering around in a ridiculous girly way and smoothing out her gown and prinking at herself like a foolish old hen and all the time pretending she was not hearing what satan was saying i was ashamed for it showed us to be what satan considered us a silly race and trivial satan said his uncle entertained a great deal and to have a clever woman presiding over the festivities would double the attractions of the place  but your uncle is a gentleman isnt he asked marget  yes said satan indifferently some even call him a prince out of compliment but he is not bigoted to him personal merit is everything rank nothing  my hand was hanging down by my chair agnes came along and licked it by this act a secret was revealed i started to say it is all a mistake this is just a common ordinary cat the hairneedles on her tongue point inward not outward but the words did not come because they couldnt satan smiled upon me and i understood  when it was dark marget took food and wine and fruit in a basket and hurried away to the jail and satan and i walked toward my home i was thinking to myself that i should like to see what the inside of the jail was like satan overheard the thought and the next moment we were in the jail we were in the torturechamber satan said the rack was there and the other instruments and there was a smoky lantern or two hanging on the walls and helping to make the place look dim and dreadful there were people thereand executionersbut as they took no notice of us it meant that we were invisible a young man lay bound and satan said he was suspected of being a heretic and the executioners were about to inquire into it they asked the man to confess to the charge and he said he could not for it was not true then they drove splinter after splinter under his nails and he shrieked with the pain satan was not disturbed but i could not endure it and had to be whisked out of there i was faint and sick but the fresh air revived me and we walked toward my home i said it was a brutal thing  no it was a human thing you should not insult the brutes by such a misuse of that word they have not deserved it and he went on talking like that it is like your paltry racealways lying always claiming virtues which it hasnt got always denying them to the higher animals which alone possess them no brute ever does a cruel thingthat is the monopoly of those with the moral sense when a brute inflicts pain he does it innocently it is not wrong for him there is no such thing as wrong and he does not inflict pain for the pleasure of inflicting itonly man does that inspired by that mongrel moral sense of his a sense whose function is to distinguish between right and wrong with liberty to choose which of them he will do now what advantage can he get out of that he is always choosing and in nine cases out of ten he prefers the wrong there shouldnt be any wrong and without the moral sense there couldnt be any and yet he is such an unreasoning creature that he is not able to perceive that the moral sense degrades him to the bottom layer of animated beings and is a shameful possession are you feeling better let me show you something   chapter 6  in a moment we were in a french village we walked through a great factory of some sort where men and women and little children were toiling in heat and dirt and a fog of dust and they were clothed in rags and drooped at their work for they were worn and half starved and weak and drowsy satan said  it is some more moral sense the proprietors are rich and very holy but the wage they pay to these poor brothers and sisters of theirs is only enough to keep them from dropping dead with hunger the workhours are fourteen per day winter and summerfrom six in the morning till eight at nightlittle children and all and they walk to and from the pigsties which they inhabitfour miles each way through mud and slush rain snow sleet and storm daily year in and year out they get four hours of sleep they kennel together three families in a room in unimaginable filth and stench and disease comes and they die off like flies have they committed a crime these mangy things no what have they done that they are punished so nothing at all except getting themselves born into your foolish race you have seen how they treat a misdoer there in the jail now you see how they treat the innocent and the worthy is your race logical are these illsmelling innocents better off than that heretic indeed no his punishment is trivial compared with theirs they broke him on the wheel and smashed him to rags and pulp after we left and he is dead now and free of your precious race but these poor slaves herewhy they have been dying for years and some of them will not escape from life for years to come it is the moral sense which teaches the factory proprietors the difference between right and wrongyou perceive the result they think themselves better than dogs ah you are such an illogical unreasoning race and paltryoh unspeakably  then he dropped all seriousness and just overstrained himself making fun of us and deriding our pride in our warlike deeds our great heroes our imperishable fames our mighty kings our ancient aristocracies our venerable historyand laughed and laughed till it was enough to make a person sick to hear him and finally he sobered a little and said but after all it is not all ridiculous there is a sort of pathos about it when one remembers how few are your days how childish your pomps and what shadows you are  presently all things vanished suddenly from my sight and i knew what it meant the next moment we were walking along in our village and down toward the river i saw the twinkling lights of the golden stag then in the dark i heard a joyful cry  hes come again  it was seppi wohlmeyer he had felt his blood leap and his spirits rise in a way that could mean only one thing and he knew satan was near although it was too dark to see him he came to us and we walked along together and seppi poured out his gladness like water it was as if he were a lover and had found his sweetheart who had been lost seppi was a smart and animated boy and had enthusiasm and expression and was a contrast to nikolaus and me he was full of the last new mystery nowthe disappearance of hans oppert the village loafer people were beginning to be curious about it he said he did not say anxiouscurious was the right word and strong enough no one had seen hans for a couple of days  not since he did that brutal thing you know he said  what brutal thing it was satan that asked  well he is always clubbing his dog which is a good dog and his only friend and is faithful and loves him and does no one any harm and two days ago he was at it again just for nothingjust for pleasureand the dog was howling and begging and theodor and i begged too but he threatened us and struck the dog again with all his might and knocked one of his eyes out and he said to us there i hope you are satisfied now thats what you have got for him by your damned meddlingand he laughed the heartless brute seppis voice trembled with pity and anger i guessed what satan would say and he said it  there is that misused word againthat shabby slander brutes do not act like that but only men  well it was inhuman anyway  no it wasnt seppi it was humanquite distinctly human it is not pleasant to hear you libel the higher animals by attributing to them dispositions which they are free from and which are found nowhere but in the human heart none of the higher animals is tainted with the disease called the moral sense purify your language seppi drop those lying phrases out of it  he spoke pretty sternlyfor himand i was sorry i hadnt warned seppi to be more particular about the word he used i knew how he was feeling he would not want to offend satan he would rather offend all his kin there was an uncomfortable silence but relief soon came for that poor dog came along now with his eye hanging down and went straight to satan and began to moan and mutter brokenly and satan began to answer in the same way and it was plain that they were talking together in the dog language we all sat down in the grass in the moonlight for the clouds were breaking away now and satan took the dogs head in his lap and put the eye back in its place and the dog was comfortable and he wagged his tail and licked satans hand and looked thankful and said the same i knew he was saying it though i did not understand the words then the two talked together a bit and satan said  he says his master was drunk  yes he was said we  and an hour later he fell over the precipice there beyond the cliff pasture  we know the place it is three miles from here  and the dog has been often to the village begging people to go there but he was only driven away and not listened to  we remembered it but hadnt understood what he wanted  he only wanted help for the man who had misused him and he thought only of that and has had no food nor sought any he has watched by his master two nights what do you think of your race is heaven reserved for it and this dog ruled out as your teachers tell you can your race add anything to this dogs stock of morals and magnanimities he spoke to the creature who jumped up eager and happy and apparently ready for orders and impatient to execute them get some men go with the doghe will show you that carrion and take a priest along to arrange about insurance for death is near  with the last word he vanished to our sorrow and disappointment we got the men and father adolf and we saw the man die nobody cared but the dog he mourned and grieved and licked the dead face and could not be comforted we buried him where he was and without a coffin for he had no money and no friend but the dog if we had been an hour earlier the priest would have been in time to send that poor creature to heaven but now he was gone down into the awful fires to burn forever it seemed such a pity that in a world where so many people have difficulty to put in their time one little hour could not have been spared for this poor creature who needed it so much and to whom it would have made the difference between eternal joy and eternal pain it gave an appalling idea of the value of an hour and i thought i could never waste one again without remorse and terror seppi was depressed and grieved and said it must be so much better to be a dog and not run such awful risks we took this one home with us and kept him for our own seppi had a very good thought as we were walking along and it cheered us up and made us feel much better he said the dog had forgiven the man that had wronged him so and maybe god would accept that absolution  there was a very dull week now for satan did not come nothing much was going on and we boys could not venture to go and see marget because the nights were moonlit and our parents might find us out if we tried but we came across ursula a couple of times taking a walk in the meadows beyond the river to air the cat and we learned from her that things were going well she had natty new clothes on and bore a prosperous look the four groschen a day were arriving without a break but were not being spent for food and wine and such thingsthe cat attended to all that  marget was enduring her forsakenness and isolation fairly well all things considered and was cheerful by help of wilhelm meidling she spent an hour or two every night in the jail with her uncle and had fattened him up with the cats contributions but she was curious to know more about philip traum and hoped i would bring him again ursula was curious about him herself and asked a good many questions about his uncle it made the boys laugh for i had told them the nonsense satan had been stuffing her with she got no satisfaction out of us our tongues being tied  ursula gave us a small item of information money being plenty now she had taken on a servant to help about the house and run errands she tried to tell it in a commonplace matterofcourse way but she was so set up by it and so vain of it that her pride in it leaked out pretty plainly it was beautiful to see her veiled delight in this grandeur poor old thing but when we heard the name of the servant we wondered if she had been altogether wise for although we were young and often thoughtless we had fairly good perception on some matters this boy was gottfried narr a dull good creature with no harm in him and nothing against him personally still he was under a cloud and properly so for it had not been six months since a social blight had mildewed the familyhis grandmother had been burned as a witch when that kind of a malady is in the blood it does not always come out with just one burning just now was not a good time for ursula and marget to be having dealings with a member of such a family for the witchterror had risen higher during the past year than it had ever reached in the memory of the oldest villagers the mere mention of a witch was almost enough to frighten us out of our wits this was natural enough because of late years there were more kinds of witches than there used to be in old times it had been only old women but of late years they were of all ageseven children of eight and nine it was getting so that anybody might turn out to be a familiar of the devilage and sex hadnt anything to do with it in our little region we had tried to extirpate the witches but the more of them we burned the more of the breed rose up in their places  once in a school for girls only ten miles away the teachers found that the back of one of the girls was all red and inflamed and they were greatly frightened believing it to be the devils marks the girl was scared and begged them not to denounce her and said it was only fleas but of course it would not do to let the matter rest there all the girls were examined and eleven out of the fifty were badly marked the rest less so a commission was appointed but the eleven only cried for their mothers and would not confess then they were shut up each by herself in the dark and put on black bread and water for ten days and nights and by that time they were haggard and wild and their eyes were dry and they did not cry any more but only sat and mumbled and would not take the food then one of them confessed and said they had often ridden through the air on broomsticks to the witches sabbath and in a bleak place high up in the mountains had danced and drunk and caroused with several hundred other witches and the evil one and all had conducted themselves in a scandalous way and had reviled the priests and blasphemed god that is what she saidnot in narrative form for she was not able to remember any of the details without having them called to her mind one after the other but the commission did that for they knew just what questions to ask they being all written down for the use of witchcommissioners two centuries before they asked did you do so and so and she always said yes and looked weary and tired and took no interest in it and so when the other ten heard that this one confessed they confessed too and answered yes to the questions then they were burned at the stake all together which was just and right and everybody went from all the countryside to see it i went too but when i saw that one of them was a bonny sweet girl i used to play with and looked so pitiful there chained to the stake and her mother crying over her and devouring her with kisses and clinging around her neck and saying oh my god oh my god it was too dreadful and i went away  it was bitter cold weather when gottfrieds grandmother was burned it was charged that she had cured bad headaches by kneading the persons head and neck with her fingersas she saidbut really by the devils help as everybody knew they were going to examine her but she stopped them and confessed straight off that her power was from the devil so they appointed to burn her next morning early in our marketsquare the officer who was to prepare the fire was there first and prepared it she was there nextbrought by the constables who left her and went to fetch another witch her family did not come with her they might be reviled maybe stoned if the people were excited i came and gave her an apple she was squatting at the fire warming herself and waiting and her old lips and hands were blue with the cold a stranger came next he was a traveler passing through and he spoke to her gently and seeing nobody but me there to hear said he was sorry for her and he asked if what she confessed was true and she said no he looked surprised and still more sorry then and asked her  then why did you confess  i am old and very poor she said and i work for my living there was no way but to confess if i hadnt they might have set me free that would ruin me for no one would forget that i had been suspected of being a witch and so i would get no more work and wherever i went they would set the dogs on me in a little while i would starve the fire is best it is soon over you have been good to me you two and i thank you  she snuggled closer to the fire and put out her hands to warm them the snowflakes descending soft and still on her old gray head and making it white and whiter the crowd was gathering now and an egg came flying and struck her in the eye and broke and ran down her face there was a laugh at that  i told satan all about the eleven girls and the old woman once but it did not affect him he only said it was the human race and what the human race did was of no consequence and he said he had seen it made and it was not made of clay it was made of mudpart of it was anyway i knew what he meant by thatthe moral sense he saw the thought in my head and it tickled him and made him laugh then he called a bullock out of a pasture and petted it and talked with it and said  therehe wouldnt drive children mad with hunger and fright and loneliness and then burn them for confessing to things invented for them which had never happened and neither would he break the hearts of innocent poor old women and make them afraid to trust themselves among their own race and he would not insult them in their deathagony for he is not besmirched with the moral sense but is as the angels are and knows no wrong and never does it  lovely as he was satan could be cruelly offensive when he chose and he always chose when the human race was brought to his attention he always turned up his nose at it and never had a kind word for it  well as i was saying we boys doubted if it was a good time for ursula to be hiring a member of the narr family we were right when the people found it out they were naturally indignant and moreover since marget and ursula hadnt enough to eat themselves where was the money coming from to feed another mouth that is what they wanted to know and in order to find out they stopped avoiding gottfried and began to seek his society and have sociable conversations with him he was pleasednot thinking any harm and not seeing the trapand so he talked innocently along and was no discreeter than a cow  money he said theyve got plenty of it they pay me two groschen a week besides my keep and they live on the fat of the land i can tell you the prince himself cant beat their table  this astonishing statement was conveyed by the astrologer to father adolf on a sunday morning when he was returning from mass he was deeply moved and said  this must be looked into  he said there must be witchcraft at the bottom of it and told the villagers to resume relations with marget and ursula in a private and unostentatious way and keep both eyes open they were told to keep their own counsel and not rouse the suspicions of the household the villagers were at first a bit reluctant to enter such a dreadful place but the priest said they would be under his protection while there and no harm could come to them particularly if they carried a trifle of holy water along and kept their beads and crosses handy this satisfied them and made them willing to go envy and malice made the baser sort even eager to go  and so poor marget began to have company again and was as pleased as a cat she was like most anybody elsejust human and happy in her prosperities and not averse from showing them off a little and she was humanly grateful to have the warm shoulder turned to her and be smiled upon by her friends and the village again for of all the hard things to bear to be cut by your neighbors and left in contemptuous solitude is maybe the hardest  the bars were down and we could all go there now and we didour parents and allday after day the cat began to strain herself she provided the top of everything for those companies and in abundanceamong them many a dish and many a wine which they had not tasted before and which they had not even heard of except at secondhand from the princes servants and the tableware was much above ordinary too  marget was troubled at times and pursued ursula with questions to an uncomfortable degree but ursula stood her ground and stuck to it that it was providence and said no word about the cat marget knew that nothing was impossible to providence but she could not help having doubts that this effort was from there though she was afraid to say so lest disaster come of it witchcraft occurred to her but she put the thought aside for this was before gottfried joined the household and she knew ursula was pious and a bitter hater of witches by the time gottfried arrived providence was established unshakably intrenched and getting all the gratitude the cat made no murmur but went on composedly improving in style and prodigality by experience  in any community big or little there is always a fair proportion of people who are not malicious or unkind by nature and who never do unkind things except when they are overmastered by fear or when their selfinterest is greatly in danger or some such matter as that eseldorf had its proportion of such people and ordinarily their good and gentle influence was felt but these were not ordinary timeson account of the witchdreadand so we did not seem to have any gentle and compassionate hearts left to speak of every person was frightened at the unaccountable state of things at margets house not doubting that witchcraft was at the bottom of it and fright frenzied their reason naturally there were some who pitied marget and ursula for the danger that was gathering about them but naturally they did not say so it would not have been safe so the others had it all their own way and there was none to advise the ignorant girl and the foolish woman and warn them to modify their doings we boys wanted to warn them but we backed down when it came to the pinch being afraid we found that we were not manly enough nor brave enough to do a generous action when there was a chance that it could get us into trouble neither of us confessed this poor spirit to the others but did as other people would have donedropped the subject and talked about something else and i knew we all felt mean eating and drinking margets fine things along with those companies of spies and petting her and complimenting her with the rest and seeing with selfreproach how foolishly happy she was and never saying a word to put her on her guard and indeed she was happy and as proud as a princess and so grateful to have friends again and all the time these people were watching with all their eyes and reporting all they saw to father adolf  but he couldnt make head or tail of the situation there must be an enchanter somewhere on the premises but who was it marget was not seen to do any jugglery nor was ursula nor yet gottfried and still the wines and dainties never ran short and a guest could not call for a thing and not get it to produce these effects was usual enough with witches and enchantersthat part of it was not new but to do it without any incantations or even any rumblings or earthquakes or lightnings or apparitionsthat was new novel wholly irregular there was nothing in the books like this enchanted things were always unreal gold turned to dirt in an unenchanted atmosphere food withered away and vanished but this test failed in the present case the spies brought samples father adolf prayed over them exorcised them but it did no good they remained sound and real they yielded to natural decay only and took the usual time to do it  father adolf was not merely puzzled he was also exasperated for these evidences very nearly convinced himprivatelythat there was no witchcraft in the matter it did not wholly convince him for this could be a new kind of witchcraft there was a way to find out as to this if this prodigal abundance of provender was not brought in from the outside but produced on the premises there was witchcraft sure   chapter 7  marget announced a party and invited forty people the date for it was seven days away this was a fine opportunity margets house stood by itself and it could be easily watched all the week it was watched night and day margets household went out and in as usual but they carried nothing in their hands and neither they nor others brought anything to the house this was ascertained evidently rations for forty people were not being fetched if they were furnished any sustenance it would have to be made on the premises it was true that marget went out with a basket every evening but the spies ascertained that she always brought it back empty  the guests arrived at noon and filled the place father adolf followed also after a little the astrologer without invitation the spies had informed him that neither at the back nor the front had any parcels been brought in he entered and found the eating and drinking going on finely and everything progressing in a lively and festive way he glanced around and perceived that many of the cooked delicacies and all of the native and foreign fruits were of a perishable character and he also recognized that these were fresh and perfect no apparitions no incantations no thunder that settled it this was witchcraft and not only that but of a new kinda kind never dreamed of before it was a prodigious power an illustrious power he resolved to discover its secret the announcement of it would resound throughout the world penetrate to the remotest lands paralyze all the nations with amazementand carry his name with it and make him renowned forever it was a wonderful piece of luck a splendid piece of luck the glory of it made him dizzy  all the house made room for him marget politely seated him ursula ordered gottfried to bring a special table for him then she decked it and furnished it and asked for his orders  bring me what you will he said  the two servants brought supplies from the pantry together with white wine and reda bottle of each the astrologer who very likely had never seen such delicacies before poured out a beaker of red wine drank it off poured another then began to eat with a grand appetite  i was not expecting satan for it was more than a week since i had seen or heard of him but now he came ini knew it by the feel though people were in the way and i could not see him i heard him apologizing for intruding and he was going away but marget urged him to stay and he thanked her and stayed she brought him along introducing him to the girls and to meidling and to some of the elders and there was quite a rustle of whispers its the young stranger we hear so much about and cant get sight of he is away so much dear dear but he is beautifulwhat is his name philip traum ah it fits him you see traum is german for dream what does he do studying for the ministry they say his face is his fortunehell be a cardinal some day where is his home away down somewhere in the tropics they sayhas a rich uncle down there and so on he made his way at once everybody was anxious to know him and talk with him everybody noticed how cool and fresh it was all of a sudden and wondered at it for they could see that the sun was beating down the same as before outside and the sky was clear of clouds but no one guessed the reason of course  the astrologer had drunk his second beaker he poured out a third he set the bottle down and by accident overturned it he seized it before much was spilled and held it up to the light saying what a pityit is royal wine then his face lighted with joy or triumph or something and he said quick bring a bowl  it was broughta fourquart one he took up that twopint bottle and began to pour went on pouring the red liquor gurgling and gushing into the white bowl and rising higher and higher up its sides everybody staring and holding their breathand presently the bowl was full to the brim  look at the bottle he said holding it up it is full yet i glanced at satan and in that moment he vanished then father adolf rose up flushed and excited crossed himself and began to thunder in his great voice this house is bewitched and accursed people began to cry and shriek and crowd toward the door i summon this detected household to  his words were cut off short his face became red then purple but he could not utter another sound then i saw satan a transparent film melt into the astrologers body then the astrologer put up his hand and apparently in his own voice said waitremain where you are all stopped where they stood bring a funnel ursula brought it trembling and scared and he stuck it in the bottle and took up the great bowl and began to pour the wine back the people gazing and dazed with astonishment for they knew the bottle was already full before he began he emptied the whole of the bowl into the bottle then smiled out over the room chuckled and said indifferently it is nothinganybody can do it with my powers i can even do much more  a frightened cry burst out everywhere oh my god he is possessed and there was a tumultuous rush for the door which swiftly emptied the house of all who did not belong in it except us boys and meidling we boys knew the secret and would have told it if we could but we couldnt we were very thankful to satan for furnishing that good help at the needful time  marget was pale and crying meidling looked kind of petrified ursula the same but gottfried was the worsthe couldnt stand he was so weak and scared for he was of a witch family you know and it would be bad for him to be suspected agnes came loafing in looking pious and unaware and wanted to rub up against ursula and be petted but ursula was afraid of her and shrank away from her but pretending she was not meaning any incivility for she knew very well it wouldnt answer to have strained relations with that kind of a cat but we boys took agnes and petted her for satan would not have befriended her if he had not had a good opinion of her and that was indorsement enough for us he seemed to trust anything that hadnt the moral sense  outside the guests panicstricken scattered in every direction and fled in a pitiable state of terror and such a tumult as they made with their running and sobbing and shrieking and shouting that soon all the village came flocking from their houses to see what had happened and they thronged the street and shouldered and jostled one another in excitement and fright and then father adolf appeared and they fell apart in two walls like the cloven red sea and presently down this lane the astrologer came striding and mumbling and where he passed the lanes surged back in packed masses and fell silent with awe and their eyes stared and their breasts heaved and several women fainted and when he was gone by the crowd swarmed together and followed him at a distance talking excitedly and asking questions and finding out the facts finding out the facts and passing them on to others with improvementsimprovements which soon enlarged the bowl of wine to a barrel and made the one bottle hold it all and yet remain empty to the last  when the astrologer reached the marketsquare he went straight to a juggler fantastically dressed who was keeping three brass balls in the air and took them from him and faced around upon the approaching crowd and said this poor clown is ignorant of his art come forward and see an expert perform  so saying he tossed the balls up one after another and set them whirling in a slender bright oval in the air and added another then another and another and soonno one seeing whence he got themadding adding adding the oval lengthening all the time his hands moving so swiftly that they were just a web or a blur and not distinguishable as hands and such as counted said there were now a hundred balls in the air the spinning great oval reached up twenty feet in the air and was a shining and glinting and wonderful sight then he folded his arms and told the balls to go on spinning without his helpand they did it after a couple of minutes he said there that will do and the oval broke and came crashing down and the balls scattered abroad and rolled every whither and wherever one of them came the people fell back in dread and no one would touch it it made him laugh and he scoffed at the people and called them cowards and old women then he turned and saw the tightrope and said foolish people were daily wasting their money to see a clumsy and ignorant varlet degrade that beautiful art now they should see the work of a master with that he made a spring into the air and lit firm on his feet on the rope then he hopped the whole length of it back and forth on one foot with his hands clasped over his eyes and next he began to throw somersaults both backward and forward and threw twentyseven  the people murmured for the astrologer was old and always before had been halting of movement and at times even lame but he was nimble enough now and went on with his antics in the liveliest manner finally he sprang lightly down and walked away and passed up the road and around the corner and disappeared then that great pale silent solid crowd drew a deep breath and looked into one anothers faces as if they said was it real did you see it or was it only iand was i dreaming then they broke into a low murmur of talking and fell apart in couples and moved toward their homes still talking in that awed way with faces close together and laying a hand on an arm and making other such gestures as people make when they have been deeply impressed by something  we boys followed behind our fathers and listened catching all we could of what they said and when they sat down in our house and continued their talk they still had us for company they were in a sad mood for it was certain they said that disaster for the village must follow this awful visitation of witches and devils then my father remembered that father adolf had been struck dumb at the moment of his denunciation  they have not ventured to lay their hands upon an anointed servant of god before he said and how they could have dared it this time i cannot make out for he wore his crucifix isnt it so  yes said the others we saw it  it is serious friends it is very serious always before we had a protection it has failed  the others shook as with a sort of chill and muttered those words overit has failed god has forsaken us  it is true said seppi wohlmeyers father there is nowhere to look for help  the people will realize this said nikolauss father the judge and despair will take away their courage and their energies we have indeed fallen upon evil times  he sighed and wohlmeyer said in a troubled voice the report of it all will go about the country and our village will be shunned as being under the displeasure of god the golden stag will know hard times  true neighbor said my father all of us will sufferall in repute many in estate and good god  what is it  that can cometo finish us  name itum gottes willen  the interdict  it smote like a thunderclap and they were like to swoon with the terror of it then the dread of this calamity roused their energies and they stopped brooding and began to consider ways to avert it they discussed this that and the other way and talked till the afternoon was far spent then confessed that at present they could arrive at no decision so they parted sorrowfully with oppressed hearts which were filled with bodings  while they were saying their parting words i slipped out and set my course for margets house to see what was happening there i met many people but none of them greeted me it ought to have been surprising but it was not for they were so distraught with fear and dread that they were not in their right minds i think they were white and haggard and walked like persons in a dream their eyes open but seeing nothing their lips moving but uttering nothing and worriedly clasping and unclasping their hands without knowing it  at margets it was like a funeral she and wilhelm sat together on the sofa but said nothing and not even holding hands both were steeped in gloom and margets eyes were red from the crying she had been doing she said  i have been begging him to go and come no more and so save himself alive i cannot bear to be his murderer this house is bewitched and no inmate will escape the fire but he will not go and he will be lost with the rest  wilhelm said he would not go if there was danger for her his place was by her and there he would remain then she began to cry again and it was all so mournful that i wished i had stayed away there was a knock now and satan came in fresh and cheery and beautiful and brought that winy atmosphere of his and changed the whole thing he never said a word about what had been happening nor about the awful fears which were freezing the blood in the hearts of the community but began to talk and rattle on about all manner of gay and pleasant things and next about musican artful stroke which cleared away the remnant of margets depression and brought her spirits and her interests broad awake she had not heard any one talk so well and so knowingly on that subject before and she was so uplifted by it and so charmed that what she was feeling lit up her face and came out in her words and wilhelm noticed it and did not look as pleased as he ought to have done and next satan branched off into poetry and recited some and did it well and marget was charmed again and again wilhelm was not as pleased as he ought to have been and this time marget noticed it and was remorseful  i fell asleep to pleasant music that nightthe patter of rain upon the panes and the dull growling of distant thunder away in the night satan came and roused me and said come with me where shall we go  anywhereso it is with you  then there was a fierce glare of sunlight and he said this is china  that was a grand surprise and made me sort of drunk with vanity and gladness to think i had come so farso much much farther than anybody else in our village including bartel sperling who had such a great opinion of his travels we buzzed around over that empire for more than half an hour and saw the whole of it it was wonderful the spectacles we saw and some were beautiful others too horrible to think for instancehowever i may go into that by and by and also why satan chose china for this excursion instead of another place it would interrupt my tale to do it now finally we stopped flitting and lit  we sat upon a mountain commanding a vast landscape of mountainrange and gorge and valley and plain and river with cities and villages slumbering in the sunlight and a glimpse of blue sea on the farther verge it was a tranquil and dreamy picture beautiful to the eye and restful to the spirit if we could only make a change like that whenever we wanted to the world would be easier to live in than it is for change of scene shifts the minds burdens to the other shoulder and banishes old shopworn wearinesses from mind and body both  we talked together and i had the idea of trying to reform satan and persuade him to lead a better life i told him about all those things he had been doing and begged him to be more considerate and stop making people unhappy i said i knew he did not mean any harm but that he ought to stop and consider the possible consequences of a thing before launching it in that impulsive and random way of his then he would not make so much trouble he was not hurt by this plain speech he only looked amused and surprised and said  what i do random things indeed i never do i stop and consider possible consequences where is the need i know what the consequences are going to bealways  oh satan then how could you do these things  well i will tell you and you must understand if you can you belong to a singular race every man is a sufferingmachine and a happinessmachine combined the two functions work together harmoniously with a fine and delicate precision on the giveandtake principle for every happiness turned out in the one department the other stands ready to modify it with a sorrow or a painmaybe a dozen in most cases the mans life is about equally divided between happiness and unhappiness when this is not the case the unhappiness predominatesalways never the other sometimes a mans make and disposition are such that his miserymachine is able to do nearly all the business such a man goes through life almost ignorant of what happiness is everything he touches everything he does brings a misfortune upon him you have seen such people to that kind of a person life is not an advantage is it it is only a disaster sometimes for an hours happiness a mans machinery makes him pay years of misery dont you know that it happens every now and then i will give you a case or two presently now the people of your village are nothing to meyou know that dont you  i did not like to speak out too flatly so i said i had suspected it  well it is true that they are nothing to me it is not possible that they should be the difference between them and me is abysmal immeasurable they have no intellect  no intellect  nothing that resembles it at a future time i will examine what man calls his mind and give you the details of that chaos then you will see and understand men have nothing in common with methere is no point of contact they have foolish little feelings and foolish little vanities and impertinences and ambitions their foolish little life is but a laugh a sigh and extinction and they have no sense only the moral sense i will show you what i mean here is a red spider not so big as a pins head can you imagine an elephant being interested in himcaring whether he is happy or isnt or whether he is wealthy or poor or whether his sweetheart returns his love or not or whether his mother is sick or well or whether he is looked up to in society or not or whether his enemies will smite him or his friends desert him or whether his hopes will suffer blight or his political ambitions fail or whether he shall die in the bosom of his family or neglected and despised in a foreign land these things can never be important to the elephant they are nothing to him he cannot shrink his sympathies to the microscopic size of them man is to me as the red spider is to the elephant the elephant has nothing against the spiderhe cannot get down to that remote level i have nothing against man the elephant is indifferent i am indifferent the elephant would not take the trouble to do the spider an ill turn if he took the notion he might do him a good turn if it came in his way and cost nothing i have done men good service but no ill turns  the elephant lives a century the red spider a day in power intellect and dignity the one creature is separated from the other by a distance which is simply astronomical yet in these as in all qualities man is immeasurably further below me than is the wee spider below the elephant  mans mind clumsily and tediously and laboriously patches little trivialities together and gets a resultsuch as it is my mind creates do you get the force of that creates anything it desiresand in a moment creates without material creates fluids solids colorsanything everythingout of the airy nothing which is called thought a man imagines a silk thread imagines a machine to make it imagines a picture then by weeks of labor embroiders it on canvas with the thread i think the whole thing and in a moment it is before youcreated  i think a poem music the record of a game of chessanythingand it is there this is the immortal mindnothing is beyond its reach nothing can obstruct my vision the rocks are transparent to me and darkness is daylight i do not need to open a book i take the whole of its contents into my mind at a single glance through the cover and in a million years i could not forget a single word of it or its place in the volume nothing goes on in the skull of man bird fish insect or other creature which can be hidden from me i pierce the learned mans brain with a single glance and the treasures which cost him threescore years to accumulate are mine he can forget and he does forget but i retain  now then i perceive by your thoughts that you are understanding me fairly well let us proceed circumstances might so fall out that the elephant could like the spidersupposing he can see itbut he could not love it his love is for his own kindfor his equals an angels love is sublime adorable divine beyond the imagination of maninfinitely beyond it but it is limited to his own august order if it fell upon one of your race for only an instant it would consume its object to ashes no we cannot love men but we can be harmlessly indifferent to them we can also like them sometimes i like you and the boys i like father peter and for your sakes i am doing all these things for the villagers  he saw that i was thinking a sarcasm and he explained his position  i have wrought well for the villagers though it does not look like it on the surface your race never know good fortune from ill they are always mistaking the one for the other it is because they cannot see into the future what i am doing for the villagers will bear good fruit some day in some cases to themselves in others to unborn generations of men no one will ever know that i was the cause but it will be none the less true for all that among you boys you have a game you stand a row of bricks on end a few inches apart you push a brick it knocks its neighbor over the neighbor knocks over the next brickand so on till all the row is prostrate that is human life a childs first act knocks over the initial brick and the rest will follow inexorably if you could see into the future as i can you would see everything that was going to happen to that creature for nothing can change the order of its life after the first event has determined it that is nothing will change it because each act unfailingly begets an act that act begets another and so on to the end and the seer can look forward down the line and see just when each act is to have birth from cradle to grave  does god order the career  foreordain it no the mans circumstances and environment order it his first act determines the second and all that follow after but suppose for arguments sake that the man should skip one of these acts an apparently trifling one for instance suppose that it had been appointed that on a certain day at a certain hour and minute and second and fraction of a second he should go to the well and he didnt go that mans career would change utterly from that moment thence to the grave it would be wholly different from the career which his first act as a child had arranged for him indeed it might be that if he had gone to the well he would have ended his career on a throne and that omitting to do it would set him upon a career that would lead to beggary and a paupers grave for instance if at any timesay in boyhoodcolumbus had skipped the triflingest little link in the chain of acts projected and made inevitable by his first childish act it would have changed his whole subsequent life and he would have become a priest and died obscure in an italian village and america would not have been discovered for two centuries afterward i know this to skip any one of the billion acts in columbuss chain would have wholly changed his life i have examined his billion of possible careers and in only one of them occurs the discovery of america you people do not suspect that all of your acts are of one size and importance but it is true to snatch at an appointed fly is as big with fate for you as is any other appointed act  as the conquering of a continent for instance  yes now then no man ever does drop a linkthe thing has never happened even when he is trying to make up his mind as to whether he will do a thing or not that itself is a link an act and has its proper place in his chain and when he finally decides an act that also was the thing which he was absolutely certain to do you see now that a man will never drop a link in his chain he cannot if he made up his mind to try that project would itself be an unavoidable linka thought bound to occur to him at that precise moment and made certain by the first act of his babyhood  it seemed so dismal  he is a prisoner for life i said sorrowfully and cannot get free  no of himself he cannot get away from the consequences of his first childish act but i can free him  i looked up wistfully  i have changed the careers of a number of your villagers  i tried to thank him but found it difficult and let it drop  i shall make some other changes you know that little lisa brandt  oh yes everybody does my mother says she is so sweet and so lovely that she is not like any other child she says she will be the pride of the village when she grows up and its idol too just as she is now  i shall change her future  make it better i asked  yes and i will change the future of nikolaus  i was glad this time and said i dont need to ask about his case you will be sure to do generously by him  it is my intention  straight off i was building that great future of nickys in my imagination and had already made a renowned general of him and hofmeister at the court when i noticed that satan was waiting for me to get ready to listen again i was ashamed of having exposed my cheap imaginings to him and was expecting some sarcasms but it did not happen he proceeded with his subject  nickys appointed life is sixtytwo years  thats grand i said  lisas thirtysix but as i told you i shall change their lives and those ages two minutes and a quarter from now nikolaus will wake out of his sleep and find the rain blowing in it was appointed that he should turn over and go to sleep again but i have appointed that he shall get up and close the window first that trifle will change his career entirely he will rise in the morning two minutes later than the chain of his life had appointed him to rise by consequence thenceforth nothing will ever happen to him in accordance with the details of the old chain he took out his watch and sat looking at it a few moments then said nikolaus has risen to close the window his life is changed his new career has begun there will be consequences  it made me feel creepy it was uncanny  but for this change certain things would happen twelve days from now for instance nikolaus would save lisa from drowning he would arrive on the scene at exactly the right momentfour minutes past ten the longago appointed instant of timeand the water would be shoal the achievement easy and certain but he will arrive some seconds too late now lisa will have struggled into deeper water he will do his best but both will drown  oh satan oh dear satan i cried with the tears rising in my eyes save them dont let it happen i cant bear to lose nikolaus he is my loving playmate and friend and think of lisas poor mother  i clung to him and begged and pleaded but he was not moved he made me sit down again and told me i must hear him out  i have changed nikolauss life and this has changed lisas if i had not done this nikolaus would save lisa then he would catch cold from his drenching one of your races fantastic and desolating scarlet fevers would follow with pathetic aftereffects for fortysix years he would lie in his bed a paralytic log deaf dumb blind and praying night and day for the blessed relief of death shall i change his life back  oh no oh not for the world in charity and pity leave it as it is  it is best so i could not have changed any other link in his life and done him so good a service he had a billion possible careers but not one of them was worth living they were charged full with miseries and disasters but for my intervention he would do his brave deed twelve days from nowa deed begun and ended in six minutesand get for all reward those fortysix years of sorrow and suffering i told you of it is one of the cases i was thinking of awhile ago when i said that sometimes an act which brings the actor an hours happiness and selfsatisfaction is paid foror punishedby years of suffering  i wondered what poor little lisas early death would save her from he answered the thought  from ten years of pain and slow recovery from an accident and then from nineteen years pollution shame depravity crime ending with death at the hands of the executioner twelve days hence she will die her mother would save her life if she could am i not kinder than her mother  yesoh indeed yes and wiser  father peters case is coming on presently he will be acquitted through unassailable proofs of his innocence  why satan how can that be do you really think it  indeed i know it his good name will be restored and the rest of his life will be happy  i can believe it to restore his good name will have that effect  his happiness will not proceed from that cause i shall change his life that day for his good he will never know his good name has been restored  in my mindand modestlyi asked for particulars but satan paid no attention to my thought next my mind wandered to the astrologer and i wondered where he might be  in the moon said satan with a fleeting sound which i believed was a chuckle ive got him on the cold side of it too he doesnt know where he is and is not having a pleasant time still it is good enough for him a good place for his star studies i shall need him presently then i shall bring him back and possess him again he has a long and cruel and odious life before him but i will change that for i have no feeling against him and am quite willing to do him a kindness i think i shall get him burned  he had such strange notions of kindness but angels are made so and do not know any better their ways are not like our ways and besides human beings are nothing to them they think they are only freaks it seems to me odd that he should put the astrologer so far away he could have dumped him in germany just as well where he would be handy  far away said satan to me no place is far away distance does not exist for me the sun is less than a hundred million miles from here and the light that is falling upon us has taken eight minutes to come but i can make that flight or any other in a fraction of time so minute that it cannot be measured by a watch i have but to think the journey and it is accomplished  i held out my hand and said the light lies upon it think it into a glass of wine satan  he did it i drank the wine  break the glass he said  i broke it  thereyou see it is real the villagers thought the brass balls were magic stuff and as perishable as smoke they were afraid to touch them you are a curious lotyour race but come along i have business i will put you to bed said and done then he was gone but his voice came back to me through the rain and darkness saying yes tell seppi but no other  it was the answer to my thought   chapter 8  sleep would not come it was not because i was proud of my travels and excited about having been around the big world to china and feeling contemptuous of bartel sperling the traveler as he called himself and looked down upon us others because he had been to vienna once and was the only eseldorf boy who had made such a journey and seen the worlds wonders at another time that would have kept me awake but it did not affect me now no my mind was filled with nikolaus my thoughts ran upon him only and the good days we had seen together at romps and frolics in the woods and the fields and the river in the long summer days and skating and sliding in the winter when our parents thought we were in school and now he was going out of this young life and the summers and winters would come and go and we others would rove and play as before but his place would be vacant we should see him no more tomorrow he would not suspect but would be as he had always been and it would shock me to hear him laugh and see him do lightsome and frivolous things for to me he would be a corpse with waxen hands and dull eyes and i should see the shroud around his face and next day he would not suspect nor the next and all the time his handful of days would be wasting swiftly away and that awful thing coming nearer and nearer his fate closing steadily around him and no one knowing it but seppi and me twelve daysonly twelve days it was awful to think of i noticed that in my thoughts i was not calling him by his familiar names nick and nicky but was speaking of him by his full name and reverently as one speaks of the dead also as incident after incident of our comradeship came thronging into my mind out of the past i noticed that they were mainly cases where i had wronged him or hurt him and they rebuked me and reproached me and my heart was wrung with remorse just as it is when we remember our unkindnesses to friends who have passed beyond the veil and we wish we could have them back again if only for a moment so that we could go on our knees to them and say have pity and forgive  once when we were nine years old he went a long errand of nearly two miles for the fruiterer who gave him a splendid big apple for reward and he was flying home with it almost beside himself with astonishment and delight and i met him and he let me look at the apple not thinking of treachery and i ran off with it eating it as i ran he following me and begging and when he overtook me i offered him the core which was all that was left and i laughed then he turned away crying and said he had meant to give it to his little sister that smote me for she was slowly getting well of a sickness and it would have been a proud moment for him to see her joy and surprise and have her caresses but i was ashamed to say i was ashamed and only said something rude and mean to pretend i did not care and he made no reply in words but there was a wounded look in his face as he turned away toward his home which rose before me many times in after years in the night and reproached me and made me ashamed again it had grown dim in my mind by and by then it disappeared but it was back now and not dim  once at school when we were eleven i upset my ink and spoiled four copybooks and was in danger of severe punishment but i put it upon him and he got the whipping  and only last year i had cheated him in a trade giving him a large fishhook which was partly broken through for three small sound ones the first fish he caught broke the hook but he did not know i was blamable and he refused to take back one of the small hooks which my conscience forced me to offer him but said a trade is a trade the hook was bad but that was not your fault  no i could not sleep these little shabby wrongs upbraided me and tortured me and with a pain much sharper than one feels when the wrongs have been done to the living nikolaus was living but no matter he was to me as one already dead the wind was still moaning about the eaves the rain still pattering upon the panes  in the morning i sought out seppi and told him it was down by the river his lips moved but he did not say anything he only looked dazed and stunned and his face turned very white he stood like that a few moments the tears welling into his eyes then he turned away and i locked my arm in his and we walked along thinking but not speaking we crossed the bridge and wandered through the meadows and up among the hills and the woods and at last the talk came and flowed freely and it was all about nikolaus and was a recalling of the life we had lived with him and every now and then seppi said as if to himself  twelve daysless than twelve days  we said we must be with him all the time we must have all of him we could the days were precious now yet we did not go to seek him it would be like meeting the dead and we were afraid we did not say it but that was what we were feeling and so it gave us a shock when we turned a curve and came upon nikolaus face to face he shouted gaily  hihi what is the matter have you seen a ghost  we couldnt speak but there was no occasion he was willing to talk for us all for he had just seen satan and was in high spirits about it satan had told him about our trip to china and he had begged satan to take him a journey and satan had promised it was to be a far journey and wonderful and beautiful and nikolaus had begged him to take us too but he said no he would take us some day maybe but not now satan would come for him on the 13th and nikolaus was already counting the hours he was so impatient  that was the fatal day we were already counting the hours too  we wandered many a mile always following paths which had been our favorites from the days when we were little and always we talked about the old times all the blitheness was with nikolaus we others could not shake off our depression our tone toward nikolaus was so strangely gentle and tender and yearning that he noticed it and was pleased and we were constantly doing him deferential little offices of courtesy and saying wait let me do that for you and that pleased him too i gave him seven fishhooksall i hadand made him take them and seppi gave him his new knife and a hummingtop painted red and yellowatonements for swindles practised upon him formerly as i learned later and probably no longer remembered by nikolaus now these things touched him and he could not have believed that we loved him so and his pride in it and gratefulness for it cut us to the heart we were so undeserving of them when we parted at last he was radiant and said he had never had such a happy day  as we walked along homeward seppi said we always prized him but never so much as now when we are going to lose him  next day and every day we spent all of our spare time with nikolaus and also added to it time which we and he stole from work and other duties and this cost the three of us some sharp scoldings and some threats of punishment every morning two of us woke with a start and a shudder saying as the days flew along only ten days left only nine days left only eight only seven always it was narrowing always nikolaus was gay and happy and always puzzled because we were not he wore his invention to the bone trying to invent ways to cheer us up but it was only a hollow success he could see that our jollity had no heart in it and that the laughs we broke into came up against some obstruction or other and suffered damage and decayed into a sigh he tried to find out what the matter was so that he could help us out of our trouble or make it lighter by sharing it with us so we had to tell many lies to deceive him and appease him  but the most distressing thing of all was that he was always making plans and often they went beyond the 13th whenever that happened it made us groan in spirit all his mind was fixed upon finding some way to conquer our depression and cheer us up and at last when he had but three days to live he fell upon the right idea and was jubilant over ita boysandgirls frolic and dance in the woods up there where we first met satan and this was to occur on the 14th it was ghastly for that was his funeral day we couldnt venture to protest it would only have brought a why which we could not answer he wanted us to help him invite his guests and we did itone can refuse nothing to a dying friend but it was dreadful for really we were inviting them to his funeral  it was an awful eleven days and yet with a lifetime stretching back between today and then they are still a grateful memory to me and beautiful in effect they were days of companionship with ones sacred dead and i have known no comradeship that was so close or so precious we clung to the hours and the minutes counting them as they wasted away and parting with them with that pain and bereavement which a miser feels who sees his hoard filched from him coin by coin by robbers and is helpless to prevent it  when the evening of the last day came we stayed out too long seppi and i were in fault for that we could not bear to part with nikolaus so it was very late when we left him at his door we lingered near awhile listening and that happened which we were fearing his father gave him the promised punishment and we heard his shrieks but we listened only a moment then hurried away remorseful for this thing which we had caused and sorry for the father too our thought being if he only knewif he only knew  in the morning nikolaus did not meet us at the appointed place so we went to his home to see what the matter was his mother said  his father is out of all patience with these goingson and will not have any more of it half the time when nick is needed he is not to be found then it turns out that he has been gadding around with you two his father gave him a flogging last night it always grieved me before and manys the time i have begged him off and saved him but this time he appealed to me in vain for i was out of patience myself  i wish you had saved him just this one time i said my voice trembling a little it would ease a pain in your heart to remember it some day  she was ironing at the time and her back was partly toward me she turned about with a startled or wondering look in her face and said what do you mean by that  i was not prepared and didnt know anything to say so it was awkward for she kept looking at me but seppi was alert and spoke up  why of course it would be pleasant to remember for the very reason we were out so late was that nikolaus got to telling how good you are to him and how he never got whipped when you were by to save him and he was so full of it and we were so full of the interest of it that none of us noticed how late it was getting  did he say that did he and she put her apron to her eyes  you can ask theodorhe will tell you the same  it is a dear good lad my nick she said i am sorry i let him get whipped i will never do it again to thinkall the time i was sitting here last night fretting and angry at him he was loving me and praising me dear dear if we could only know then we shouldnt ever go wrong but we are only poor dumb beasts groping around and making mistakes i shant ever think of last night without a pang  she was like all the rest it seemed as if nobody could open a mouth in these wretched days without saying something that made us shiver they were groping around and did not know what true sorrowfully true things they were saying by accident  seppi asked if nikolaus might go out with us  i am sorry she answered but he cant to punish him further his father doesnt allow him to go out of the house today  we had a great hope i saw it in seppis eyes we thought if he cannot leave the house he cannot be drowned seppi asked to make sure  must he stay in all day or only the morning  all day its such a pity too its a beautiful day and he is so unused to being shut up but he is busy planning his party and maybe that is company for him i do hope he isnt too lonesome  seppi saw that in her eye which emboldened him to ask if we might go up and help him pass his time  and welcome she said right heartily now i call that real friendship when you might be abroad in the fields and the woods having a happy time you are good boys ill allow that though you dont always find satisfactory ways of improving it take these cakesfor yourselvesand give him this one from his mother  the first thing we noticed when we entered nikolauss room was the timea quarter to 10 could that be correct only such a few minutes to live i felt a contraction at my heart nikolaus jumped up and gave us a glad welcome he was in good spirits over his plannings for his party and had not been lonesome  sit down he said and look at what ive been doing and ive finished a kite that you will say is a beauty its drying in the kitchen ill fetch it  he had been spending his penny savings in fanciful trifles of various kinds to go as prizes in the games and they were marshaled with fine and showy effect upon the table he said  examine them at your leisure while i get mother to touch up the kite with her iron if it isnt dry enough yet  then he tripped out and went clattering downstairs whistling  we did not look at the things we couldnt take any interest in anything but the clock we sat staring at it in silence listening to the ticking and every time the minutehand jumped we nodded recognitionone minute fewer to cover in the race for life or for death finally seppi drew a deep breath and said  two minutes to ten seven minutes more and he will pass the deathpoint theodor he is going to be saved hes going to  hush im on needles watch the clock and keep still  five minutes more we were panting with the strain and the excitement another three minutes and there was a footstep on the stair  saved and we jumped up and faced the door  the old mother entered bringing the kite isnt it a beauty she said and dear me how he has slaved over itever since daylight i think and only finished it awhile before you came she stood it against the wall and stepped back to take a view of it he drew the pictures his own self and i think they are very good the church isnt so very good ill have to admit but look at the bridgeany one can recognize the bridge in a minute he asked me to bring it up dear me its seven minutes past ten and i  but where is he  he oh hell be here soon hes gone out a minute  gone out  yes just as he came downstairs little lisas mother came in and said the child had wandered off somewhere and as she was a little uneasy i told nikolaus to never mind about his fathers ordersgo and look her up why how white you two do look i do believe you are sick sit down ill fetch something that cake has disagreed with you it is a little heavy but i thought  she disappeared without finishing her sentence and we hurried at once to the back window and looked toward the river there was a great crowd at the other end of the bridge and people were flying toward that point from every direction  oh it is all overpoor nikolaus why oh why did she let him get out of the house  come away said seppi half sobbing come quickwe cant bear to meet her in five minutes she will know  but we were not to escape she came upon us at the foot of the stairs with her cordials in her hands and made us come in and sit down and take the medicine then she watched the effect and it did not satisfy her so she made us wait longer and kept upbraiding herself for giving us the unwholesome cake  presently the thing happened which we were dreading there was a sound of tramping and scraping outside and a crowd came solemnly in with heads uncovered and laid the two drowned bodies on the bed  oh my god that poor mother cried out and fell on her knees and put her arms about her dead boy and began to cover the wet face with kisses oh it was i that sent him and i have been his death if i had obeyed and kept him in the house this would not have happened and i am rightly punished i was cruel to him last night and him begging me his own mother to be his friend  and so she went on and on and all the women cried and pitied her and tried to comfort her but she could not forgive herself and could not be comforted and kept on saying if she had not sent him out he would be alive and well now and she was the cause of his death  it shows how foolish people are when they blame themselves for anything they have done satan knows and he said nothing happens that your first act hasnt arranged to happen and made inevitable and so of your own motion you cant ever alter the scheme or do a thing that will break a link next we heard screams and frau brandt came wildly plowing and plunging through the crowd with her dress in disorder and hair flying loose and flung herself upon her dead child with moans and kisses and pleadings and endearments and by and by she rose up almost exhausted with her outpourings of passionate emotion and clenched her fist and lifted it toward the sky and her teardrenched face grew hard and resentful and she said  for nearly two weeks i have had dreams and presentiments and warnings that death was going to strike what was most precious to me and day and night and night and day i have groveled in the dirt before him praying him to have pity on my innocent child and save it from harmand here is his answer  why he had saved it from harmbut she did not know  she wiped the tears from her eyes and cheeks and stood awhile gazing down at the child and caressing its face and its hair with her hands then she spoke again in that bitter tone but in his hard heart is no compassion i will never pray again  she gathered her dead child to her bosom and strode away the crowd falling back to let her pass and smitten dumb by the awful words they had heard ah that poor woman it is as satan said we do not know good fortune from bad and are always mistaking the one for the other many a time since i have heard people pray to god to spare the life of sick persons but i have never done it  both funerals took place at the same time in our little church next day everybody was there including the party guests satan was there too which was proper for it was on account of his efforts that the funerals had happened nikolaus had departed this life without absolution and a collection was taken up for masses to get him out of purgatory only twothirds of the required money was gathered and the parents were going to try to borrow the rest but satan furnished it he told us privately that there was no purgatory but he had contributed in order that nikolauss parents and their friends might be saved from worry and distress we thought it very good of him but he said money did not cost him anything  at the graveyard the body of little lisa was seized for debt by a carpenter to whom the mother owed fifty groschen for work done the year before she had never been able to pay this and was not able now the carpenter took the corpse home and kept it four days in his cellar the mother weeping and imploring about his house all the time then he buried it in his brothers cattleyard without religious ceremonies it drove the mother wild with grief and shame and she forsook her work and went daily about the town cursing the carpenter and blaspheming the laws of the emperor and the church and it was pitiful to see seppi asked satan to interfere but he said the carpenter and the rest were members of the human race and were acting quite neatly for that species of animal he would interfere if he found a horse acting in such a way and we must inform him when we came across that kind of horse doing that kind of human thing so that he could stop it we believed this was sarcasm for of course there wasnt any such horse  but after a few days we found that we could not abide that poor womans distress so we begged satan to examine her several possible careers and see if he could not change her to her profit to a new one he said the longest of her careers as they now stood gave her fortytwo years to live and her shortest one twentynine and that both were charged with grief and hunger and cold and pain the only improvement he could make would be to enable her to skip a certain three minutes from now and he asked us if he should do it this was such a short time to decide in that we went to pieces with nervous excitement and before we could pull ourselves together and ask for particulars he said the time would be up in a few more seconds so then we gasped out do it  it is done he said she was going around a corner i have turned her back it has changed her career  then what will happen satan  it is happening now she is having words with fischer the weaver in his anger fischer will straightway do what he would not have done but for this accident he was present when she stood over her childs body and uttered those blasphemies  what will he do  he is doing it nowbetraying her in three days she will go to the stake  we could not speak we were frozen with horror for if we had not meddled with her career she would have been spared this awful fate satan noticed these thoughts and said  what you are thinking is strictly humanlikethat is to say foolish the woman is advantaged die when she might she would go to heaven by this prompt death she gets twentynine years more of heaven than she is entitled to and escapes twentynine years of misery here  a moment before we were bitterly making up our minds that we would ask no more favors of satan for friends of ours for he did not seem to know any way to do a person a kindness but by killing him but the whole aspect of the case was changed now and we were glad of what we had done and full of happiness in the thought of it  after a little i began to feel troubled about fischer and asked timidly does this episode change fischers lifescheme satan  change it why certainly and radically if he had not met frau brandt awhile ago he would die next year thirtyfour years of age now he will live to be ninety and have a pretty prosperous and comfortable life of it as human lives go  we felt a great joy and pride in what we had done for fischer and were expecting satan to sympathize with this feeling but he showed no sign and this made us uneasy we waited for him to speak but he didnt so to assuage our solicitude we had to ask him if there was any defect in fischers good luck satan considered the question a moment then said with some hesitation  well the fact is it is a delicate point under his several former possible lifecareers he was going to heaven  we were aghast oh satan and under this one  there dont be so distressed you were sincerely trying to do him a kindness let that comfort you  oh dear dear that cannot comfort us you ought to have told us what we were doing then we wouldnt have acted so  but it made no impression on him he had never felt a pain or a sorrow and did not know what they were in any really informing way he had no knowledge of them except theoreticallythat is to say intellectually and of course that is no good one can never get any but a loose and ignorant notion of such things except by experience we tried our best to make him comprehend the awful thing that had been done and how we were compromised by it but he couldnt seem to get hold of it he said he did not think it important where fischer went to in heaven he would not be missed there were plenty there we tried to make him see that he was missing the point entirely that fischer and not other people was the proper one to decide about the importance of it but it all went for nothing he said he did not care for fischerthere were plenty more fischers  the next minute fischer went by on the other side of the way and it made us sick and faint to see him remembering the doom that was upon him and we the cause of it and how unconscious he was that anything had happened to him you could see by his elastic step and his alert manner that he was well satisfied with himself for doing that hard turn for poor frau brandt he kept glancing back over his shoulder expectantly and sure enough pretty soon frau brandt followed after in charge of the officers and wearing jingling chains a mob was in her wake jeering and shouting blasphemer and heretic and some among them were neighbors and friends of her happier days some were trying to strike her and the officers were not taking as much trouble as they might to keep them from it  oh stop them satan it was out before we remembered that he could not interrupt them for a moment without changing their whole afterlives he puffed a little puff toward them with his lips and they began to reel and stagger and grab at the empty air then they broke apart and fled in every direction shrieking as if in intolerable pain he had crushed a rib of each of them with that little puff we could not help asking if their lifechart was changed  yes entirely some have gained years some have lost them some few will profit in various ways by the change but only that few  we did not ask if we had brought poor fischers luck to any of them we did not wish to know we fully believed in satans desire to do us kindnesses but we were losing confidence in his judgment it was at this time that our growing anxiety to have him look over our lifecharts and suggest improvements began to fade out and give place to other interests  for a day or two the whole village was a chattering turmoil over frau brandts case and over the mysterious calamity that had overtaken the mob and at her trial the place was crowded she was easily convicted of her blasphemies for she uttered those terrible words again and said she would not take them back when warned that she was imperiling her life she said they could take it in welcome she did not want it she would rather live with the professional devils in perdition than with these imitators in the village they accused her of breaking all those ribs by witchcraft and asked her if she was not a witch she answered scornfully  no if i had that power would any of you holy hypocrites be alive five minutes no i would strike you all dead pronounce your sentence and let me go i am tired of your society  so they found her guilty and she was excommunicated and cut off from the joys of heaven and doomed to the fires of hell then she was clothed in a coarse robe and delivered to the secular arm and conducted to the marketplace the bell solemnly tolling the while we saw her chained to the stake and saw the first film of blue smoke rise on the still air then her hard face softened and she looked upon the packed crowd in front of her and said with gentleness  we played together once in longagone days when we were innocent little creatures for the sake of that i forgive you  we went away then and did not see the fires consume her but we heard the shrieks although we put our fingers in our ears when they ceased we knew she was in heaven notwithstanding the excommunication and we were glad of her death and not sorry that we had brought it about  one day a little while after this satan appeared again we were always watching out for him for life was never very stagnant when he was by he came upon us at that place in the woods where we had first met him being boys we wanted to be entertained we asked him to do a show for us  very well he said would you like to see a history of the progress of the human raceits development of that product which it calls civilization  we said we should  so with a thought he turned the place into the garden of eden and we saw abel praying by his altar then cain came walking toward him with his club and did not seem to see us and would have stepped on my foot if i had not drawn it in he spoke to his brother in a language which we did not understand then he grew violent and threatening and we knew what was going to happen and turned away our heads for the moment but we heard the crash of the blows and heard the shrieks and the groans then there was silence and we saw abel lying in his blood and gasping out his life and cain standing over him and looking down at him vengeful and unrepentant  then the vision vanished and was followed by a long series of unknown wars murders and massacres next we had the flood and the ark tossing around in the stormy waters with lofty mountains in the distance showing veiled and dim through the rain satan said  the progress of your race was not satisfactory it is to have another chance now  the scene changed and we saw noah overcome with wine  next we had sodom and gomorrah and the attempt to discover two or three respectable persons there as satan described it next lot and his daughters in the cave  next came the hebraic wars and we saw the victors massacre the survivors and their cattle and save the young girls alive and distribute them around  next we had jael and saw her slip into the tent and drive the nail into the temple of her sleeping guest and we were so close that when the blood gushed out it trickled in a little red stream to our feet and we could have stained our hands in it if we had wanted to  next we had egyptian wars greek wars roman wars hideous drenchings of the earth with blood and we saw the treacheries of the romans toward the carthaginians and the sickening spectacle of the massacre of those brave people also we saw caesar invade britainnot that those barbarians had done him any harm but because he wanted their land and desired to confer the blessings of civilization upon their widows and orphans as satan explained  next christianity was born then ages of europe passed in review before us and we saw christianity and civilization march hand in hand through those ages leaving famine and death and desolation in their wake and other signs of the progress of the human race as satan observed  and always we had wars and more wars and still other warsall over europe all over the world sometimes in the private interest of royal families satan said sometimes to crush a weak nation but never a war started by the aggressor for any clean purposethere is no such war in the history of the race  now said satan you have seen your progress down to the present and you must confess that it is wonderfulin its way we must now exhibit the future  he showed us slaughters more terrible in their destruction of life more devastating in their engines of war than any we had seen  you perceive he said that you have made continual progress cain did his murder with a club the hebrews did their murders with javelins and swords the greeks and romans added protective armor and the fine arts of military organization and generalship the christian has added guns and gunpowder a few centuries from now he will have so greatly improved the deadly effectiveness of his weapons of slaughter that all men will confess that without christian civilization war must have remained a poor and trifling thing to the end of time  then he began to laugh in the most unfeeling way and make fun of the human race although he knew that what he had been saying shamed us and wounded us no one but an angel could have acted so but suffering is nothing to them they do not know what it is except by hearsay  more than once seppi and i had tried in a humble and diffident way to convert him and as he had remained silent we had taken his silence as a sort of encouragement necessarily then this talk of his was a disappointment to us for it showed that we had made no deep impression upon him the thought made us sad and we knew then how the missionary must feel when he has been cherishing a glad hope and has seen it blighted we kept our grief to ourselves knowing that this was not the time to continue our work  satan laughed his unkind laugh to a finish then he said it is a remarkable progress in five or six thousand years five or six high civilizations have risen flourished commanded the wonder of the world then faded out and disappeared and not one of them except the latest ever invented any sweeping and adequate way to kill people they all did their bestto kill being the chiefest ambition of the human race and the earliest incident in its historybut only the christian civilization has scored a triumph to be proud of two or three centuries from now it will be recognized that all the competent killers are christians then the pagan world will go to school to the christiannot to acquire his religion but his guns the turk and the chinaman will buy those to kill missionaries and converts with  by this time his theater was at work again and before our eyes nation after nation drifted by during two or three centuries a mighty procession an endless procession raging struggling wallowing through seas of blood smothered in battlesmoke through which the flags glinted and the red jets from the cannon darted and always we heard the thunder of the guns and the cries of the dying  and what does it amount to said satan with his evil chuckle nothing at all you gain nothing you always come out where you went in for a million years the race has gone on monotonously propagating itself and monotonously reperforming this dull nonsenseto what end no wisdom can guess who gets a profit out of it nobody but a parcel of usurping little monarchs and nobilities who despise you would feel defiled if you touched them would shut the door in your face if you proposed to call whom you slave for fight for die for and are not ashamed of it but proud whose existence is a perpetual insult to you and you are afraid to resent it who are mendicants supported by your alms yet assume toward you the airs of benefactor toward beggar who address you in the language of master to slave and are answered in the language of slave to master who are worshiped by you with your mouth while in your heartif you have oneyou despise yourselves for it the first man was a hypocrite and a coward qualities which have not yet failed in his line it is the foundation upon which all civilizations have been built drink to their perpetuation drink to their augmentation drink to then he saw by our faces how much we were hurt and he cut his sentence short and stopped chuckling and his manner changed he said gently no we will drink one anothers health and let civilization go the wine which has flown to our hands out of space by desire is earthly and good enough for that other toast but throw away the glasses we will drink this one in wine which has not visited this world before  we obeyed and reached up and received the new cups as they descended they were shapely and beautiful goblets but they were not made of any material that we were acquainted with they seemed to be in motion they seemed to be alive and certainly the colors in them were in motion they were very brilliant and sparkling and of every tint and they were never still but flowed to and fro in rich tides which met and broke and flashed out dainty explosions of enchanting color i think it was most like opals washing about in waves and flashing out their splendid fires but there is nothing to compare the wine with we drank it and felt a strange and witching ecstasy as of heaven go stealing through us and seppis eyes filled and he said worshipingly  we shall be there some day and then  he glanced furtively at satan and i think he hoped satan would say yes you will be there some day but satan seemed to be thinking about something else and said nothing this made me feel ghastly for i knew he had heard nothing spoken or unspoken ever escaped him poor seppi looked distressed and did not finish his remark the goblets rose and clove their way into the sky a triplet of radiant sundogs and disappeared why didnt they stay it seemed a bad sign and depressed me should i ever see mine again would seppi ever see his   chapter 9  it was wonderful the mastery satan had over time and distance for him they did not exist he called them human inventions and said they were artificialities we often went to the most distant parts of the globe with him and stayed weeks and months and yet were gone only a fraction of a second as a rule you could prove it by the clock one day when our people were in such awful distress because the witch commission were afraid to proceed against the astrologer and father peters household or against any indeed but the poor and the friendless they lost patience and took to witchhunting on their own score and began to chase a born lady who was known to have the habit of curing people by devilish arts such as bathing them washing them and nourishing them instead of bleeding them and purging them through the ministrations of a barbersurgeon in the proper way she came flying down with the howling and cursing mob after her and tried to take refuge in houses but the doors were shut in her face they chased her more than half an hour we following to see it and at last she was exhausted and fell and they caught her they dragged her to a tree and threw a rope over the limb and began to make a noose in it some holding her meantime and she crying and begging and her young daughter looking on and weeping but afraid to say or do anything  they hanged the lady and i threw a stone at her although in my heart i was sorry for her but all were throwing stones and each was watching his neighbor and if i had not done as the others did it would have been noticed and spoken of satan burst out laughing  all that were near by turned upon him astonished and not pleased it was an ill time to laugh for his free and scoffing ways and his supernatural music had brought him under suspicion all over the town and turned many privately against him the big blacksmith called attention to him now raising his voice so that all should hear and said  what are you laughing at answer moreover please explain to the company why you threw no stone  are you sure i did not throw a stone  yes you neednt try to get out of it i had my eye on you  and ii noticed you shouted two others  three witnesses said satan mueller the blacksmith klein the butchers man pfeiffer the weavers journeyman three very ordinary liars are there any more  never mind whether there are others or not and never mind about what you consider usthrees enough to settle your matter for you youll prove that you threw a stone or it shall go hard with you  thats so shouted the crowd and surged up as closely as they could to the center of interest  and first you will answer that other question cried the blacksmith pleased with himself for being mouthpiece to the public and hero of the occasion what are you laughing at  satan smiled and answered pleasantly to see three cowards stoning a dying lady when they were so near death themselves  you could see the superstitious crowd shrink and catch their breath under the sudden shock the blacksmith with a show of bravado said  pooh what do you know about it  i everything by profession i am a fortuneteller and i read the hands of you threeand some otherswhen you lifted them to stone the woman one of you will die tomorrow week another of you will die tonight the third has but five minutes to liveand yonder is the clock  it made a sensation the faces of the crowd blanched and turned mechanically toward the clock the butcher and the weaver seemed smitten with an illness but the blacksmith braced up and said with spirit  it is not long to wait for prediction number one if it fails young master you will not live a whole minute after i promise you that  no one said anything all watched the clock in a deep stillness which was impressive when four and a half minutes were gone the blacksmith gave a sudden gasp and clapped his hands upon his heart saying give me breath give me room and began to sink down the crowd surged back no one offering to support him and he fell lumbering to the ground and was dead the people stared at him then at satan then at one another and their lips moved but no words came then satan said  three saw that i threw no stone perhaps there are others let them speak  it struck a kind of panic into them and although no one answered him many began to violently accuse one another saying you said he didnt throw and getting for reply it is a lie and i will make you eat it and so in a moment they were in a raging and noisy turmoil and beating and banging one another and in the midst was the only indifferent onethe dead lady hanging from her rope her troubles forgotten her spirit at peace  so we walked away and i was not at ease but was saying to myself he told them he was laughing at them but it was a liehe was laughing at me  that made him laugh again and he said yes i was laughing at you because in fear of what others might report about you you stoned the woman when your heart revolted at the actbut i was laughing at the others too  why  because their case was yours  how is that  well there were sixtyeight people there and sixtytwo of them had no more desire to throw a stone than you had  satan  oh its true i know your race it is made up of sheep it is governed by minorities seldom or never by majorities it suppresses its feelings and its beliefs and follows the handful that makes the most noise sometimes the noisy handful is right sometimes wrong but no matter the crowd follows it the vast majority of the race whether savage or civilized are secretly kindhearted and shrink from inflicting pain but in the presence of the aggressive and pitiless minority they dont dare to assert themselves think of it one kindhearted creature spies upon another and sees to it that he loyally helps in iniquities which revolt both of them speaking as an expert i know that ninetynine out of a hundred of your race were strongly against the killing of witches when that foolishness was first agitated by a handful of pious lunatics in the long ago and i know that even today after ages of transmitted prejudice and silly teaching only one person in twenty puts any real heart into the harrying of a witch and yet apparently everybody hates witches and wants them killed some day a handful will rise up on the other side and make the most noiseperhaps even a single daring man with a big voice and a determined front will do itand in a week all the sheep will wheel and follow him and witchhunting will come to a sudden end  monarchies aristocracies and religions are all based upon that large defect in your racethe individuals distrust of his neighbor and his desire for safetys or comforts sake to stand well in his neighbors eye these institutions will always remain and always flourish and always oppress you affront you and degrade you because you will always be and remain slaves of minorities there was never a country where the majority of the people were in their secret hearts loyal to any of these institutions  i did not like to hear our race called sheep and said i did not think they were  still it is true lamb said satan look at you in warwhat mutton you are and how ridiculous  in war how  there has never been a just one never an honorable oneon the part of the instigator of the war i can see a million years ahead and this rule will never change in so many as half a dozen instances the loud little handfulas usualwill shout for the war the pulpit willwarily and cautiouslyobjectat first the great big dull bulk of the nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try to make out why there should be a war and will say earnestly and indignantly it is unjust and dishonorable and there is no necessity for it then the handful will shout louder a few fair men on the other side will argue and reason against the war with speech and pen and at first will have a hearing and be applauded but it will not last long those others will outshout them and presently the antiwar audiences will thin out and lose popularity before long you will see this curious thing the speakers stoned from the platform and free speech strangled by hordes of furious men who in their secret hearts are still at one with those stoned speakersas earlierbut do not dare to say so and now the whole nationpulpit and allwill take up the warcry and shout itself hoarse and mob any honest man who ventures to open his mouth and presently such mouths will cease to open next the statesmen will invent cheap lies putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked and every man will be glad of those consciencesoothing falsities and will diligently study them and refuse to examine any refutations of them and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just and will thank god for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque selfdeception   chapter 10  days and days went by now and no satan it was dull without him but the astrologer who had returned from his excursion to the moon went about the village braving public opinion and getting a stone in the middle of his back now and then when some witchhater got a safe chance to throw it and dodge out of sight meantime two influences had been working well for marget that satan who was quite indifferent to her had stopped going to her house after a visit or two had hurt her pride and she had set herself the task of banishing him from her heart reports of wilhelm meidlings dissipation brought to her from time to time by old ursula had touched her with remorse jealousy of satan being the cause of it and so now these two matters working upon her together she was getting a good profit out of the combinationher interest in satan was steadily cooling her interest in wilhelm as steadily warming all that was needed to complete her conversion was that wilhelm should brace up and do something that should cause favorable talk and incline the public toward him again  the opportunity came now marget sent and asked him to defend her uncle in the approaching trial and he was greatly pleased and stopped drinking and began his preparations with diligence with more diligence than hope in fact for it was not a promising case he had many interviews in his office with seppi and me and threshed out our testimony pretty thoroughly thinking to find some valuable grains among the chaff but the harvest was poor of course  if satan would only come that was my constant thought he could invent some way to win the case for he had said it would be won so he necessarily knew how it could be done but the days dragged on and still he did not come of course i did not doubt that it would be won and that father peter would be happy for the rest of his life since satan had said so yet i knew i should be much more comfortable if he would come and tell us how to manage it it was getting high time for father peter to have a saving change toward happiness for by general report he was worn out with his imprisonment and the ignominy that was burdening him and was like to die of his miseries unless he got relief soon  at last the trial came on and the people gathered from all around to witness it among them many strangers from considerable distances yes everybody was there except the accused he was too feeble in body for the strain but marget was present and keeping up her hope and her spirit the best she could the money was present too it was emptied on the table and was handled and caressed and examined by such as were privileged  the astrologer was put in the witnessbox he had on his best hat and robe for the occasion  question you claim that this money is yours  answer i do  q how did you come by it  a i found the bag in the road when i was returning from a journey  q when  a more than two years ago  q what did you do with it  a i brought it home and hid it in a secret place in my observatory intending to find the owner if i could  q you endeavored to find him  a i made diligent inquiry during several months but nothing came of it  q and then  a i thought it not worth while to look further and was minded to use the money in finishing the wing of the foundlingasylum connected with the priory and nunnery so i took it out of its hidingplace and counted it to see if any of it was missing and then  q why do you stop proceed  a i am sorry to have to say this but just as i had finished and was restoring the bag to its place i looked up and there stood father peter behind me  several murmured that looks bad but others answered ah but he is such a liar  q that made you uneasy  a no i thought nothing of it at the time for father peter often came to me unannounced to ask for a little help in his need  marget blushed crimson at hearing her uncle falsely and impudently charged with begging especially from one he had always denounced as a fraud and was going to speak but remembered herself in time and held her peace  q proceed  a in the end i was afraid to contribute the money to the foundlingasylum but elected to wait yet another year and continue my inquiries when i heard of father peters find i was glad and no suspicion entered my mind when i came home a day or two later and discovered that my own money was gone i still did not suspect until three circumstances connected with father peters good fortune struck me as being singular coincidences  q pray name them  a father peter had found his money in a pathi had found mine in a road father peters find consisted exclusively of gold ducatsmine also father peter found eleven hundred and seven ducatsi exactly the same  this closed his evidence and certainly it made a strong impression on the house one could see that  wilhelm meidling asked him some questions then called us boys and we told our tale it made the people laugh and we were ashamed we were feeling pretty badly anyhow because wilhelm was hopeless and showed it he was doing as well as he could poor young fellow but nothing was in his favor and such sympathy as there was was now plainly not with his client it might be difficult for court and people to believe the astrologers story considering his character but it was almost impossible to believe father peters we were already feeling badly enough but when the astrologers lawyer said he believed he would not ask us any questionsfor our story was a little delicate and it would be cruel for him to put any strain upon iteverybody tittered and it was almost more than we could bear then he made a sarcastic little speech and got so much fun out of our tale and it seemed so ridiculous and childish and every way impossible and foolish that it made everybody laugh till the tears came and at last marget could not keep up her courage any longer but broke down and cried and i was so sorry for her  now i noticed something that braced me up it was satan standing alongside of wilhelm and there was such a contrastsatan looked so confident had such a spirit in his eyes and face and wilhelm looked so depressed and despondent we two were comfortable now and judged that he would testify and persuade the bench and the people that black was white and white black or any other color he wanted it we glanced around to see what the strangers in the house thought of him for he was beautiful you knowstunning in factbut no one was noticing him so we knew by that that he was invisible  the lawyer was saying his last words and while he was saying them satan began to melt into wilhelm he melted into him and disappeared and then there was a change when his spirit began to look out of wilhelms eyes  that lawyer finished quite seriously and with dignity he pointed to the money and said  the love of it is the root of all evil there it lies the ancient tempter newly red with the shame of its latest victorythe dishonor of a priest of god and his two poor juvenile helpers in crime if it could but speak let us hope that it would be constrained to confess that of all its conquests this was the basest and the most pathetic  he sat down wilhelm rose and said  from the testimony of the accuser i gather that he found this money in a road more than two years ago correct me sir if i misunderstood you  the astrologer said his understanding of it was correct  and the money so found was never out of his hands thenceforth up to a certain definite datethe last day of last year correct me sir if i am wrong  the astrologer nodded his head wilhelm turned to the bench and said  if i prove that this money here was not that money then it is not his  certainly not but this is irregular if you had such a witness it was your duty to give proper notice of it and have him here to he broke off and began to consult with the other judges meantime that other lawyer got up excited and began to protest against allowing new witnesses to be brought into the case at this late stage  the judges decided that his contention was just and must be allowed  but this is not a new witness said wilhelm it has already been partly examined i speak of the coin  the coin what can the coin say  it can say it is not the coin that the astrologer once possessed it can say it was not in existence last december by its date it can say this  and it was so there was the greatest excitement in the court while that lawyer and the judges were reaching for coins and examining them and exclaiming and everybody was full of admiration of wilhelms brightness in happening to think of that neat idea at last order was called and the court said  all of the coins but four are of the date of the present year the court tenders its sincere sympathy to the accused and its deep regret that he an innocent man through an unfortunate mistake has suffered the undeserved humiliation of imprisonment and trial the case is dismissed  so the money could speak after all though that lawyer thought it couldnt the court rose and almost everybody came forward to shake hands with marget and congratulate her and then to shake with wilhelm and praise him and satan had stepped out of wilhelm and was standing around looking on full of interest and people walking through him every which way not knowing he was there and wilhelm could not explain why he only thought of the date on the coins at the last moment instead of earlier he said it just occurred to him all of a sudden like an inspiration and he brought it right out without any hesitation for although he didnt examine the coins he seemed somehow to know it was true that was honest of him and like him another would have pretended he had thought of it earlier and was keeping it back for a surprise  he had dulled down a little now not much but still you could notice that he hadnt that luminous look in his eyes that he had while satan was in him he nearly got it back though for a moment when marget came and praised him and thanked him and couldnt keep him from seeing how proud she was of him the astrologer went off dissatisfied and cursing and solomon isaacs gathered up the money and carried it away it was father peters for good and all now  satan was gone i judged that he had spirited himself away to the jail to tell the prisoner the news and in this i was right marget and the rest of us hurried thither at our best speed in a great state of rejoicing  well what satan had done was this he had appeared before that poor prisoner exclaiming the trial is over and you stand forever disgraced as a thiefby verdict of the court  the shock unseated the old mans reason when we arrived ten minutes later he was parading pompously up and down and delivering commands to this and that and the other constable or jailer and calling them grand chamberlain and prince this and prince that and admiral of the fleet field marshal in command and all such fustian and was as happy as a bird he thought he was emperor  marget flung herself on his breast and cried and indeed everybody was moved almost to heartbreak he recognized marget but could not understand why she should cry he patted her on the shoulder and said  dont do it dear remember there are witnesses and it is not becoming in the crown princess tell me your troubleit shall be mended there is nothing the emperor cannot do then he looked around and saw old ursula with her apron to her eyes he was puzzled at that and said and what is the matter with you  through her sobs she got out words explaining that she was distressed to see himso he reflected over that a moment then muttered as if to himself a singular old thing the dowager duchessmeans well but is always snuffling and never able to tell what it is about it is because she doesnt know his eyes fell on wilhelm prince of india he said i divine that it is you that the crown princess is concerned about her tears shall be dried i will no longer stand between you she shall share your throne and between you you shall inherit mine there little lady have i done well you can smile nowisnt it so  he petted marget and kissed her and was so contented with himself and with everybody that he could not do enough for us all but began to give away kingdoms and such things right and left and the least that any of us got was a principality and so at last being persuaded to go home he marched in imposing state and when the crowds along the way saw how it gratified him to be hurrahed at they humored him to the top of his desire and he responded with condescending bows and gracious smiles and often stretched out a hand and said bless you my people  as pitiful a sight as ever i saw and marget and old ursula crying all the way  on my road home i came upon satan and reproached him with deceiving me with that lie he was not embarrassed but said quite simply and composedly  ah you mistake it was the truth i said he would be happy the rest of his days and he will for he will always think he is the emperor and his pride in it and his joy in it will endure to the end he is now and will remain the one utterly happy person in this empire  but the method of it satan the method couldnt you have done it without depriving him of his reason  it was difficult to irritate satan but that accomplished it  what an ass you are he said are you so unobservant as not to have found out that sanity and happiness are an impossible combination no sane man can be happy for to him life is real and he sees what a fearful thing it is only the mad can be happy and not many of those the few that imagine themselves kings or gods are happy the rest are no happier than the sane of course no man is entirely in his right mind at any time but i have been referring to the extreme cases i have taken from this man that trumpery thing which the race regards as a mind i have replaced his tin life with a silvergilt fiction you see the resultand you criticize i said i would make him permanently happy and i have done it i have made him happy by the only means possible to his raceand you are not satisfied he heaved a discouraged sigh and said it seems to me that this race is hard to please  there it was you see he didnt seem to know any way to do a person a favor except by killing him or making a lunatic out of him i apologized as well as i could but privately i did not think much of his processesat that time  satan was accustomed to say that our race lived a life of continuous and uninterrupted selfdeception it duped itself from cradle to grave with shams and delusions which it mistook for realities and this made its entire life a sham of the score of fine qualities which it imagined it had and was vain of it really possessed hardly one it regarded itself as gold and was only brass one day when he was in this vein he mentioned a detailthe sense of humor i cheered up then and took issue i said we possessed it  there spoke the race he said always ready to claim what it hasnt got and mistake its ounce of brass filings for a ton of golddust you have a mongrel perception of humor nothing more a multitude of you possess that this multitude see the comic side of a thousand lowgrade and trivial thingsbroad incongruities mainly grotesqueries absurdities evokers of the horselaugh the ten thousand highgrade comicalities which exist in the world are sealed from their dull vision will a day come when the race will detect the funniness of these juvenilities and laugh at themand by laughing at them destroy them for your race in its poverty has unquestionably one really effective weaponlaughter power money persuasion supplication persecutionthese can lift at a colossal humbugpush it a littleweaken it a little century by century but only laughter can blow it to rags and atoms at a blast against the assault of laughter nothing can stand you are always fussing and fighting with your other weapons do you ever use that one no you leave it lying rusting as a race do you ever use it at all no you lack sense and the courage  we were traveling at the time and stopped at a little city in india and looked on while a juggler did his tricks before a group of natives they were wonderful but i knew satan could beat that game and i begged him to show off a little and he said he would he changed himself into a native in turban and breechcloth and very considerately conferred on me a temporary knowledge of the language  the juggler exhibited a seed covered it with earth in a small flowerpot then put a rag over the pot after a minute the rag began to rise in ten minutes it had risen a foot then the rag was removed and a little tree was exposed with leaves upon it and ripe fruit we ate the fruit and it was good but satan said  why do you cover the pot cant you grow the tree in the sunlight  no said the juggler no one can do that  you are only an apprentice you dont know your trade give me the seed i will show you he took the seed and said what shall i raise from it  it is a cherry seed of course you will raise a cherry  oh no that is a trifle any novice can do that shall i raise an orangetree from it  oh yes and the juggler laughed  and shall i make it bear other fruits as well as oranges  if god wills and they all laughed  satan put the seed in the ground put a handful of dust on it and said rise  a tiny stem shot up and began to grow and grew so fast that in five minutes it was a great tree and we were sitting in the shade of it there was a murmur of wonder then all looked up and saw a strange and pretty sight for the branches were heavy with fruits of many kinds and colorsoranges grapes bananas peaches cherries apricots and so on baskets were brought and the unlading of the tree began and the people crowded around satan and kissed his hand and praised him calling him the prince of jugglers the news went about the town and everybody came running to see the wonderand they remembered to bring baskets too but the tree was equal to the occasion it put out new fruits as fast as any were removed baskets were filled by the score and by the hundred but always the supply remained undiminished at last a foreigner in white linen and sunhelmet arrived and exclaimed angrily  away from here clear out you dogs the tree is on my lands and is my property  the natives put down their baskets and made humble obeisance satan made humble obeisance too with his fingers to his forehead in the native way and said  please let them have their pleasure for an hour sironly that and no longer afterward you may forbid them and you will still have more fruit than you and the state together can consume in a year  this made the foreigner very angry and he cried out who are you you vagabond to tell your betters what they may do and what they maynt and he struck satan with his cane and followed this error with a kick  the fruits rotted on the branches and the leaves withered and fell the foreigner gazed at the bare limbs with the look of one who is surprised and not gratified satan said  take good care of the tree for its health and yours are bound together it will never bear again but if you tend it well it will live long water its roots once in each hour every nightand do it yourself it must not be done by proxy and to do it in daylight will not answer if you fail only once in any night the tree will die and you likewise do not go home to your own country any moreyou would not reach there make no business or pleasure engagements which require you to go outside your gate at nightyou cannot afford the risk do not rent or sell this placeit would be injudicious  the foreigner was proud and wouldnt beg but i thought he looked as if he would like to while he stood gazing at satan we vanished away and landed in ceylon  i was sorry for that man sorry satan hadnt been his customary self and killed him or made him a lunatic it would have been a mercy satan overheard the thought and said  i would have done it but for his wife who has not offended me she is coming to him presently from their native land portugal she is well but has not long to live and has been yearning to see him and persuade him to go back with her next year she will die without knowing he cant leave that place  he wont tell her  he he will not trust that secret with any one he will reflect that it could be revealed in sleep in the hearing of some portuguese guests servant some time or other  did none of those natives understand what you said to him  none of them understood but he will always be afraid that some of them did that fear will be torture to him for he has been a harsh master to them in his dreams he will imagine them chopping his tree down that will make his days uncomfortablei have already arranged for his nights  it grieved me though not sharply to see him take such a malicious satisfaction in his plans for this foreigner  does he believe what you told him satan  he thought he didnt but our vanishing helped the tree where there had been no tree beforethat helped the insane and uncanny variety of fruitsthe sudden witheringall these things are helps let him think as he may reason as he may one thing is certain he will water the tree but between this and night he will begin his changed career with a very natural precautionfor him  what is that  he will fetch a priest to cast out the trees devil you are such a humorous raceand dont suspect it  will he tell the priest  no he will say a juggler from bombay created it and that he wants the jugglers devil driven out of it so that it will thrive and be fruitful again the priests incantations will fail then the portuguese will give up that scheme and get his wateringpot ready  but the priest will burn the tree i know it he will not allow it to remain  yes and anywhere in europe he would burn the man too but in india the people are civilized and these things will not happen the man will drive the priest away and take care of the tree  i reflected a little then said satan you have given him a hard life i think  comparatively it must not be mistaken for a holiday  we flitted from place to place around the world as we had done before satan showing me a hundred wonders most of them reflecting in some way the weakness and triviality of our race he did this now every few daysnot out of malicei am sure of thatit only seemed to amuse and interest him just as a naturalist might be amused and interested by a collection of ants   chapter 11  for as much as a year satan continued these visits but at last he came less often and then for a long time he did not come at all this always made me lonely and melancholy i felt that he was losing interest in our tiny world and might at any time abandon his visits entirely when one day he finally came to me i was overjoyed but only for a little while he had come to say goodby he told me and for the last time he had investigations and undertakings in other corners of the universe he said that would keep him busy for a longer period than i could wait for his return  and you are going away and will not come back any more  yes he said we have comraded long together and it has been pleasantpleasant for both but i must go now and we shall not see each other any more  in this life satan but in another we shall meet in another surely  then all tranquilly and soberly he made the strange answer there is no other  a subtle influence blew upon my spirit from his bringing with it a vague dim but blessed and hopeful feeling that the incredible words might be trueeven must be true  have you never suspected this theodor  no how could i but if it can only be true  it is true  a gust of thankfulness rose in my breast but a doubt checked it before it could issue in words and i said butbutwe have seen that future lifeseen it in its actuality and so  it was a visionit had no existence  i could hardly breathe for the great hope that was struggling in me a visiona vi  life itself is only a vision a dream  it was electrical by god i had had that very thought a thousand times in my musings  nothing exists all is a dream godmanthe worldthe sun the moon the wilderness of starsa dream all a dream they have no existence nothing exists save empty spaceand you  i  and you are not youyou have no body no blood no bones you are but a thought i myself have no existence i am but a dreamyour dream creature of your imagination in a moment you will have realized this then you will banish me from your visions and i shall dissolve into the nothingness out of which you made me  i am perishing alreadyi am failingi am passing away in a little while you will be alone in shoreless space to wander its limitless solitudes without friend or comrade foreverfor you will remain a thought the only existent thought and by your nature inextinguishable indestructible but i your poor servant have revealed you to yourself and set you free dream other dreams and better  strange that you should not have suspected years agocenturies ages eons agofor you have existed companionless through all the eternities strange indeed that you should not have suspected that your universe and its contents were only dreams visions fiction strange because they are so frankly and hysterically insanelike all dreams a god who could make good children as easily as bad yet preferred to make bad ones who could have made every one of them happy yet never made a single happy one who made them prize their bitter life yet stingily cut it short who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned yet required his other children to earn it who gave his angels painless lives yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body who mouths justice and invented hellmouths mercy and invented hellmouths golden rules and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven and invented hell who mouths morals to other people and has none himself who frowns upon crimes yet commits them all who created man without invitation then tries to shuffle the responsibility for mans acts upon man instead of honorably placing it where it belongs upon himself and finally with altogether divine obtuseness invites this poor abused slave to worship him  you perceive now that these things are all impossible except in a dream you perceive that they are pure and puerile insanities the silly creations of an imagination that is not conscious of its freaksin a word that they are a dream and you the maker of it the dreammarks are all present you should have recognized them earlier  it is true that which i have revealed to you there is no god no universe no human race no earthly life no heaven no hell it is all a dreama grotesque and foolish dream nothing exists but you and you are but a thoughta vagrant thought a useless thought a homeless thought wandering forlorn among the empty eternities  he vanished and left me appalled for i knew and realized that all he had said was true      a fable  once upon a time an artist who had painted a small and very beautiful picture placed it so that he could see it in the mirror he said this doubles the distance and softens it and it is twice as lovely as it was before  the animals out in the woods heard of this through the housecat who was greatly admired by them because he was so learned and so refined and civilized and so polite and highbred and could tell them so much which they didnt know before and were not certain about afterward they were much excited about this new piece of gossip and they asked questions so as to get at a full understanding of it they asked what a picture was and the cat explained  it is a flat thing he said wonderfully flat marvelously flat enchantingly flat and elegant and oh so beautiful  that excited them almost to a frenzy and they said they would give the world to see it then the bear asked  what is it that makes it so beautiful  it is the looks of it said the cat  this filled them with admiration and uncertainty and they were more excited than ever then the cow asked  what is a mirror  it is a hole in the wall said the cat you look in it and there you see the picture and it is so dainty and charming and ethereal and inspiring in its unimaginable beauty that your head turns round and round and you almost swoon with ecstasy  the ass had not said anything as yet he now began to throw doubts he said there had never been anything as beautiful as this before and probably wasnt now he said that when it took a whole basketful of sesquipedalian adjectives to whoop up a thing of beauty it was time for suspicion  it was easy to see that these doubts were having an effect upon the animals so the cat went off offended the subject was dropped for a couple of days but in the meantime curiosity was taking a fresh start aid there was a revival of interest perceptible then the animals assailed the ass for spoiling what could possibly have been a pleasure to them on a mere suspicion that the picture was not beautiful without any evidence that such was the case the ass was not troubled he was calm and said there was one way to find out who was in the right himself or the cat he would go and look in that hole and come back and tell what he found there the animals felt relieved and grateful and asked him to go at oncewhich he did  but he did not know where he ought to stand and so through error he stood between the picture and the mirror the result was that the picture had no chance and didnt show up he returned home and said  the cat lied there was nothing in that hole but an ass there wasnt a sign of a flat thing visible it was a handsome ass and friendly but just an ass and nothing more  the elephant asked  did you see it good and clear were you close to it  i saw it good and clear o hathi king of beasts i was so close that i touched noses with it  this is very strange said the elephant the cat was always truthful beforeas far as we could make out let another witness try go baloo look in the hole and come and report  so the bear went when he came back he said  both the cat and the ass have lied there was nothing in the hole but a bear  great was the surprise and puzzlement of the animals each was now anxious to make the test himself and get at the straight truth the elephant sent them one at a time  first the cow she found nothing in the hole but a cow  the tiger found nothing in it but a tiger  the lion found nothing in it but a lion  the leopard found nothing in it but a leopard  the camel found a camel and nothing more  then hathi was wroth and said he would have the truth if he had to go and fetch it himself when he returned he abused his whole subjectry for liars and was in an unappeasable fury with the moral and mental blindness of the cat he said that anybody but a nearsighted fool could see that there was nothing in the hole but an elephant                              moral by the cat  you can find in a text whatever you bring if you will stand between it and the mirror of your imagination you may not see your ears but they will be there       hunting the deceitful turkey  when i was a boy my uncle and his big boys hunted with the rifle the youngest boy fred and i with a shotguna small singlebarrelled shotgun which was properly suited to our size and strength it was not much heavier than a broom we carried it turn about half an hour at a time i was not able to hit anything with it but i liked to try fred and i hunted feathered small game the others hunted deer squirrels wild turkeys and such things my uncle and the big boys were good shots they killed hawks and wild geese and such like on the wing and they didnt wound or kill squirrels they stunned them when the dogs treed a squirrel the squirrel would scamper aloft and run out on a limb and flatten himself along it hoping to make himself invisible in that wayand not quite succeeding you could see his wee little ears sticking up you couldnt see his nose but you knew where it was then the hunter despising a rest for his rifle stood up and took offhand aim at the limb and sent a bullet into it immediately under the squirrels nose and down tumbled the animal unwounded but unconscious the dogs gave him a shake and he was dead sometimes when the distance was great and the wind not accurately allowed for the bullet would hit the squirrels head the dogs could do as they pleased with that onethe hunters pride was hurt and he wouldnt allow it to go into the gamebag  in the first faint gray of the dawn the stately wild turkeys would be stalking around in great flocks and ready to be sociable and answer invitations to come and converse with other excursionists of their kind the hunter concealed himself and imitated the turkeycall by sucking the air through the legbone of a turkey which had previously answered a call like that and lived only just long enough to regret it there is nothing that furnishes a perfect turkeycall except that bone another of natures treacheries you see she is full of them half the time she doesnt know which she likes bestto betray her child or protect it in the case of the turkey she is badly mixed she gives it a bone to be used in getting it into trouble and she also furnishes it with a trick for getting itself out of the trouble again when a mammaturkey answers an invitation and finds she has made a mistake in accepting it she does as the mammapartridge doesremembers a previous engagementand goes limping and scrambling away pretending to be very lame and at the same time she is saying to her notvisible children lie low keep still dont expose yourselves i shall be back as soon as i have beguiled this shabby swindler out of the country  when a person is ignorant and confiding this immoral device can have tiresome results i followed an ostensibly lame turkey over a considerable part of the united states one morning because i believed in her and could not think she would deceive a mere boy and one who was trusting her and considering her honest i had the singlebarrelled shotgun but my idea was to catch her alive i often got within rushing distance of her and then made my rush but always just as i made my final plunge and put my hand down where her back had been it wasnt there it was only two or three inches from there and i brushed the tailfeathers as i landed on my stomacha very close call but still not quite close enough that is not close enough for success but just close enough to convince me that i could do it next time she always waited for me a little piece away and let on to be resting and greatly fatigued which was a lie but i believed it for i still thought her honest long after i ought to have begun to doubt her suspecting that this was no way for a highminded bird to be acting i followed and followed and followed making my periodical rushes and getting up and brushing the dust off and resuming the voyage with patient confidence indeed with a confidence which grew for i could see by the change of climate and vegetation that we were getting up into the high latitudes and as she always looked a little tireder and a little more discouraged after each rush i judged that i was safe to win in the end the competition being purely a matter of staying power and the advantage lying with me from the start because she was lame  along in the afternoon i began to feel fatigued myself neither of us had had any rest since we first started on the excursion which was upwards of ten hours before though latterly we had paused awhile after rushes i letting on to be thinking about something else but neither of us sincere and both of us waiting for the other to call game but in no real hurry about it for indeed those little evanescent snatches of rest were very grateful to the feelings of us both it would naturally be so skirmishing along like that ever since dawn and not a bite in the meantime at least for me though sometimes as she lay on her side fanning herself with a wing and praying for strength to get out of this difficulty a grasshopper happened along whose time had come and that was well for her and fortunate but i had nothingnothing the whole day  more than once after i was very tired i gave up taking her alive and was going to shoot her but i never did it although it was my right for i did not believe i could hit her and besides she always stopped and posed when i raised the gun and this made me suspicious that she knew about me and my marksmanship and so i did not care to expose myself to remarks  i did not get her at all when she got tired of the game at last she rose from almost under my hand and flew aloft with the rush and whir of a shell and lit on the highest limb of a great tree and sat down and crossed her legs and smiled down at me and seemed gratified to see me so astonished  i was ashamed and also lost and it was while wandering the woods hunting for myself that i found a deserted log cabin and had one of the best meals there that in my lifedays i have eaten the weedgrown garden was full of ripe tomatoes and i ate them ravenously though i had never liked them before not more than two or three times since have i tasted anything that was so delicious as those tomatoes i surfeited myself with them and did not taste another one until i was in middle life i can eat them now but i do not like the look of them i suppose we have all experienced a surfeit at one time or another once in stress of circumstances i ate part of a barrel of sardines there being nothing else at hand but since then i have always been able to get along without sardines       the mcwilliamses and the burglar alarm  the conversation drifted smoothly and pleasantly along from weather to crops from crops to literature from literature to scandal from scandal to religion then took a random jump and landed on the subject of burglar alarms and now for the first time mr mcwilliams showed feeling whenever i perceive this sign on this mans dial i comprehend it and lapse into silence and give him opportunity to unload his heart said he with but illcontrolled emotion  i do not go one single cent on burglar alarms mr twainnot a single centand i will tell you why when we were finishing our house we found we had a little cash left over on account of the plumber not knowing it i was for enlightening the heathen with it for i was always unaccountably down on the heathen somehow but mrs mcwilliams said no lets have a burglar alarm i agreed to this compromise i will explain that whenever i want a thing and mrs mcwilliams wants another thing and we decide upon the thing that mrs mcwilliams wantsas we always doshe calls that a compromise very well the man came up from new york and put in the alarm and charged three hundred and twentyfive dollars for it and said we could sleep without uneasiness now so we did for awhilesay a month then one night we smelled smoke and i was advised to get up and see what the matter was i lit a candle and started toward the stairs and met a burglar coming out of a room with a basket of tinware which he had mistaken for solid silver in the dark he was smoking a pipe i said my friend we do not allow smoking in this room he said he was a stranger and could not be expected to know the rules of the house said he had been in many houses just as good as this one and it had never been objected to before he added that as far as his experience went such rules had never been considered to apply to burglars anyway  i said smoke along then if it is the custom though i think that the conceding of a privilege to a burglar which is denied to a bishop is a conspicuous sign of the looseness of the times but waiving all that what business have you to be entering this house in this furtive and clandestine way without ringing the burglar alarm  he looked confused and ashamed and said with embarrassment i beg a thousand pardons i did not know you had a burglar alarm else i would have rung it i beg you will not mention it where my parents may hear of it for they are old and feeble and such a seemingly wanton breach of the hallowed conventionalities of our christian civilization might all too rudely sunder the frail bridge which hangs darkling between the pale and evanescent present and the solemn great deeps of the eternities may i trouble you for a match  i said your sentiments do you honor but if you will allow me to say it metaphor is not your best hold spare your thigh this kind light only on the box and seldom there in fact if my experience may be trusted but to return to business how did you get in here  through a secondstory window  it was even so i redeemed the tinware at pawnbrokers rates less cost of advertising bade the burglar goodnight closed the window after him and retired to headquarters to report next morning we sent for the burglaralarm man and he came up and explained that the reason the alarm did not go off was that no part of the house but the first floor was attached to the alarm this was simply idiotic one might as well have no armor on at all in battle as to have it only on his legs the expert now put the whole second story on the alarm charged three hundred dollars for it and went his way by and by one night i found a burglar in the third story about to start down a ladder with a lot of miscellaneous property my first impulse was to crack his head with a billiard cue but my second was to refrain from this attention because he was between me and the cue rack the second impulse was plainly the soundest so i refrained and proceeded to compromise i redeemed the property at former rates after deducting ten per cent for use of ladder it being my ladder and next day we sent down for the expert once more and had the third story attached to the alarm for three hundred dollars  by this time the annunciator had grown to formidable dimensions it had fortyseven tags on it marked with the names of the various rooms and chimneys and it occupied the space of an ordinary wardrobe the gong was the size of a washbowl and was placed above the head of our bed there was a wire from the house to the coachmans quarters in the stable and a noble gong alongside his pillow  we should have been comfortable now but for one defect every morning at five the cook opened the kitchen door in the way of business and rip went that gong the first time this happened i thought the last day was come sure i didnt think it in bedno but out of itfor the first effect of that frightful gong is to hurl you across the house and slam you against the wall and then curl you up and squirm you like a spider on a stove lid till somebody shuts the kitchen door in solid fact there is no clamor that is even remotely comparable to the dire clamor which that gong makes well this catastrophe happened every morning regularly at five oclock and lost us three hours sleep for mind you when that thing wakes you it doesnt merely wake you in spots it wakes you all over conscience and all and you are good for eighteen hours of wideawakeness subsequentlyeighteen hours of the very most inconceivable wideawakeness that you ever experienced in your life a stranger died on our hands one time aid we vacated and left him in our room overnight did that stranger wait for the general judgment no sir he got up at five the next morning in the most prompt and unostentatious way i knew he would i knew it mighty well he collected his lifeinsurance and lived happy ever after for there was plenty of proof as to the perfect squareness of his death  well we were gradually fading toward a better land on account of the daily loss of sleep so we finally had the expert up again and he ran a wire to the outside of the door and placed a switch there whereby thomas the butler always made one little mistakehe switched the alarm off at night when he went to bed and switched it on again at daybreak in the morning just in time for the cook to open the kitchen door and enable that gong to slam us across the house sometimes breaking a window with one or the other of us at the end of a week we recognized that this switch business was a delusion and a snare we also discovered that a band of burglars had been lodging in the house the whole timenot exactly to steal for there wasnt much left now but to hide from the police for they were hot pressed and they shrewdly judged that the detectives would never think of a tribe of burglars taking sanctuary in a house notoriously protected by the most imposing and elaborate burglar alarm in america  sent down for the expert again and this time he struck a most dazzling ideahe fixed the thing so that opening the kitchen door would take off the alarm it was a noble idea and he charged accordingly but you already foresee the result i switched on the alarm every night at bedtime no longer trusting on thomass frail memory and as soon as the lights were out the burglars walked in at the kitchen door thus taking the alarm off without waiting for the cook to do it in the morning you see how aggravatingly we were situated for months we couldnt have any company not a spare bed in the house all occupied by burglars  finally i got up a cure of my own the expert answered the call and ran another ground wire to the stable and established a switch there so that the coachman could put on and take off the alarm that worked first rate and a season of peace ensued during which we got to inviting company once more and enjoying life  but by and by the irrepressible alarm invented a new kink one winters night we were flung out of bed by the sudden music of that awful gong and when we hobbled to the annunciator turned up the gas and saw the word nursery exposed mrs mcwilliams fainted dead away and i came precious near doing the same thing myself i seized my shotgun and stood timing the coachman whilst that appalling buzzing went on i knew that his gong had flung him out too and that he would be along with his gun as soon as he could jump into his clothes when i judged that the time was ripe i crept to the room next the nursery glanced through the window and saw the dim outline of the coachman in the yard below standing at presentarms and waiting for a chance then i hopped into the nursery and fired and in the same instant the coachman fired at the red flash of my gun both of us were successful i crippled a nurse and he shot off all my back hair we turned up the gas and telephoned for a surgeon there was not a sign of a burglar and no window had been raised one glass was absent but that was where the coachmans charge had come through here was a fine mysterya burglar alarm going off at midnight of its own accord and not a burglar in the neighborhood  the expert answered the usual call and explained that it was a false alarm said it was easily fixed so he overhauled the nursery window charged a remunerative figure for it and departed  what we suffered from false alarms for the next three years no stylographic pen can describe during the next three months i always flew with my gun to the room indicated and the coachman always sallied forth with his battery to support me but there was never anything to shoot atwindows all tight and secure we always sent down for the expert next day and he fixed those particular windows so they would keep quiet a week or so and always remembered to send us a bill about like this            wire 215           nipple  75           two hours labor  150           wax  47           tape  34           screws  15           recharging battery   98           three hours labor  225           string  02           lard   66           ponds extract  125           springs at 50 200           railroad fares 725   at length a perfectly natural thing came aboutafter we had answered three or four hundred false alarmsto wit we stopped answering them yes i simply rose up calmly when slammed across the house by the alarm calmly inspected the annunciator took note of the room indicated and then calmly disconnected that room from the alarm and went back to bed as if nothing had happened moreover i left that room off permanently and did not send for the expert well it goes without saying that in the course of time all the rooms were taken off and the entire machine was out of service  it was at this unprotected time that the heaviest calamity of all happened the burglars walked in one night and carried off the burglar alarm yes sir every hide and hair of it ripped it out tooth and nail springs bells gongs battery and all they took a hundred and fifty miles of copper wire they just cleaned her out bag and baggage and never left us a vestige of her to swear atswear by i mean  we had a time of it to get her back but we accomplished it finally for money the alarm firm said that what we needed now was to have her put in rightwith their new patent springs in the windows to make false alarms impossible and their new patent clock attached to take off and put on the alarm morning and night without human assistance that seemed a good scheme they promised to have the whole thing finished in ten days they began work and we left for the summer they worked a couple of days then they left for the summer after which the burglars moved in and began their summer vacation when we returned in the fall the house was as empty as a beer closet in premises where painters have been at work we refurnished and then sent down to hurry up the expert he came up and finished the job and said now this clock is set to put on the alarm every night at 10 and take it off every morning at 545 all youve got to do is to wind her up every week and then leave her aloneshe will take care of the alarm herself  after that we had a most tranquil season during three months the bill was prodigious of course and i had said i would not pay it until the new machinery had proved itself to be flawless the time stipulated was three months so i paid the bill and the very next day the alarm went to buzzing like ten thousand bee swarms at ten oclock in the morning i turned the hands around twelve hours according to instructions and this took off the alarm but there was another hitch at night and i had to set her ahead twelve hours once more to get her to put the alarm on again that sort of nonsense went on a week or two then the expert came up and put in a new clock he came up every three months during the next three years and put in a new clock but it was always a failure his clocks all had the same perverse defect they would put the alarm on in the daytime and they would not put it on at night and if you forced it on yourself they would take it off again the minute your back was turned  now there is the history of that burglar alarmeverything just as it happened nothing extenuated and naught set down in malice yes sirand when i had slept nine years with burglars and maintained an expensive burglar alarm the whole time for their protection not mine and at my sole costfor not a dd cent could i ever get them to contributei just said to mrs mcwilliams that i had had enough of that kind of pie so with her full consent i took the whole thing out and traded it off for a dog and shot the dog i dont know what you think about it mr twain but i think those things are made solely in the interest of the burglars yes sir a burglar alarm combines in its person all that is objectionable about a fire a riot and a harem and at the same time had none of the compensating advantages of one sort or another that customarily belong with that combination goodby i get off here
