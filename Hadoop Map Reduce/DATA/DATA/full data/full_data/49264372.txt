girl in a blue dress came out of the house and began to walk slowly across the terrace to where elsa keith sat with marvin rossiter in the shade of the big sycamore elsa and marvin had become engaged some few days before and were generally to be found at this time sitting together in some shaded spot in the grounds of the keiths long island home  whats troubling betty i wonder said elsa she looks

whats the matter betty this is marvin i want you to like marvin  betty silver smiled her face in repose was rather wistful but it lighted up when she smiled and an unsuspected dimple came into being on her chin  of course i shall she said  her big gray eyes seemed to search marvins for an instant and marvin had almost subconsciously a comfortable feeling that he had been tested and found worthy  what were you scowling at so ferociously betty asked elsa  was i scowling i hope you didnt think it was at you oh elsa im miserable i shall have to leave this heavenly place  betty  at once and i was meaning to have the most lovely time see what has come  she held out some flimsy sheets of paper  a cable said elsa  great scott it looks like the scenario of a fouract play said marvin thats not all

elsa breathless  by george said marvin he certainly seems to want you badly enough he hasnt spared expense he has put in about everything you could put into a cable  except why he wants me said betty  yes said elsa why does he want you and in such a desperate hurry too  marvin was rereading the message  it isnt a mere invitation he said theres no comerightalongyoulllikethisplaceitsfine about it he seems to look on your company more as a necessity than a luxury its a sort of imperious cqd  thats what makes it so strange we have hardly met for years why he didnt even know where i was the cable was sent to the bank and forwarded on and i dont know where he is  which brings us back said marvin to mysterious mervo let us reason inductively if you get to the place by taking a boat from marseilles it cant be far from the french coast i should say at a venture that mervo is an island in the mediterranean and a small island for if it had been a big one we should have heard of it  marvin cried elsa her face beaming with proud affection how clever you are  a mere gift he said modestly i have been like that from a boy he got up from his chair isnt there an encyclopaedia in the library elsa  yes but its an old edition  it will probably touch on mervo ill go and fetch it  as he crossed the terrace elsa turned quickly to betty  well she said  betty smiled at her  hes a dear are you very happy elsa  elsas eyes danced she drew in her breath softly betty looked at her in silence for a moment the wistful expression was back on her face  elsa she said suddenly what is it like how does it feel knowing that theres someone who is fonder of you than anything  elsa closed her eyes  its like eating berries and cream in a new dress by moonlight on a summer night while somebody plays the violin far away in the distance so that you can just hear it she said  her eyes opened again  and its like coming along on a winter evening and seeing the windows lit up and knowing youve reached home  betty was clenching her hands and breathing quickly  and its like  elsa dont i cant bear it  betty whats the matter  betty smiled again but painfully  its stupid of me im just jealous thats all i havent got a marvin you see you have  well there are plenty who would like to be your marvin  bettys face grew cold  there are plenty who would like to be benjamin scobells soninlaw she said  betty elsas voice was serious weve been friends for a good long time so youll let me say something wont you i think youre getting just the least bit hard now turn and rend me she added goodhumoredly  im not going to rend you said betty youre perfectly right i am getting hard how can i help it do you know how many men have asked me to marry them since i saw you last five  betty  and not one of them cared the slightest bit about me  but betty dear thats just what i mean why should you say that how can you know  how do i know well i do know instinct i suppose the instinct of selfpreservation which nature gives hunted animals i cant think of a single man in the worldexcept your marvin of coursewho wouldnt do anything for money she stopped well yes one  elsa leaned forward eagerly  who betty  you dont know him  but whats his name  betty hesitated  well if i am on the witnessstandmaude  maude i thought you said a man  its his name john maude  but betty why didnt you tell me before this is tremendously interesting  betty laughed shortly  not so very really i only met him two or three times and i havent seen him for years and i dont suppose i shall ever see him again he was a friend of alice beechers brother who was at harvard alice took me over to meet her brother and mr maude was there thats all  elsa was plainly disappointed  but how do you know then what makes you think that he  instinct again i suppose i do know  and youve never met him since  betty shook her head elsa relapsed into silence she had a sense of pathos  at the further end of the terrace marvin rossiter appeared carrying a large volume  here we are he said scared it up at the first attempt now then  he sat down and opened the book  you dont want to hear all about how jason went there in search of the golden fleece and how ulysses is supposed to have taken it in on his roundtrip you want something more modern well its an island in the mediterranean as i said and im surprised that youve never heard of it elsa because its celebrated in its way its the smallest independent state in the world smaller than monaco even here are some facts its population when this encyclopaedia was printedthere may be more nowwas eleven thousand and sixteen it was ruled over up to 1886 by a prince but in that year the populace appear to have said to themselves when in the course of human events anyway they fired the prince and the place is now a republic so thats where youre going miss silver i dont know if its any consolation to you but the island according to this gentleman is celebrated for the unspoilt beauty of its scenery he also gives a list of the fish that can be caught there it takes up about three lines  but what can my stepfather be doing there i last heard of him in london well i suppose i shall have to go  i suppose you will said elsa mournfully but oh betty what a shame     chapter ii  mervo and its owner   by heck cried mr benjamin scobell  he wheeled round from the window and transferred his gaze from the view to his sister marion losing by the action for the view was a joy to the eye which his sister marion was not  mervo was looking its best under the hot morning sun mr scobells villa stood near the summit of the only hill the island possessed and from the window of the morningroom where he had just finished breakfast he had an uninterrupted view of valley town and harbora twomile riot of green gold and white and beyond the white the blue satin of the mediterranean mr scobell did not read poetry except that which advertised certain breakfast foods in which he was interested or he might have been reminded of the island of flowers in tennysons voyage of maeldive violets pinks crocuses yellow and purple mesembryanthemum lavender myrtle and rosemary  his twomile view contained them all the hillside below him was all aglow with the yellow fire of the mimosa but his was not one of those emotional natures to which the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears a primrose by the rivers brim a simple primrose was to himor not so much a simple primrose perhaps as a basis for a possible primrosina the soap that really cleans you  he was a nasty little man to hold despotic sway over such a paradise a goblin in fairyland somewhat below the middle height he was lean of body and vulturine of face he had a greedy mouth a hooked nose liquid green eyes and a sallow complexion he was rarely seen without a halfsmoked cigar between his lips this at intervals he would relight only to allow it to go out again and when after numerous fresh starts it had dwindled beyond the limits of convenience he would substitute another from the reserve supply that protruded from his vestpocket                                       how benjamin scobell had discovered the existence of mervo is not known it lay well outside the sphere of the ordinary financier but mr scobell took a pride in the versatility of his finance it distinguished him from the uninspired who were content to concentrate themselves on steel wheat and suchlike things it was mr scobells way to consider nothing as lying outside his sphere in a financial sense he might have taken terences nihil humanum alienum as his motto he was interested in innumerable enterprises great and small he was the power behind a company which was endeavoring without much success to extract gold from the mountains of north wales and another which was trying without any success at all to do the same by sea water he owned a model farm in indiana and a weekly paper in new york he had financed patent medicines patent foods patent corks patent corkscrews patent devices of all kinds some profitable some the reverse  alsooutside the ordinary gains of financehe had expectations he was the only male relative of his aunt the celebrated mrs jane oakley who lived in a cottage on staten island and was reputed to spend five hundred dollars a yearsome said lessout of her snug income of eighteen million she was an unusual old lady in many ways and unfortunately unusually full of deeprooted prejudices the fear lest he might inadvertently fall foul of these rarely ceased to haunt mr scobell  this man of many projects had descended upon mervo like a stone on the surface of some quiet pool bubbling over with modern enterprise in general and in particular with a scheme before his arrival mervo had been an island of dreams and slow movement and putting things off till tomorrow the only really energetic thing it had ever done in its whole history had been to expel his late highness prince charles and change itself into a republic and even that had been done with the minimum of fuss the prince was away at the time indeed he had been away for nearly three years the pleasures of paris london and vienna appealing to him more keenly than life among his subjects mervo having thought the matter over during these years decided that it had no further use for prince charles quite quietly with none of that vulgar brawling which its neighbor france had found necessary in similar circumstances it had struck his name off the payroll and declared itself a republic the royalist party headed by general poineau had been distracted but impotent the army one hundred and fifteen strong had gone solid for the new regime and that had settled it mervo had then gone to sleep again it was asleep when mr scobell found it  the financiers scheme was first revealed to m dorby the president of the republic a large stout statesman with even more than the average mervian instinct for slumber he was asleep in a chair on the porch of his villa when mr scobell paid his call and it was not until the financiers secretary who attended the seance in the capacity of interpreter had rocked him vigorously from side to side for quite a minute that he displayed any signs of animation beyond a snore like the growling of distant thunder when at length he opened his eyes he perceived the nightmarelike form of mr scobell standing before him talking the financier impatient of delay had begun to talk some moments before the great awakening  sir mr scobell was saying i gotta proposition to which id like you to give your complete attention shake him some more crump sir theres big money in it for all of us if you and your crowdll sit in money lar monnay no that means change whats money crump arjong theres arjong in it squire get that oh shucks hand it to him in french crump  mr secretary crump translated the president blinked and intimated that he would hear more mr scobell relighted his cigarstump and proceeded  say youve heard of moosieer blonk ask the old skeesicks if hes ever heard of mersyaw blonk crump the feller who started the gamingtables at monte carlo  filtered through mr crump the question became intelligible to the president he said he had heard of m blanc mr crump caught the reply and sent it on to mr scobell as the man on first base catches the ball and throws it to second  mr scobell relighted his cigar  well im in that line im going to put this island on the map just like old doctor blonk put monte carlo ive been studying up all about the old man and i know just what he did and how he did it monte carlo was just such another jerkwater little place as this is before he hit it the government was down to its last bean and wondering where the heck its next mealticket was coming from when in blows mr man tucks up his shirtsleeves and starts the tables and after that the place never looked back you and your crowd gotta get together and pass a vote to give me a gambling concession here same as they did him scobells my name hand him that crump  mr crump obliged once more a gleam of intelligence came into the presidents dull eye he nodded once or twice he talked volubly in french to mr crump who responded in the same tongue  the idea seems to strike him sir said mr crump  it ought to if he isnt a clam replied mr scobell he started to relight his cigar but after scorching the tip of his nose bowed to the inevitable and threw the relic away  see here he said having bitten the end off the next in order ive thought this thing out from soup to nuts theres heaps of room for another monte carlo montes a dandy place but its not perfect by a long way to start with its hilly you have to take the elevator to get to the casino and when youve gotten to the end of your roll and want to soak your pearl pin wheres the hockshop half a mile away up the side of a mountain it aint right in my casino theres going to be a resident pawnbroker inside the building just off the main entrance thats only one of a heap of improvements another is that my casinos scheduled to be a home from home a place you can be real cosy in youll look around you and the only thing youll miss will be mothers face yes sir theres no need for a gambling casino to look and feel and smell like the readingroom at the british museum comfort coziness and convenience thats the ticket im running on slip that to the old gink crump  a further outburst of the french language from mr crump supplemented on the part of the old gink by gesticulations interrupted the proceedings  whats he saying now asked mr scobell  he wants to know  dont tell let me guess he wants to know what sort of a rakeoff he and the other somnambulists will getthe darned old pirate is that it  mr crump said that that was just it  thatll be all right said mr scobell old man blongs offer to the prince of monaco was five hundred thousand francs a yearthats somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars in real moneyand half the profits made by the casino thats my offer too see how that hits him crump  mr crump investigated  he says he accepts gladly on behalf of the republic sir he announced  m dorby confirmed the statement by rising dodging the cigar and kissing mr scobell on both cheeks  cut it out said the financier austerely breaking out of the clinch well take the apache dance as read goodby squire glad its settled now i can get busy  he did workmen poured into mervo and in a very short time dominating the town and reducing to insignificance the palace of the late prince once a passably imposing mansion there rose beside the harbor a mammoth casino of shining stone  imposing as was the exterior it was on the interior that mr scobell more particularly prided himself and not without reason certainly a man with money to lose could lose it here under the most charming conditions it had been mr scobells object to avoid the cheerless grandeur of the rival institution down the coast instead of one large hall sprinkled with tables each table had a room to itself separated from its neighbor by soundproof foldingdoors and as the building progressed mr scobells active mind had soared above the original idea of domestic coziness to far greater heights of ingenuity each of the rooms was furnished and arranged in a different style the note of individuality extended even to the croupiers thus a man with money at his command could wander from the dutch room where in the picturesque surroundings of a dutch kitchen croupiers in the costume of holland ministered to his needs to the japanese room where his coin would be raked in by quite passable imitations of the samurai if he had any left at this point he was free to dispose of it under the auspices of nearhindoos in the indian room of merry swiss peasants in the swiss room or in other appropriately furnished apartments of redshirted bret harte miners furclad esquimaux or languorous spaniards he could then if a man of spirit who did not know when he was beaten collect the family jewels and proceed down the main hall accompanied by the strains of an excellent band to the office of a gentlemanly pawnbroker who spoke seven languages like a native and was prepared to advance money on reasonable security in all of them  it was a colossal venture but it suffered from the defect from which most big things suffer it moved slowly that it also moved steadily was to some extent a consolation to mr scobell undoubtedly it would progress quicker and quicker as time went on until at length the casino became a permanent gold mine but at present it was being conducted at a loss it was inevitable but it irked mr scobell he paced the island and brooded his mind dwelt incessantly on the problem ideas for promoting the prosperity of his nursling came to him at all hoursat meals in the night watches when he was shaving walking washing reading brushing his hair  and now one had come to him as he stood looking at the view from the window of his morningroom listening absently to his sister marion as she read stray items of interest from the columns of the new york herald and had caused him to utter the exclamation recorded at the beginning of the chapter                                       by heck he said read that again marion i gottan idea  miss scobell deep in her paper paid no attention few people would have taken her for the sister of the financier she was his exact opposite in almost every way he was small jerky and aggressive she tall deliberate and negative she was one of those women whom nature seems to have produced with the object of attaching them to some man in a peculiar position of independent dependence and who defy the imagination to picture them in any other condition whatsoever one could not see miss scobell doing anything but pour out her brothers coffee darn his socks and sit placidly by while he talked yet it would have been untrue to describe her as dependent upon him she had a detached mind though her whole life had been devoted to his comfort and though she admired him intensely she never appeared to give his conversation any real attention she listened to him much as she would have listened to a barking pomeranian  marion cried mr scobell  a fivelegged rabbit has been born in carbondale southern illinois she announced  mr scobell cursed the fivelegged rabbit  never mind about your rabbits i want to hear that piece you read before the one about the prince of monaco willyoulisten marion  the prince of monaco dear yes he has caught another fish or something of that sort i think yes a fish with telescope eyes the paper says and very convenient too i should imagine  mr scobell thumped the table  ive got it ive found out whats the matter with this darned place i see why the casino hasnt struck its gait  i think it must be the croupiers dear im sure i never heard of croupiers in fancy costume before it doesnt seem right im sure people dont like those nasty hindoos i am quite nervous myself when i go into the indian room they look at me so oddly  nonsense thats the whole idea of the place that it should be different people are sick and tired of having their money gathered in by seedylooking dagoes in secondhand morning coats we give em variety its not the casino thats wrong its the darned island whats the use of a republic to a place like this im not saying that you dont want a republic for a live country thats got its way to make in the world but for a little runt of a sawnoff hobo onenight stand like this you gotta have something picturesque something thatll advertise the place something thatll give a jolt to folks curiosity and make em talk theres this monaco gook he snoops around in his yacht digging up telescopeeyed fish and people talk about it another darned fish they say thats the steenth bite the prince of monaco has had this year its like a soap advertisement it works by suggestion they get to thinking about the prince and his popeyed fishes and first thing they know theyve packed their grips and come along to monaco to have a peek at him and when theyre there its a safe bet they arent going back again without trying to get a mess of easy money from the bank thats what this place wants whoever heard of this blamed republic doing anything except eat and sleep they used to have a prince here way back in eightysomething well im going to have him working at the old stand again right away  miss scobell looked up from her paper which she had been reading with absorbed interest throughout tins harangue  dear she said enquiringly  i say im going to have him back again said mr scobell a little damped i wish you would listen  i think youre quite right dear who  the prince do listen marion the prince of this island his highness the prince of mervo im going to send for him and put him on the throne again  you cant dear hes dead  i know hes dead you cant faze me on the history of this place he died in ninetyone but before he died he married an american girl and theres a son whos in america now living with his uncle its the son im going to send for i got it all from general poineau hes a royalist hell be tickled to pieces when johnny comes marching home again old man poineau told me all about it the prince married a girl called westley and then he was killed in an automobile accident and his widow went back to america with the kid to live with her brother poineau says he could lay his hand on him any time he pleased  i hope you wont do anything rash dear said his sister comfortably im sure we dont want any horrid revolution here with people shooting and stabbing each other  revolution cried mr scobell revolution well i should say nix revolution nothing im the man with the big stick in mervo pretty near every adult on this island is dependent on my casino for his weekly envelope and what i say goeswithout argument i want a prince so i gotta have a prince and if any gazook makes a noise like a man with a grouch hell find himself fired  miss scobell turned to her paper again  very well dear she said just as you please im sure you know best  sure said her brother youre a good guesser ill go and beat up old man poineau right away     chapter iii  john   ten days after mr scobells visit to general poineau john prince of mervo ignorant of the greatness so soon to be thrust upon him was strolling thoughtfully along one of the main thoroughfares of that outpost of civilization jersey city he was a big young man tall and large of limb his shoulders especially were of the massive type expressly designed by nature for driving wide gaps in the opposing line on the gridiron he looked like one of natures centerrushes and had indeed played in that position for harvard during two strenuous seasons his face wore an expression of invincible goodhumor he had a wide goodnatured mouth and a pair of friendly gray eyes one felt that he liked his follow men and would be surprised and pained if they did not like him  as he passed along the street he looked a little anxious sherlock holmesand possibly even doctor watsonwould have deduced that he had something on his conscience  at the entrance to a large office building he paused and seemed to hesitate then as if he had made up his mind to face an ordeal he went in and pressed the button of the elevator  leaving the elevator at the third floor he went down the passage and pushed open a door on which was inscribed the legend westley martin  co  a stout youth walking across the office with his hands full of papers stopped in astonishment  hello john maude he cried  the young man grinned  say where have you been the old mans been as mad as a hornet since he found you had quit without leave he was asking for you just now  i guess im up against it admitted john cheerfully  where did you go yesterday  john put the thing to him candidly as man to man  see here spiller suppose you got up one day and found it was a perfectly bully morning and remembered that the giants were playing the athletics and looked at your mail and saw that someone had sent you a pass for the game  were you at the ballgame youve got the nerve didnt you know there would be trouble  old man said john frankly i could no more have turned down that pass oh well whats the use it was just great i suppose id better tackle the boss now its got to be done  it was not a task to which many would have looked forward most of those who came into contact with andrew westley were afraid of him he was a capable rather than a lovable man and too selfcontrolled to be quite human there was no recoil in him no reaction after anger as there would have been in a hottertempered man he thought before he acted but when he acted never yielded a step  john in all the years of their connection had never been able to make anything of him at first he had been prepared to like him as he liked nearly everybody but mr westley had discouraged all advances and as time went by his nephew had come to look on him as something apart from the rest of the world one of those things which no fellow could understand  on mr westleys side there was something to be said in extenuation of his attitude john reminded him of his father and he had hated the late prince of mervo with a cold hatred that had for a time been the ruling passion of his life he had loved his sister and her married life had been one long torture to him a torture rendered keener by the fact that he was powerless to protect either her happiness or her money her money was her own to use as she pleased and the use which pleased her most was to give it to her husband who could always find a way of spending it as to her happiness that was equally out of his control it was bound up in her prince who unfortunately was a bad custodian for it at last an automobile accident put an end to his highnesss hectic career and incidentally to that of a blonde lady from the folies bergeres and the princess had returned to her brothers home where a year later she died leaving him in charge of her infant son  mr westleys desire from the first had been to eliminate as far as possible all memory of the late prince he gave john his sisters name maude and brought him up as an american in total ignorance of his fathers identity during all the years they had spent together he had never mentioned the princes name  he disliked john intensely he fed him clothed him sent him to college and gave him a place in his office but he never for a moment relaxed his bleakness of front toward him john was not unlike his father in appearance though built on a larger scale and as time went on little mannerisms too began to show themselves that reminded mr westley of the dead man and killed any beginnings of affection  john for his part had the philosophy which goes with perfect health he fitted his uncle into the scheme of things or rather set him outside them as an irreconcilable element and went on his way enjoying life in his own goodhumored fashion  it was only lately since he had joined the firm that he had been conscious of any great strain college had given him a glimpse of a larger life and the office cramped him he felt vaguely that there were bigger things in the world which he might be doing his best friends of whom he now saw little were all men of adventure and enterprise who had tried their hand at many things men like jimmy pitt who had done nearly everything that could be done before coming into an unexpected halfmillion men like rupert smith who had been at harvard with him and was now a reporter on the news men like baker faraday williamshe could name halfadozen all men who were doing something who were out on the firing line  he was not a man who worried he had not that temperament but sometimes he would wonder in rather a vague way whether he was not allowing life to slip by him a little too placidly an occasional yearning for something larger would attack him there seemed to be something in him that made for inaction his soul was sleepy  if he had been told of the identity of his father it is possible that he might have understood the princes of mervo had never taken readily to action and enterprise for generations back if they had varied at all son from father it had been in the color of hair or eyes not in charactera weak shiftless procession with nothing to distinguish them from the common run of men except good looks and a talent for wasting money  john was the first of the line who had in him the seeds of better things the westley blood and the bracing nature of his education had done much to counteract the mervo strain he did not know it but the american in him was winning the desire for action was growing steadily every day  it had been mervo that had sent him to the polo grounds on the previous day that impulse had been purely mervian no prince of that island had ever resisted a temptation but it was america that was sending him now to meet his uncle with a quiet unconcern as to the outcome of the interview the spirit of adventure was in him it was more than possible that mr westley would sink the uncle in the employer and dismiss him as summarily as he would have dismissed any other clerk in similar circumstances if so he was prepared to welcome dismissal other men fought an unsheltered fight with the world so why not he  he moved towards the door of the inner office with a certain exhilaration  as he approached it flew open disclosing mr westley himself a tall thin man at the sight of whom spiller shot into his seat like a rabbit  john went to meet him  ah said mr westley come in here i want to speak to you  john followed him into the room  sit down said his uncle  john waited while he dictated a letter neither spoke till the stenographer had left the room john met the girls eye as she passed there was a compassionate look in it john was popular with his fellow employes his absence had been the cause of discussion and speculation among them and the general verdict had been that there would be troublous times for him on the morrow  when the door closed mr westley leaned back in his chair and regarded his nephew steadily from under a pair of bushy gray eyebrows which lent a sort of hypnotic keenness to his gaze  you were at the ballgame yesterday he said  the unexpectedness of the question startled john into a sharp laugh  yes he said recovering himself  without leave  it didnt seem worth while asking for leave  you mean that you relied so implicitly on our relationship to save you from the consequences  no i meant  well we need not try and discover what you may have meant what claim do you put forward for special consideration why should i treat you differently from any other member of the staff  john had a feeling that the interview was being taken at too rapid a pace he felt confused  i dont want you to treat me differently he said  mr westley did not reply john saw that he had taken a checkbook from its pigeonhole  i think we understand each other said mr westley there is no need for any discussion i am writing you a check for ten thousand dollars  ten thousand dollars  it happens to be your own it was left to me in trust for you by your mother by a miracle your father did not happen to spend it  john caught the bitter note which the other could not keep out of his voice and made one last attempt to probe this mystery as a boy he had tried more than once before he realized that this was a forbidden topic  who was my father he said  mr westley blotted the check carefully  quite the worst blackguard i ever had the misfortune to know he replied in an even tone will you kindly give me a receipt for this then i need not detain you you may return to the ballgame without any further delay possibly he went on you may wonder why you have not received this money before i persuaded your mother to let me use my discretion in choosing the time when it should be handed over to you i decided to wait until in my opinion you had sense enough to use it properly i do not think that time has arrived i do not think it will ever arrive but as we are parting company and shall i hope never meet again you had better have it now  john signed the receipt in silence  thank you said mr westley goodby  at the door john hesitated he had looked forward to this moment as one of excitement and adventure but now that it had come it had left him in anything but an uplifted mood he was naturally warmhearted and his uncles cold anger hurt him it was so different from anything sudden so essentially not of the moment he felt instinctively that it had been smoldering for a long time and realized with a shock that his uncle had not been merely indifferent to him all these years but had actually hated him it was as if he had caught a glimpse of something ugly he felt that this was the last scene of some long drawnout tragedy  something made him turn impulsively back towards the desk  uncle he cried  he stopped the hopelessness of attempting any step towards a better understanding overwhelmed him mr westley had begun to write he must have seen johns movement but he continued to write as if he were alone in the room  john turned to the door again  goodby he said  mr westley did not look up     chapter iv  vive le roi   when an hour later john landed in new york from the ferry his mood had changed the sun and the breeze had done their work he looked on life once more with a cheerful and optimistic eye  his first act on landing was to proceed to the office of the news and enquire for rupert smith he felt that he had urgent need of a few minutes conversation with him now that the painter had been definitely cut that bound him to the safe and conventional and he had set out on his own account to lead the life adventurous he was conscious of an absurd diffidence new york looked different to him it made him feel positively shy a pressing need for a friendly native in this strange land manifested itself smith would have ideas and advice to bestowhe was notoriously prolific of bothand in this crisis both were highly necessary  smith however was not at the office he had gone out john was informed earlier in the morning to cover a threatened strike somewhere down on the east side john did not go in search of him the chance of finding him in that maze of mean streets was remote he decided to go uptown select a hotel and lunch to the need for lunch he attributed a certain sinking sensation of which he was becoming more and more aware and which bore much too close a resemblance to dismay to be pleasant the poets statement that the man whos square his chances always are best no circumstance can shoot a scare into the contents of his vest is only true within limits the squarest men deposited suddenly in new york and faced with the prospect of earning his living there is likely to quail for a moment new york is not like other cities london greets the stranger with a sleepy grunt paris giggles new york howls a gladiator waiting in the center of the arena while the colosseum officials fumbled with the bolts of the door behind which paced the noisy tiger he was to fight must have had some of the emotions which john experienced during his first hour as a masterless man in gotham  a surface car carried him up broadway at times square the astor hotel loomed up on the left it looked a pretty good hotel to john he dismounted  half an hour later he decided that he was acclimated he had secured a base of operations in the shape of a room on the seventh floor his check was safely deposited in the hotel bank and he was halfway through a lunch which had caused him already to look on new york not only as the finest city in the world but also on the whole as the one city of all others in which a young man might make a fortune with the maximum of speed and the minimum of effort  after lunch having telegraphed his address to his uncle in case of mail he took the latters excellent advice and went to the polo grounds returning in time to dress he dined at the hotel after which he visited a nearby theater and completed a pleasant and strenuous day at one of those friendly restaurants where the music is continuous and the waiters are apt to burst into song in the intervals of their other duties  a second attempt to find smith next morning failed as the first had done the staff of the news were out of bed and at work ridiculously early and when john called up the office between eleven and twelve oclocknatures breakfasthoursmith was again down east observing the movements of those who were about to strike or who had already struck  it hardly seemed worth while starting to lay the bed plates of his fortune till he had consulted the expert what would rockefeller have done he would john felt certain have gone to the ballgame  he imitated the great financier                                       it was while he was smoking a cigar after dinner that night musing on the fortunes of the days game and in particular on the almost criminal imbecility of the umpire that he was dreamily aware that he was being paged a small boy in uniform was meandering through the room chanting his name  gent wants five minutes wit you announced the boy intercepted hasnt got no card business he says  this disposed of the idea that rupert smith had discovered his retreat john was puzzled he could not think of another person in new york who knew of his presence at the astor but it was the unknown that he was in search of and he decided to see the mysterious stranger  send him along he said  the boy disappeared and presently john observed him threading his way back among the tables followed by a young man of extraordinary gravity of countenance who was looking about him with an intent gaze through a pair of goldrimmed spectacles  john got up to meet him  my name is maude he said wont you sit down have you had dinner  thank you yes said the spectacled young man  youll have a cigar and coffee then  thank you yes  the young man remained silent until the waiter had filled his cup  my name is crump he said i am mr benjamin scobells private secretary  yes said john snug job  the other seemed to miss something in his voice  you have heard of mr scobell he asked  not to my knowledge said john  ah you have lost touch very much with mervo of course  john stared  mervo  it sounded like some patent medicine  i have been instructed said mr crump solemnly to inform your highness that the republic has been dissolved and that your subjects offer you the throne of your ancestors  john leaned back in his chair and looked at the speaker in dumb amazement the thought flashed across him that mr crump had been perfectly correct in saying that he had dined  his attitude appeared to astound mr crump he goggled through his spectacles at john who was reminded of some rare fish  you are john maude you said you were  im john maude right enough were solid on that point  and your mother was the only sister of mr andrew westley  youre right there too  then there is no mistake i say the republic he paused as if struck with an idea dont you know he said your father  john became suddenly interested  if youve got anything to tell me about my father go right ahead youll be the only man ive ever met who has said a word about him who the deuce was he anyway  mr crumps face cleared  i understand i had not expected this you have been kept in ignorance your father mr maude was the late prince charles of mervo  it was not easy to astonish john but this announcement did so he dropped his cigar in a shower of gray ash on to his trousers and retrieved it almost mechanically his wideopen eyes fixed on the others face  what he cried  mr crump nodded gravely  you are prince john of mervo and i am here he got into his stride as he reached the familiar phraseto inform your highness that the republic has been dissolved and that your subjects offer you the throne of your ancestors  a horrid doubt seized john  youre stringing me one of those indians at the news rupert smith or someone has put you up to this  mr crump appeared wounded  if your highness would glance at these documents this is a copy of the register of the church in which your mother and father were married  john glanced at the document it was perfectly lucid  thenthen its true he said  perfectly true your highness and i am here to inform  but where the deuce is mervo i never heard of the place  it is an island principality in the mediterranean your high  for goodness sake old man dont keep calling me your highness it may be fun to you but it makes me feel a perfect ass let me get into the thing gradually  mr crump felt in his pocket  mr scobell he said producing a roll of bills entrusted me with money to defray any expenses  more than any words this spectacle removed any lingering doubt which john might have had as to the possibility of this being some intricate practical joke  are these for me he said  mr crump passed them across to him  there are a thousand dollars here he said i am also instructed to say that you are at liberty to draw further against mr scobells account at the wall street office of the european and asiatic bank  the name scobell had been recurring like a leitmotif in mr crumps conversation this suddenly came home to john  before we go any further he said lets get one thing clear who is this mr scobell how does he get mixed up in this  he is the proprietor of the casino at mervo  he seems to be one of those generous openhanded fellows nothing of the tight wad about him  he is deeply interested in your highin your return  john laid the roll of bills beside his coffee cup and relighted his cigar  thats mighty good of him he said it strikes me old man that i am not absolutely uptodate as regards the internal affairs of this important little kingdom of mine how would it be if you were to put me next to one or two facts start at the beginning and go right on  when mr crump had finished a condensed history of mervo and mervian politics john smoked in silence for some minutes  life crump he said at last is certainly speeding up as far as i am concerned up till now nothing in particular has ever happened to me a couple of days ago i lost my job was given ten thousand dollars that i didnt know existed and now you tell me im a prince well well these are stirring times when do we start for the old homestead  mr scobell was exceedingly anxious that we should return by saturdays boat  saturday what tomorrow  perhaps it is too soon you will not be able to settle your affairs  i guess i can settle my affairs all right ive only got to pack a grip and tip the bell hops and as scobell seems to be financing this show perhaps its up to me to step lively if he wants it but its a pity i was just beginning to like this place there is generally something doing along the white way after twilight crump  the gravity of mr scobells secretary broke up unexpectedly into a slow wide smile his eyes behind their glasses gleamed with a wistful light  gee he murmured  john looked at him amazed  crump he cried crump i believe youre a sport  mr crump seemed completely to have forgotten his responsible position as secretary to a millionaire and special messenger to a prince he smirked  id have liked a day or two in the old burg he said softly i havent been to rectors since ponto was a pup  john reached across the table and seized the secretarys hand  crump he said you are a sport this is no time for delay if we are to liven up this great city we must get busy right away grab your hat and come along one doesnt become a prince every day the occasion wants celebrating are you with me crump old scout  sure thing said the envoy ecstatically                                       at eight oclock on the following morning two young men hatless and a little rumpled but obviously cheerful entered the astor hotel demanding breakfast  a bell boy who met them was addressed by the larger of the two and asked his name  desmond ryan he replied  the young man patted him on his shoulder  i appoint you desmond ryan he said grand hereditary bell hop to the court of mervo  thus did prince john formally enter into his kingdom     chapter v  mr scobell has another idea   owing to collaboration between fate and mr scobell johns state entry into mervo was an interesting blend between a pageant and a vaudeville sketch the pageant idea was mr scobells fate supplied the vaudeville  the reception at the quay when the little steamer that plied between marseilles and the island principality gave up its precious freight was not on quite so impressive a scale as might have been given to the monarch of a more powerful kingdom but john was not disappointed during the voyage from new york in the intervals of seasicknessfor he was a poor sailormr crump had supplied him with certain facts about mervo one of which was that its adult population numbered just under thirteen thousand and this had prepared him for any shortcomings in the way of popular demonstration  as a matter of fact mr scobell was exceedingly pleased with the scale of the reception which to his mind amounted practically to pomp the palace guard forty strong lined the quay besides these there were four officers a band and sixteen mounted carbineers the rest of the army was dotted along the streets in addition to the military there was a gathering of a hundred and fifty civilians mainly drawn from fishing circles the majority of these remained stolidly silent throughout but three more emotional cheered vigorously as a young man was seen to step on to the gangway carrying a grip and make for the shore general poineau a whitehaired warrior with a fierce mustache strode forward and saluted the palace guards presented arms the band struck up the mervian national anthem general poineau lowering his hand put on a pair of pincenez and began to unroll an address of welcome  it was then seen that the young man was mr crump general poineau removed his glasses and gave an impatient twirl to his mustache mr scobell who for possibly the first time in his career was not smoking though as was afterward made manifest he had the materials on his person bustled to the front  wheres his nibs crump he enquired  the secretarys reply was swept away in a flood of melody to the band mr crumps face was strange they had no reason to suppose that he was not prince john and they acted accordingly with a rattle of drums they burst once more into their spirited rendering of the national anthem  mr scobell sawed the air with his arms but was powerless to dam the flood  his highness is shaving sir bawled mr crump depositing his grip on the quay and making a trumpet of his hands  shaving  yes sir i told him he ought to come along but his highness said he wasnt going to land looking like a tramp comedian  by this time general poineau had explained matters to the band and they checked the national anthem abruptly in the middle of a bar with the exception of the cornet player who continued gallantly by himself till a feeling of loneliness brought the truth home to him an awkward stage wait followed which lasted until john was seen crossing the deck when there were more cheers and general poineau resuming his pincenez brought out the address of welcome again  at this point mr scobell made his presence felt  glad to meet you prince he said coming forward scobells my name shake hands with general poineau no thats wrong i guess he kisses your hand dont he  ill swing on him if he does said john cheerfully  mr scobell eyed him doubtfully his highness did not appear to him to be treating the inaugural ceremony with that reserved dignity which we like to see in princes on these occasions mr scobell was a business man he wanted his moneys worth his idea of a prince of mervo was something statuesquely aloof somethinghe could not express it exactlyon the lines of the illustrations in the zenda stories in the magazinesabout eight feet high and shinily magnificent something that would give the place a tone that was what he had had in his mind when he sent for john he did not want a cheerful young man in a soft hat and a flannel suit who looked as if at any moment he might burst into a college yell  general poineau meanwhile had embarked on the address of welcome john regarded him thoughtfully  i can see he said to mr scobell that the gentleman is making a good speech but what is he saying that is what gets past me  he is welcoming your highness said mr crump the linguist in the name of the people of mervo  who i notice have had the bully good sense to stay in bed i guess they knew that the boy orator would do all that was necessary he hasnt said anything about a bite of breakfast has he has his address happened to work around to the subject of shredded wheat and shirred eggs yet thats the part thats going to make a hit with me  therell be breakfast at my villa your highness said mr scobell my automobile is waiting along there  the general reached his peroration worked his way through it and finished with a military clash of heels and a salute the band rattled off the national anthem once more  now what said john turning to mr scobell breakfast  i guess youd better say a few words to them your highness theyll expect it  but i cant speak the language and they cant understand english the thingll be a standoff  crump will hand it to em here crump  sir  line up and shoot his highnesss remarks into em  yes sir  its all very well for you crump said john you probably enjoy this sort of thing i dont i havent felt such a fool since i sang the maidens prayer on tremont street when i was joining the frat are you ready no its no good i dont know what to say  tell em youre tickled to death advised mr scobell anxiously  john smiled in a friendly manner at the populace then he coughed gentlemen he saidand more particularly the sport on my left who has just spoken his piece whose name i cant rememberi thank you for the warm welcome you have given me if it is any satisfaction to you to know that it has made me feel like thirty cents you may have that satisfaction thirty is a liberal estimate  his highness is overwhelmed by your loyal welcome he thanks you warmly translated mr crump tactfully  i feel that we shall get along nicely together continued john if you are chumps enough to turn out of your comfortable beds at this time of the morning simply to see me you cant be very hard to please we shall hit it off fine  mr crump his highness hopes and believes that he will always continue to command the affection of his people  i john paused thats the lot he said the flow of inspiration has ceased the magic fire has gone out break it to em crump for me breakfast  during the early portion of the ride mr scobell was silent and thoughtful johns speech had impressed him neither as oratory nor as an index to his frame of mind he had not interrupted him because he knew that none of those present could understand what was being said and that mr crump was to be relied on as an editor but he had not enjoyed it he did not take the people of mervo seriously himself but in the prince such an attitude struck him as unbecoming then he cheered up after all john had given evidence of having a certain amount of what he would have called getup in him for the purposes for which he needed him a tendency to make light of things was not amiss it was essentially as a performing prince that he had engaged john he wanted him to do unusual things which would make people talkaeroplaning was one that occurred to him perhaps a prince who took a serious view of his position would try to raise the peoples minds and start reforms and generally be a nuisance john could at any rate be relied upon not to do that  his face cleared  have a good cigar prince he said cordially inserting two fingers in his vestpocket  sure mike said his highness affably  breakfast over mr scobell replaced the remains of his cigar between his lips and turned to business  eh prince he said  yes  i want you prince said mr scobell to help boom this place thats where you come in  sure said john  as to ruling and all that continued mr scobell there isnt any to do the place runs itself some guy gave it a shove a thousand years ago and its been rolling along ever since what i want you to do is the picturesque stunts get a yacht and catch rare fishes whoop it up entertain swell guys when they come here have a courtsee what i meansame as over in england go around in aeroplanes and that style of thing dont worry about money thatll be all right you draw your steady hundred thousand a year and a good chunk more besides when we begin to get a move on so the dough proposition doesnt need to scare you any  do i by george said john it seems to me that ive fallen into a pretty soft thing here therell be a joker in the deck somewhere i guess there always is in these good things but i dont see it yet you can count me in all right  good boy said mr scobell and now youll be wanting to get to the palace ill have them bring the automobile round  the council of state broke up  having seen john off in the car the financier proceeded to his sisters sittingroom miss scobell had breakfasted apart that morning by request her brother giving her to understand that matters of state unsuited to the ear of a third party must be discussed at the meal she was reading her new york herald  well said mr scobell hes come  yes dear  and just the sort i want saw the idea of the thing right away and is ready to go the limit no nonsense about him  is he nicelooking bennie  sure all these mervo princes have been goodlookers i hear and this one must be near the top of the list youll like him marion all the girls will be crazy about him in a week  miss scobell turned a page  is he married  her brother started  married i never thought of that but no i guess hes not hed have mentioned it hes not the sort to hush up a thing like that i  he stopped short his green eyes gleamed excitedly  marion he cried marion  well dear  listen gee this thing is going to be the biggest ever i gotta new idea it just came to me your saying that put it into my head do you know what im going to do im going to cable over to betty to come right along here and im going to have her marry this prince guy yes sir  for once miss scobell showed signs that her brothers conversation really interested her she laid down her paper and stared at him  betty  sure betty why not shes a pretty girl clever too the princell be lucky to get such a wife for all his darned ancestors away back to the flood  but suppose betty does not like him  like him shes gotta like him say cant you make your mind soar or wont you cant you see that a thing like this has gotta be fixed different from a marriage betweenbetween a ribboncounter clerk and the girl who takes the money at a twentyfivecent hash restaurant in flatbush this is a royal alliance do you suppose that when a european princess is introduced to the prince shes going to marry they let her say nothing doing i dont like the shape of his nose  he gave a spirited imitation of a european princess objecting to the shape of her selected husbands nose  it isnt very romantic bennie sighed miss scobell she was a confirmed reader of the more sentimental class of fiction and this businesslike treatment of loves young dream jarred upon her  its founding a dynasty isnt that romantic enough for you you make me tired marion  miss scobell sighed again  very well dear i suppose you know best but perhaps the prince wont like betty  mr scobell gave a snort of disgust  marion he said youve got a mind like a chunk of wet dough cant you understand that the prince is just as much in my employment as the man who scrubs the casino steps im hiring him to be prince of mervo and his first job as prince of mervo will be to marry betty id like to see him kick he began to pace the room by heck its going to make this place boom to beat the band itll be the biggest kind of advertisement restoration of royalty at mervo thatll make them take notice by itself then biff right on top of that royal romanceprince weds american girllove at first sightpicturesque wedding gee well wipe monte carlo clean off the map well have em licked to a splinter weits the greatest scheme on earth  i have no doubt you are right bennie said miss scobell but her voice became dreamy againits not very romantic  oh shucks said the schemer impatiently here wheres a cable form     chapter vi  young adam cupid   on a red sandstone rock at the edge of the water where the island curved sharply out into the sea prince john of mervo sat and brooded on first causes for nearly an hour and a half he had been engaged in an earnest attempt to trace to its source the acute fit of depression which had comeapparently from nowhereto poison his existence that morning  it was his seventh day on the island and he could remember every incident of his brief reign the only thing that eluded him was the recollection of the exact point when the shadow of discontent had begun to spread itself over his mind looking back it seemed to him that he had done nothing during that week but enjoy each new aspect of his position as it was introduced to his notice yet here he was sitting on a lonely rock consumed with an unquenchable restlessness a kind of trapped sensation exactly when and exactly how fate that king of goldbrick men had cheated him he could not say but he knew with a certainty that defied argument that there had been sharp practise and that in an unguarded moment he had been induced to part with something of infinite value in exchange for a gilded fraud  the mystery baffled him he sent his mind back to the first definite entry of mervo into the foreground of his life he had come up from his stateroom on to the deck of the little steamer and there in the pearlgray of the morning was the island gradually taking definite shape as the pink mists shredded away before the rays of the rising sun as the ship rounded the point where the lighthouse still flashed a needless warning from its cluster of jagged rocks he had had his first view of the town nestling at the foot of the hill gleaming white against the green with the golddomed casino towering in its midst in all southern europe there was no view to match it for quiet beauty for all his thews and sinews there was poetry in john and the sight had stirred him like wine  it was not then that depression had begun nor was it during the reception at the quay  the days that had followed had been peaceful and amusing he could not detect in any one of them a sign of the approaching shadow they had been lazy days his duties had been much more simple than he had anticipated he had not known before he tried it that it was possible to be a prince with so small an expenditure of mental energy as mr scobell had hinted to all intents and purposes he was a mere ornament his work began at eleven in the morning and finished as a rule at about a quarter after at the hour named a report of the happenings of the previous day was brought to him when he had read it the state asked no more of him until the next morning  the report was made up of such items as a fisherman named lesieur called carbineer ferrier a fool in the marketplace at eleven minutes after two this afternoon he has not been arrested but is being watched and generally gave john a few minutes of mild enjoyment certainly he could not recollect that it had ever depressed him  no it had been something else that had worked the mischief and in another moment the thing stood revealed beyond all question of doubt what had unsettled him was that unexpected meeting with betty silver last night at the casino  he had been sitting at the dutch table he generally visited the casino after dinner the light and movement of the place interested him as a rule he merely strolled through the rooms watching the play but last night he had slipped into a vacant seat he had only just settled himself when he was aware of a girl standing beside him he got up  would you care he had begun and then he saw her face  it had all happened in an instant some chord in him numbed till then had begun to throb it was as if he had awakened from a dream or returned to consciousness after being stunned there was something in the sight of her standing there so cool and neat and composed so typically american a sort of goddess of america in the heat and stir of the casino that struck him like a blow  how long was it since he had seen her last not more than a couple of years it seemed centuries it all came back to him it was during his last winter at harvard that they had met a college friend of hers had been the sister of a college friend of his they had met several times but he could not recollect having taken any particular notice of her then beyond recognizing that she was certainly pretty the world had been full of pretty american girls then but now  he looked at her and as he looked he heard america calling to him mervo by the appeal of its novelty had caused him to forget but now quite suddenly he knew that he was homesickand it astonished him the readiness with which he had permitted mr crump to lead him away into bondage it seemed incredible that he had not foreseen what must happen  love comes to some gently imperceptibly creeping in as the tide through unsuspected creeks and inlets creeps on a sleeping man until he wakes to find himself surrounded but to others it comes as a wave breaking on them beating them down whirling them away  it was so with john in that instant when their eyes met the miracle must have happened it seemed to him as he recalled the scene now that he had loved her before he had had time to frame his first remark it amazed him that he could ever have been blind to the fact that he loved her she was so obviously the only girl in the world  youyou dont remember me he stammered  she was flushing a little under his stare but her eyes were shining  i remember you very well mr maude she said with a smile i thought i knew your shoulders before you turned round what are you doing here  i  there was a hush the croupier had set the ball rolling a wizened little man and two ladies of determined aspect were looking up disapprovingly john realized that he was the only person in the room not silent it was impossible to tell her the story of the change in his fortunes in the middle of this crowd he stopped and the moment passed  the ball dropped with a rattle the tension relaxed  wont you take this seat said john  no thank you im not playing i only just stopped to look on my aunt is in one of the rooms and i want to make her come home im tired  have you  he caught the eye of the wizened man and stopped again  have you been in mervo long he said as the ball fell  i only arrived this morning it seems lovely i must explore tomorrow  she was beginning to move off  er john coughed to remove what seemed to him a deposit of sawdust and unshelled nuts in his throat ermay iwill you let me show you prolonged struggle with the nuts and sawdust then rapidlysome of the places tomorrow  he had hardly spoken the words when it was borne in upon him that he was a vulgar pushing bounder presuming on a dead and buried acquaintanceship to force his company on a girl who naturally did not want it and who would now proceed to snub him as he deserved he quailed though he had not had time to collect and examine and label his feelings he was sufficiently in touch with them to know that a snub from her would be the most terrible thing that could possibly happen to him  she did not snub him indeed if he had been in a state of mind coherent enough to allow him to observe he might have detected in her eyes and her voice signs of pleasure  i should like it very much she said  john made his big effort he attacked the nuts and sawdust which had come back and settled down again in company with a large lump of some unidentified material as if he were bucking center they broke before him as long ago the yale line had done and his voice rang out as if through a megaphone to the unconcealed disgust of the neighboring gamesters  if you go along the path at the foot of the hill he bellowed rapidly and follow it down to the sea you get a little bay full of red sandstone rocksyou cant miss itand theres a fine view of the island from there id like awfully well to show that to you its great  she nodded  then shall we meet there she said when  john was in no mood to postpone the event  as early as ever you like he roared  at about ten then goodnight mr maude                                       john had reached the bay at halfpast eight and had been on guard there ever since it was now past ten but still there were no signs of betty his depression increased he told himself that she had forgotten then that she had remembered but had changed her mind then that she had never meant to come at all he could not decide which of the three theories was the most distressing  his mood became morbidly introspective he was weighed down by a sense of his own unworthiness he submitted himself to a thorough examination and the conclusion to which he came was that as an aspirant to the regard of a girl like betty he did not score a single point no wonder she had ignored the appointment  a cold sweat broke out on him this was the snub she had not administered it in the casino simply in order that by being delayed its force might be the more overwhelming  he looked at his watch again and the world grew black it was twelve minutes after ten  john in his time had thought and read a good deal about love ever since he had grown up he had wanted to fall in love he had imagined love as a perpetual exhilaration something that flooded life with a golden glow as if by the pressing of a button or the pulling of a switch and automatically removed from it everything mean and hard and uncomfortable a something that made a man feel grand and godlike looking down benevolently of course on his fellow men as from some lofty mountain  that it should make him feel a wormlike humility had not entered his calculations he was beginning to see something of the possibilities of love his tentative excursions into the unknown emotion while at college had never really deceived him even at the time a sort of second self had looked on and sneered at the poor imitation  this was different this had nothing to do with moonlight and soft music it was raw and hard it hurt it was a thing sharp and jagged tearing at the roots of his soul  he turned his head and looked up the path for the hundredth time and this time he sprang to his feet between the pines on the hillside his eye had caught the flutter of a white dress     chapter vii  mr scobell is frank   much may happen in these rapid times in the course of an hour and a half while john was keeping his vigil on the sandstone rock betty was having an interview with mr scobell which was to produce farreaching results and which incidentally was to leave her angrier and more at war with the whole of her world than she could remember to have been in the entire course of her life  the interview began shortly after breakfast in a gentle and tactful manner with aunt marion at the helm but mr scobell was not the man to stand by silently while persons were being tactful at the end of the second minute he had plunged through his sisters mild monologue like a rhinoceros through a cobweb and had stated definitely with an economy of words the exact part which betty was to play in mervian affairs  you say you want to know why you were cabled for ill tell you theres no use talking for half a day before you get to the point i guess youve heard that theres a prince here instead of a republic now well thats where you come in  do you mean she hesitated  yes i do said mr scobell there was a touch of doggedness in his voice he was not going to stand any nonsense by heck but there was no doubt that bettys wideopen eyes were not very easy to meet he went on rapidly cut out any fool notions about romance miss scobell who was knitting a sock checked her needles for a moment in order to sigh her brother eyed her morosely then resumed his remarks this is a matter of state thats it you gotta cut out fool notions and act for good of state you gotta look at it in the proper spirit great honorsee what i mean princess and all that chance of a lifetimedynastyyou gotta look at it that way  miss scobell heaved another sigh and dropped a stitch  for the love of mike said her brother irritably dont snort like that marion  very well dear  betty had not taken her eyes off him from his first word an unbiased observer would have said that she made a pretty picture standing there in her white dress but in the matter of pictures still life was evidently what mr scobell preferred for his gaze never wandered from the cigar stump which he had removed from his mouth in order to knock off the ash  betty continued to regard him steadfastly the shock of his words had to some extent numbed her at this moment she was merely thinking quite dispassionately what a singularly nasty little man he looked and wonderingnot for the first timewhat strange quality invisible to everybody else it had been in him that had made her mother his adoring slave during the whole of their married life  then her mind began to work actively once more she was a western girl and an insistence on freedom was the first article in her creed a great rush of anger filled her that this man should set himself up to dictate to her  do you mean that you want me to marry this prince she said  thats right  i wont do anything of the sort  pshaw dont be foolish you make me tired  bettys eye shone mutinously her cheeks were flushed and her slim boyish figure quivered her chin always determined became a silent declaration of independence  i wont she said  aunt marion suspending operations on the sock went on with tact at the point where her brothers interruption had forced her to leave off  im sure hes a very nice young man i have not seen him but everybody says so you like him bennie dont you  sure i like him hes a corker wait till you see him betty nobodys asking you to marry him before lunch youll have plenty of time to get acquainted it beats me what youre kicking at you give me a pain in the neck be reasonable  betty sought for arguments to clinch her refusal  its ridiculous she said you talk as if you had just to wave your hand why should your prince want to marry a girl he has never seen  he will said mr scobell confidently  how do you know  because i know hes a sensible young skeesicks thats how see here betty youve gotten hold of wrong ideas about this place you dont understand the position of affairs your aunt didnt till i put her wise  he bit my head off my dear murmured miss scobell knitting placidly  youre thinking that mervo is an ordinary state and that the prince is one of those independent allwool offwithhisdarnedhead rulers like you read about in the best sellers well youve got another guess coming if you want to know whos the big noise here its meme this prince guy is my hired man see who sent for him i did who put him on the throne i did who pays him his salary i do from the profits of the casino now do you understand he knows his job he knows which side his breads buttered when i tell him about this marriage do you know what hell say hell say thank you sir thats how things are in this island  betty shuddered her face was white with humiliation she halfraised her hands with an impulsive movement to hide it  i wont i wont i wont she gasped  mr scobell was pacing the room in an ecstasy of triumphant rhetoric  theres another thing he said swinging round suddenly and causing his sister to drop another stitch maybe you think hes some kind of a dago this guy maybe thats whats biting you let me tell you that hes an americanpretty near as much an american as you are yourself  betty stared at him  an american  dont believe it eh well let me tell you that his mother was born and raised in jersey and that he has lived all his life in the states hes no little runt of a dago no sir hes a harvard man sixfoot high and weighs two hundred pounds thats the sort of man he is i guess thats not american enough for you maybe no  you do shout so bennie murmured miss scobell im sure theres no need  betty uttered a cry something had told her who he was this harvard man who had sold himself that species of sixth sense which lies undeveloped at the back of our minds during the ordinary happenings of life wakes sometimes in moments of keen emotion at its highest it is prophecy at its lowest a vague presentiment it woke in betty now there was no particular reason why she should have connected her stepfathers words with john the term he had used was an elastic one among the visitors to the island there were probably several harvard men but somehow she knew  who is he she cried what was his name before hewhen he  his name said mr scobell john maude maude was his mothers name she was a miss westley here where are you going  betty was walking slowly toward the door something in her face checked mr scobell  i want to think she said quietly im going out                                       in days of old in the age of legend omens warned heroes of impending doom but today the gods have grown weary and we rush unsuspecting on our fate no owl hooted no thunder rolled from the blue sky as john went up the path to meet the white dress that gleamed between the trees  his heart was singing within him she had come she had not forgotten or changed her mind or willfully abandoned him his mood lightened swiftly humility vanished he was not such an outcast after all he was someone he was the man betty silver had come to meet  but with the sight of her face came reaction  her face was pale and cold and hard she did not speak or smile as she drew near she looked at him and there was that in her look which set a chill wind blowing through the world and cast a veil across the sun  and in this bleak world they stood silent and motionless while eons rolled by  betty was the first to speak  im late she said  john searched in his brain for words and came empty away he shook his head dumbly  shall we sit down said betty  john indicated silently the sandstone rock on which he had been communing with himself  they sat down a sense of being preposterously and indecently big obsessed john there seemed no end to him wherever he looked there were hands and feet and legs he was a vast blot on the face of the earth he glanced out of the corner of his eye at betty she was gazing out to sea  he dived into his brain again it was absurd there must be something to say  and then he realized that a worse thing had befallen he had no voice it had gone he knew that try he never so hard to speak he would not be able to utter a word a nightmare feeling of unreality came upon him had he ever spoken had he ever done anything but sit dumbly on that rock looking at those sea gulls out in the water  he shot another swift glance at betty and a thrill went through him there were tears in her eyes  the next momentthe action was almost automatichis left hand was clasping her right and he was moving along the rock to her side  she snatched her hand away  his brain ransacked for the third time yielded a single word  betty  she got up quickly  in the confused state of his mind john found it necessary if he were to speak at all to say the essential thing in the shortest possible way polished periods are not for the man who is feeling deeply  he blurted out huskily i love you and finding that this was all that he could say was silent  even to himself the words as he spoke them sounded bald and meaningless to betty shaken by her encounter with mr scobell they sounded artificial as if he were forcing himself to repeat a lesson they jarred upon her  dont she said sharply oh dont  her voice stabbed him it could not have stirred him more if she had uttered a cry of physical pain  dont i know ive been told  been told  she went on quickly  i know all about it my stepfather has just told me he saidhe said you were his she chokedhis hired man that he paid you to stay here and advertise the casino oh its too horrible that it should be you you who have beenyou cant understand what youhave been to meever since we met you couldnt understand i cant tell youa sort of helpsomethingsomething thati cant put it into words only it used to help me just to think of you it was almost impersonal i didnt mind if i never saw you again i didnt expect ever to see you again it was just being able to think of you it helpedyou were something i could trust something strongsolid she laughed bitterly i suppose i made a hero of you girls are fools but it helped me to feel that there was one man alive whowho put his honor above money  she broke off john stood motionless staring at the ground for the first time in his easygoing life he knew shame even now he had not grasped to the full the purport of her words the scales were falling from his eyes but as yet he saw but dimly  she began to speak again in a low monotonous voice almost as if she were talking to herself she was looking past him at the gulls that swooped and skimmed above the glittering water  im so tired of moneymoneymoney everythings money isnt there a man in the world who wont sell himself i thought that youi suppose im stupid its business i suppose one expects too much  she looked at him wearily  goodby she said im going  he did not move  she turned and went slowly up the path still he made no movement a spell seemed to be on him his eyes never left her as she passed into the shadow of the trees for a moment her white dress stood out clearly she had stopped with his whole soul he prayed that she would look back but she moved on once more and was gone and suddenly a strange weakness came upon john he trembled the hillside flickered before his eyes for an instant and he clutched at the sandstone rock to steady himself  then his brain cleared and he found himself thinking swiftly he could not let her go like this he must overtake her he must stop her he must speak to her he must sayhe did not know what it was that he would sayanything so that he spoke to her again  he raced up the path calling her name no answer came to his cries above him lay the hillside dozing in the noonday sun below the mediterranean sleek and blue without a ripple he stood alone in a land of silence and sleep     chapter viii  an ultimatum from the throne   at halfpast twelve that morning business took mr benjamin scobell to the royal palace he was not a man who believed in letting the grass grow under his feet he prided himself on his briskness of attack every now and then mr crump searching the newspapers would discover and hand to him a paragraph alluding to his hustling methods when this happened he would preserve the clipping and carry it about in his vestpocket with his cigars till time and friction wore it away he liked to think of himself as swift and suddenthe human thunderbolt  in this matter of the royal alliance it was his intention to have at it and clear it up at once having put his views clearly before betty he now proposed to lay them with equal clarity before the prince there was no sense in putting the thing off the sooner all parties concerned understood the position of affairs the sooner the business would be settled  that betty had not received his information with joy did not distress him he had a poor opinion of the feminine intelligence girls got their minds full of nonsense from reading novels and seeing playslike betty betty objected to those who were wiser than herself providing a perfectly good prince for her to marry some fool notion of romance of course not that he was angry he did not blame her any more than the surgeon blames a patient for the possession of an unsuitable appendix there was no animus in the matter her mind was suffering from foolish ideas and he was the surgeon whose task it was to operate upon it that was all one had to expect foolishness in women it was their nature the only thing to do was to tie a rope to them and let them run around till they were tired of it then pull them in he saw his way to managing betty  nor did he anticipate trouble with john he had taken an estimate of johns character and it did not seem to him likely that it contained unsuspected depths he set john down as he had told betty as a young man acute enough to know when he had a good job and sufficiently sensible to make concessions in order to retain it betty after the manner of woman might make a fuss before yielding to the inevitable but from levelheaded john he looked for placid acquiescence  his mood as the automobile whirred its way down the hill toward the town was sunny he looked on life benevolently and found it good the view appealed to him more than it had managed to do on other days as a rule he was the man of blood and iron who had no time for admiring scenery but today he vouchsafed it a not unkindly glance it was certainly a dandy little place this island of his a vineyard on the right caught his eye he made a mental note to uproot it and run up a hotel in its place further down the hill he selected a site for a villa where the mimosa blazed and another where at present there were a number of utterly useless violets a certain practical element was apt perhaps to color mr scobells halfhours with nature  the sight of the steamboat leaving the harbor on its journey to marseilles gave him another idea now that mervo was a going concern a real live proposition it was high time that it should have an adequate service of boats the present system of one a day was absurd he made a note to look into the matter these people wanted waking up  arriving at the palace he was informed that his highness had gone out shortly after breakfast and had not returned the majordomo gave the information with a tinkle of disapproval in his voice before taking up his duties at mervo he had held a similar position in the household of a german prince where rigid ceremonial obtained and johns cheerful disregard of the formalities frankly shocked him to take the present case for instance when his highness of swartzheim had felt inclined to enjoy the air of a morning it had been a domestic event full of stir and pomp he had not merely crammed a soft hat over his eyes and strolled out with his hands in his pockets but without a word to his household staff as to where he was going or when he might be expected to return  mr scobell received the news equably and directed his chauffeur to return to the villa he could not have done better for on his arrival he was met with the information that his highness had called to see him shortly after he had left and was now waiting in the morningroom  the sound of footsteps came to mr scobells ears as he approached the room his highness appeared to be pacing the floor like a caged animal at the luncheon hour the resemblance was heightened by the expression in the royal eye as his highness swung round at the opening of the door and faced the financier  why say prince said mr scobell this is lucky i been looking for you i just been to the palace and the main guy there told me you had gone out  i did and i met your stepdaughter  mr scobell was astonished fate was certainly smoothing his way if it arranged meetings between betty and the prince before he had time to do it himself there might be no need for the iron hand after all  you did he said say how the heck did you come to do that what did you know about betty  miss silver and i had met before in america when i was in college  mr scobell slapped his thigh joyously  gee its all working out like a fiction story in the magazines  is it said john how and for the matter of that what  mr scobell answered question with question say prince you and betty were pretty good friends in the old days i guess  john looked at him coldly  we wont discuss that if you dont mind he said  his tone annoyed mr scobell off came the velvet glove and the iron hand displayed itself his green eyes glowed dully and the tip of his nose wriggled as was its habit in times of emotion  is that so he cried regarding john with disfavor well i guess wont discuss it you gotta discuss it your royal texas league highness you want making a head shorter my bucko you  johns demeanor had become so dangerous that he broke off abruptly and with an unostentatious movement as of a man strolling carelessly about his private sanctum put himself within easy reach of the door handle  he then became satirical  maybe your serene imperial twobyfourness would care to suggest a subject we can discuss  john took a step forward  yes i will he said between his teeth you were talking to miss silver about me this morning she told me one or two of the things you said and they opened my eyes until i heard them i had not quite understood my position i do now you said among other things that i was your hired man  it wasnt intended for you to hear said mr scobell slightly mollified and betty shouldnt oughter have handed it to you i dont wonder you feel raw i wouldnt say that sort of thing to a guys face sure no tacts my middle name but since you have heard it well  dont apologize you were quite right i was a fool not to see it before no description could have been fairer you might have said much more you might have added that i was nothing more than a steerer for a gambling hell  oh come prince  there was a knock at the door a footman entered bearing with a detached air as if he disclaimed all responsibility a letter on a silver tray  mr scobell slit the envelope and began to read as he did so his eyes grew round and his mouth slowly opened till his cigar stump after hanging for a moment from his lower lip dropped off like an exhausted bivalve and rolled along the carpet  prince he gasped shes gone betty  gone what do you mean  shes beaten it shes halfway to marseilles by now gee and i saw the darned boat going out  shes gone  this is from her listen what she says     by the time you read this i shall be gone i am going back    to america as quickly as i can i am giving this to a boy to    take to you directly the boat has started please do not try    to bring me back i would sooner die than marry the prince  john started violently  what he cried  mr scobell nodded sympathy  thats what she says she sure has it in bad for you what does she mean seeing you and she are old friends  i dont understand why does she say that to you why should she think that you knew that i had asked her to marry me  eh cried mr scobell you asked her to marry you and she turned you down prince this beats the band say you and i must get together and do something the girls mad see here you arent wise to whats been happening i been fixing this thing up i fetched you over here and then i fetched betty and i was going to have you two marry i told betty all about it this morning  john cut through his explanations with a sudden sharp cry a blinding blaze of understanding had flashed upon him it was as if he had been groping his way in a dark cavern and had stumbled unexpectedly into brilliant sunlight he understood everything now every word that betty had spoken every gesture that she had made had become amazingly clear he saw now why she had shrunk back from him why her eyes had worn that look he dared not face the picture of himself as he must have appeared in those eyes the man whom mr benjamin scobells casino was paying to marry her the hired man earning his wages by speaking words of love  a feeling of physical sickness came over him he held to the table for support as he had held to the sandstone rock and then came rage rage such as he had never felt before rage that he had not thought himself capable of feeling it swept over him in a wave pouring through his veins and blinding him and he clung to the table till his knuckles whitened under the strain for he knew that he was very near to murder  a minute passed he walked to the window and stood there looking out vaguely he heard mr scobells voice at his back talking on but the words had no meaning for him  he had begun to think with a curious coolness his detachment surprised him it was one of those rare moments in a mans life when from the outside through a breach in that wall of excuses and selfdeception which he has been at such pains to build he looks at himself impartially  the sight that john saw through the wall was not comforting it was not a heroic soul that stripped of its defenses shivered beneath the scrutiny in another mood he would have mended the breach excusing and extenuating but not now he looked at himself without pity and saw himself weak slothful devoid of all that was clean and fine and a bitter contempt filled him  outside the window a blaze of color mervo smiled up at him and suddenly he found himself loathing its exotic beauty he felt stifled this was no place for a man a vision of clean winds and wide spaces came to him  and just then at the foot of the hill the dome of the casino caught the sun and flashed out in a blaze of gold  he swung round and faced mr scobell he had made up his mind  the financier was still talking  so thats how it stands prince he was saying and its up to us to get busy  john looked at him  i intend to he said  good boy said the financier  to begin with i shall run you out of this place mr scobell  the other gasped  there is going to be a cleaningup john went on ive thought it out there will be no more gambling in mervo  youre crazy with the heat gasped mr scobell abolish gambling you cant  i can that concession of yours isnt worth the paper its written on the republic gave it to you the republics finished if you want to conduct a casino in mervo theres only one man who can give you permission and thats myself the acts of the republic are not binding on me for a week you have been gambling on this island without a concession and now its going to stop do you understand  but prince talk sense mr scobells voice was almost tearful its you who dont understand do for the love of mike come down off the roof and talk sense do you suppose that these guys here will stand for this not on your life not for a minute see here im not blaming you i know you dont know what youre saying but listen here you must cut out this kind of thing you mustnt get these ideas in your head you stick to your job and dont butt in on other folks do you know how long youd stay prince of this joint if you started in to monkey with my casino just about long enough to let you pack a collarstud and a toothbrush into your grip and after that there wouldnt be any more prince sonnie you stick to your job and ill stick to mine youre a mighty good prince for all thats required of you youre ornamental and youve got getup in you you just keep right on being a good boy and dont start trying stunts off your own beat and youll do fine dont forget that im the big noise here im old grayback from way back in mervo see ive only to twiddle my fingers and therell be a revolution and you for the downandout club dont you forget it sonnie  john shrugged his shoulders  ive said all i have to say youve had your notice to quit after tonight the casino is closed  but dont i tell you the people wont stand for it  thats for them to decide they may have some selfrespect  theyll fire you  very well that will prove that they have not  prince talk sense you cant mean that youll throw away a hundred thousand dollars a year as if it was dirt  it is dirt when its made that way we neednt discuss it any more  but prince  its finished  but say  john had left the room  he had been gone several minutes before the financier recovered full possession of his faculties  when he did his remarks were brief and to the point  bughouse he gasped absolutely bughouse     chapter ix  mervo changes its constitution   humor if one looks into it is principally a matter of retrospect in after years john was wont to look back with amusement on the revolution which ejected him from the throne of his ancestors but at the time its mirthfulness did not appeal to him he was in a frenzy of restlessness he wanted betty he wanted to see her and explain explanations could not restore him to the place he had held in her mind but at least they would show her that he was not the thing he had appeared  mervo had become a prison he ached for america but before he could go this matter of the casino must be settled it was obvious that it could only be settled in one way he did not credit his subjects with the highmindedness that puts ideals first and money after that military and civilians alike would rally to a man round mr scobell and the casino he was well aware but this did not affect his determination to remain till the last if he went now he would be like a boy who makes a runaway ring at the doorbell until he should receive formal notice of dismissal he must stay although every day had fortyeight hours and every hour twice its complement of weary minutes  so he waited chafing while mervo examined the situation turned it over in its mind discussed it slept upon it discussed it again and displayed generally that ponderous leisureliness which is the mervians birthright  indeed the earliest demonstration was not mervian at all it came from the visitors to the island and consisted of a deputation of four headed by the wizened little man who had frowned at john in the dutch room on the occasion of his meeting with betty and a stolid individual with a bald forehead and a walrus mustache  the tone of the deputation was from the first querulous the wizened man had constituted himself spokesman he introduced the partythe walrus as colonel finch the others as herr von mandelbaum and mr archercleeve his own name was pugh and the whole party like the other visitors whom they represented had it seemed come to mervo at great trouble and expense to patronize the tables only to find these suddenly without a word of warning withdrawn from their patronage and what the deputation wished to know was what did it all mean  we were amazed siryour highness said mr pugh we could notwe cannotunderstand it the entire thing is a baffling mystery to us we asked the soldiers at the door they referred us to mr scobell we asked mr scobell he referred us to you and now we have come as the representatives of our fellow visitors to this island to ask your highness what it means  have a cigar said john extending the box mr pugh waved aside the preferred gift impatiently not so herr von mandelbaum who slid forward after the manner of one in quest of second base and retired with his prize to the rear of the little army once more  mr archercleeve a young man with carefully parted fair hair and the expression of a strayed sheep contributed a remark  no but i say by jove you know i mean really you know what  that was mr archercleeve upon the situation  we have not come here for cigars said mr pugh we have come here your highness for an explanation  of what said john  mr pugh made an impatient gesture  do you question my right to rule this massive country as i think best mr pugh  it is a highhanded proceeding said the wizened little man  the walrus spoke for the first time  what say he murmured huskily  i said repeated mr pugh raising his voice that it was a highhanded proceeding colonel  the walrus nodded heavily in assent with closed eyes  yah said herr von mandelbaum through the smoke  john looked at the spokesman  you are from england mr pugh  yes sir i am a british citizen  suppose some enterprising person began to run a gambling hell in piccadilly would the authorities look on and smile  that is an entirely different matter sir you are quibbling in england gambling is forbidden by law  so it is in mervo mr pugh  tchah  what say said the walrus  i said tchah colonel  why said the walrus  because his highness quibbled  the walrus nodded approvingly  his highness did nothing of the sort said john gambling is forbidden in mervo for the same reason that it is forbidden in england because it demoralizes the people  this is absurd sir gambling has been permitted in mervo for nearly a year  but not by me mr pugh the republic certainly granted mr scobell a concession but when i came to the throne it became necessary for him to get a concession from me i refused it hence the closed doors  mr archercleeve once more but he paused forgotten what i was going to say he said to the room at large  herr von mandelbaum made some remark at the back of his throat but was ignored  john spoke again  if you were a prince mr pugh would you find it pleasant to be in the pay of a gambling hell  that is neither here nor  on the contrary it is very much i happen to have some selfrespect ive only just found it out its true but its there all right i dont want to be a princetake it from me its a much overrated professionbut if ive got to be one ill specialize i wont combine it with being a bunco steerer on the side as long as i am on the throne this hightoned crapshooting will continue a back number  what say said the walrus  i said that while i am on the throne here people who feel it necessary to chant come little seven must do it elsewhere  i dont understand you said mr pugh your remarks are absolutely unintelligible  never mind my actions speak for themselves it doesnt matter how i describe itwhat it comes to is that the casino is closed you can follow that mervo is no longer running wide open the lid is on  then let me tell you sir mr pugh brought a bony fist down with a thump on the tablethat you are playing with fire understand me sir we are not here to threaten we are a peaceful deputation of visitors but i have observed your people sir i have watched them narrowly and let me tell you that you are walking on a volcano already there are signs of grave discontent  already cried john alreadys good i guess they call it going some in this infernal country if they can keep awake long enough to take action within a year after a thing has happened i dont know if you have any influence with the populace mr pughyou seem a pretty warm and important sort of personbut if you have do please ask them as a favor to me to get a move on its no good saying that im walking on a volcano im from missouri i want to be shown lets see this volcano bring it out and make it trot around  you may jest  whos jesting im not its a mighty serious thing for me i want to get away the only thing thats keeping me in this forsaken place is this delay these people are obviously going to fire me sooner or later why on earth cant they do it at once  what say said the walrus  you may well ask colonel said mr pugh staring amazed at john his highness appears completely to have lost his senses  the walrus looked at john as if expecting some demonstration of practical insanity but finding him outwardly calm closed his eyes and nodded heavily again  i must say dont you know said mr archercleeve it beats me what  the entire deputation seemed to consider that johns last speech needed footnotes  john was in no mood to supply them his patience was exhausted  i guess well call this conference finished he said youve been told all you came to find outmy reason for closing the casino if it doesnt strike you as a satisfactory reason thats up to you do what you like about it the one thing you may take as a solid factand you can spread it around the town as much as ever you pleaseis that it is closed and is not going to be reopened while im ruler here  the deputation then withdrew reluctantly                                       on the following morning there came a note from mr scobell it was brief come on down before the shooting begins it ran john tore it up  it was on the same evening that definite hostilities may be said to have begun  between the palace and the marketplace there was a narrow street of flagged stone which was busy during the early part of the day but deserted after sundown along this street at about seven oclock john was strolling with a cigarette when he was aware of a man crouching with his back toward him so absorbed was the man in something which he was writing on the stones that he did not hear johns approach and the latter coming up from behind was enabled to see over his shoulder in large letters of chalk he read the words conspuez le prince  johns knowledge of french was not profound but he could understand this and it annoyed him  as he looked the man squatting on his heels bent forward to touch up one of the letters if he had been deliberately posing he could not have assumed a more convenient attitude  john had been a footballer before he was a prince the temptation was too much for him he drew back his foot  there was a howl and a thud and john resumed his stroll the first gun from fort sumter had been fired                                       early next morning a window at the rear of the palace was broken by a stone and toward noon one of the soldiers on guard in front of the casino was narrowly missed by an anonymous orange for mervo this was practically equivalent to the attack on the bastille and john when the report of the atrocities was brought to him became hopeful  but the effort seemed temporarily to have exhausted the fury of the mob the rest of that day and the whole of the next passed without sensation  after breakfast on the following morning mr crump paid a visit to the palace john was glad to see him the staff of the palace were loyal but considered as cheery companions they were handicapped by the fact that they spoke no english while john spoke no french  mr crump was the bearer of another note from mr scobell this time john tore it up unread and turning to the secretary invited him to sit down and make himself at home  sipping a cocktail and smoking one of johns cigars mr crump became confidential  this is a queer business he said old ben is chewing pieces out of the furniture up there hes mad clean through hes losing money all the while the people are making up their minds about this thing and it beats him why theyre so slow  it beats me too i dont believe these hookworm victims ever turned my father out or if they did somebody must have injected radium into them first ill give them another couple of days and if they havent fixed it by then ill go and leave them to do what they like about it  go do you want to go  of course i want to go do you think i like stringing along in this musical comedy island im crazy to get back to america i dont blame you crump because it was not your fault but by george if i had known what you were letting me in for when you carried me off here id have called up the police reserves hello whats this  he rose to his feet as the sound of agitated voices came from the other side of the door the next moment it flew open revealing general poineau and an assorted group of footmen and other domestics excitement seemed to be in the air  general poineau rushed forward into the room and flung his arms above his head then he dropped them to his side and shrugged his shoulders finishing in an attitude reminiscent of plate 6 despair in the home reciter  mon prince he moaned  a perfect avalanche of french burst from the group outside the door  crump cried john stand by me crump get busy this is where you make your big play never mind the chorus gentlemen in the passage concentrate yourself on poineau whats he talking about i believe hes come to tell me the people have wakened up offer him a cocktail whats the french for corpsereviver get busy crump  the general had begun to speak rapidly with a wealth of gestures it astonished john that mr crump could follow the harangue as apparently he did  well said john  mr crump looked grave  he says there is a large mob in the marketplace they are talking  they would be  of moving in force on the palace the palace guards have gone over to the people general poineau urges you to disguise yourself and escape while there is time you will be safe at his villa till the excitement subsides when you can be smuggled over to france during the night  not for mine said john shaking his head its mighty good of you general and i appreciate it but i cant wait till night the boat leaves for marseilles in another hour ill catch that i can manage it comfortably ill go up and pack my grip crump entertain the general while im gone will you i wont be a moment  but as he left the room there came through the open window the mutter of a crowd he stopped general poineau whipped out his sword and brought it to the salute john patted him on the shoulder  youre a sport general he said but we shant want it come along crump come and help me address the multitude  the window of the room looked out on to a square there was a small balcony with a stone parapet as john stepped out a howl of rage burst from the mob  john walked on to the balcony and stood looking down on them resting his arms on the parapet the howl was repeated and from somewhere at the back of the crowd came the sharp crack of a rifle and a shot the first and last of the campaign clipped a strip of flannel from the collar of his coat and splashed against the wall  a broad smile spread over his face  if he had studied for a year he could not have hit on a swifter or more effective method of quieting the mob there was something so engaging and friendly in his smile that the howling died away and fists that has been shaken unclenched themselves and fell there was an expectant silence in the square  john beckoned to crump who came on to the balcony with some reluctance being mistrustful of the unseen sportsman with the rifle  tell em its all right crump and that theres no call for any fuss from their manner i gather that i am no longer needed on this throne ask them if thats right  a small man who appeared to be in command of the crowd stepped forward as the secretary finished speaking and shouted some words which drew a murmur of approval from his followers  he wants to know interpreted mr crump if you will allow the casino to open again  tell him no but add that i shall be tickled to death to abdicate if thats what they want speed them up old man tell them to make up their minds on the jump because i want to catch that boat dont let them get to discussing it or theyll stand there talking till sunset yes or no thats the idea  there was a moments surprised silence when mr crump had spoken the mervian mind was unused to being hustled in this way then a voice shouted as it were tentatively vive la republique and at once the cry was taken up on all sides  john beamed down on them  thats right he said bully i knew you could get a move on as quick as anyone else if you gave your minds to it this is what i call something like a revolution its a model to every country in the world but i guess we must close down the entertainment now or i shall be missing the boat will you tell them crump that any citizen who cares for a drink and a cigar will find it in the palace tell the household staff to stand by to pull corks its dry work revolutionizing and now i really must be going ive run it mighty fine slip one of these fellows down there half a dollar and send him to fetch a cab i must step lively                                       five minutes later the revolutionists obviously embarrassed and ill at ease were sheepishly gulping down their refreshment beneath the stony eye of the majordomo and his assistants while upstairs in the state bedroom the deposed prince was whistling dixie and packing the royal pajamas into a suitcase     chapter x  mrs oakley   betty when she stepped on board the boat for marseilles had had no definite plan of action she had been caught up and swept away by an overmastering desire for escape that left no room in her mind for thoughts of the morrow it was not till the train was roaring its way across southern france that she found herself sufficiently composed to review her position and make plans  she would not go back she could not the words she had used in her letter to mr scobell were no melodramatic rhetoric they were a plain and literal statement of the truth death would be infinitely preferable to life at mervo on her stepfathers conditions  but that settled what then what was she to do the gods are businesslike they sell they do not give and for what they sell they demand a heavy price we may buy life of them in many ways with our honor our health our independence our happiness with our brains or with our hands but somehow or other in whatever currency we may choose to pay it the price must be paid  betty faced the problem what had she what could she give her independence that certainly she saw now what a mockery that fancied independence had been she had come and gone as she pleased her path smoothed by her stepfathers money and she had been accustomed to consider herself free she had learned wisdom now and could understand that it was only by sacrificing such artificial independence that she could win through to freedom the world was a market and the only independent people in it were those who had a market value  what was her market value what could she do she looked back at her life and saw that she had dabbled she had a little of most thingsenough of nothing she could sketch a little play a little sing a little write a little alsoand as she remembered it she felt for the first time a tremor of hopeshe could use a typewriter reasonably well that one accomplishment stood out in the welter of her thoughts solid and comforting like a rock in a quicksand it was something definite something marketable something of value for which persons paid  the tremor of hope did not comfort her long her mood was critical and she saw that in this her one accomplishment she was as in everything else an amateur she could not compete against professionals she closed her eyes and had a momentary vision of those professionals keen of face leathern of finger rattling out myriads of words at a dizzy speed and at that all her courage suddenly broke she drooped forlornly and hiding her face on the cushioned armrest she began to cry  tears are the turkish bath of the soul nature never intended woman to pass dryeyed through crises of emotion a casual stranger meeting betty on her way to the boat might have thought that she looked a little worriednothing more the same stranger if he had happened to enter the compartment at this juncture would have set her down at sight as brokenhearted beyond recovery yet such is the magic of tears that it was at this very moment that betty was beginning to be conscious of a distinct change for the better her heart still ached and to think of john even for an instant was to feel the knife turning in the wound but her brain was clear the panic fear had gone and she faced the future resolutely once more for she had just remembered the existence of mrs oakley                                       only once in her life had betty met her stepfathers celebrated aunt and the meeting had taken place nearly twelve years ago the figure that remained in her memory was of a paleeyed grenadierlike old lady almost entirely surrounded by clocks it was these clocks that had impressed her most she was too young to be awed by the knowledge that the tall old woman who stared at her just like a sandy cat she had once possessed was one of the three richest women in the whole wide world she only remembered thinking that the finger which emerged from the plaid shawl and prodded her cheek was unpleasantly bony but the clocks had absorbed her it was as if all the clocks in the world had been gathered together into that one room there had been big clocks with almost human faces small perky clocks clocks of strange shape and one dingy mediumsized clock in particular which had made her cry out with delight her visit had chanced to begin shortly before eleven in the morning and she had not been in the room ten minutes before there was a whirring and the majority of the clocks began to announce the hour each after its own fashionsome with a slow bloom some with a rapid belllike sound but the mediumsized clock unexpectedly belying its appearance of being nothing of particular importance had performed its task in a way quite distinct from the others it had suddenly produced from its interior a shabby little gold man with a trumpet who had blown eleven little blasts before sliding backward into his house and shutting the door after him betty had waited in rapt silence till he finished and had then shouted eagerly for more  just as the beginner at golf may effect a drive surpassing that of the expert so may a child unconsciously eclipse the practised courtier there was no soft side to mrs oakleys character as thousands of suave wouldbe borrowers had discovered in their time but there was a soft spot to general praise of her collection of clocks she was impervious it was unique and she did not require you to tell her so but exhibit admiration for the clock with the little trumpeter and she melted it was the one oasis of sentiment in the sahara of her mental outlook the grain of radium in the pitchblende years ago it had stood in a little new england farmhouse and a child had clapped her hands and shouted even as betty had done when the golden man slid from his hidingplace much water had flowed beneath the bridge since those days many things had happened to the child but she still kept her old love for the trumpeter the world knew nothing of this the world if it had known would have been delighted to stand before the clock and admire it volubly by the day but it had no inkling of the trumpeters importance and when it came to visit mrs oakley was apt to waste its time showering compliments on the obvious beauties of the queens of the collection  but betty ignoring these jumped up and down before the dingy clock demanding further trumpetings and turning to mrs oakley as one possessing influence she was aware of a curious intent look in the old ladys eyes  do you like that clock my dear said mrs oakley  yes oh yes  perhaps you shall have it some day honey  betty was probably the only person who had been admitted to that room who would not on the strength of this remark have steered the conversation gently to the subject of a small loan instead she ran to the old lady and kissed her and as to what had happened after that memory was vague there had been some talk she remembered of a dollar to buy candy but it had come to nothing and now that she had grown older and had read the frequent paragraphs and anecdotes that appeared in the papers about her stepfathers aunt she could understand why she knew now what everybody knew of mrs oakleyher history her eccentricities and the miserliness of which the papers spoke with a satirical lightness that seemed somehow but a thin disguise for what was almost admiration  mrs oakley was one of two children a son and a daughter of a vermont farmer of her early life no records remain her public history begins when she was twentytwo and came to new york after two years struggling she found a position in the firm of one redgrave those who knew her then speak of her as a tall handsome girl hard and intensely ambitious from contemporary accounts she seems to have outnietzsched nietzsche nietzsches vision stopped short at the superman jane scobell was a superwoman she had all the titanic selfishness and indifference to the comfort of others which marks the superman and in addition undeniable good looks and a knowledge of the weaknesses of men poor mr redgrave had not had a chance from the start she married him within a year two years later catching the bulls in an unguarded moment mr redgrave despoiled them of a trifle over three million dollars and died the same day of an apoplectic stroke caused by the excitement of victory his widow after a tour in europe returned to the united states and visited pittsburg any sociologist will support the statement that it is difficult almost impossible for an attractive widow visiting pittsburg not to marry a millionaire even if she is not particularly anxious to do so if such an act is the primary object of her visit the thing becomes a certainty groping through the smoke jane redgrave seized and carried off no less a quarry than alexander baynes oakley a widower whose income was one of the seven wonders of the world in the fullness of time he too died and jane oakley was left with the sole control of two vast fortunes  she did not marry again though it was rumored that it took three secretaries working nine hours a day to cope with the written proposals and that butler after butler contracted clergymans sore throat through denying admittance to amorous callers in the ten years after alexander baynes death every impecunious aristocrat in the civilized world must have made his dash for the matrimonial pole but her pale eyes looked them over and dismissed them  during those early years she was tempted once or twice to speculation a failure in a cotton deal not only cured her of this taste but seems to have marked the point in her career when her thoughts began to turn to parsimony until then she had lived in some state but now gradually at first then swiftly she began to cut down her expenses now we find her in an apartment in west central park next in a washington square hotel then in a harlem flat and finallyher last fixed abidingplacein a small cottage on staten island  it was a curious life that she led this woman who could have bought kingdoms if she had willed it a swedish maidofallwork was her only companion by day she would walk in her little garden or dust arrange and wind up her clocks at night she would knit or read one of the frequent reports that arrived at the cottage from charity workers on the east side those were her two hobbies and her only extravagancesclocks and charity  her charity had its limitations in actual money she expended little she was a theoretical philanthropist she lent her influence her time and her advice but seldom her bank balance arrange an entertainment for the delectation of the poor and you would find her on the platform but her name would not be on the list of subscribers to the funds she would deliver a lecture on thrift to an audience of factory girls and she would give them a practical example of what she preached  yet with all its limitations her charity was partly genuine her mind was like a country in the grip of civil war onehalf of her sincerely pitied the poor burned at any story of oppression and cried give but the other cried halt and held her back and between the two she fell                                       it was to this somewhat unpromising haven of refuge that bettys mind now turned in her trouble she did not expect great things she could not have said exactly what she did expect but at least the cottage on staten island offered a restingplace on her journey even if it could not be the journeys end her mad dash from mervo ceased to be objectless it led somewhere     chapter xi  a letter of introduction   new york revisited had much the same effect on betty as it had had on john during his first morning of independence as the liner came up the bay and the great buildings stood out against the clear blue of the sky she felt afraid and lonely that terror which is said to attack immigrants on their first sight of the new york skyline came to her as she leaned on the rail and with it a feeling of utter misery by a continual effort during the voyage she had kept her thoughts from turning to john but now he rose up insistently before her and she realized all that had gone out of her life  she rebelled against the mad cruelty of the fate which had brought them together again it seemed to her now that she must always have loved him but it had been such a vague gentle thing this love before that last meetinghardly more than a pleasant accompaniment to her life something to think about in idle moments a help and a support when things were running crosswise she had been so satisfied with it so content to keep him a mere memory it seemed so needless and wanton to destroy her illusion  of love as a wildbeast passion tearing and torturing quite ordinary persons like herself she had always been a little sceptical the great love poems of the world when she read them had always left her with the feeling that their authors were of different clay from herself and had no common meeting ground with her she had seen her friends fall in love as they called it and it had been very pretty and charming but as far removed from the frenzies of the poets as an amateurs snapshot of niagara from the cataract itself elsa keith for instance was obviously very fond and proud of marvin but she seemed perfectly placid about it she loved but she could still spare half an hour for the discussion of a new frock her soul did not appear to have been revolutionized in any way  gradually betty had come to the conclusion that love in the full sense of the word was one of the things that did not happen and now as if to punish her presumption it had leaped from hiding and seized her  there was nothing exaggerated or unintelligible in the poets now they ceased to be inhabitants of another world swayed by curiously complex emotions they were her brothersordinary men with ordinary feelings and a strange gift for expressing them she knew now that it was possible to hate the man you loved and to love the man you hated to ache for the sight of someone even while you fled from him  it did not take her long to pass the customs a small grip constituted her entire baggage having left this in the keeping of the amiable proprietor of a nearby delicatessen store she made her way to the ferry  her first enquiry brought her to the cottage mrs oakley was a celebrity on staten island  at the door she paused for a moment then knocked  the swede servant she who had been there at her former visit twelve years ago received her stolidly mrs oakley was dusting her clocks  ask her if she can see me said betty im great stepniece sounded too ridiculousim her niece she said  the handmaid went and returned stolid as ever ay tal her vat yu say about niece and she say she not knowing any niece she announced  betty amended the description and presently the swede returned once more and motioned her to enter  like so many scenes of childhood the room of the clocks was sharply stamped on bettys memory and as she came into it now it seemed to her that nothing had changed there were the clocks all round the walls of every shape and size the big clocks with the human faces and the small perky clocks there was the dingy mediumsized clock that held the trumpeter and there looking at her with just the old sandycat expression in her pale eyes was mrs oakley  even the possession of an income of eighteen million dollars and a unique collection of clocks cannot place a woman above the making of the obvious remark  how you have grown said mrs oakley  the words seemed to melt the chill that had gathered around bettys heart she had been prepared to enter into long explanations and the knowledge that these would not be required was very comforting  do you remember me she exclaimed  you are the little girl who clapped her hands at the trumpeter but you are not little now  im not so very big said betty smiling she felt curiously at home and pity for the loneliness of this strange old woman caused her to forget her own troubles  you look pretty when you smile said mrs oakley thoughtfully she continued to look closely at her you are in trouble she said  betty met her eyes frankly  yes she said  the old woman bent her head over a sevres china clock and stroked it tenderly with her feather duster  why did you run away she asked without looking up  betty had a feeling that the ground was being cut from beneath her feet she had expected to have to explain who she was and why she had come and behold both were unnecessary it was uncanny and then the obvious explanation occurred to her  did my stepfather cable she asked  mrs oakley laid down the feather duster and opening a drawer produced some sheets of paperto the initiated eye plainly one of mr scobells lengthy messages  a wickedly extravagant cable she said frowning at it he could have expressed himself perfectly well at a quarter of the expense  betty began to read the dimple on her chin appeared for a moment as she did so the tone of the message was so obsequious there was no trace of the old peremptory note in it the words dearest aunt occurred no fewer than six times in the course of the essay its author being apparently reckless of the fact that it was costing him half a dollar a time mrs oakley had been quite right in her criticism the gist of the cable was betty has run away to america dearest aunt ridiculous is sure to visit you please dearest aunt do not encourage her the rest was pure padding  mrs oakley watched her with a glowering eye if bennie scobell she soliloquized imagines that he can dictate to me she ceased leaving an impressive hiatus unhappy mr scobell convicted of dictation even after three dollars worth of dearest aunt  betty handed back the cable her chin emblem of war was tilted and advanced  ill tell you why i ran away aunt she said  mrs oakley listened to her story in silence betty did not relate it at great length for with every word she spoke the thought of john stabbed her afresh she omitted much that has been told in this chronicle but she disclosed the essential fact that napoleonic mr scobell had tried to force her into a marriage with a man she did notshe hesitated at the worddid not respect she concluded  mrs oakley regarded her inscrutably for a while before replying  respect she said at last i have never met a man in my life whom i could respect harpies every one of them every one of them every one of them  she was muttering to herself it is possible that her thoughts were back with those persevering young aristocrats of her second widowhood certainly if she had sometimes displayed a touch of the pirate in her dealings with man man it must be said in fairness had not always shown his best side to her  respect she muttered again did you like him this prince of yours  bettys eyes filled she made no reply  well never mind said mrs oakley dont cry child im not going to press you you must have hated him or else loved him very much or you would never have run away dictate to me she broke off halfaloud her mind evidently once more on mr scobells unfortunate cable  betty could bear it no longer  i loved him she cried i loved him  she was shaking with dry sobs she felt the old womans eyes upon her but she could not stop  a sudden whirr cut through the silence one of the large clocks near the door was beginning to strike the hour instantly the rest began to do the same till the room was full of the noise and above the din there sounded sharp and clear the note of the little trumpet  the noise died away with metallic echoings  honey  it was a changed voice that spoke betty looked up and saw that the eyes that met hers were very soft she moved quickly to the old womans side  honey im going to tell you something about myself that nobody dreams of betty when i was your age i ran away from a man because i loved him it was just a little village tragedy my dear i think he was fond of me but father was poor and her folks were the great people of the place and he married her and i ran away like you and went to new york  betty pressed her hand it was trembling  im so sorry she whispered  i went to new york because i wanted to kill my heart and i killed it theres only one way work work work she was sitting bolt upright and the soft look had gone out of her eyes they were hard and fiery under the drawn brows work ah i worked i never rested for two years two whole years it fought back at me it tore me to bits but i wouldnt stop i worked on i killed it  she stopped quivering betty was cold with a nameless dismay she felt as if she were standing in the dark on the brink of an abyss  the old woman began to speak again  child its the same with you your hearts tearing you dont let it it will get worse and worse if you are afraid of it fight it kill it work  she stopped again clenching and unclenching her fingers as if she were strangling some living thing there was silence for a long moment  what can you do she asked suddenly  her voice was calm and unemotional again the abruptness of the transition from passion to the practical took betty aback she could not speak  there must be something continued mrs oakley when i was your age i had taught myself bookkeeping shorthand and typewriting what can you do can you use a typewriter  blessed word  yes said betty promptly  well  not very well  hm well i expect you will do it well enough for mr renshawon my recommendation ill give you a letter to him he is the editor of a small weekly paper i dont know how much he will offer you but take it and work youll find him pleasant i have met him at charity organization meetings on the east side hes useful at the entertainmentsdoes conjuring tricksstupid but they seem to amuse people youll find him pleasant there  she had been writing the letter of introduction during the course of these remarks at the last word she blotted it and placed it in an envelope  thats the address she said j brabazon renshaw office of peaceful moments take it to him now goodby  it was as if she were ashamed of her late display of emotion she spoke abruptly and her pale eyes were expressionless betty thanked her and turned to go  tell me how you get on said mrs oakley  yes said betty  and work keep on working  there was a momentary return of her former manner as she spoke the words and betty wavered she longed to say something comforting something that would show that she understood  mrs oakley had taken up the feather duster again  steena will show you out she said curtly and betty was aware of the stolid swede in the doorway the interview was plainly at an end  goodby aunt she said and thank you ever so muchfor everything     chapter xii  peaceful moments   the man in the street did not appear to know it but a great crisis was imminent in new york journalism  everything seemed much as usual in the city the cars ran blithely on broadway newsboys shouted their mystic slogan wuxtry with undiminished vim society thronged fifth avenue without a furrow on its brow at a thousand street corners a thousand policemen preserved their air of massive superiority to the things of this world of all the four million not one showed the least sign of perturbation  nevertheless the crisis was at hand mr j brabazon renshaw editorinchief of peaceful moments was about to leave his post and start on a threemonths vacation  peaceful moments as its name an inspiration of mr renshaws own was designed to imply was a journal of the home it was the sort of paper which the father of the family is expected to take back with him from the office and read aloud to the chicks before bedtime under the shade of the rubber plant  circumstances had left the development of the paper almost entirely to mr renshaw its contents were varied there was a moments in the nursery page conducted by luella granville waterman and devoted mainly to anecdotes of the family canary by jane aged six and similar works of the younger set there was a moments of meditation page conducted by the reverend edwin t philpotts a moments among the masters page consisting of assorted chunks looted from the literature of the past when foreheads were bulged and thoughts profound by mr renshaw himself one or two other special pages a short story answers to correspondents on domestic matters and a moments of mirth page conducted by one b henderson ashera very painful affair  the proprietor of this admirable journal was that napoleon of finance mr benjamin scobell  that this should have been so is but one proof of the manysidedness of that great man  mr scobell had founded peaceful moments at an early stage in his career and it was only at very rare intervals nowadays that he recollected that he still owned it he had so many irons in the fire now that he had no time to waste his brain tissues thinking about a paper like peaceful moments it was one of his failures it certainly paid its way and brought him a small sum each year but to him it was a failure a bombshell that had fizzled  he had intended to do big things with peaceful moments he had meant to start a new epoch in the literature of manhattan  i gottan idea he had said to miss scobell all this yellow journalismred blood and all thatfolks are tired of it they want something milder wholesome see what i mean theres money in it guys make a roll too big to lift by selling soft drinks dont they well im going to run a softdrink paper see  the enterprise had started well to begin with he had found the ideal editor he had met mr renshaw at a downeast gathering presided over by mrs oakley and his napoleonic eye had seen in j brabazon the seeds of domestic greatness before they parted he had come to terms with him nor had the latter failed to justify his intuition he made an admirable editor it was not mr renshaws fault that the new paper had failed to electrify america it was the public on whom the responsibility for the failure must be laid they spoiled the whole thing certain of the faithful subscribed it is true and continued to subscribe but the great heart of the public remained untouched the great heart of the public declined to be interested in the meditations of mr philpotts and the humor of mr b henderson asher and continued to spend its money along the bad old channels the thing began to bore mr scobell he left the conduct of the journal more and more to mr renshaw until finallyit was just after the idea for extracting gold from sea water had struck himhe put the whole business definitely out of his mind his actual words were that he never wanted to see or hear of the darned thing again inasmuch as it gave him a pain in the neck mr renshaw was given a free hand as to the editing and all matters of finance connected with the enterprise were placed in the hands of mr scobells solicitors who had instructions to sell the journal if as its owner crisply put it they could find any chump who was enough of a darned chump to give real money for it up to the present the great army of chumps had fallen short of this ideal standard of darned chumphood  ever since this parting of the ways mr renshaw had been in his element under his guidance peaceful moments had reached a level of domesticity which made other socalled domestic journals look like sporting supplements but at last the work had told upon him whether it was the effort of digging into the literature of the past every week or the strain of reading b henderson ashers moments of mirth is uncertain at any rate his labors had ended in wrecking his health to such an extent that the doctor had ordered him three months complete rest in the woods or mountains whichever he preferred and being a farseeing man who went to the root of things had absolutely declined to consent to mr renshaws suggestion that he keep in touch with the paper during his vacation he was adamant he had seen copies of peaceful moments once or twice and refused to permit a man in mr renshaws state of health to come in contact with luella granville watermans moments in the nursery and b henderson ashers moments of mirth  you must forget that such a paper exists he said you must dismiss the whole thing from your mind live in the open and develop some flesh and muscle  mr renshaw had bowed before the sentence howbeit gloomily and now on the morning of bettys departure from mrs oakleys house with the letter of introduction was giving his final instructions to his temporary successor  this temporary successor in the editorship was none other than johns friend rupert smith late of the news  smith on leaving harvard had been attracted by newspaper work and had found his first billet on a western journal of the type whose society column consists of such items as jim thompson was to town yesterday with a bunch of other cheap skates we take this opportunity of once more informing jim that he is a liar and a skunk and whose editor works with a pistol on his desk and another in his hippocket graduating from this he had proceeded to a reporters post on a daily paper in kentucky where there were blood feuds and other southern devices for preventing life from becoming dull all this was good but even while he enjoyed these experiences new york the magnet had been tugging at him and at last after two eventful years on the kentucky paper he had come east and eventually won through to the staff of the news  his presence in the office of peaceful moments was due to the uncomfortable habit of most of the new york daily papers of cutting down their staff of reporters during the summer the dismissed had to sustain them the knowledge that they would return like the swallows anon and be received back into their old places but in the meantime they suffered the inconvenience of having to support themselves as best they could smith when in the company of halfadozen others he had had to leave the news had heard of the vacant post of assistant editor on peaceful moments and had applied for and received it whereby he was more fortunate than some of his late colleagues though as the character of his new work unrolled itself before him he was frequently doubtful on that point for the atmosphere of peaceful moments however wholesome was certainly not exciting and his happened to be essentially a nature that needed the stimulus of excitement even in park row the denizens of which street are rarely slaves to the conventional and safe he had a wellestablished reputation in this matter others of his acquaintances welcomed excitement when it came to them in the course of the days work but it was smiths practise to go in search of it he was a young man of spirit and resource  his appearance to those who did not know him hardly suggested this he was very tall and thin with a dark solemn face he was a purist in the matter of clothes and even in times of storm and stress presented an immaculate appearance to the world in his left eye attached to a cord he wore a monocle  through this at the present moment he was gazing benevolently at mr renshaw as the latter fussed about the office in the throes of departure to the editors rapid fire of advice and warning he listened with the pleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son frisks before him mr renshaw interested him to smiths mind mr renshaw put him in any show you pleased would alone have been worth the price of admission  well chirruped the holidaymakerhe was a little man with a long neck and he always chirrupedwell i think that is all mr smith oh ah yes the stenographer you will need a new stenographer  the peaceful moments stenographer had resigned her position three days before in order to get married  unquestionably comrade renshaw said smith a blonde  mr renshaw looked annoyed  i have told you before mr smith i object to your addressing me as comrade it is notit is noterfitting  smith waved a deprecating hand  say no more he said i will correct the habit i have been studying the principles of socialism somewhat deeply of late and i came to the conclusion that i must join the cause it looked good to me you work for the equal distribution of property and start in by swiping all you can and sitting on it a noble scheme me for it but i am interrupting you  mr renshaw had to pause for a moment to reorganize his ideas  i thinkah yes i think it would be best perhaps to wait for a day or two in case mrs oakley should recommend someone i mentioned the vacancy in the office to her and she said she would give the matter her attention i should prefer if possible to give the place to her nominee she  has eighteen million a year said smith i understand scatter seeds of kindness  mr renshaw looked at him sharply smiths face was solemn and thoughtful  nothing of the kind the editor said after a pause i should prefer mrs oakleys nominee because mrs oakley is a shrewd practical woman whoerwhowho in fact  just so said smith eying him gravely through the monocle entirely  the scrutiny irritated mr renshaw  do put that thing away mr smith he said  that thing  yes that ridiculous glass put it away  instantly said smith replacing the monocle in his vestpocket you object to it well well many people do we all have these curious likes and dislikes it is these clashings of personal taste which constitute what we call life yes you were saying  mr renshaw wrinkled his forehead  i have forgotten what i intended to say he said querulously you have driven it out of my head  smith clicked his tongue sympathetically mr renshaw looked at his watch  dear me he said i must be going i shall miss my train but i think i have covered the ground quite thoroughly you understand everything  absolutely said smith i look on myself as some engineer controlling a machine with a light hand on the throttle or like some faithful hound whose master  ah there is just one thing mrs julia burdett parslow is a little inclined to be unpunctual with her moments with budding girlhood if this should happen while i am away just write her a letter quite a pleasant letter you understand pointing out the necessity of being in good time she must realize that we are a machine  exactly murmured smith  the machinery of the paper cannot run smoothly unless contributors are in good time with their copy  precisely said smith they are the janitors of the literary world let them turn off the steam heat and where are we if mrs julia burdett parslow is not up to time with the hot air how shall our girlhood escape being nipped in the bud  and there is just one other thing i wish you would correct a slight tendency i have noticed lately in mr asher to be just a triflewell not precisely risky but perhaps a shade broad in his humor  young blood sighed smith young blood  mr asher is a very sensible man and he will understand well that is all i think now i really must be going goodby mr smith  goodby  at the door mr renshaw paused with the air of an exile bidding farewell to his native land sighed and trotted out  smith put his feet upon the table flicked a speck of dust from his coatsleeve and resumed his task of reading the proofs of luella granville watermans moments in the nursery                                       he had not been working long when pugsy maloney the office boy entered  say said pugsy  say on comrade maloney  deres a loidy out dere wit a letter for mr renshaw  have you acquainted her with the fact that mr renshaw has passed to other climes  huh  have you in the course of your conversation with this lady mentioned that mr renshaw has beaten it  sure i did and she says can she see you  smith removed his feet from the table  certainly he said who am i that i should deny people these little treats ask her to come in comrade maloney     chapter xiii  betty makes a friend   betty had appealed to master maloneys esthetic sense of beauty directly she appeared before him it was with regret therefore rather than with the usual calm triumph of the office boy that he informed her that the editor was not in also seeing that she was evidently perturbed by the information he had gone out of his way to suggest that she lay her business whatever it might be before mr renshaws temporary successor  smith received her with oldworld courtesy  will you sit down he said not to wait for comrade renshaw of course he will not be back for another three months perhaps i can help you i am acting editor the work is not light he added gratuitously sometimes the cry goes round new york can smith get through it all will his strength support his unquenchable spirit but i stagger on i do not repine what was it that you wished to see comrade renshaw about  he swung his monocle lightly by its cord for the first time since she had entered the office betty was rather glad that mr renshaw was away conscious of her defects as a stenographer she had been looking forward somewhat apprehensively to the interview with her prospective employer but this long solemn youth put her at her ease his manner suggested in some indefinable way that the whole thing was a sort of round game  i came about the typewriting she said  smith looked at her with interest  are you the nominee  i beg your pardon  do you come from mrs oakley  yes  then all is well the decks have been cleared against your coming consider yourself engaged as our official typist by the way can you type  betty laughed this was certainly not the awkward interview she had been picturing in her mind  yes she said but im afraid im not very good at it  never mind said smith im not very good at editing yet here i am i foresee that we shall make an ideal team together we will toil early and late till we whoop up this domestic journal into a shining model of what a domestic journal should be what that is at present i do not exactly know excursion trains will be run from the middle west to see this domestic journal visitors from oshkosh will do it before going on to grants tomb what exactly is your name  betty hesitated yes perhaps it would be better brown she said  mine is smith the smiling child in the outer office is pugsy maloney one of our most prominent citizens homely in appearance perhaps but one of us you will get to like comrade maloney and now to touch on a painful subjectwork would you care to start in now or have you any other engagements perhaps you wish to see the sights of this beautiful little city before beginning you would prefer to start in now excellent you could not have come at a more suitable time for i was on the very point of sallying out to purchase about twentyfive cents worth of lunch we editors comrade brown find that our tissues need constant restoration such is the strenuous nature of our duties you will find one or two letters on that table goodby then for the present  he picked up his hat smoothed it carefully and with a courtly inclination of his head left the room  betty sat down and began to think so she was really earning her own living it was a stimulating thought she felt a little bewildered she had imagined something so different mrs oakley had certainly said that peaceful moments was a small paper but despite that her imagination had conjured up visions of bustle and activity and a peremptory overdriven editor snapping out words of command smith with his careful speech and general air of calm detachment from the noisy side of life created an atmosphere of restfulness if this was a sample of life in the office she thought the paper had been well named she felt soothed and almost happy  interesting and exciting things new york things began to happen at once to her meditating there entered pugsy maloney the guardian of the gate of this shrine of peace a nonchalant youth of about fifteen with a freckled masklike face the expression of which never varied bearing in his arms a cat the cat was struggling violently but he appeared quite unconscious of it its existence did not seem to occur to him  say said pugsy  betty was fond of cats  oh dont hurt her she cried anxiously  master maloney eyed the cat as if he were seeing it for the first time  i wasnt hoitin her he said without emotion dere was two fresh kids in the street sickin a dawg on to her and i comes up and says gwan what do youse tink youse doin fussin de poor dumb animal an one of de guys he says gwan who do youse tink youse is an i says im de guy whats goin to swat youse on de coco smarty if youse dont quit fussin de poor dumb animal so wit dat he makes a break at swattin me one but i swats him one an i swats de odder feller one an den i swats dem bote some more an i gits de kitty an i brings her in here cos i tinks maybe yousell look after her i cant be boddered myself cats is foolishness  and having finished this homeric narrative master maloney fixed an expressionless eye on the ceiling and was silent  how splendid of you pugsy cried betty she might have been killed poor thing  she had it pretty fierce admitted master maloney gazing dispassionately at the rescued animal which had escaped from his clutch and taken up a strong position on an upper shelf of the bookcase  will you go out and get her some milk pugsy shes probably starving heres a quarter will you keep the change  sure thing assented master maloney  he strolled slowly out while betty mounting a chair proceeded to chirrup and snap her fingers in the effort to establish the foundations of an entente cordiale with the cat  by the time pugsy returned carrying a fivecent bottle of milk the animal had vacated the shelf and was sitting on the table polishing her face the milk having been poured into the lid of a tobacco tin in lieu of a saucer she suspended her operations and adjourned for refreshments pugsy having no immediate duties on hand concentrated himself on the cat  say he said  well  dat kitty pipe de leather collar shes wearin  betty had noticed earlier in the proceedings that a narrow leather collar encircled the animals neck  guess i know where dat kitty belongs dey all has dose collars i guess shes one of bat jarviss kitties hes got twentytree of dem and dey all has dose collars  bat jarvis  sure  who is he  pugsy looked at her incredulously  say aint youse never heard of bat jarvis heshes bat jarvis  do you know him  sure i knows him  does he live near here  sure he lives near here  then i think the best thing for you to do is to run round and tell him that i am taking care of his cat and that he had better come and fetch it i must be getting on with my work or i shall never finish it  she settled down to type the letters smith had indicated she attacked her task cautiously she was one of those typists who are at their best when they do not have to hurry  she was putting the finishing touches to the last of the batch when there was a shuffling of feet in the outer room followed by a knock on the door the next moment there entered a short burly young man around whom there hung like an aroma an indescribable air of toughness partly due perhaps to the fact that he wore his hair in a welloiled fringe almost down to his eyebrows thus presenting the appearance of having no forehead at all his eyes were small and set close together his mouth was wide his jaw prominent not in short the sort of man you would have picked out on sight as a model citizen he blinked furtively as his eyes met bettys and looked round the room his face lighted up as he saw the cat  say he said stepping forward and touching the cats collar maam mine  are you mr jarvis asked betty  the visitor nodded not without a touch of complacency as of a monarch abandoning his incognito  for mr jarvis was a celebrity  by profession he was a dealer in animals birds and snakes he had a fanciers shop on groome street in the heart of the bowery this was on the ground floor his living abode was in the upper story of that house and it was there that he kept the twentythree cats whose necks were adorned with leather collars  but it was not the fact that he possessed twentythree cats with leather collars that had made mr jarvis a celebrity a man may win a local reputation if only for eccentricity by such means mr jarvis reputation was far from being purely local broadway knew him and the tenderloin tammany hall knew him long island city knew him for bat jarvis was the leader of the famous groome street gang the largest and most influential of the four big gangs of the east side  to betty so little does the world often know of its greatest men he was merely a decidedly repellentlooking young man in unbecoming clothes but his evident affection for the cat gave her a feeling of fellowship toward him she beamed upon him and mr jarvis who was wont to face the glare of rivals without flinching avoided her eye and shuffled with embarrassment  im so glad shes safe said betty there were two boys teasing her in the street ive been giving her some milk  mr jarvis nodded with his eyes on the floor  there was a pause then he looked up and fixing his gaze some three feet above her head spoke  say he said and paused again betty waited expectantly  he relaxed into silence again apparently thinking  say he said maam obliged fond of de kit i am  shes a dear said betty tickling the cat under the ear  maam went on mr jarvis pursuing his theme obliged shant fergit it any time youre in bad glad to be of service bat jarvis groome street anybodyll show youse where i live  he paused and shuffled his feet then tucking the cat more firmly under his arm left the room betty heard him shuffling downstairs  he had hardly gone when the door opened again and smith came in  so you have had company while i was away he said who was the grandee with the cat an old childhoods friend was he trying to sell the animal to us  that was mr bat jarvis said betty  smith looked interested  bat what was he doing here  betty related the story of the cat smith nodded thoughtfully  well he said i dont know that comrade jarvis is precisely the sort of friend i would go out of my way to select still you never know what might happen he might come in useful and now let us concentrate ourselves tensely on this very entertaining little journal of ours and see if we cannot stagger humanity with it     chapter xiv  a change of policy   the feeling of tranquillity which had come to betty on her first acquaintance with peaceful moments seemed to deepen as the days went by and with each day she found the sharp pain at her heart less vehement it was still there but it was dulled the novelty of her life and surroundings kept it in check new york is an egotist it will suffer no divided attention look at me says the voice of the city imperiously and its children obey it snatches their thoughts from their inner griefs and concentrates them on the pageant that rolls unceasingly from one end of the island to the other one may despair in new york but it is difficult to brood on the past for new york is the city of the present the city of things that are going on  to betty everything was new and strange her previous acquaintance with the metropolis had not been extensive mr scobells homeor rather the house which he owned in americawas on the outskirts of philadelphia and it was there that she had lived when she was not paying visits occasionally during horseshow week or at some other time of festivity she had spent a few days with friends who lived in madison or upper fifth avenue but beyond that new york was a closed book to her  it would have been a miracle in the circumstances if john and mervo and the whole of the events since the arrival of the great cable had not to some extent become a little dreamlike when she was alone at night and had leisure to think the dream became a reality once more but in her hours of work or what passed for work in the office of peaceful moments and in the hours she spent walking about the streets and observing the ways of this new world of hers it faded everything was so bright and busy every moment had its fresh interest  and above all there was the sense of adventure she was twentyfour she had health and an imagination and almost unconsciously she was stimulated by the thrill of being for the first time in her life genuinely at large the childs love of hiding dies hard in us to betty to walk abroad in new york in the midst of hurrying crowds just betty brownone of four million and no longer the beautiful miss silver of the society column was to taste the romance of disguise or invisibility  during office hours she came near to complete contentment to an expert stenographer the amount of work to be done would have seemed ridiculously small but betty who liked plenty of time for a task generally managed to make it last comfortably through the day  this was partly owing to the fact that her editor when not actually at work himself was accustomed to engage her in conversation and to keep her so engaged until the entrance of pugsy maloney heralded the arrival of some caller  betty liked smith his odd ways his conversation and his extreme solicitude for his clothes amused her she found his outlook on life refreshing smith was an optimist whatever cataclysm might occur he never doubted for a moment that he would be comfortably on the summit of the debris when all was over he amazed betty with his stories of his reportorial adventures he told them for the most part as humorous stories at his own expense but the fact remained that in a considerable proportion of them he had only escaped a sudden and violent death by adroitness or pure good luck his conversation opened up a new world to betty she began to see that in america and especially in new york anything may happen to anybody she looked on smith with new eyes  but surely all this she said one morning after he had come to the end of the story of a highly delicate piece of interviewing work in connection with some cumberland mountains feudists surely all this she looked round the room  domesticity suggested smith  yes said betty surely it all seems rather tame to you  smith sighed  comrade brown he said you have touched the spot with an unerring finger  since mr renshaws departure the flatness of life had come home to smith with renewed emphasis before there had always been the quiet entertainment of watching the editor at work but now he was feeling restless like john at mervo he was practically nothing but an ornament peaceful moments like mervo had been set rolling and had continued to roll on almost automatically the staff of regular contributors sent in their various pages there was nothing for the man in charge to do mr renshaw had been one of those men who have a genius for being as busy over nothing as if it were some colossal work but smith had not that gift he liked something that he could grip and that gripped him he was becoming desperately bored he felt like a marooned sailor on a barren rock of domesticity  a visitor who called at the office at this time did nothing to remove this sensation of being outside everything that made life worth living betty returning to the office one afternoon found smith in the doorway just parting from a thickset young man there was a rather gloomy expression on the thickset young mans face  smith too she noted when they were back in the inner office seemed to have something on his mind he was strangely silent  comrade brown he said at last i wish this little journal of ours had a sporting page  betty laughed  less ribaldry protested smith pained this is a sad affair you saw the man i was talking to that was kid brady i used to know him when i was out west he wants to fight anyone in the country at a hundred and thirtythree pounds we all have our hobbies that is comrade bradys  is he a boxer  he would like to be out west nobody could touch him hes in the championship class but he has been pottering about new york for a month without being able to get a fight if we had a sporting page on peaceful moments we could do him some good but i dont see how we can write him up said smith picking up a copy of the paper and regarding it gloomily in moments in the nursery or moments with budding girlhood  he put up his eyeglass and stared at the offending journal with the air of a vegetarian who has found a caterpillar in his salad incredulity dismay and disgust fought for precedence in his expression  b henderson asher he said severely ought to be in some sort of a home cain killed abel for telling him that story  he turned to another page and scrutinized it with deepening gloom  is luella granville waterman by any chance a friend of yours comrade brown no i am glad for it seems to me that for sheer concentrated piffle she is in a class by herself  he read on for a few moments in silence then looked up and fixed betty with his monocle there was righteous wrath in his eyes  and people he said are paying money for this money even now they are sitting down and writing checks for a years subscription it isnt right its a skin game i am assisting in a carefully planned skin game  but perhaps they like it suggested betty  smith shook his head  it is kind of you to try and soothe my conscience but it is useless i see my position too clearly think of it comrade brown thousands of poor doddering halfwitted creatures in brooklyn and flatbush who ought not really to have control of their own money at all are getting buncoed out of whatever it is per annum in exchange forhow shall i put it in a forcible yet refined and gentlemanly mannerfor cats meat of this description why selling gold bricks is honest compared with it and i am temporarily responsible for the black business  he extended a lean hand with melodramatic suddenness toward betty the unexpectedness of the movement caused her to start back in her chair with a little exclamation of surprise smith nodded with a kind of mournful satisfaction  exactly he said as i expected you shrink from me you avoid my polluted hand how could it be otherwise a conscientious greengoods man would do the same he rose from his seat your attitude he said confirms me in a decision that has been in my mind for some days i will no longer calmly accept this terrible position i will try to make amends while i am in charge i will give our public something worth reading all these watermans and ashers and parslows must go  go  go repeated smith firmly i have been thinking it over for days you cannot look me in the face comrade brown and say that there is a single feature which would not be better away i mean in the paper not in my face every one of these punk pages must disappear letters must be despatched at once informing julia burdett parslow and the others and in particular b henderson asher who on brief acquaintance strikes me as an ideal candidate for a lethal chamberthat unless they cease their contributions instantly we shall call up the police reserves then we can begin to move  betty like most of his acquaintances seldom knew whether smith was talking seriously or not she decided to assume till he should dismiss the idea that he meant what he said  but you cant she exclaimed  with your kind cooperation nothing easier you supply the mechanical work i will compose the letters first b henderson asher dear sir  but she fell back on her original remarkbut you cant what will mr renshaw say when he comes back  sufficient unto the day i have a suspicion that he will be the first to approve his vacation will have made him see things differentlypurified him as it were his conscience will be alive once more  but  why should we worry ourselves because the end of this venture is wrapped in obscurity why columbus didnt know where he was going to when he set out all he knew was some highly interesting fact about an egg what that was i do not at the moment recall but i understand it acted on columbus like a tonic we are the columbuses of the journalistic world full steam ahead and see what happens if comrade renshaw is not pleased why i shall have been a martyr to a good cause it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done so to speak why should i allow possible inconvenience to myself to stand in the way of the happiness which we propose to inject into those brooklyn and flatbush homes are you ready then once more dear sir  betty gave in  when the letters were finished she made one more objection  they are certain to call here and make a fuss she said mr asher and the rest  you think they will not bear the blow with manly fortitude  i certainly do and i think its hard on them too suppose they depend for a living on what they make from peaceful moments  they dont said smith reassuringly ive looked into that have no pity for them they are amateursdegraded creatures of substance who take the cocktails out of the mouths of deserving professionals b henderson asher for instance is largely interested in gents haberdashery and so with the others we touch their pride perhaps but not their purses  bettys soft heart was distinctly relieved by the information  i see she said but suppose they do call what will you do it will be very unpleasant  smith pondered  true he said true i think you are right there my nervous system is so delicately attuned that anything in the shape of a brawl would reduce it to a frazzle i think that for this occasion only we will promote comrade maloney to the post of editor he is a stern hard rugged man who does not care how unpopular he is yes i think that would be best  he signed the letters with a firm hand per pro p maloney editor  then he lit a cigarette and leaned back in his chair  an excellent mornings work he said already i begin to feel the dawnings of a new selfrespect  betty thinking the thing over a little dazed by the rapidity of smiths method of action had found a fresh flaw in the scheme  if you send mr asher and the others away how are you going to bring the paper out at all you cant write it all yourself  smith looked at her with benevolent admiration  she thinks of everything he murmured that busy brain is never still no comrade brown i do not propose to write the whole paper myself i do not shirk work when it gets me in a corner and i cant sidestep but there are limits i propose to apply to a few of my late companions of park row bright boys who will be delighted to come across with redhot stuff for a moderate fee  and the proprietor of the paper wont he make any objection  smith shook his head with a touch of reproof  you seem determined to try to look on the dark side do you insinuate that we are not acting in the proprietors best interests when he gets his check for the receipts after i have handled the paper awhile he will go singing about the streets his beaming smile will be a byword visitors will be shown it as one of the sights his only doubt will be whether to send his money to the bank or keep it in tubs and roll in it and anyway he added hes in europe somewhere and never sees the paper sensible man  he scratched a speck of dust off his coatsleeve with his finger nail  this is a big thing he resumed wait till you see the first number of the new series my idea is that peaceful moments shall become a pretty warm proposition its tone shall be such that the public will wonder why we do not print it on asbestos we shall comment on all the live events of the weekmurders wall street scandals glove fights and the like in a manner which will make our readers spines thrill above all we shall be the guardians of the peoples rights we shall be a spot light showing up the dark places and bringing into prominence those who would endeavor in any way to put the people in dutch we shall detect the wrongdoer and hand him such a series of resentful wallops that he will abandon his little games and become a model citizen in this way we shall produce a bright readable little sheet which will make our city sit up and take notice i think so i think so and now i must be hustling about and seeing our new contributors there is no time to waste     chapter xv  the honeyed word   the offices of peaceful moments were in a large building in a street off madison avenue they consisted of a sort of outer lair where pugsy maloney spent his time reading tales of life on the prairies and heading off undesirable visitors a small room into which desirable but premature visitors were loosed to wait their turn for admission into the presence and a larger room beyond which was the editorial sanctum  smith returning from luncheon on the day following his announcement of the great change found both betty and pugsy waiting in the outer lair evidently with news of import  mr smith began betty  deyre in dere said master maloney with his customary terseness  who exactly asked smith  de whole bunch of dem  smith inspected pugsy through his eyeglass can you give me any particulars he asked patiently you are wellmeaning but vague comrade maloney who are in there  about steen of dem said pugsy  mr asher said betty and mr philpotts and all the rest of them she struggled for a moment but unable to resist the temptation added i told you so  a faint smile appeared upon smiths face  dey just butted in said master maloney resuming his narrative i was sittin here readin me book when de foist of de guys blows in boy says he is de editor in nope i says ill go in and wait says he nuttin doin says i nix on de goinin act i might as well have saved me breat in he butts in about tree minutes along comes another gazebo boy says he is de editor in nope i says ill wait says he lightin out for de door and in he butts wit dat i sees de propositions too fierce for muh i cant keep dese big husky guys out if dey bucks center like dat so when de rest of de bunch comes along i dont try to give dem de trun down i says well gent i says its up to youse de editor aint in but if you feels lonesome push troo deres plenty dere to keep youse company i cant be boddered  and what more could you have said agreed smith approvingly tell me did these gentlemen appear to be gay and lighthearted or did they seem to be looking for someone with a hatchet  dey was hoppin mad de whole bunch of dem  dreadfully attested betty  as i suspected said smith but we must not repine these trifling contretemps are the penalties we pay for our high journalistic aims i fancy that with the aid of the diplomatic smile and the honeyed word i may manage to win out will you come and give me your moral support comrade brown  he opened the door of the inner room for betty and followed her in  master maloneys statement that about steen visitors had arrived proved to be a little exaggerated there were five men in the room  as smith entered every eye was turned upon him to an outside spectator he would have seemed rather like a very welldressed daniel introduced into a den of singularly irritable lions five pairs of eyes were smoldering with a longnursed resentment five brows were corrugated with wrathful lines such however was the simple majesty of smiths demeanor that for a moment there was dead silence not a word was spoken as he paced wrapped in thought to the editorial chair stillness brooded over the room as he carefully dusted that piece of furniture and having done so to his satisfaction hitched up the knees of his trousers and sank gracefully into a sitting position  this accomplished he looked up and started he gazed round the room  ha i am observed he murmured  the words broke the spell instantly the five visitors burst simultaneously into speech  are you the acting editor of this paper  i wish to have a word with you sir  mr maloney i presume  pardon me  i should like a few moments conversation  the start was good and even but the gentleman who said pardon me necessarily finished first with the rest nowhere  smith turned to him bowed and fixed him with a benevolent gaze through his eyeglass  are you mr maloney may i ask enquired the favored one  the others paused for the reply smith shook his head my name is smith  where is mr maloney  smith looked across at betty who had seated herself in her place by the typewriter  where did you tell me mr maloney had gone to miss brown ah well never mind is there anything i can do for you gentlemen i am on the editorial staff of this paper  then maybe said a small round gentleman who so far had done only chorus work you can tell me what all this means my name is waterman sir i am here on behalf of my wife whose name you doubtless know  correct me if i am wrong said smith but i should say it also was waterman  luella granville waterman sir said the little man proudly my wife he went on has received this extraordinary communication from a man signing himself p maloney we are both at a loss to make head or tail of it  it seems reasonably clear to me said smith reading the letter  its an outrage my wife has been a contributor to this journal since its foundation we are both intimate friends of mr renshaw to whom my wifes work has always given complete satisfaction and now without the slightest warning comes this peremptory dismissal from p maloney who is p maloney where is mr renshaw  the chorus burst forth it seemed that that was what they all wanted to know who was p maloney where was mr renshaw  i am the reverend edwin t philpott sir said a cadaverouslooking man with light blue eyes and a melancholy face i have contributed moments of meditation to this journal for some considerable time  smith nodded  i know yours has always seemed to me work which the world will not willingly let die  the reverend edwins frosty face thawed into a bleak smile  and yet continued smith i gather that p maloney on the other hand actually wishes to hurry on its decease strange  a man in a serge suit who had been lurking behind betty bobbed into the open  wheres this fellow maloney p maloney thats the man we want to see ive been working for this paper without a break except when i had the grip for four years and now up comes this maloney fellow if you please and tells me in so many words that the papers got no use for me  these are lifes tragedies sighed smith  what does he mean by it thats what i want to know and thats what these gentlemen want to know see here  i am addressing said smith  ashers my name b henderson asher i write moments of mirth  a look almost of excitement came into smiths face such a look as a visitor to a foreign land might wear when confronted with some great national monument he stood up and shook mr asher reverently by the hand  gentlemen he said reseating himself this is a painful case the circumstances as you will admit when you have heard all are peculiar you have asked me where mr renshaw is i dont know  you dont know exclaimed mr asher  nobody knows with luck you may find a black cat in a coal cellar on a moonless night but not mr renshaw shortly after i joined this journal he started out on a vacation by his doctors orders and left no address no letters were to be forwarded he was to enjoy complete rest who can say where he is now possibly racing down some rugged slope in the rockies with two grizzlies and a wildcat in earnest pursuit possibly in the midst of florida everglades making a noise like a piece of meat in order to snare alligators who can tell  silent consternation prevailed among his audience  then do you mean to say demanded mr asher that this fellow maloneys the boss here and that what he says goes  smith bowed  exactly a man of intensely masterful character he will brook no opposition i am powerless to sway him suggestions from myself as to the conduct of the paper would infuriate him he believes that radical changes are necessary in the policy of peaceful moments and he will carry them through if it snows doubtless he would gladly consider your work if it fitted in with his ideas a rapidfire impression of a glove fight a spineshaking word picture of a railway smash or something on those lines would be welcomed but  i have never heard of such a thing said mr waterman indignantly  in this life said smith shaking his head we must be prepared for every emergency we must distinguish between the unusual and the impossible it is unusual for the acting editor of a weekly paper to revolutionize its existing policy and you have rashly ordered your life on the assumption that it is impossible you are unprepared the thing comes on you as a surprise the cry goes round new york comrades asher waterman philpotts and others have been taken unawares they cannot cope with the situation  but what is to be done cried mr asher  nothing i fear except to wait it may be that when mr renshaw having dodged the bears and eluded the wildcat returns to his post he will decide not to continue the paper on the lines at present mapped out he should be back in about ten weeks  ten weeks  till then the only thing to do is to wait you may rely on me to keep a watchful eye on your interests when your thoughts tend to take a gloomy turn say to yourselves all is well smith is keeping a watchful eye on our interests  all the same i should like to see this p maloney said mr asher  i shouldnt said smith i speak in your best interests p maloney is a man of the fiercest passions he cannot brook interference if you should argue with him there is no knowing what might not happen he would be the first to regret any violent action when once he had cooled off but of course if you wish it i could arrange a meeting no i think you are wise and now gentlemen as i have a good deal of work to get through  all very disturbing to the man of culture and refinement said smith as the door closed behind the last of the malcontents but i think that we may now consider the line clear i see no further obstacle in our path i fear i have made comrade maloney perhaps a shade unpopular with our late contributors but these things must be we must clench our teeth and face them manfully he suffers in an excellent cause     chapter xvi  two visitors to the office   there was once an editor of a paper in the far west who was sitting at his desk musing pleasantly on life when a bullet crashed through the window and imbedded itself in the wall at the back of his head a happy smile lighted up the editors face ah he said complacently i knew that personal column of ours would make a hit  what the bullet was to the far west editor the visit of mr martin parker to the offices of peaceful moments was to smith  it occurred shortly after the publication of the second number of the new series and was directly due to bettys first and only suggestion for the welfare of the paper  if the first number of the series had not staggered humanity it had at least caused a certain amount of comment the warm weather had begun and there was nothing much going on in new york the papers were consequently free to take notice of the change in the policy of peaceful moments through the agency of smiths newspaper friends it received some very satisfactory free advertisement and the sudden increase in the sales enabled smith to bear up with fortitude against the numerous letters of complaint from old subscribers who did not know what was good for them visions of a large new public which should replace these brooklyn and flatbush ingrates filled his mind  the sporting section of the paper pleased him most the personality of kid brady bulked large in it a photograph of the ambitious pugilist looking moody and important in an attitude of selfdefense filled half a page and under the photograph was the legend jimmy garvin must meet this boy jimmy was the present holder of the lightweight title he had won it a year before and since then had confined himself to smoking cigars as long as walking sticks and appearing nightly in a vaudeville sketch entitled a fight for honor his reminiscences were being published in a sunday paper it was this that gave smith the idea of publishing kid bradys autobiography in peaceful moments an idea which won the kids wholehearted gratitude like most pugilists he had a passion for bursting into print print is the fighters accolade it signifies that he has arrived he was grateful to smith too for not editing his contributions jimmy garvin groaned under the supervision of a member of the staff of his sunday paper who deleted his best passages and altered the rest into addisonian english the readers of peaceful moments got their brady raw  comrade brady said smith meditatively to betty one morning has a singularly pure and pleasing style it is bound to appeal powerfully to the manyheaded listen to this our hero is fighting one benson in the latters home town san francisco and the audience is rooting hard for the native son here is comrade brady on the subject i looked around that house and i seen i hadnt a friend in it and then the gong goes and i says to myself how i has one friend my old mother down in illinois and i goes in and mixes it and then i seen benson losing his goat so i gives him a halfscissor hook and in the next round i picks up a sleepproducer from the floor and hands it to him and he takes the count that is what the public wants crisp lucid and to the point if that does not get him a fight with some eminent person nothing will  he leaned back in his chair  what we really need now he said thoughtfully is a good honest muckraking series thats the thing to put a paper on the map the worst of it is that everything seems to have been done have you by any chance a second frenzied finance at the back of your mind or proofs that nut sundaes are composed principally of ptomaine and outlying portions of the american workingman it would be the making of us  now it happened that in the course of her rambles through the city betty had lost herself one morning in the slums the experience had impressed itself on her mind with an extraordinary vividness her lot had always been cast in pleasant places and she had never before been brought into close touch with this side of life the sight of actual raw misery had come home to her with an added force from that circumstance wandering on she had reached a street which eclipsed in cheerlessness even its squalid neighbors all the smells and noises of the east side seemed to be penned up here in a sort of canyon the masses of dirty clothes hanging from the fireescapes increased the atmosphere of depression groups of ragged children covered the roadway  it was these that had stamped the scene so indelibly on her memory she loved children and these seemed so draggled and uncaredfor  smiths words gave her an idea  do you know broster street mr smith she asked  down on the east side yes i went there once to get a story one redhot night in august when i was on the news the ice company had been putting up their prices and trouble was expected down there i was sent to cover it  he did not add that he had spent a weeks salary that night buying ice and distributing it among the denizens of broster street  its an awful place said betty her eyes filling with tears those poor children  smith nodded  some of those tenement houses are fierce he said thoughtfully like betty he found himself with a singularly clear recollection of his one visit to broster street but you cant do anything  why not cried betty oh why not surely you couldnt have a better subject for your series its wicked people only want to be told about them to make them better why cant we draw attention to them  its been done already not about broster street but about other tenements tenements as a subject are played out the public isnt interested in them besides it wouldnt be any use you cant tree the man who is really responsible unless you can spend thousands scaring up evidence the land belongs in the first place to some corporation or other they lease it to a lessee when theres a fuss they say they arent responsible its up to the lessee and he bright boy lies so low you cant find out who it is  but we could try urged betty  smith looked at her curiously the cause was plainly one that lay near to her heart her face was flushed and eager he wavered and having wavered he did what no practical man should do he allowed sentiment to interfere with business he knew that a series of articles on broster street would probably be so much dead weight on the paper something to be skipped by the average reader but he put the thought aside  very well he said if you care to turn in a few crisp remarks on the subject ill print them  bettys first instalment was ready on the following morning it was a curious composition a critic might have classed it with kid bradys reminiscences for there was a complete absence of literary style it was just a wail of pity and a cry of indignation straight from the heart and split up into paragraphs  smith read it with interest and sent it off to the printer unaltered  have another ready for next week comrade brown he said its a long shot but this might turn out to be just what we need  and when two days after the publication of the number containing the article mr martin parker called at the office he felt that the long shot had won out  he was holding forth on life in general to betty shortly before the luncheon hour when pugsy maloney entered bearing a card  martin parker said smith taking it i dont know him we make new friends daily  hes a guy wit a tallshaped hat volunteered master maloney an hes wearing a dude suit an shiny shoes  comrade parker said smith approvingly has evidently not been blind to the importance of a visit to peaceful moments he has dressed himself in his best he has felt rightly that this is no occasion for the flannel suit and the old straw hat i would not have it otherwise it is the right spirit show the guy in we will give him audience  pugsy withdrew  mr martin parker proved to be a man who might have been any age between thirtyfive and fortyfive he had a dark face and a black mustache as pugsy had stated in effect he wore a morning coat trousers with a crease which brought a smile of kindly approval to smiths face and patentleather shoes of pronounced shininess  i want to see the editor he said  will you take a seat said smith  he pushed a chair toward the visitor who seated himself with the care inspired by a perfect trouser crease there was a momentary silence while he selected a spot on the table on which to place his hat  i have come about a private matter he said looking meaningly at betty who got up and began to move toward the door smith nodded to her and she went out  say said mr parker hasnt something happened to this paper these last few weeks it used not to take such an interest in things used it  you are very right responded smith comrade renshaws methods were good in their way i have no quarrel with comrade renshaw but he did not lead public thought he catered exclusively to children with water on the brain and men and women with solid ivory skulls i feel that there are other and larger publics i cannot content myself with ladling out a weekly dole of predigested mental breakfast food i  then you i guess said mr parker are responsible for this broster street thing  at any rate i approve of it and put it in the paper if any husky guy as comrade maloney would put it is anxious to aim a swift kick at the author of that article he can aim it at me  i see said mr parker he paused it said number one in the paper does that mean there are going to be more of them  there is no flaw in your reasoning there are to be several more  mr parker looked at the door it was closed he bent forward  see here he said im going to talk straight if youll let me  assuredly comrade parker there must be no secrets no restraint between us i would not have you go away and say to yourself did i make my meaning clear was i too elusive  mr parker scratched the floor with the point of a gleaming shoe he seemed to be searching for words  say on urged smith have you come to point out some flaw in that article does it fall short in any way of your standard for such work  mr parker came to the point  if i were you he said i should quit it i shouldnt go on with those articles  why enquired smith  because said mr parker  he looked at smith and smiled slowly an ingratiating smile smith did not respond  i do not completely gather your meaning he said i fear i must ask you to hand it to me with still more breezy frankness do you speak from purely friendly motives are you advising me to discontinue the series because you fear that it will damage the literary reputation of the paper do you speak solely as a literary connoisseur or are there other reasons  mr parker leaned forward  the gentleman whom i represent  then this is no matter of your own personal taste there is another  see here im representing a gentleman who shall be nameless and ive come on his behalf to tip you off to quit this game these articles of yours are liable to cause him inconvenience  financial do you mean that he may possibly have to spend some of his spare doubloons in making broster street fit to live in  its not so much the money its the publicity there are reasons why he would prefer not to have it made too public that hes the owner of the tenements down there  well he knows what to do if he makes broster street fit for a nottoofastidious pig to live in  mr parker coughed a tentative cough suggesting that the situation was now about to enter upon a more delicate phase  now see here sir he said im going to be frank im going to put my cards on the table and see if we cant fix something up now see here we dont want any unpleasantness you arent in this business for your health eh youve got your living to make same as everybody else i guess well this is how it stands to a certain extent i dont mind owning since were being frank with one another youve got usthats to say this gentleman im speaking ofin a cleft stick frankly that broster street story of yours has attracted attentioni saw it myself in two sunday papersand if theres going to be any more of themwell now heres a square proposition how much do you want to stop those articles thats straight ive been frank with you and i want you to be frank with me whats your figure name it and if you dont want the earth i guess we neednt quarrel  he looked expectantly at smith smith gazing sadly at him through his monocle spoke quietly with the restrained dignity of some old roman senator dealing with the enemies of the republic  comrade parker he said i fear that you have allowed your intercourse with this worldly city to undermine your moral sense it is useless to dangle rich bribes before the editorial eyes peaceful moments cannot be muzzled you doubtless mean well according to your somewhat murky lights but we are not for sale except at fifteen cents weekly from the hills of maine to the everglades of florida from portland oregon to melonsquashville tennessee one sentence is in every mans mouth and what is that sentence i give you three guesses you give it up it is this peaceful moments cannot be muzzled  mr parker rose  nothing doing then he said  nothing  mr parker picked up his hat  see here he said a grating note in his voice hitherto smooth and conciliatory ive no time to fool away talking to you ive given you your chance those stories are going to be stopped and if youve any sense in you at all youll stop them yourself before you get hurt thats all ive got to say and that goes  he went out closing the door behind him with a bang that added emphasis to his words  all very painful and disturbing murmured smith comrade brown he called  betty came in  did our late visitor bite a piece out of you on his way out he was in the mood to do something of the sort  he seemed angry said betty  he was angry said smith do you know what has happened comrade brown with your very first contribution to the paper you have hit the bullseye you have done the state some service friend parker came as the representative of the owner of those broster street houses he wanted to buy us off weve got them scared or he wouldnt have shown his hand with such refreshing candor have you any engagements at present  i was just going out to lunch if you could spare me  not alone this lunch is on the office as editor of this journal i will entertain you if you will allow me to a magnificent banquet peaceful moments is grateful to you peaceful moments he added with the contented look the far west editor must have worn as the bullet came through the window is owing to you going some now                                       when they returned from lunch and reentered the outer office pugsy maloney raising his eyes for a moment from his book met them with the information that another caller had arrived and was waiting in the inner room  deres a guy in dere waitin to see youse he said jerking his head towards the door  yet another guy this is our busy day did he give a name  says his names maude said master maloney turning a page  maude cried betty falling back  smith beamed  old john maude he said great ive been wondering what on earth hes been doing with himself all this time goodold john youll like him he said turning and stopped abruptly for he was speaking to the empty air betty had disappeared  wheres miss brown pugsy he said where did she go  pugsy vouchsafed another jerk of the head in the direction of the outer door  shes beaten it he said i seen her make a break for de stairs guess shes forgotten to remember someting he added indifferently turning once more to his romance of prairie life goils is boneheads     chapter xvii  the man at the astor   refraining from discussing with master maloney the alleged boneheadedness of girls smith went through into the inner room and found john sitting in the editorial chair glancing through the latest number of peaceful moments  why john friend of my youth he said where have you been hiding all this time i called you up at your office weeks ago and an acid voice informed me that you were no longer there have you been fired  yes said john why arent you on the news any more nobody seemed to know where you were till i met faraday this morning who told me you were here  smith was conscious of an impression that in some subtle way john had changed since their last meeting for a moment he could not have said what had given him this impression then it flashed upon him before john had always been like mrs fezziwig in the christmas carol one vast substantial smile he had beamed cheerfully on what to him was evidently the best of all possible worlds now however it would seem that doubts had occurred to him as to the universal perfection of things his face was graver his eyes and his mouth alike gave evidence of disturbing happenings  in the matter of confidences smith was not a believer in spadework if they were offered to him he was invariably sympathetic but he never dug for them that john had something on his mind was obvious but he intended to allow him if he wished to reveal it to select his own time for the revelation  john for his part had no intention of sharing this particular trouble even with smith it was too new and intimate for discussion  it was only since his return to new york that the futility of his quest had really come home to him in the belief of having at last escaped from mervo he had been inclined to overlook obstacles it had seemed to him while he waited for his late subjects to dismiss him that once he could move all would be simple new york had dispelled that idea logically he saw with perfect clearness there was no reason why he and betty should ever meet again  to retain a spark of hope beneath this knowledge was not easy and john having been in new york now for nearly three weeks without any encouragement from the fates was near the breaking point a gray apathy had succeeded the frenzied restlessness of the first few days the necessity for some kind of work that would to some extent occupy his mind was borne in upon him and the thought of smith had followed naturally if anybody could supply distraction it would be smith faraday another of the temporary exiles from the news whom he had met by chance in washington square had informed him of smiths new position and of the renaissance of peaceful moments and he had hurried to the office to present himself as an unskilled but willing volunteer to the cause inspection of the current number of the paper had convinced him that the peaceful moments atmosphere if it could not cure would at least relieve  faraday told me all about what you had done to this paper he said i came to see if you would let me in on it i want work  excellent said smith consider yourself one of us  ive never done any newspaper work of course but  never cried smith is it so long since the deaf old college days that you forget the gridiron  in their last year at harvard smith and john assisted by others of a congenial spirit had published a small but lively magazine devoted to college topics with such successfrom one point of viewthat on the appearance of the third number it was suppressed by the authorities  you were the life and soul of the gridiron went on smith you shall be the life and soul of peaceful moments you have special qualifications for the post a young man once called at the office of a certain newspaper and asked for a job have you any specialty enquired the editor yes replied the bright boy i am rather good at invective any particular kind of invective queried the man up top no replied our hero just general invective such is your case my son you have a genius for general invective you are the man peaceful moments has been waiting for  if you think so  i do think so let us consider it settled and now tell me what do you think of our little journal  wellarent you asking for trouble isnt the proprietor  smith waved his hand airily  dismiss him from your mind he said he is a gentleman of the name of benjamin scobell who  benjamin scobell  who lives in europe and never sees the paper i happen to know that he is anxious to get rid of it his solicitors have instructions to accept any reasonable offer if only i could close in on a small roll i would buy it myself for by the time we have finished our improvements it will be a sound investment for the young speculator have you read the broster street story it has hit somebody already already some unknown individual is grasping the lemon in his unwilling fingers andto remove any diffidence you may still have about lending your sympathetic aidthat was written by no hardened professional but by our stenographer shell be in soon and ill introduce you youll like her i do not despair later on of securing an epochmaking contribution from comrade maloney  as he spoke that bulwark of the paper entered in person bearing an envelope  ah comrade maloney said smith is that your contribution what is the subject mustangs i have met  a kid brought dis said pugsy dere aint no answer  smith read the letter with raised eyebrows  we shall have to get another stenographer he said the gifted author of our broster street series has quit  oh said john not interested  quit at a moments notice and without explanation i cant understand it  i guess she had some reason said john absently he was inclined to be absent during these days his mind was always stealing away to occupy itself with the problem of the discovery of betty the motives that might have led a stenographer to resign her position had no interest for him  smith shrugged his shoulders  oh woman woman he said resignedly  she says she will send in some more broster street stuff though which is a comfort but im sorry shes quit you would have liked her  yes said john  at this moment there came from the outer office a piercing squeal it penetrated into the editorial sanctum losing only a small part of its strength on the way smith looked up with patient sadness  if comrade maloney he said is going to take to singing during business hours i fear this journal must put up its shutters concentrated thought will be out of the question  he moved to the door and flung it open as a second squeal rent the air and found master maloney writhing in the grip of a toughlooking person in patched trousers and a stained sweater his left ear was firmly grasped between the strangers finger and thumb  the tough person released pugsy and having eyed smith keenly for a moment made a dash for the stairs leaving the guardian of the gate rubbing his ear resentfully  he blows in said master maloney aggrieved an asks is de editor in i tells him no an he nips me by the ear when i tries to stop him buttin troo  comrade maloney said smith you are a martyr what would horatius have done if somebody had nipped him by the ear when he was holding the bridge it might have made all the difference did the gentleman state his business  nope just tried to butt troo  one of these strong silent men the world is full of us these are the perils of the journalistic life you will be safer and happier when you are a cowboy comrade maloney  smith was thoughtful as he returned to the inner room  things are warming up john he said the sport who has just left evidently came just to get a sight of me otherwise why should he tear himself away without stopping for a chat i suppose he was sent to mark me down for whichever gang comrade parker is employing  what do you mean said john all this gets past me who is parker  smith related the events leading up to mr parkers visit and described what had happened on that occasion  so before you throw in your lot with this journal he concluded it would be well to think the matter over you must weigh the pros and cons is your passion for literature such that you do not mind being put out of business with a blackjack for the cause will the knowledge that a lowbrowed gentleman is waiting round the corner for you stimulate or hinder you in your work theres no doubt now that we are up against a tough crowd  by jove said john i hadnt a notion it was like that  you feel then that on the whole  i feel that on the whole this is just the business ive been hunting for you couldnt keep me out of it now with an ax  smith looked at him curiously but refrained from enquiries that there must be something at the back of this craving for adventure and excitement he knew the easygoing john he had known of old would certainly not have deserted the danger zone but he would not have welcomed entry to it so keenly it was plain that he was hungry for work that would keep him from thought smith was eminently a patient young man and though the problem of what upheaval had happened to change john to such an extent interested him greatly he was prepared to wait for explanations  of the imminence of the danger he was perfectly aware he had known from the first that mr parkers concluding words were not an empty threat his experience as a reporter had given him the knowledge that is only given in its entirety to police and newspaper men that there are two new yorksone a modern wellpoliced city through which one may walk from end to end without encountering adventure the other a city as full of sinister intrigue of whisperings and conspiracies of battle murder and sudden death in dark byways as any town of mediaeval italy given certain conditions anything may happen in new york and smith realized that these conditions now prevailed in his own case he had come into conflict with new yorks underworld circumstances had placed him below the surface where only his wits could help him  he would have been prepared to see the thing through by himself but there was no doubt that john as an ally would be a distinct comfort  nevertheless he felt compelled to give his friend a last chance of withdrawing  you know he said there is really no reason why you should  but im going to interrupted john thats all there is to it whats going to happen anyway i dont know anything about these gangs i thought they spent all their time shooting each other up  not all unfortunately comrade john they are always charmed to take on a small job like this on the side  and what does it come to do we have an entire gang camping on our trail in a solid mass or only one or two toughs  merely a section i should imagine comrade parker would go to the main boss of the gangbat jarvis if it was the groome street gang or spider reilly and dude dawson if he wanted the three points or the table hill lot the boss would chat over the matter with his own special partners and they would fix it up among themselves the rest of the gang would probably know nothing about it the fewer in the game you see the fewer to divide the parker dollars so what we have to do is to keep a lookout for a dozen or so aristocrats of that dignified deportment which comes from constant association with the main boss and if we can elude these all will be well                                       it was by smiths suggestion that the editorial staff of peaceful moments dined that night at the astor roofgarden  the tired brain he said needs to recuperate to feed on such a night as this in some lowdown hostelry on the level of the street with german waiters breathing heavily down the back of ones neck and two fiddles and a piano hitting up ragtime about three feet from ones tympanum would be false economy here fanned by cool breezes and surrounded by passably fair women and brave men one may do a certain amount of tissuerestoring moreover there is little danger up here of being slugged by our motheaten acquaintance of this afternoon we shall probably find him waiting for us at the main entrance with a blackjack but till then  he turned with gentle grace to his soup it was a warm night and the roofgarden was full from where they sat they could see the million twinkling lights of the city john watching them as he smoked a cigarette at the conclusion of the meal had fallen into a dream he came to himself with a start to find smith in conversation with a waiter  yes my name is smith he was saying  the waiter retired to one of the tables and spoke to a young man sitting there john recollected having seen this solitary diner looking in their direction once or twice during dinner but the fact had not impressed him  whats the matter he asked  the man at that table sent over to ask if my name was smith it was he is now coming along to chat in person i wonder why i dont know him from adam  the stranger was threading his way between the tables  can i have a word with you mr smith he said the waiter brought a chair and he seated himself  by the way said smith my friend mr maude your own name will doubtless come up in the course of general chitchat over the coffeecups  not on your tintype it wont said the stranger decidedly it wont be needed is mr maude on your paper thats all right then i can go ahead  he turned to smith  its about that broster street thing  more fame murmured smith we certainly are making a hit with the great public over broster street  well you understand certain parties have got it in against you  a charming conversationalist one comrade parker hinted at something of the sort in a recent conversation we shall endeavor however to look after ourselves  youll need to the man behind is a big bug  who is he  the stranger shrugged his shoulders  search me you wouldnt expect him to give that away  then on what system have you estimated the size of the gentlemans bughood what makes you think that hes a big bug  by the number of dollars he was ready to put up to have you put through  smiths eyes gleamed for an instant but he spoke as coolly as ever  oh he said and which gang has he hired  i couldnt say hehis agent that iscame to bat jarvis bat for some reason turned the job down  he did why  search me nobody knows but just as soon as he heard who it was he was being asked to lay for he turned it down cold said none of his fellows was going to put a finger on anyone who had anything to do with your paper i dont know what youve been doing to bat but he sure is the longlost brother to you  a powerful argument in favor of kindness to animals said smith one of his celebrated stud of cats came into the possession of our stenographer what did she do instead of having the animal made into a nourishing soup she restored it to its bereaved owner observe the sequel we are very much obliged to comrade jarvis  he sent me along went on the stranger to tell you to watch out because one of the other gangs was dead sure to take on the job and he said you were to know that he wasnt mixed up in it well thats all ill be pushing along ive a date glad to have met you mr maude goodnight  for a few moments after he had gone smith and john sat smoking in silence  whats the time asked smith suddenly if its not too latehello here comes our friend once more  the stranger came up to the table a light overcoat over his dress clothes from the pocket of this he produced a watch  force of habit he said apologetically handing it to john youll pardon me goodnight again     chapter xviii  the highfield   john looked after him openmouthed the events of the evening had been a revelation to him he had not realized the ramifications of new yorks underworld that members of the gangs should appear in gorgeous raiment in the astor roofgarden was a surprise and now said smith that our friend has so sportingly returned your watch take a look at it and see the time nine excellent we shall do it comfortably  whats that asked john  our visit to the highfield a young friend of mine who is fighting there tonight sent me tickets a few days ago in your perusal of peaceful moments you may have chanced to see mention of one kid brady he is the man i was intending to go in any case but an idea has just struck me that we might combine pleasure with business has it occurred to you that these blackjack specialists may drop in on us at the office and if so that comrade maloneys statement that we are not in may be insufficient to keep them out comrade brady would be an invaluable assistant and as we are his pugilistic sponsors without whom he would not have got this fight at all i think we may say that he will do any little thing we may ask of him  it was certainly true that from the moment the paper had taken up his cause kid bradys star had been in the ascendant the sporting pages of the big dailies had begun to notice him until finally the management of the highfield club had signed him on for a tenround bout with a certain cyclone dick fisher  he should continued smith if equipped in any degree with the finer feelings be bubbling over with gratitude toward us at any rate it is worth investigating                                       far away from the comfortable glare of broadway in a place of disheveled houses and insufficient streetlamps there stands the old warehouse which modern enterprise has converted into the highfield athletic and gymnastic club the imagination stimulated by the title conjures up picturecovered walls padded chairs and seas of white shirt front the highfield differs in some respects from this fancy picture indeed it would be hard to find a respect in which it does not differ but these names are so misleading the title under which the highfield used to be known till a few years back was swifty bobs it was a good honest title you knew what to export and if you attended seances at swifty bobs you left your gold watch and your little savings at home but a wave of antipugilistic feeling swept over the new york authorities promoters of boxing contests found themselves to their acute disgust raided by the police the industry began to languish persons avoided places where at any moment the festivities might be marred by an inrush of large men in blue uniforms armed with locust sticks  and then some bigbrained person suggested the club idea which stands alone as an example of american dry humor at once there were no boxing contests in new york swifty bob and his fellows would have been shocked at the idea of such a thing all that happened now was exhibition sparring bouts between members of the club it is true that next day the papers very tactlessly reported the friendly exhibition spar as if it had been quite a serious affair but that was not the fault of swifty bob  kid brady the chosen of peaceful moments was billed for a tenround exhibition contest to be the main event of the evenings entertainment                                       a long journey on the subway took them to the neighborhood and after considerable wandering they arrived at their destination  smiths tickets were for a ringside box a species of sheep pen of unpolished wood with four hard chairs in it the interior of the highfield athletic and gymnastic club was severely free from anything in the shape of luxury and ornament along the four walls were raised benches in tiers on these were seated as toughlooking a collection of citizens as one might wish to see on chairs at the ringside were the reporters with tickers at their sides in the center of the room brilliantly lighted by halfadozen electric chandeliers was the ring  there were preliminary bouts before the main event a burly gentleman in shirtsleeves entered the ring followed by two slim youths in fighting costume and a massive person in a red jersey blue serge trousers and yellow braces who chewed gum with an abstracted air throughout the proceedings  the burly gentleman gave tongue in a voice that cleft the air like a cannon ball  exhibition fourround bout between patsy milligan and tommy goodley members of this club patsy on my right tommy on my left gentlemen will kindly stop smokin  the audience did nothing of the sort possibly they did not apply the description to themselves possibly they considered the appeal a mere formula somewhere in the background a gong sounded and patsy from the right stepped briskly forward to meet tommy approaching from the left  the contest was short but energetic at intervals the combatants would cling affectionately to one another and on these occasions the redjerseyed man still chewing gum and still wearing the same air of being lost in abstract thought would split up the mass by the simple method of ploughing his way between the pair toward the end of the first round thomas eluding a left swing put patrick neatly to the floor where the latter remained for the necessary ten seconds  the remaining preliminaries proved disappointing so much so that in the last of the series a soured sportsman on one of the benches near the roof began in satirical mood to whistle the merry widow waltz it was here that the redjerseyed thinker for the first and last time came out of his meditative trance he leaned over the ropes and spoke without heat but firmly  if that guy whistling back up yonder thinks he can do better than these boys he can come right down into the ring  the whistling ceased  there was a distinct air of relief when the last preliminary was finished and preparations for the main bout began it did not commence at once there were formalities to be gone through introductions and the like the burly gentleman reappeared from nowhere ushering into the ring a sheepishly grinning youth in a flannel suit  interdoocin young leary he bellowed impressively a noo member of this club who will box some good boy here in september  he walked to the other side of the ring and repeated the remark a raucous welcome was accorded to the new member  two other notable performers were introduced in a similar manner and then the building became suddenly full of noise for a tall youth in a bath robe attended by a little army of assistants had entered the ring one of the army carried a bright green bucket on which were painted in white letters the words cyclone dick fisher a moment later there was another though a far less uproar as kid brady his pleasant face wearing a selfconscious smirk ducked under the ropes and sat down in the opposite corner  exhibition tenround bout thundered the burly gentleman between cyclone dick fisher  loud applause mr fisher was one of the famous a fighter with a reputation from new york to san francisco he was generally considered the most likely man to give the hitherto invincible jimmy garvin a hard battle for the lightweight championship  oh you dick roared the crowd  mr fisher bowed benevolently  and kid brady member of this  there was noticeably less applause for the kid he was an unknown a few of those present had heard of his victories in the west but these were but a small section of the crowd when the faint applause had ceased smith rose to his feet  oh you kid he observed encouragingly i should not like comrade brady he said reseating himself to think that he has no friend but his poor old mother as occurred on a previous occasion  the burly gentleman followed by the two armies of assistants dropped down from the ring and the gong sounded  mr fisher sprang from his corner as if somebody had touched a spring he seemed to be of the opinion that if you are a cyclone it is never too soon to begin behaving like one he danced round the kid with an indiarubber agility the peaceful moments representative exhibited more stolidity except for the fact that he was in fighting attitude with one gloved hand moving slowly in the neighborhood of his stocky chest and the other pawing the air on a line with his square jaw one would have said that he did not realize the position of affairs he wore the friendly smile of the goodnatured guest who is led forward by his hostess to join in some game to amuse the children  suddenly his opponents long left shot out the kid who had been strolling forward received it under the chin and continued to stroll forward as if nothing of note had happened he gave the impression of being aware that mr fisher had committed a breach of good taste and of being resolved to pass it off with ready tact  the cyclone having executed a backward leap a forward leap and a feint landed heavily with both hands the kids genial smile did not even quiver but he continued to move forward his opponents left flashed out again but this time instead of ignoring the matter the kid replied with a heavy right swing and mr fisher leaping back found himself against the ropes by the time he had got out of that uncongenial position two more of the kids swings had found their mark mr fisher somewhat perturbed scuttled out into the middle of the ring the kid following in his selfcontained stolid way  the cyclone now became still more cyclonic he had a left arm which seemed to open out in joints like a telescope several times when the kid appeared well out of distance there was a thud as a brown glove ripped in over his guard and jerked his head back but always he kept boring in delivering an occasional right to the body with the pleased smile of an infant destroying a noahs ark with a tackhammer despite these efforts however he was plainly getting all the worst of it energetic mr fisher relying on his long left was putting in three blows to his one when the gong sounded ending the first round the house was practically solid for the cyclone whoops and yells rose from everywhere the building rang with shouts of oh you dick  smith turned sadly to john  it seems to me he said that this merry meeting looks like doing comrade brady no good i should not be surprised at any moment to see his head bounce off on to the floor  rounds two and three were a repetition of round one the cyclone raged almost unchecked about the ring in one lightning rally in the third he brought his right across squarely on to the kids jaw it was a blow which should have knocked any boxer out the kid merely staggered slightly and returned to business still smiling  with the opening of round four there came a subtle change the cyclones fury was expending itself that long left shot out less sharply instead of being knocked back by it the peaceful moments champion now took the hits in his stride and came shuffling in with his damaging bodyblows there were cheers and oh you dicks at the sound of the gong but there was an appealing note in them this time the gallant sportsmen whose connection with boxing was confined to watching other men fight and betting on what they considered a certainty and who would have expired promptly if anyone had tapped them sharply on their wellfilled vests were beginning to fear that they might lose their money after all  in the fifth round the thing became a certainty like the month of march the cyclone who had come in like a lion was going out like a lamb a slight decrease in the pleasantness of the kids smile was noticeable his expression began to resemble more nearly the gloomy importance of the peaceful moments photographs yells of agony from panicstricken speculators around the ring began to smite the rafters the cyclone now but a gentle breeze clutched repeatedly hanging on like a leech till removed by the redjerseyed referee  suddenly a grisly silence fell upon the house for the kid battered but obviously content was standing in the middle of the ring while on the ropes the cyclone drooping like a wet sock was sliding slowly to the floor  peaceful moments wins said smith an omen i fancy comrade john  penetrating into the kids dressingroom some moments later the editorial staff found the winner of the tenround exhibition bout between members of the club seated on a chair having his right leg rubbed by a shockheaded man in a sweater who had been one of his seconds during the conflict the kid beamed as they entered  gents he said come right in mighty glad to see you  it is a relief to me comrade brady said smith to find that you can see us i had expected to find that comrade fishers purposeful wallops had completely closed your starlikes  sure i never felt them hes a good quick boy is dick but continued the kid with powerful imagery he couldnt hit a hole in a block of icecream not if he was to use a cokehammer  and yet at one period in the proceedings said smith i fancied that your head would come unglued at the neck but the fear was merely transient when you began to get going why then i felt like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes he stared at the pacific  the kid blinked  hows that he enquired  and why did i feel like that comrade brady i will tell you because my faith in you was justified because there before me stood the ideal fighting editor of peaceful moments it is not a post that any weakling can fill mere charm of manner cannot qualify a man for the position no one can hold down the job simply by having a kind heart or being good at comic songs no we want a man of thews and sinews a man who would rather be hit on the head with a halfbrick than not and you comrade brady are such a man  the shockheaded man who during this conversation had been concentrating himself on his subjects left leg now announced that he guessed that would about do and having advised the kid not to stop and pick daisies but to get into his clothes at once before he caught a chill bade the company goodnight and retired  smith shut the door  comrade brady he said you know those articles about the tenements weve been having in the paper  sure i read em theyre to the good it was about time some strong josher came and put it across em  so we thought comrade parker however totally disagreed with us  parker  thats what im coming to said smith the day before yesterday a man named parker called at the office and tried to buy us off  you gave him the hook i guess queried the interested kid  to such an extent comrade brady said smith that he left breathing threatenings and slaughter and it is for that reason that we have ventured to call upon you were pretty sure by this time that comrade parker has put one of the gangs on to us  you dont say exclaimed the kid gee theyre tough propositions those gangs  so weve come along to you we can look after ourselves out of the office but what we want is someone to help in case they try to rush us there in brief a fighting editor at all costs we must have privacy no writer can prune and polish his sentences to his satisfaction if he is compelled constantly to break off in order to eject boisterous toughs we therefore offer you the job of sitting in the outer room and intercepting these bravoes before they can reach us the salary we leave to you there are doubloons and to spare in the old oak chest take what you need and put the restif anyback how does the offer strike you comrade brady  gents said the kid its this way  he slipped into his coat and resumed  now that ive made good by licking dick theyll be giving me a chance of a big fight maybe with jimmy garvin well if that happens see what i mean ill have to be going away somewhere and getting into training i shouldnt be able to come and sit with you but if you gents feel like it id be mighty glad to come in till im wanted to go into training camp  great said smith and touching salary  shucks said the kid with emphasis nix on the salary thing i wouldnt take a dime if it hadnt a been for you id have been waiting still for a chance of lining up in the championship class thats good enough for me any old thing you want me to do ill do it and glad to  comrade brady said smith warmly you are if i may say so the goods you are beyond a doubt supremely the stuff we three then handinhand will face the foe and if the foe has good sound sense he will keep right away you appear to be ready shall we meander forth  the building was empty and the lights were out when they emerged from the dressingroom they had to grope their way in darkness it was raining when they reached the street and the only signs of life were a moist policeman and the distant glare of saloon lights down the road  they turned off to the left and after walking some hundred yards found themselves in a blind alley  hello said john where have we come to  smith sighed  in my trusting way he said i had imagined that either you or comrade brady was in charge of this expedition and taking me by a known route to the nearest subway station i did not think to ask i placed myself without hesitation wholly in your hands  i thought the kid knew the way said john  i was just taggin along with you gents protested the lightweight i thought you was taking me right this is the first time i been up here  next time we three go on a little jaunt anywhere said smith resignedly it would be as well to take a map and a corps of guides with us otherwise we shall start for broadway and finish up at minneapolis  they emerged from the blind alley and stood in the dark street looking doubtfully up and down it  aha said smith suddenly i perceive a native several natives in fact quite a little covey of them we will put our case before them concealing nothing and rely on their advice to take us to our goal  a little knot of men was approaching from the left in the darkness it was impossible to say how many of them were there smith stepped forward the kid at his side  excuse me sir he said to the leader but if you can spare me a moment of your valuable time  there was a sudden shuffle of feet on the pavement a quick movement on the part of the kid a chunky sound as of wood striking wood and the man smith had been addressing fell to the ground in a heap  as he fell something dropped from his hand on to the pavement with a bump and a rattle stooping swiftly the kid picked it up and handed it to smith his fingers closed upon it it was a short wickedlooking little bludgeon the blackjack of the new york tough  get busy advised the kid briefly     chapter xix  the first battle   the promptitude and despatch with which the kid had attended to the gentleman with the blackjack had not been without its effect on the followers of the stricken one physical courage is not an outstanding quality of the new york gangsman his personal preference is for retreat when it is a question of unpleasantness with a stranger and in any case even when warring among themselves the gangs exhibit a lively distaste for the hard knocks of handtohand fighting their chosen method of battling is to lie down on the ground and shoot  the kids rapid work on the present occasion created a good deal of confusion there was no doubt that much had been hoped for from speedy attack also the generalship of the expedition had been in the hands of the fallen warrior his removal from the sphere of active influence had left the party without a head and to add to their discomfiture they could not account for the kid smith they knew and john was to be accounted for but who was this stranger with the square shoulders and the uppercut that landed like a cannon ball something approaching a panic prevailed among the gang  it was not lessened by the behavior of the intended victims john was the first to join issue he had been a few paces behind the others during the blackjack incident but dark as it was he had seen enough to show him that the occasion was as smith would have said one for the shrewd blow rather than the prolonged parley with a shout he made a football rush into the confused mass of the enemy a moment later smith and the kid followed and there raged over the body of the fallen leader a battle of homeric type  it was not a long affair the rules and conditions governing the encounter offended the delicate sensibilities of the gang like artists who feel themselves trammeled by distasteful conventions they were damped and could not do themselves justice their forte was longrange fighting with pistols with that they felt en rapport but this vulgar brawling in the darkness with muscular opponents who hit hard and often with the clenched fist was distasteful to them they could not develop any enthusiasm for it they carried pistols but it was too dark and the combatants were too entangled to allow them to use these  there was but one thing to be done reluctant as they might be to abandon their fallen leader it must be done already they were suffering grievously from john the blackjack and the lightning blows of the kid for a moment they hung wavering then stampeded in halfadozen different directions melting into the night whence they had come  john full of zeal pursued one fugitive some fifty yards down the street but his quarry exhibiting a rare turn of speed easily outstripped him  he came back panting to find smith and the kid examining the fallen leader of the departed ones with the aid of a match which went out just as john arrived  the kid struck another the head of it fell off and dropped upon the upturned face the victim stirred shook himself sat up and began to mutter something in a foggy voice  hes still woozy said the kid  stillwhat exactly comrade brady  in the air explained the kid bats in the belfry dizzy see what i mean its often like that when a feller puts one in with a bit of weight behind it just where that one landed gee i remember when i fought martin kelly i was only starting to learn the game then martin and me was mixing it good and hard all over the ring when suddenly he puts over a stiff one right on the point what do you think i done fall down and take the count not on your life i just turns round and walks straight out of the ring to my dressingroom willie harvey who was seconding me comes tearing in after me and finds me getting into my clothes whats doing kid he asks im going fishin willie i says its a lovely day youve lost the fight he says fight says i what fight see what i mean i hadnt a notion of what had happened it was half an hour and more before i could remember a thing  during this reminiscence the man on the ground had contrived to clear his mind of the mistiness induced by the kids upper cut the first sign he showed of returning intelligence was a sudden dash for safety up the road but he had not gone five yards when he sat down limply  the kid was inspired to further reminiscence  guess hes feeling pretty poor he said its no good him trying to run for a while after hes put his chin in the way of a real live one i remember when joe peterson put me out way back when i was new to the gameit was the same year i fought martin kelly he had an awful punch had old joe and he put me down and out in the eighth round after the fight they found me on the fireescape outside my dressingroom come in kid says they its all right chaps i says im dying like that its all right chaps im dying same with this guy see what i mean  they formed a group about the fallen blackjack expert  pardon us said smith courteously for breaking in upon your reverie but if you could spare us a moment of your valuable time there are one or two things which we would like to know  sure thing agreed the kid  in the first place continued smith would it be betraying professional secrets if you told us which particular bevy of energetic cutthroats it is to which you are attached  gent explained the kid wants to know whats your gang  the man on the ground muttered something that to smith and john was unintelligible  it would be a charity said the former if some philanthropist would give this fellow elocution lessons can you interpret comrade brady  says its the three points said the kid  the three points thats spider reillys lot perhaps this is spider reilly  nope said the kid i know the spider this aint him this is some other mutt  which other mutt in particular asked smith try and find out comrade brady you seem to be able to understand what he says to me personally his remarks sound like the output of a gramophone with a hot potato in its mouth  says hes jack repetto announced the interpreter  there was another interruption at this moment the bashful mr repetto plainly a man who was not happy in the society of strangers made another attempt to withdraw reaching out a pair of lean hands he pulled the kids legs from under him with a swift jerk and wriggling to his feet started off again down the road once more however desire outran performance he got as far as the nearest streetlamp but no further the giddiness seemed to overcome him again for he grasped the lamppost and sliding slowly to the ground sat there motionless  the kid whose fall had jolted and bruised him was inclined to be wrathful and vindictive he was the first of the three to reach the elusive mr repetto and if that worthy had happened to be standing instead of sitting it might have gone hard with him but the kid was not the man to attack a fallen foe he contented himself with brushing the dust off his person and addressing a richly abusive flow of remarks to mr repetto  under the rays of the lamp it was possible to discern more closely the features of the blackjack exponent there was a subtle but noticeable resemblance to those of mr bat jarvis apparently the latters oiled forelock worn low over the forehead was more a concession to the general fashion prevailing in gang circles than an expression of personal taste mr repetto had it too in his case it was almost white for the fallen warrior was an albino his eyes which were closed had white lashes and were set as near together as nature had been able to manage without actually running them into one another his underlip protruded and drooped looking at him one felt instinctively that no judging committee of a beauty contest would hesitate a moment before him  it soon became apparent that the light of the lamp though bestowing the doubtful privilege of a clearer view of mr repettos face held certain disadvantages scarcely had the staff of peaceful moments reached the faint yellow pool of light in the center of which mr repetto reclined than with a suddenness which caused them to leap into the air there sounded from the darkness down the road the crackcrackcrack of a revolver instantly from the opposite direction came other shots three bullets cut grooves in the roadway almost at johns feet the kid gave a sudden howl smiths hat suddenly imbued with life sprang into the air and vanished whirling into the night  the thought did not come to them consciously at the moment there being little time to think but it was evident as soon as diving out of the circle of light into the sheltering darkness they crouched down and waited for the next move that a somewhat skilful ambush had been effected the other members of the gang who had fled with such remarkable speed had by no means been eliminated altogether from the game while the questioning of mr repetto had been in progress they had crept back unperceived except by mr repetto himself it being too dark for successful shooting it had become mr repettos task to lure his captors into the light which he had accomplished with considerable skill  for some minutes the battle halted there was dead silence the circle of light was empty now mr repetto had vanished a tentative shot from nowhere ripped through the air close to where smith lay flattened on the pavement and then the pavement began to vibrate and give out a curious resonant sound somewhereit might be near or fara policeman had heard the shots and was signaling for help to other policemen along the line by beating on the flagstones with his night stick the noise grew filling the still air prom somewhere down the road sounded the ring of running feet  de cops cried a voice beat it  next moment the night was full of clatter the gang was beating it  smith rose to his feet and felt his wet and muddy clothes ruefully  the rescue party was coming up at the gallop  whats doing asked a voice  nothing now said the disgusted voice of the kid from the shadows theyve beaten it  the circle of lamplight became as if by mutual consent a general rendezvous three grayclad policemen tough cleanshaven men with keen eyes and square jaws stood there revolvers in one hand night sticks in the other smith hatless and muddy joined them john and the kid the latter bleeding freely from his left ear the lobe of which had been chipped by a bullet were the last to arrive  whats been the roughhouse inquired one of the policemen mildly interested  do you know a sport of the name of repetto enquired smith  jack repetto sure  he belongs to the three points said another intelligent officer as one naming some fashionable club  when next you see him said smith i should be obliged if you would use your authority to make him buy me a new hat i could do with another pair of trousers too but i will not press the trousers a new hat is however essential mine has a sixinch hole in it  shot at you did they said one of the policemen as who should say tut tut  shot at us burst out the ruffled kid what do you thinks been happening think an aeroplane ran into my ear and took half of it off think the noise was somebody opening bottles of pop think those guys that sneaked off down the road was just training for a marathon  comrade brady said smith touches the spot he  say are you kid brady enquired one of the officers for the first time the constabulary had begun to display real animation  reckoned id seen you somewhere said another you licked cyclone dick all right kid i hear  and who but a bonehead thought he wouldnt demanded the third warmly he could whip a dozen cyclone dicks in the same evening with his eyes shut  hes the next champeen admitted the first speaker  if he juts it over jimmy garvin argued the second  jimmy garvin cried the third he can whip twenty jimmy garvins with his feet tied i tell you  i am loath observed smith to interrupt this very impressive brain barbecue but trivial as it may seem to you to me there is a certain interest in this other little matter of my ruined hat i know that it may strike you as hypersensitive of us to protest against being riddled with bullets but  well whats been doin inquired the force it was a nuisance this perpetual harping on trifles when the deep question of the lightweight championship of the world was under discussion but the sooner it was attended to the sooner it would be over  john undertook to explain  the three points laid for us he said this man jack repetto was bossing the crowd the kid put one over on to jack repettos chin and we were asking him a few questions when the rest came back and started shooting then we got to cover quick and you came up and they beat it  that said smith nodding is a very fair precis of the evenings events we should like you if you will be so good to corral this comrade repetto and see that he buys me a new hat  well round jack up said one of the policemen indulgently  do it nicely urged smith dont go hurting his feelings  the second policeman gave it as his opinion that jack was getting too gay the third policeman conceded this jack he said had shown signs for some time past of asking for it in the neck it was an error on jacks part he gave his hearers to understand to assume that the lid was completely off the great city of new york  too blamed fresh hes gettin the trio agreed they seemed to think it was too bad of jack  the wrath of the law said smith is very terrible we will leave the matter then in your hands in the meantime we should be glad if you would direct us to the nearest subway station just at the moment the cheerful lights of the great white way are what i seem chiefly to need                                       so ended the opening engagement of the campaign in a satisfactory but far from decisive victory for the peaceful moments army  the victory said smith was not bloodless comrade bradys ear my hatthese are not slight casualties on the other hand the elimination of comrade repetto is pleasant i know few men whom i would not rather meet on a lonely road than comrade repetto he is one of natures blackjackers probably the thing crept upon him slowly he started possibly in a merely tentative way by slugging one of the family circle his aunt let us say or his small brother but once started he is unable to resist the craving the thing grips him like dramdrinking he blackjacks now not because he really wants to but because he cannot help himself theres something singularly consoling in the thought that comrade repetto will no longer be among those present  there are others said john  as you justly remark said smith there are others i am glad we have secured comrade bradys services we may need them     chapter xx  betty at large   it was not till betty found herself many blocks distant from the office of peaceful moments that she checked her headlong flight she had run down the stairs and out into the street blindly filled only with that passion for escape which had swept her away from mervo not till she had dived into the human river of broadway and reached times square did she feel secure then with less haste she walked on to the park and sat down on a bench to think  inevitably she had placed her own construction on johns sudden appearance in new york and at the spot where only one person in any way connected with mervo knew her to be she did not know that smith and he were friends and did not therefore suspect that the former and not herself might be the object of his visit nor had any word reached her of what had happened at mervo after her departure she had taken it for granted that things had continued as she had left them and the only possible explanation to her of johns presence in new york was that acting under orders from mr scobell he had come to try and bring her back  she shuddered as she conjured up the scene that must have taken place if pugsy had not mentioned his name and she had gone on into the inner room in itself the thought that after what she had said that morning on the island after she had forced on him stripping it of the uttermost rag of disguise the realization of how his position appeared to her he should have come under orders to bring her back was wellnigh unendurable but to have met him to have seen the man she loved plunging still deeper into shame would have been pain beyond bearing better a thousand times than that this panic flight into the iron wilderness of new york  it was cool and soothing in the park the roar of the city was hushed it was pleasant to sit there and watch the squirrels playing on the green slopes or scampering up into the branches through which one could see the gleam of water her thoughts became less chaotic the peace of the summer afternoon stole upon her  it did not take her long to make up her mind that the door of peaceful moments was closed to her john not finding her might go away but he would return reluctantly she abandoned the paper her heart was heavy when she had formed the decision she had been as happy at peaceful moments as it was possible for her to be now she would miss smith and the leisurely work and the feeling of being one of a team working in a good cause and that brought broster street back to her mind and she thought of the children no she could not abandon them she had started the tenement articles and she would go on with them but she must do it without ever venturing into the dangerous neighborhood of the office  a squirrel ran up and sat begging for a nut betty searched in the grass in the hope of finding one but came upon nothing but shells the squirrel bounded away with a disdainful flick of the tail  betty laughed  you think of nothing but food you ought to be ashamed to be so greedy  and then it came to her suddenly that it was no trifle this same problem of food  the warm green park seemed to grow chill and gray once again she must deal with lifes material side  her case was at the same time better and worse than it had been on that other occasion when she had faced the future in the french train better because then new york had been to her something vague and terrifying while now it was her city worse because she could no longer seek help from mrs oakley  that mrs oakley had given john the information which had enabled him to discover her hidingplace betty felt certain by what other possible means could he have found it why mrs oakley whom she had considered an ally should have done so she did not know she attributed it to a change of mind a reconsideration of the case when uninfluenced by sentiment and yet it seemed strange perhaps john had gone to her and the sight of him had won the old lady over to his side it might be so at any rate it meant that the cottage on staten island like the office of peaceful moments was closed to her she must look elsewhere for help or trust entirely to herself  she sat on thinking with grave troubled eyes while the shadows lengthened and the birds rustled sleepily in the branches overhead                                       among the good qualities none too numerous of mr bat jarvis of groome street in the bowery early rising was not included it was his habit to retire to rest at an advanced hour and to balance accounts by lying abed on the following morning this idiosyncrasy of his was well known in the neighborhood and respected and it was generally bold to be both bad taste and unsafe to visit bats shop until near the fashionable hour for luncheon when the great one shirtsleeved and smoking a short pipe would appear in the doorway looking out upon the world and giving it to understand that he was now open to be approached by deserving acquaintances  when therefore at ten oclock in the morning his slumbers were cut short by a sharp rapping at the front door his first impression was that he had been dreaming when after a brief interval the noise was resumed he rose in his might and knuckling the sleep from his eyes went down tightlipped to interview this person  he had got as far as a preliminary say when speech was wiped from his lips as with a sponge and he stood gaping and ashamed for the murderer of sleep and untimely knocker on front doors was betty  mr jarvis had not forgotten betty his meeting with her at the office of peaceful moments had marked an epoch in his life never before had anyone quite like her crossed his path and at that moment romance had come to him his was essentially a respectful admiration he was contentindeed he preferred to worship from afar of his own initiative he would never have met her again in her presence with those gray eyes of hers looking at him tremors ran down his spine and his conscience usually a battered and downtrodden wreck became fiercely aggressive she filled him with novel emotions and whether these were pleasant or painful was more than he could say he had not the gift of analysis where his feelings were concerned to himself he put it broadly that she made him feel like a nickel with a hole in it but that was not entirely satisfactory there were other and pleasanter emotions mixed in with this humility the thought of her made him feel for instance vaguely chivalrous he wanted to do risky and useful things for her thus if any fresh guy should endeavor to get gay with her it would he felt be a privilege to fix that same guy if she should be in bad he would be more than ready to get busy on her behalf  but he had never expected to meet her again certainly not on his own doorstep at ten in the morning to bat ten in the morning was included with the small hours  betty smiled at him a little anxiously she had no suspicion that she played star to mr jarvis moth in the latters life and as she eyed him standing there on the doorstep her excuse for coming to him began to seem terribly flimsy not being aware that he was in reality a tough bayard keenly desirous of obeying her lightest word she had staked her all on the chance of his remembering the cat episode and being grateful on account of it and in the cold light of the morning this idea born in the watches of the night when things tend to lose their proportion struck her as less happy than she had fancied suppose he had forgotten all about it suppose he should be violent for a moment her heart sank he certainly was not a pleasing and encouraging sight as he stood there blinking at her no man looks his best immediately on rising from bed and bat even at his best was not a hero of romance his forelock drooped dankly over his brow there was stubble on his chin his eyes were red like a dogs he did not look like the fairy prince who was to save her in her trouble  ii hope you remember me mr jarvis she faltered your cat i  he nodded speechlessly hideous things happened to his face he was really trying to smile pleasantly but it seemed a scowl to betty and her voice died away  mr jarvis spoke  maamsurestep nside  betty followed him into the shop there were birds in cages on the walls and patroling the floor a great company of cats each with its leather collar one rubbed itself against bettys skirt she picked it up and began to stroke it and looking over its head at mr jarvis she was aware that he was beaming sheepishly  his eyes darted away the instant they met hers but betty had seen enough to show her that she had mistaken nervousness for truculence immediately she was at her ease and womanlike had begun to control the situation she made conversation pleasantly praising the cats admiring the birds touching lightly on the general subject of domestic pets until her womans sixth sense told her that her hosts panic had passed and that she might now proceed to discuss business  i hope you dont mind my coming to you mr jarvis she said you know you told me to if ever i were in trouble so ive taken you at your word you dont mind  mr jarvis gulped and searched for words  glad he said at last  ive left peaceful moments you know i used to be stenographer there  she was surprised and gratified to see a look of consternation spread itself across mr jarvis face it was a hopeful sign that he should take her cause to heart to such an extent  but mr jarvis consternation was not due wholly to solicitude for her his thoughts at that moment put after having been expurgated into speech might have been summed up in the line of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been  aint youse woikin dere no more is dat right he gasped gee i wisht id a known it sooner why a guy come to me and wants to give me half a ton of the long green to go to dat poiper what youse was woikin on and fix de guy whats runnin it an i truns him down cos i dont want you to be frown out of your job say why youse quit woikin dere his eyes narrowed as an idea struck him say he went on you aint bin fired has de boss give youse de trundown cos if he has say de woid and ill fix him for youse loidy an it wont set you back a nickel he concluded handsomely  no no cried betty horrified mr smith has been very kind to me i left of my own free will  mr jarvis looked disappointed his demeanor was like that of some mediaeval knight called back on the eve of starting out to battle with the paynim for the honor of his lady  what was that you said about the man who came to you and offered you money asked betty  her mind had flashed back to mr parkers visit and her heart was beating quickly  sure he come to me all right an wants de guy on de poiper fixed an i truns him down  oh you wont dream of doing anything to hurt mr smith will you mr jarvis said betty anxiously  not if you say so loidy  and yourfriends you wont let them do anything  nope  betty breathed freely again her knowledge of the east side was small and that there might be those there who acted independently of mr jarvis disdainful of his influence did not occur to her she returned to her own affairs satisfied that danger no longer threatened  mr jarvis i wonder if you can help me i want to find some work to do she said  woik  i have to earn my living you see and im afraid i dont know how to begin  mr jarvis pondered what sort of woik  any sort said betty valiantly i dont care what it is  mr jarvis knitted his brows in thought he was not used to being an employment agency but betty was betty and even at the cost of a headache he must think of something  at the end of five minutes inspiration came to him  say he said what do youse call de guy dat sits an takes de money at an eatinjoint cashier well say could youse be dat  it would be just the thing do you know a place  sure just around de corner ill take you dere  betty waited while he put on his coat and they started out betty chatted as they walked but mr jarvis who appeared a little selfconscious beneath the unconcealed interest of the neighbors was silent at intervals he would turn and glare ferociously at the heads that popped out of windows or protruded from doorways fame has its penalties and most of the population of that portion of the bowery had turned out to see their most prominent citizen so romantically employed as a squire of dames  after a short walk bat halted the expedition before a dingy restaurant the glass window bore in battered letters the name fontelli  dis is de joint he said  inside the restaurant a dreamyeyed italian sat gazing at vacancy and twirling a pointed mustache in a far corner a solitary customer was finishing a late breakfast  signor fontelli for the sadeyed exile was he sprang to his feet at the sight of mr jarvis wellknown figure an ingratiating but nervous smile came into view behind the pointed mustache  hey tony said mr jarvis coming at once to the point i want you to know dis loidy shes going to be cashier at dis joint  signor fontelli looked at betty and shook his head he smiled deprecatingly his manner seemed to indicate that while she met with the approval of fontelli the slave of her sex to fontelli the employer she appealed in vain he gave his mustache a sorrowful twirl  ah no he sighed not da cashier do i need i takea myself da money  mr jarvis looked at him coldly he continued to look at him coldly his lower jaw began slowly to protrude and his forehead retreated further behind its zareba of forelock  there was a pause the signor was plainly embarrassed  dis loidy repeated mr jarvis is cashier at dis joint at six per he paused does dat go he added smoothly  certainly there was magnetism about mr jarvis with a minimum of words he produced remarkable results something seemed to happen suddenly to signor fontellis spine he wilted like a tired flower a gesture in which were blended resignation humility and a desire to be at peace with all men particularly mr jarvis completed his capitulation  mr jarvis waited while betty was instructed in her simple duties then drew her aside  say he remarked confidentially yousell be all right here six per aint all de dough dere is in de woild but bein cashier see you can swipe a whole heap more whenever you feel like it and if tony registers a kick ill come around and talk to himsee dats right goodmorning loidy  and having delivered these admirable hints to young cashiers in a hurry to get rich mr jarvis ducked his head in a species of bow declined to be thanked and shuffled out into the street leaving betty to open her new career by taking thirtyseven cents from the late breakfaster     chapter xxi  changes in the staff   three days had elapsed since the battle which had opened the campaign and there had been no further movement on the part of the enemy smith was puzzled a strange quiet seemed to be brooding over the other camp he could not believe that a single defeat had crushed the foe but it was hard to think of any other explanation  it was pugsy maloney who on the fourth morning brought to the office the inner history of the truce his version was brief and unadorned as was the way with his narratives such things as first causes and piquant details he avoided as tending to prolong the telling excessively thus keeping him from the perusal of his cowboy stories he gave the thing out merely as an item of general interest a bubble on the surface of the life of a great city he did not know how nearly interested were his employers in any matter touching that gang which is known as the three points  pugsy said deres been fussn going on down where i live dude dawsons mad at spider reilly and now de table hills is layin for de tree points to soak it to em dats right  he then retired to his outer fastness yielding further details jerkily and with the distrait air of one whose mind is elsewhere  skilfully extracted and pieced together these details formed themselves into the following typical narrative of east side life  there were four really important gangs in new york at this time there were other less important institutions besides but these were little more than mere friendly gatherings of old boyhood chums for purposes of mutual companionship they might grow into formidable organizations in time but for the moment the amount of ice which good judges declared them to cut was but small they would stick up an occasional wayfarer for his cush and they carried canisters and sometimes fired them off but these things do not signify the cutting of ice in matters political there were only four gangs which counted the east side the groome street the three points and the table hill greatest of these by virtue of their numbers were the east side and the groome street the latter presided over at the time of this story by mr bat jarvis these two were colossal and though they might fight each other were immune from attack at the hands of the rest  but between the other gangs and especially between the table hill and the three points which were much of a size warfare raged as frequently as among the republics of south america there had always been bad blood between the table hill and the three points little events trifling in themselves had always occurred to shatter friendly relations just when there seemed a chance of their being formed thus just as the table hillites were beginning to forgive the three points for shooting the redoubtable paul horgan down at coney island a three pointer injudiciously wiped out a table hillite near canal street he pleaded selfdefense and in any case it was probably mere thoughtlessness but nevertheless the table hillites were ruffled  that had been a month or so back during that month things had been simmering down and peace was just preparing to brood when there occurred the incident alluded to by pugsy the regrettable falling out between dude dawson and spider reilly  to be as brief as possible dude dawson had gone to spend a happy evening at a dancing saloon named shamrock hall near groome street now shamrock hall belonged to a mr maginnis a friend of bat jarvis and was under the direct protection of that celebrity it was therefore sacred ground and mr dawson visited it in a purely private and peaceful capacity the last thing he intended was to spoil the harmony of the evening  alas for the best intentions twostepping clumsily round the roomfor he was a poor though enthusiastic dancerdude dawson collided with and upset a certain reddy davis and his partner reddy davis was a member of the three points and his temper was the temper of a redheaded man he slugged mr dawson mr dawson more skilful at the fray than at the dance joined battle willingly and they were absorbed in a stirring combat when an interruption occurred in the far corner of the room surrounded by admiring friends sat spider reilly monarch of the three points he had noticed that there was a slight disturbance at the other side of the hall but had given it little attention till the dancing ceasing suddenly and the floor emptying itself of its crowd he had a plain view of mr dawson and mr davis squaring up at each other for the second round  we must assume that mr reilly was not thinking of what he did for his action was contrary to all rules of gang etiquette in the street it would have been perfectly legitimate even praiseworthy but in a dancehall under the protection of a neutral power it was unpardonable  what he did was to produce his revolver and shoot the unsuspecting mr dawson in the leg having done which he left hurriedly fearing the wrath of bat jarvis  mr dawson meanwhile was attended to and helped home willing informants gave him the name of his aggressor and before morning the table hill camp was in a ferment shooting broke out in three places though there were no casualties  when the day dawned there existed between the two gangs a state of war more bitter than any in their record for this time it was chieftain who had assaulted chieftain royal blood had been spilt  such was the explanation of the lull in the campaign against peaceful moments the new war had taken the mind of spider reilly and his warriors off the paper and its affairs for the moment much as the unexpected appearance of a mad bull would make a man forget that he had come out snipeshooting  at present there had been no pitched battle as was usual between the gangs war had broken out in a somewhat tentative fashion at first there had been skirmishes by the wayside but nothing more the two armies were sparring for an opening                                       smith was distinctly relieved at the respite for necessitating careful thought this was the defection of kid brady  the kids easy defeat of cyclone dick fisher had naturally created a sensation in sporting circles he had become famous in a night it was not with surprise therefore that smith received from his fighting editor the information that he had been matched against one eddie wood whose fame outshone even that of the late cyclone  the kid a white man to the core exhibited quite a feudal loyalty to the paper which had raised him from the ruck and placed him on the road to eminence  say the word he said and ill call it off if you feel you need me around here mr smith say so and ill sidestep eddie  comrade brady said smith with enthusiasm i have had occasion before to call you sport i do so again but im not going to stand in your way if you eliminate this comrade wood they will have to give you a chance against jimmy garvin wont they  i guess thats right said the kid eddie stayed nineteen rounds against jimmy and if i can put him away it gets me clear into line with jim and hell have to meet me  then go in and win comrade brady we shall miss you it will be as if a ray of sunshine had been removed from the office but you mustnt throw a chance away  ill train at white plains said the kid so ill be pretty near in case im wanted  oh we shall be all right said smith and if you win well bring out a special number good luck comrade brady and many thanks for your help                                       john when he arrived at the office and learned the news was for relying on their own unaided efforts  and anyway he said i dont see who else there is to help us you could tell the police i suppose he went on doubtfully  smith shook his head  the new york policeman comrade john is like all great men somewhat peculiar if you go to a new york policeman and exhibit a black eye he is more likely to express admiration for the handiwork of the citizen responsible for the same than sympathy no since coming to this city i have developed a habit of taking care of myself or employing private help i do not want allies who will merely shake their heads at comrade reilly and his merry men however sternly i want someone who if necessary will soak it to them good  sure said john but who is there now the kids gone  who else but comrade jarvis said smith  jarvis bat jarvis  the same i fancy that we shall find on enquiry that we are ace high with him at any rate there is no harm in sounding him it is true that he may have forgotten or it may be that it is to comrade brown alone that he is  whos brown asked john  our late stenographer explained smith a miss brown she entertained comrade jarvis cat if you remember i wonder what has become of her she has sent in three more corking efforts on the subject of broster street but she gives no address i wish i knew where she was id have liked for you to meet her     chapter xxii  a gathering of cat specialists   it will probably be necessary said smith as they set out for groome street to allude to you comrade john in the course of this interview as one of our most eminent living catfanciers you have never met comrade jarvis i believe well he is a gentleman with just about enough forehead to prevent his front hair getting inextricably blended with his eyebrows and he owns twentythree cats each with a leather collar round its neck it is i fancy the cat note which we shall have to strike today if only comrade brown were with us we could appeal to his finer feelings but he has seen me only once and you never and i should not care to bet that he will feel the least particle of dismay at the idea of our occiputs getting all mussed up with a blackjack but when i inform him that you are an english catfancier and that in your island home you have seventyfour fine cats mostly angoras that will be a different matter i shall be surprised if he does not fall on your neck  they found mr jarvis in his fanciers shop engaged in the intellectual occupation of greasing a cats paws with butter he looked up as they entered and then resumed his task  comrade jarvis said smith we meet again you remember me  nope said mr jarvis promptly  smith was not discouraged  ah he said tolerantly the fierce rush of new york life how it wipes from the retina today the image impressed on it but yesterday is it not so comrade jarvis  the catexpert concentrated himself on his patients paws without replying  a fine animal said smith adjusting his monocle to what particular family of the felis domestica does that belong in color it resembles a neapolitan ice more than anything  mr jarvis manner became unfriendly  say what do youse want thats straight aint it if youse want to buy a boid or a snake why dont youse say so  i stand corrected said smith i should have remembered that time is money i called in here partly in the hope that though you only met me onceon the stairs of my office you might retain pleasant recollections of me but principally in order that i might make two very eminent catfanciers acquainted this he said with a wave of his hand in the direction of john is comrade maude possibly the best known of english catfanciers comrade maudes stud of angoras is celebrated wherever the english language is spoken  mr jarviss expression changed he rose and having inspected john with silent admiration for a while extended a wellbuttered hand towards him smith looked on benevolently  what comrade maude does not know about cats he said is not knowledge his information on angoras alone would fill a volume  saymr jarvis was evidently touching on a point which had weighed deeply upon himwhys catnip called catnip  john looked at smith helplessly it sounded like a riddle but it was obvious that mr jarviss motive in putting the question was not frivolous he really wished to know  the word as comrade maude was just about to observe said smith is a corruption of catmint why it should be so corrupted i do not know but what of that the subject is too deep to be gone fully into at the moment i should recommend you to read mr maudes little brochure on the matter passing lightly on from that  did youse ever have a cat dat ate bettles enquired mr jarvis  there was a time when many of comrade maudes felidae supported life almost entirely on beetles  did they git thin  john felt it was time if he were to preserve his reputation to assert himself  no he replied firmly  mr jarvis looked astonished  english beetles said smith dont make cats thin passing lightly  i had a cat oncst said mr jarvis ignoring the remark and sticking to his point dat ate beetles and got thin and used to tie itself inter knots  a versatile animal agreed smith  say mr jarvis went on now plainly on a subject near to his heart dem beetles is fierce sure cant keep de cats off of eatin dem i cant first ting you know deyve swallowed dem and den dey gits thin and ties theirselves into knots  you should put them into straitwaistcoats said smith passing however lightly  say ever have a crosseyed cat  comrade maudes cats said smith have happily been almost entirely free from strabismus  deys lucky crosseyed cats is you has a crosseyed cat and notin dont never go wrong but say was dere ever a cat wit one blue and one yaller one in your bunch gee its fierce when its like dat its a skidoo is a cat wit one blue eye and one yaller one puts you in bad surest ting you know oncst a guy give me a cat like dat and first ting you know im in bad all round it wasnt till i give him away to de cop on de corner and gets me one dats crosseyed dat i lifts de skidoo off of me  and what happened to the cop enquired smith interested  oh he got in bad sure enough said mr jarvis without emotion one of de boys what hed pinched and had sent up the road once lays for him and puts one over on him wit a blackjack sure dats what comes of havin a cat wit one blue and one yaller one  mr jarvis relapsed into silence he seemed to be meditating on the inscrutable workings of fate smith took advantage of the pause to leave the cat topic and touch on matters of more vital import  tense and exhilarating as is this discussion of the optical peculiarities of cats he said there is another matter on which if you will permit me i should like to touch i would hesitate to bore you with my own private troubles but this is a matter which concerns comrade maude as well as myself and i can see that your regard for comrade maude is almost an obsession  hows that  i can see said smith that comrade maude is a man to whom you give the glad hand  mr jarvis regarded john with respectful affection  sure hes to the good mr maude is  exactly said smith to resume then the fact is comrade jarvis we are much persecuted by scoundrels how sad it is in this world we look to every side we look to north east south and west and what do we see mainly scoundrels i fancy you have heard a little about our troubles before this in fact i gather that the same scoundrels actually approached you with a view to engaging your services to do us up but that you very handsomely refused the contract we are the staff of peaceful moments  peaceful moments said mr jarvis sure dats right a guy comes to me and says he wants you put through it but i gives him de trundown  so i was informed said smith well failing you they went to a gentleman of the name of reilly  spider reilly  exactly spider reilly the lessee and manager of the three points gang  mr jarvis frowned  dose tree points deyre to de bad deyre fresh  it is too true comrade jarvis  say went on mr jarvis waxing wrathful at the recollection what do youse tink dem fresh stiffs done de odder night started some rough woik in me own dancejoint  shamrock hall said smith i heard about it  dats right shamrock hall got gay dey did wit some of the table hillers say i got it in for dem gazebos sure i have surest ting you know  smith beamed approval  that he said is the right spirit nothing could be more admirable we are bound together by our common desire to check the evergrowing spirit of freshness among the members of the three points add to that the fact that we are united by a sympathetic knowledge of the manners and customs of cats and especially that comrade maude englands greatest fancier is our mutual friend and what more do we want nothing  mr maudes to de good assented mr jarvis eying john once more in friendly fashion  we are all to the good said smith now the thing i wished to ask you is this the office of the paper was until this morning securely guarded by comrade brady whose name will be familiar to you  de kid  on the bullseye as usual kid brady the coming lightweight champion of the world well he has unfortunately been compelled to leave us and the way into the office is consequently clear to any sandbag specialist who cares to wander in so what i came to ask was will you take comrade bradys place for a few days  hows that  will you come in and sit in the office for the next day or so and help hold the fort i may mention that there is money attached to the job we will pay for your services  mr jarvis reflected but a brief moment  why sure he said me fer dat  excellent comrade jarvis nothing could be better we will see you tomorrow then i rather fancy that the gay band of three pointers who will undoubtedly visit the offices of peaceful moments in the next few days is scheduled to run up against the surprise of their lives  sure ting ill bring me canister  do said smith in certain circumstances one canister is worth a flood of rhetoric till tomorrow then comrade jarvis i am very much obliged to you                                       not at all a bad hours work he said complacently as they turned out of groome street a vote of thanks to you john for your invaluable assistance  i didnt do much said john with a grin  apparently no in reality yes your manner was exactly right reserved yet not haughty just what an eminent catfanciers manner should be i could see that you made a pronounced hit with comrade jarvis by the way as he is going to show up at the office tomorrow perhaps it would be as well if you were to look up a few facts bearing on the feline world there is no knowing what thirst for information a nights rest may not give comrade jarvis i do not presume to dictate but if you were to make yourself a thorough master of the subject of catnip for instance it might quite possibly come in useful     chapter xxiii  the retirement of smith   the first member of the staff of peaceful moments to arrive at the office on the following morning was master maloney this sounds like the beginning of a plod and punctuality or how great fortunes have been made story but as a matter of fact master maloney like mr bat jarvis was no early bird larks who rose in his neighborhood rose alone he did not get up with them he was supposed to be at the office at nine oclock it was a point of honor with him a sort of daily declaration of independence never to put in an appearance before ninethirty on this particular morning he was punctual to the minute or half an hour late whichever way you choose to look at it  he had only whistled a few bars of my little irish rose and had barely got into the first page of his story of life on the prairie when kid brady appeared the kid had come to pay a farewell visit he had not yet begun training and he was making the best of the short time before such comforts should be forbidden by smoking a big black cigar master maloney eyed him admiringly the kid unknown to that gentleman himself was pugsys ideal he came from the plains and had indeed once actually been a cowboy he was a coming champion and he could smoke big black cigars there was no trace of his official wellwhatisitnow air about pugsy as he laid down his book and prepared to converse  say mr smith around anywhere pugsy asked the kid  naw mr brady he aint came yet replied master maloney respectfully  late aint he  sure he generally blows in before i do  wonder whats keepin him  as he spoke john appeared hello kid he said come to say goodby  yep said the kid seen mr smith around anywhere mr maude  hasnt he come yet i guess hell be here soon hello whos this  a small boy was standing at the door holding a note  mr maude he said cop at jefferson market give me dis fer you  what he took the letter and gave the boy a dime why its from smith great scott  it was apparent that the kid was politely endeavoring to veil his curiosity master maloney had no such delicacy  whats in de letter boss he enquired  the letter said john slowly is from mr smith and it says that he was sentenced this morning to thirty days on the island for resisting the police  hes de guy admitted master maloney approvingly  whats that said the kid mr smith been slugging cops whats he been doin that for  i must go and find out at once it beats me  it did not take john long to reach jefferson market and by the judicious expenditure of a few dollars he was enabled to obtain an interview with smith in a back room  the editor of peaceful moments was seated on a bench looking remarkably disheveled there was a bruise on his forehead just where the hair began he was however cheerful  ah john he said you got my note all right then john looked at him concerned  what on earth does it all mean  smith heaved a regretful sigh  i fear he said i have made precisely the blamed fool of myself that comrade parker hoped i would  parker  smith nodded  i may be misjudging him but i seem to see the hand of comrade parker in this we had a raid at my house last night john we were pulled  what on earth  somebodyif it was not comrade parker it was some other citizen dripping with public spirittipped the police off that certain sports were running a poolroom in the house where i live  on his departure from the news smith from motives of economy had moved from his hotel in washington square and taken a furnished room on fourteenth street  there actually was a poolroom there he went on so possibly i am wronging comrade parker in thinking that this was a scheme of his for getting me out of the way at any rate somebody gave the tip and at about three oclock this morning i was aroused from a dreamless slumber by quite a considerable hammering at my door there standing on the mat were two policemen very cordially the honest fellows invited me to go with them a conveyance it seemed waited in the street without i disclaimed all connection with the bad gambling persons below but they replied that they were cleaning up the house and if i wished to make any remarks i had better make them to the magistrate this seemed reasonable i said i would put on some clothes and come along they demurred they said they couldnt wait about while i put on clothes i pointed out that skyblue pajamas with oldrose frogs were not the costume in which the editor of a great new york weekly paper should be seen abroad in one of the worlds greatest cities but they assured memore by their manner than their wordsthat my misgivings were groundless so i yielded these men i told myself have lived longer in new york than i they know what is done and what is not done i will bow to their views so i was starting to go with them like a lamb when one of them gave me a shove in the ribs with his night stick and it was here that i fancy i may have committed a slight error of policy  he smiled dreamily for a moment then went on  i admit that the old berserk blood of the smiths boiled at that juncture i picked up a sleepproducer from the floor as comrade brady would say and handed it to the bigstick merchant he went down like a sack of coal over the bookcase and at that moment i rather fancy the other gentleman must have got busy with his club at any rate somebody suddenly loosed off some fifty thousand dollars worth of fireworks and the next thing i knew was that the curtain had risen for the next act on me discovered sitting in a prison cell with an outsize in lumps on my forehead  he sighed again  what peaceful moments really needs he said is a sitzredacteur a sitzredacteur john is a gentleman employed by german newspapers with a taste for lesemajeste to go to prison whenever required in place of the real editor the real editor hints in his bright and snappy editorial for instance that the kaisers mustache gives him bad dreams the police force swoops down in a body on the office of the journal and are met by the sitzredacteur who goes with them cheerfully allowing the editor to remain and sketch out plans for his next weeks article on the crown prince we need a sitzredacteur on peaceful moments almost as much as a fighting editor not now of course this has finished the thing youll have to close down the paper now  close it down cried john you bet i wont  my dear old son said smith seriously what earthly reason have you for going on with it you only came in to help me and i am no more i am gone like some beautiful flower that withers in the night wheres the sense of getting yourself beaten up then quit  john shook his head  i wouldnt quit now if you paid me  but  a policeman appeared at the door  say pal he remarked to john youll have to be fading away soon i guess give you three minutes more say it quick  he retired smith looked at john  you wont quit he said  no  smith smiled  youre an allwool sport john he said i dont suppose you know how to spell quit well then if you are determined to stand by the ship like comrade casabianca ill tell you an idea that came to me in the watches of the night if ever you want to get ideas john you spend a night in one of these cells they flock to you i suppose i did more profound thinking last night than ive ever done in my life well heres the idea act on it or not as you please i was thinking over the whole business from soup to nuts and it struck me that the queerest part of it all is that whoever owns these broster street tenements should care a canadian dime whether we find out who he is or not  well theres the publicity began john  tush said smith and possibly bah do you suppose that the sort of man who runs broster street is likely to care a darn about publicity what does it matter to him if the papers soak it to him for about two days he knows theyll drop him and go on to something else on the third and he knows hes broken no law no theres something more in this business than that dont think that this bright boy wants to hush us up simply because he is a sensitive plant who cant bear to think that people should be cross with him he has got some private reason for wanting to lie low  well but what difference  comrade ill tell you it makes this difference that the rents are almost certainly collected by some confidential person belonging to his own crowd not by an ordinary collector in other words the collector knows the name of the man hes collecting for but for this little misfortune of mine i was going to suggest that we waylay that collector administer the third degree and ask him who his boss is  john uttered an exclamation  youre right ill do it  you think you can alone  sure dont you worry ill  the door opened and the policeman reappeared  times up slide sonny  john said goodby to smith and went out he had a last glimpse of his late editor a sad smile on his face telling the policeman what was apparently a humorous story complete good will seemed to exist between them john consoled himself as he went away with the reflection that smiths was a temperament that would probably find a bright side even to a thirtydays visit to blackwells island  he walked thoughtfully back to the office there was something lonely and yet wonderfully exhilarating in the realization that he was now alone and in sole charge of the campaign it braced him for the first time in several weeks he felt positively lighthearted     chapter xxiv  the campaign quickens   mr jarvis was as good as his word early in the afternoon he made his appearance at the office of peaceful moments his forelock more than usually well oiled in honor of the occasion and his right coatpocket bulging in a manner that betrayed to the initiated eye the presence of his trusty canister with him in addition he brought a long thin young man who wore under his brown tweed coat a blueandred striped sweater whether he brought him as an ally in case of need or merely as a kindred soul with whom he might commune during his vigil did not appear  pugsy startled out of his wonted calm by the arrival of this distinguished company gazed after the pair as they passed into the inner office with protruding eyes  john greeted the allies warmly and explained smiths absence mr jarvis listened to the story with interest and introduced his colleague  tought id let him chase along long ottos his monaker  sure said john the more the merrier take a seat youll find cigars over there you wont mind my not talking for the moment theres a wad of work to clear up  this was an overstatement he was comparatively free of work press day having only just gone by but he was keenly anxious to avoid conversation on the subject of cats of his ignorance of which mr jarviss appearance had suddenly reminded him he took up an old proof sheet and began to glance through it frowning thoughtfully  mr jarvis regarded the paraphernalia of literature on the table with interest so did long otto who however being a man of silent habit made no comment throughout the seance and the events which followed it he confined himself to an occasional grunt he seemed to lack other modes of expression  is dis where youse writes up pieces fer de poiper enquired mr jarvis  this is the spot said john on busy mornings you could hear our brains buzzing in madison square garden oh one moment  he rose and went into the outer office  pugsy he said do you know broster street  sure  could you find out for me exactly when the man comes round collecting the rents  surest ting you know i knows a kid what knows anodder kid what lives dere  then go and do it now and after youve found out you can take the rest of the day off  me fer dat said master maloney with enthusiasm ill take me goil to de bronx zoo  your girl i didnt know youd got a girl pugsy i always imagined you as one of those strong stern bloodandiron men who despised girls who is she  aw shes a kid said pugsy her pa runs a delicatessen shop down our street she aint a bad mutt added the ardent swain im her steady  well mind you send me a card for the wedding and if two dollars would be a help  sure ting tanks boss youre all right  it had occurred to john that the less time pugsy spent in the outer office during the next few days the better the lull in the warfare could not last much longer and at any moment a visit from spider reilly and his adherents might be expected their probable first move in such an event would be to knock master maloney on the head to prevent his giving warning of their approach  events proved that he had not been mistaken he had not been back in the inner office for more than a quarter of an hour when there came from without the sound of stealthy movements the handle of the door beganto revolve slowly and quietly the next moment three figures tumbled into the room  it was evident that they had not expected to find the door unlocked and the absence of resistance when they applied their weight had surprising effects two of the three did not pause in their career till they cannoned against the table the third checked himself by holding the handle  john got up coolly  come right in he said what can we do for you it had been too dark on the other occasion of his meeting with the three pointers to take note of their faces though he fancied that he had seen the man holding the doorhandle before the others were strangers they were all exceedingly unprepossessing in appearance  there was a pause the three marauders had become aware of the presence of mr jarvis and his colleague and the meeting was causing them embarrassment which may have been due in part to the fact that both had produced and were toying meditatively with uglylooking pistols  mr jarvis spoke  well he said whats doin  the man to whom the question was directly addressed appeared to have some difficulty in finding a reply he shuffled his feet and looked at the floor his two companions seemed equally at a loss  goin to start anything enquired mr jarvis casually  the humor of the situation suddenly tickled john the embarrassment of the uninvited guests was ludicrous  youve just dropped in for a quiet chat is that it he said well were all delighted to see you the cigars are on the table draw up your chairs  mr jarvis opposed the motion he drew slow circles in the air with his revolver  say youse had best beat it see  long otto grunted sympathy with the advice  and youse had best go back to spider reilly continued mr jarvis and tell him there aint nothin doing in the way of roughhouse wit dis gent here and you can tell de spider went on bat with growing ferocity dat next time he gits fresh and starts in to shootin up my dancejoint ill bite de head offn him see dat goes if he tinks his little twobyfour crowd can git way wit de groome street hes got anodder guess comin an dont fergit dis gent here and me is friends and anyone dat starts anyting wit dis gent is going to find trouble does dat go beat it  he jerked his shoulder in the direction of the door  the delegation then withdrew  thanks said john im much obliged to you both youre certainly there with the goods as fighting editors i dont know what i should have done without you  aw chee said mr jarvis handsomely dismissing the matter long otto kicked the leg of a table and grunted  pugsy maloneys report on the following morning was entirely satisfactory rents were collected in broster street on thursdays nothing could have been more convenient for that very day happened to be thursday  i rubbered around said pugsy an done de sleut act an its this way deres a feller blows in every tursday bout six oclock an den its up to de folks to dig down inter deir jeans for de stuff or out dey goes before supper i got dat from my kid frien what knows a kid what lives dere an say he has it pretty fierce dat kid de kid what lives dere hes a wop kid an italian an hes in bad cos his pa comes over from italy to woik on de subway  i dont see why that puts him in bad said john wonderingly you dont construct your stories well pugsy you start at the end then go back to any part which happens to appeal to you at the moment and eventually wind up at the beginning why is this kid in bad because his father has come to work on the subway  why sure because his pa got fired an swatted de foreman one on de coco an dey gives him toity days so de kids all alone an no one to pay de rent  i see said john well come along with me and introduce me and ill look after that  at halfpast five john closed the office for the day and armed with a big stick and conducted by master maloney made his way to broster street to reach it it was necessary to pass through a section of the enemys country but the perilous passage was safely negotiated the expedition reached its unsavory goal intact  the wop kid inhabited a small room at the very top of a building halfway down the street he was out when john and pugsy arrived  it was not an abode of luxury the tenement they had to feel their way up the stairs in almost pitch darkness most of the doors were shut but one on the second floor was ajar through the opening john had a glimpse of a number of women sitting on upturned boxes the floor was covered with little heaps of linen all the women were sewing stumbling in the darkness john almost fell against the door none of the women looked up at the noise in broster street time was evidently money  on the top floor pugsy halted before the open door of an empty room the architect in this case had apparently given rein to a passion for originality for he had constructed the apartment without a window of any sort whatsoever the entire stock of air used by the occupants came through a small opening over the door  it was a warm day and john recoiled hastily  is this the kids room he said i guess the corridors good enough for me to wait in what the owner of this place wants he went on reflectively is scalping well well do it in the paper if we cant in any other way is this your kid  a small boy had appeared he seemed surprised to see visitors pugsy undertook to do the honors pugsy as interpreter was energetic but not wholly successful he appeared to have a fixed idea that the italian language was one easily mastered by the simple method of saying da instead of the and adding a final a to any word that seemed to him to need one  say kid he began has da rentaman come yeta  the black eyes of the wop kid clouded he gesticulated and said something in his native language  he hasnt got next reported master maloney he cant git on to me curves dese wop kids is all boneheads say kid looka here he walked to the door rapped on it smartly and assuming a look of extreme ferocity stretched out his hand and thundered unbelta slipa me da stuff  the wop kids puzzlement in the face of this address became pathetic  this said john deeply interested is getting exciting dont give in pugsy i guess the trouble is that your too perfect italian accent is making the kid homesick  master maloney made a gesture of disgust  im troo dese dagoes makes me tired dey dont know enough to go upstairs to take de elevated beat it you mutt he observed with moody displeasure accompanying the words with a gesture which conveyed its own meaning the wop kid plainly glad to get away slipped down the stairs like a shadow  pugsy shrugged his shoulders  boss he said resignedly its up to youse  john reflected  its all right he said of course if the collector had been here the kid wouldnt be all ive got to do is to wait  he peered over the banisters into the darkness below  not that its not enough he said for of all the poisonous places i ever met this is the worst i wish whoever built it had thought to put in a few windows his idea of ventilation was apparently to leave a hole about the size of a lima bean and let the thing go at that  i guess theres a door on to de roof somewhere suggested pugsy at de joint where i lives dere is  his surmise proved correct at the end of the passage a ladder nailed against the wall ended in a large square opening through which was visible if not that narrow strip of blue which prisoners call the sky at any rate a tall brick chimney and a clothesline covered with garments that waved lazily in the breeze  john stood beneath it looking up  well he said this isnt much but its better than nothing i suppose the architect of this place was one of those fellows who dont begin to appreciate air till its thick enough to scoop chunks out with a spoon its an acquired taste i guess like limburger cheese and now pugsy old scout you had better beat it there may be a roughhouse here any minute now  pugsy looked up indignant  beat it  while your shoeleathers good said john firmly this is no place for a ministers son take it from me  i want to stop and pipe de fun objected master maloney  what fun  i guess you aint here to play ball surmised pugsy shrewdly eying the big stick  never mind why im here said john beat it ill tell you all about it tomorrow  master maloney prepared reluctantly to depart as he did so there was a sound of wellshod feet on the stairs and a man in a snuffcolored suit wearing a brown homburg hat and carrying a small notebook in one hand walked briskly up the stairs his whole appearance proclaimed him to be the longexpected collector of rents     chapter xxv  cornered   he did not see john for a moment and had reached the door of the room when he became aware of a presence he turned in surprise he was a smallish palefaced man with protruding eyes and teeth which gave him a certain resemblance to a rabbit  hello he said  welcome to our city said john stepping unostentatiously between him and the stairs  master maloney who had taken advantage of the interruption to edge back into the center of things now appeared to consider the question of his departure permanently shelved he sidled to a corner of the landing and sat down on an empty soap box with the air of a dramatic critic at the opening night of a new play the scene looked good to him it promised interesting developments he was an earnest student of the drama as exhibited in the theaters of the east side and few had ever applauded the hero of escaped from sing sing or hissed the villain of nellie the beautiful cloakmodel with more fervor he liked his drama to have plenty of action and to his practised eye this one promised well there was a set expression on johns face which suggested great things  his pleasure was abruptly quenched john placing a firm hand on his collar led him to the top of the stairs and pushed him down  beat it he said  the rentcollector watched these things with a puzzled eye he now turned to john  say seen anything of the wops that live here he enquired my names gooch ive come to take the rent  john nodded  i dont think theres much chance of your seeing them tonight he said the father i hear is in prison you wont get any rent out of him  then its outside for theirs said mr gooch definitely  what about the kid said john wheres he to go  thats up to him nothing to do with me im only acting under orders from up top  whose orders enquired john  the gent who owns this joint  who is he  suspicion crept into the protruding eyes of the rentcollector  say he demanded who are you anyway and what do you think youre doing here thats what id like to know what do you want with the name of the owner of this place what business is it of yours  im a newspaper man  i guessed you were said mr gooch with triumph you cant bluff me well its no good sonny ive nothing for you youd better chase off and try something else  he became more friendly  say though he said i just guessed you were from some paper i wish i could give you a story but i cant i guess its this peaceful moments business thats been and put your editor on to this joint aint it say though thats a queer thing that paper why only a few weeks ago it used to be a sort of takehomeandreadtothekids affair a friend of mine used to buy it regular and then suddenly it comes out with a regular whoop and starts knocking these tenements and boosting kid brady and all that it gets past me all i know is that its begun to get this place talked about why you see for yourself how it is here is your editor sending you down to get a story about it but say those peaceful moments guys are taking big risks i tell you straight they are and i know i happen to be wise to a thing or two about whats going on on the other side and i tell you theres going to be something doing if they dont cut it out quick mr qem the fellow who owns this place isnt the man to sit still and smile hes going to get busy say what paper do you come from  peaceful moments said john  for a moment the inwardness of the information did not seem to come home to mr gooch then it hit him he spun round john was standing squarely between him and the stairs  hey whats all this demanded mr gooch nervously the light was dim in the passage but it was sufficiently light to enable him to see johns face and it did not reassure him  ill soon tell you said john first however lets get this business of the kids rent settled take it out of this and give me the receipt  he pulled out a bill  curse his rent said mr gooch let me pass  soon said john business before pleasure how much does the kid have to pay for the privilege of suffocating in this infernal place as much as that well give me a receipt and then we can get on to more important things  let me pass  receipt said john laconically  mr gooch looked at the big stick then scribbled a few words in his notebook and tore out the page john thanked him  i will see that it reaches him he said and now will you kindly tell me the name of the man for whom you collected that money  let me pass bellowed mr gooch ill bring an action against you for assault and battery playing a fool game like this get away from those stairs  there has been no assault and batteryyet said john well are you going to tell me  mr gooch shuffled restlessly john leaned against the banisters  as you said a moment ago he observed the staff of peaceful moments is taking big risks i knew it before you told me i have had practical demonstration of the fact and that is why this broster street thing has got to be finished quick we cant afford to wait so i am going to have you tell me this mans name right now  help yelled mr gooch  the noise died away echoing against the walls no answering cry came from below custom had staled the piquancy of such cries in broster street if anybody heard it nobody thought the matter worth investigation  if you do that again said john ill break you in half now then i cant wait much longer get busy  he looked huge and sinister to mr gooch standing there in the uncertain light it was very lonely on that top floor and the rest of the world seemed infinitely far away mr gooch wavered he was loyal to his employer but he was still more loyal to mr gooch  well said john  there was a clatter on the stairs of one running swiftly and pugsy maloney burst into view for the first time since john had known him pugsy was openly excited  say boss he cried deys coming  what who  why dem i seen dem tree pointersspider reilly an  he broke off with a yelp of surprise mr gooch had seized his opportunity and had made his dash for safety with a rush he dived past john nearly upsetting pugsy who stood in his path and sprang down the stairs once he tripped but recovered himself and in another instant only the faint sound of his hurrying footsteps reached them  john had made a movement as if to follow but the full meaning of pugsys words came upon him and he stopped  spider reilly he said  i guess it was spider reilly said pugsy excitedly dey called him spider i guess dey piped youse comin in here gee its pretty fierce boss dis what youse goin to do  where did you see them pugsy  on the street just outside dere was a bunch of dem spielin togedder and i hears dem say you was in here dere aint no ways out but de front so dey aint hurryin dey just reckon to pike along upstairs peekin inter each room till dey find you an deres a bunch of dem goin to wait on de street in case youse beat it past down de stairs while de odder guys is rubberin for youse gee aint dis de limit  john stood thinking his mind was working rapidly suddenly he smiled  its all right pugsy he said it looks bad but i see a way out im going up that ladder there and through the trapdoor on to the roof i shall be all right there if they find me they can only get at me one at a time and while im there heres what i want you to do  shall i go for de cops boss  no not the cops do you know where dude dawson lives  the light of intelligence began to shine in master maloneys face his eye glistened with approval this was strategy of the right sort  i can ask around he said ill soon find him all right  do and as quick as you can and when youve found him tell him that his old chum spider reilly is here with the rest of his crowd and now id better be getting up on to my perch off you go pugsy my son and dont take a week about it goodby  pugsy vanished and john going to the ladder climbed out on to the roof with his big stick he looked about him the examination was satisfactory the trapdoor appeared to be the only means of access to the roof and between this roof and that of the next building there was a broad gulf the position was practically impregnable only one thing could undo him and that was if the enemy should mount to the next roof and shoot from there and even then he would have cover in the shape of the chimney it was a pity that the trap opened downward for he had no means of securing it and was obliged to allow it to hang open but except for that his position could hardly have been stronger  as yet there was no sound of the enemys approach evidently as pugsy had said they were conducting the search room by room in a thorough and leisurely way he listened with his ear close to the open trapdoor but could hear nothing  a startled exclamation directly behind him brought him to his feet in a flash every muscle tense he whirled his stick above his head as he turned ready to strike then let it fall with a clatter for there a bare yard away stood betty     chapter xxvi  journeys end   the capacity of the human brain for surprise like that of the human body for pain is limited for a single instant a sense of utter unreality struck john like a physical blow the world flickered before his eyes and the air seemed full of strange noises then quite suddenly these things passed and he found himself looking at her with a total absence of astonishment mildly amused in some remote corner of his brain at his own calm it was absurd he told himself that he should be feeling as if he had known of her presence there all the time yet it was so if this were a dream he could not be taking the miracle more as a matter of course joy at the sight of her he felt keen and almost painful but no surprise the shock had stunned his sense of wonder  she was wearing a calico apron over her dress an apron that had evidently been designed for a large woman swathed in its folds she suggested a child playing at being grown up her sleeves were rolled back to the elbow and her slim arms dripped with water strands of brown hair were blowing loose in the evening breeze to john she had never seemed so bewitchingly pretty he stared at her till the pallor of her face gave way to a warm red glow  as they stood there speechless there came from the other side of the chimney softly at first then swelling the sound of a childs voice raised in a tentative wail betty started violently the next moment she was gone and from the unseen parts beyond the chimney came the noise of splashing water  and at the same instant through the trap came a trampling of feet and the sound of whispering the enemy had reached the top floor  john was conscious of a remarkable exhilaration he felt insanely lighthearted he laughed aloud at the thought that until then he had completely forgotten the very existence of these earnest seekers after his downfall he threw back his head and shouted there was something so ridiculous in their assumption that they mattered to a man who had found betty again  he thrust his head down through the trap to see what was going on the dark passage was full of indistinct forms gathered together in puzzled groups the mystery of the vanished object of their pursuit was being discussed in hoarse whispers  suddenly there was an excited shout then a rush of feet john drew back his head and waited gripping his stick  voices called to each other in the passage below  de roof  on top de roof  hes beaten it for de roof  feet shuffled on the stone floor the voices ceased abruptly and then like a jackinthebox there popped through the trap a head and shoulders  the new arrival was a young man with a shock of red hair a broken nose and a mouth from which force or the passage of time had removed three front teeth he held on to the edge of the trap and stared up at john  john beamed down at him and shifted his grip on the stick  whos here he cried historic picture old dr cook discovers the north pole  the redheaded young man blinked the strong light of the open air was trying to his eyes  youse had best come down he observed coldly weve got youse  and continued john unmoved is instantly handed a gumdrop by his faithful eskimo  as he spoke he brought the stick down on the knuckles which disfigured the edges of the trap the intruder uttered a howl and dropped out of sight in the passage below there were whisperings and mutterings growing gradually louder till something resembling coherent conversation came to johns ears as he knelt by the trap making meditative billiard shots with the stick at a small pebble  aw gwan dont be a quitter  whos a quitter  youse a quitter get on top de roof he cant hoit youse  de guys gotten a big stick  john nodded appreciatively  i and theodore he murmured  a somewhat baffled silence on the part of the attacking force was followed by further conversation  gee some guys got to go up  murmur of assent from the audience  a voice in inspired tones let sam do it  the suggestion made a hit there was no doubt about that it was a success from the start quite a little chorus of voices expressed sincere approval of the very happy solution to what had seemed an insoluble problem john listening from above failed to detect in the choir of glad voices one that might belong to sam himself probably gratification had rendered the chosen one dumb  yes let sam do it cried the unseen chorus the first speaker unnecessarily perhapsfor the motion had been carried almost unanimouslybut possibly with the idea of convincing the one member of the party in whose bosom doubts might conceivably be harbored went on to adduce reasons  sam bein a coon he argued aint goin to git hoit by no stick youse cant hoit a coon by soakin him on de coco can you sam  john waited with some interest for the reply but it did not come possibly sam did not wish to generalize on insufficient experience  we can but try said john softly turning the stick round in his fingers  a report like a cannon sounded in the passage below it was merely a revolver shot but in the confined space it was deafening the bullet sang up into the sky  never hit me said john cheerfully  the noise was succeeded by a shuffling of feet john grasped his stick more firmly this was evidently the real attack the revolver shot had been a mere demonstration of artillery to cover the infantrys advance  sure enough the next moment a woolly head popped through the opening and a pair of rolling eyes gleamed up at him  why sam he said cordially this is great now for our interesting experiment my idea is that you can hurt a coons head with a stick if you hit it hard enough keep quite still now what are you coming up sam i hate to do it but  a yell rang out johns theory had been tested and proved correct  by this time the affair had begun to attract spectators the noise of the revolver had proved a fine advertisement the roof of the house next door began to fill up only a few of the occupants could get a clear view of the proceedings for the chimney intervened there was considerable speculation as to what was passing in the three points camp john was the popular favorite the early comers had seen his interview with sam and were relating it with gusto to their friends their attitude toward john was that of a group of men watching a dog at a rat hole they looked to him to provide entertainment for them but they realized that the first move must be with the attackers they were fairminded men and they did not expect john to make any aggressive move  their indignation when the proceedings began to grow slow was directed entirely at the dilatory three pointers they hooted the three pointers they urged them to go home and tuck themselves up in bed the spectators were mostly irishmen and it offended them to see what should have been a spirited fight so grossly bungled  gwan away home ye quitters roared one  a second member of the audience alluded to them as stiffs  it was evident that the besieging army was beginning to grow a little unpopular more action was needed if they were to retain the esteem of broster street  suddenly there came another and a longer explosion from below and more bullets wasted themselves on air john sighed  you make me tired he said  the irish neighbors expressed the same sentiment in different and more forcible words there was no doubt about itas warriors the three pointers were failing to give satisfaction  a voice from the passage called to john  say  well said john  are youse comin down off out of dat roof  would you mind repeating that remark  are youse goin to quit off out of dat roof  go away and learn some grammar said john severely  hey  well  are youse  no my son said john since you ask it i am not i like being up here how is sam  there was silence below the time began to pass slowly the irishmen on the other roof now definitely abandoning hope of further entertainment proceeded with hoots of derision to climb down one by one into the recesses of their own house  and then from the street far below there came a fusillade of shots and a babel of shouts and countershouts the roof of the house next door filled again with a magical swiftness and the low wall facing the street became black with the backs of those craning over there appeared to be great doings in the street  john smiled comfortably  in the army of the corridor confusion had arisen a scout clattering upstairs had brought the news of the table hillites advent and there was doubt as to the proper course to pursue certain voices urged going down to help the main body others pointed out that this would mean abandoning the siege of the roof the scout who had brought the news was eloquent in favor of the first course  gee he cried dont i keep tellin youse dat de table hills is here sure deres a whole bunch of dem and unless youse come on down deyll bite de hull head off of us lot leave dat stiff on de roof let sam wait here wit his canister and den he cant get down cos samll pump him full of lead while hes beatin it troo de trapdoor sure  john nodded reflectively  there is certainly something in that he murmured i guess the grand rescue scene in the third act has sprung a leak this will want thinking over  in the street the disturbance had now become terrible both sides were hard at it and the irishmen on the roof rewarded at last for their long vigil were yelling encouragement promiscuously and whooping with the unfettered ecstasy of men who are getting the treat of their lives without having paid a penny for it  the behavior of the new york policeman in affairs of this kind is based on principles of the soundest practical wisdom the unthinking man would rush in and attempt to crush the combat in its earliest and fiercest stages the new york policeman knowing the importance of his safety and the insignificance of the gangsmans permits the opposing forces to hammer each other into a certain distaste for battle and then when both sides have begun to have enough of it rushes in himself and clubs everything in sight it is an admirable process in its results but it is sure rather than swift  proceedings in the affair below had not yet reached the policeinterference stage the noise what with the shots and yells from the street and the earpiercing approval of the roof audience was just working up to a climax  john rose he was tired of kneeling by the trap and there was no likelihood of sam making another attempt to climb through he got up and stretched himself  and then he saw that betty was standing beside him holding with each hand a small andby broster street standardsuncannily clean child the children were scared and whimpering and she stooped to soothe them then she turned to john her eyes wide with anxiety  are you hurt she cried what has been happening are you hurt  johns heart leaped at the anxious break in her voice  its all right he said soothingly its absolutely all right everythings over  as if to give him the lie the noise in the street swelled to a crescendo of yells and shots  whats that cried betty starting  i fancy said john the police must be taking a hand its all right theres a little trouble down below there between two of the gangs it wont last long now  who were those men  my friends in the passage he said lightly those were some of the three points gang we were holding the concluding exercise of a rather lively campaign thats been  betty leaned weakly against the chimney there was silence now in the street only the distant rumble of an elevated train broke the stillness she drew her hands from the childrens grasp and covered her face as she lowered them again john saw that the blood had left her cheeks she was white and shaking he moved forward impulsively  betty  she tottered reaching blindly for the chimney for support and without further words he gathered her into his arms as if she had been the child she looked and held her there clutching her to him fiercely kissing the brown hair that brushed against his face and soothing her with vague murmurings  her breath came in broken gasps she laughed hysterically  i thought they were killing youkilling youand i couldnt leave my babiesthey were so frightened poor little mitesi thought they were killing you  betty  her arms about his neck tightened their grip convulsively forcing his head down until his face rested against hers and so they stood rigid while the two children stared with round eyes and whimpered unheeded  her grip relaxed her hands dropped slowly to her side she leaned back against the circle of his arms and looked up at hima strange look full of a sweet humility  i thought i was strong she said quietly im weakbut i dont care  he looked at her with glowing eyes not understanding but content that the journey was ended that she was there in his arms speaking to him  i always loved you dear she went on you knew that didnt you but i thought i was strong enough to give you up forfor a principlebut i was wrong i cant do without youi knew it just now when i saw she stopped and shuddered i cant do without you she repented  she felt the muscles of his arms quiver and pressed more closely against them they were strong arms protecting arms restful to lean against at the journeys end     chapter xxvii  a lemon   that bulwark of peaceful moments pugsy maloney was rather the man of action than the man of tact otherwise when a moment later he thrust his head up through the trap he would have withdrawn delicately and not split the silence with a raucous hey which acted on john and betty like an electric shock  john glowered at him betty was pink but composed pugsy climbed leisurely on to the roof and surveyed the group  why hello he said as he saw betty more closely  well pugsy said betty how are you  john turned in surprise  do you know pugsy  betty looked at him puzzled  why of course i do  sure said pugsy miss brown was stenographer on de poiper till she beat it  miss brown  there was utter bewilderment in johns face  i changed my name when i went to peaceful moments  then are youdid you  yes i wrote those articles thats how i happen to be here now i come down every day and help look after the babies poor little souls there seems to be nobody else here who has time to do it its dreadful some of themyou wouldnt believei dont think they could ever have had a real bath in their lives  baths is foolishness commented master maloney austerely eying the scoured infants with a touch of disfavor  john was reminded of a second mystery that needed solution  how on earth did you get up here pugsy he asked how did you get past sam  sam i didnt see no sam whos sam  one of those fellows a coon they left him on guard with a gun so that i shouldnt get down  ah i met a coon beating it down de stairs i guess dat was him i guess he got cold feet  then theres nothing to stop us from getting down  nope dats right dere aint a tree pointer witin a mile de cops have been loadin dem into de patrolwagon by de dozen  john turned to betty  well go and have dinner somewhere you havent begun to explain things yet  betty shook her head with a smile  i havent got time to go out to dinners she said im a workinggirl im cashier at fontellis italian restaurant i shall be on duty in another halfhour  john was aghast  you  its a very good situation said betty demurely six dollars a week and what i steal i havent stolen anything yet and i think mr jarvis is a little disappointed in me but of course i havent settled down properly  jarvis bat jarvis  yes he has been very good to me he got me this place and has looked after me all the time  ill buy him a thousand cats said john fervently but betty you mustnt go there any more you must quit you  if peaceful moments would reengage me said betty  she spoke lightly but her face was serious  dear she said quickly i cant be away from you now while theres danger i couldnt bear it will you let me come  he hesitated  you will you must her manner changed again thats settled then pugsy im coming back to the paper are you glad  sure ting said pugsy youre to de good  and now she went on i must give these babies back to their mothers and then ill come with you  she lowered herself through the trap and john handed the children down to her pugsy looked on smoking a thoughtful cigarette  john drew a deep breath pugsy removing the cigarette from his mouth delivered himself of a stately word of praise  shes a boid he said  pugsy said john feeling in his pocket and producing a roll of bills a dollar a word is our rate for contributions like that                                       john pushed back his chair slightly stretched out his legs and lighted a cigarette watching betty fondly through the smoke the resources of the knickerbocker hotel had proved equal to supplying the staff of peaceful moments with an excellent dinner and john had stoutly declined to give or listen to any explanations until the coffee arrived  thousands of promising careers he said have been ruined by the fatal practise of talking seriously at dinner but now we might begin  betty looked at him across the table with shining eyes it was good to be together again  my explanations wont take long she said i ran away from you and when you found me i ran away again  but i didnt find you objected john that was my trouble  but my aunt told you i was at peaceful moments  on the contrary i didnt even know you had an aunt  well shes not exactly that shes my stepfathers auntmrs oakley i was certain you had gone straight to her and that she had told you where i was  the mrs oakley theerphilanthropist  dont laugh at her said betty quickly she was so good to me  she passes said john decidedly  and now said betty its your turn  john lighted another cigarette  my story he said is rather longer when they threw me out of mervo  what  im afraid you dont keep abreast of european history he said havent you heard of the great revolution in mervo and the overthrow of the dynasty bloodless but invigorating the populace rose against me as one manexcept good old general poineau he was for me and crump was neutral but apart from them my subjects were unanimous theres a republic again in mervo now  but why what had you done  well i abolished the gamingtables but more probably he went on quickly they saw what a perfect dub i was in every  she interrupted him  do you mean to say that just because of me  well he said awkwardly as a matter of fact what you said did make me think over my position and of course directly i thought over itoh well anyway i closed down gambling in mervo and then  john  he was aware of a small hand creeping round the table under cover of the cloth he pressed it swiftly and looking round caught the eye of a hovering waiter who swooped like a respectful hawk  did you want anything sir  ive got it thanks said john  the waiter moved away  well directly they had fired me i came over here i dont know what i expected to do i suppose i thought i might find you by chance i pretty soon saw how hopeless it was and it struck me that if i didnt get some work to do mighty quick i shouldnt be much good to anyone except the alienists  dear  the waiter stared but johns eyes stopped him in midswoop  then i found smith  where is mr smith  in prison said john with a chuckle  in prison  he resisted and assaulted the police ill tell you about it later well smith told me of the alterations in peaceful moments and i saw that it was just the thing for me and it has occupied my mind quite some to think of you being the writer of those broster street articles you certainly have started something betty goodness knows where it will end i hoped to have brought off a coup this afternoon but the arrival of sam and his friends just spoiled it  this afternoon yes why were you there what were you doing  i was interviewing the collector of rents and trying to dig his employers name out of him it was smiths idea smiths theory was that the owner of the tenements must have some special private reason for lying low and that he would employ some special fellow whom he could trust as a rentcollector and im pretty certain he was right i cornered the collector a little rabbitfaced man named gooch and i believe he was on the point ofwhats the matter  bettys forehead was wrinkled her eyes wore a faraway expression  im trying to remember something i seem to know the name gooch and i seem to associate it with a little rabbitfaced man andquick tell me some more about him hes just hovering about on the edge of my memory quick push him in  john threw his mind back to the interview in the dark passage trying to reconstruct it  hes small he said slowly his eyes protrudeso do his teethheheyes i remember nowhe has a curious red mark  on his right cheek said betty triumphantly  by jove cried john youve got him  i remember him perfectly he was she stopped with a little gasp  yes  john he was one of my stepfathers secretaries she said  they looked at each other in silence  it cant be said john at length  it can it is he must be he has scores of interests everywhere he prides himself on it its the most natural thing  john shook his head doubtfully  but why all the fuss your stepfather isnt the man to mind public opinion  but dont you see its as mr smith said the private reason its as clear as daylight naturally he would do anything rather than be found out dont you see because of mrs oakley  because of mrs oakley  you dont know her as i do she is a curious mixture shes doublenatured you called her the philanthropist just now well she would be one ifif she could bear to part with money yes i know it sounds ridiculous but its so she is mean about money but she honestly hates to hear of anybody treating poor people badly if my stepfather were really the owner of those tenements and she should find it out she would have nothing more to do with him its true i know her  the smile passed away from johns face  by george he said it certainly begins to hang together  i know im right  i think you are  he sat meditating for a moment  well he said at last  what do you mean  i mean what are we to do do we go on with this  go on with it i dont understand  i meanwell it has become rather a family matter you see do you feel aswarlike against mr scobell as you did against an unknown lessee  bettys eyes sparkled  i dont think i should feel any different ifif it was you she said ive been spending days and days in those houses john dear and ive seen such utter squalor and misery where there neednt be any at all if only the owner would do his duty andand  she stopped her eyes were misty  thumbs down in fact said john nodding im with you  as he spoke two men came down the broad staircase into the grillroom bettys back was towards them but john saw them and stared  what are you looking at asked betty  will you count ten before looking round  what is it  your stepfather has just come in  what  hes sitting at the other side of the room directly behind you count ten  but betty had twisted round in her chair  where where  just where youre looking dont let him see you  i dont oh  got him  he leaned back in his chair  the plot thickens eh he said what is mr scobell doing in new york i wonder if he has not come to keep an eye on his interests  betty had whipped round again her face was white with excitement  its true she whispered i was right do you see who that is with him the man  do you know him hes a stranger to me  its mr parker said betty  john drew in his breath sharply  are you sure  positive  john laughed quietly he thought for a moment then beckoned to the hovering waiter  what are you going to do asked betty  bring me a small lemon said john  lemon squash sir  not a lemon squash a plain lemon the fruit of that name the common or garden citron which is sharp to the taste and not pleasant to have handed to one also a piece of note paper a little tissue paper and an envelope  what are you going to do asked betty again  john beamed  did you ever read the sherlock holmes story entitled the five orange pips well when a man in that story received a mysterious envelope containing five orange pips it was a sign that he was due to get his it was all over as far as he was concerned except phoning for the undertaker i propose to treat mr scobell better than that he shall have a whole lemon  the waiter returned john wrapped up the lemon carefully wrote on the note paper the words to b scobell esq property owner broster street from prince john of peaceful moments this gift and enclosed it in the envelope  do you see that gentleman at the table by the pillar he said give him these just say a gentleman sent them  the waiter smiled doubtfully john added a twodollar bill to the collection in his hand  you neednt give him that he said  the waiter smiled again but this time not doubtfully  and now said john as the messenger ambled off perhaps it would be just as well if we retired     chapter xxviii  the final attempt   proof that his shot had not missed its mark was supplied to john immediately upon his arrival at the office on the following morning when he was met by pugsy maloney with the information that a gentleman had called to see him  with or without a blackjack enquired john did he give any name  sure parkers his name he blew in oncst before when mr smith was here i loosed him into de odder room  john walked through the man he had seen with mr scobell at the knickerbocker was standing at the window  mr parker  the other turned as the door opened and looked at him keenly  are you mr maude  i am said john  i guess you dont need to be told what ive come about  no  see here said mr parker i dont know how youve found things out but youve done it and were through we quit  im glad of that said john would you mind informing spider reilly of that fact it will make life pleasanter for all of us  mr scobell sent me along here to ask you to come and talk over this thing with him hes at the knickerbocker ive a cab waiting outside can you come along  id rather he came here  and i bet hed rather come here than be where he is that little surprise packet of yours last night put him down and out gave him a stroke of some sort hes in bed now with halfadozen doctors working on him  john thought for a moment  oh he said slowly if its thatvery well  he could not help feeling a touch of remorse he had no reason to be fond of mr scobell but he was sorry that this should have happened  they went out on the street a taximeter cab was standing by the sidewalk they got in neither spoke john was thoughtful and preoccupied mr parker too appeared to be absorbed in his own thoughts he sat with folded arms and lowered head  the cab buzzed up fifth avenue suddenly something halfseen through the window brought john to himself with a jerk it was the great white mass of the plaza hotel the next moment he saw that they were abreast of the park and for the first time an icy wave of suspicion swept over him  here whats this he cried where are you taking me  mr parkers right hand came swiftly out of ambush and something gleamed in the sun  dont move said mr parker the hard nozzle of a pistol pressed against johns chest keep that hand still  john dropped his hand mr parker leaned back with the pistol resting easily on his knee the cab began to move more quickly  johns mind was in a whirl his chief emotion was not fear but disgust that he should have allowed himself to be trapped with such absurd ease he blushed for himself mr parkers face was expressionless but who could say what tumults of silent laughter were not going on inside him john bit his lip  well he said at last  mr parker did not reply  well said john again whats the next move  it flashed across his mind that unless driven to it by an attack his captor would do nothing for the moment without running grave risks himself to shoot now would be to attract attention the cab would be overtaken at once by bicycle police and stopped there would be no escape no nothing could happen till they reached open country at least he would have time to think this matter over in all its bearings  mr parker ignored the question he was sitting in the same attitude of watchfulness the revolver resting on his knee he seemed mistrustful of johns right hand which was hanging limply at his side it was from this quarter that he appeared to expect attack the cab was bowling easily up the broad street past rows and rows of high houses each looking exactly the same as the last occasionally to the right through a break in the line of buildings a glimpse of the river could be seen  a faint hope occurred to john that by talking he might put the other off his guard for just that instant which was all he asked he exerted himself to find material for conversation  tell me he said what you said about mr scobell was that true about his being ill in bed  mr parker did not answer but a wintry smile flittered across his face  it was not said john well im glad of that i dont wish mr scobell any harm  mr parker looked at him doubtfully  say why are you in this game at all he said what made you butt in  one must do something said john its interesting work  if youll quit  john shook his head  i own its a tempting proposition things being as they are but i wont give up yet you never know what may happen  well you can make a mighty near guess this trip  you cant do a thing yet thats sure said john confidently if you shot me now the cab would be stopped and you would be lynched by the populace i seem to see them tearing you limb from limb she loves me off comes an arm she loves me not a leg joins the little heap on the ground that is what would happen mr parker  the other shrugged his shoulders and relapsed into silence once more  what are you going to do with me mr parker asked john  mr parker did not reply                                       the cab moved swiftly on now they had reached the open country an occasional wooden shack was passed but that was all at any moment john felt the climax of the drama might be reached and he got ready his muscles stiffened for a spring there was little chance of its being effective but at least it would be good to put up some kind of a fight and he had a faint hope that the suddenness of his movement might upset the others aim he was bound to be hit somewhere that was certain but quickness might save him to some extent he braced his leg against the back of the cab and as he did so its smooth speed changed to a series of jarring jumps each more emphatic than the last it slowed down then came to a halt there was a thud as the chauffeur jumped down john heard him fumbling in the tool box presently the body of the machine was raised slightly as he got to work with the jack johns muscles relaxed he leaned back surely something could be made of this new development but the hand that held the revolver never wavered he paused irresolute and at the moment somebody spoke in the road outside  had a breakdown enquired the voice  john recognized it it was the voice of kid brady                                       the kid as he had stated that he intended to do had begun his training for his match with eddie wood at white plains it was his practise to open a course of training with a little gentle roadwork and it was while jogging along the highway a couple of miles from his training camp in company with the two thicknecked gentlemen who acted as his sparring partners that he had come upon the brokendown taxicab  if this had happened after his training had begun in real earnest he would have averted his eyes from the spectacle however alluring and continued on his way without a pause but now as he had not yet settled down to genuine hard work he felt justified in turning aside and looking into the matter the fact that the chauffeur who seemed to be a taciturn man lacking the conversational graces manifestly objected to an audience deterred him not at all one cannot have everything in this world and the kid and his attendant thicknecks were content to watch the process of mending the tire without demanding the additional joy of sparkling small talk from the man in charge of the operations  guys had a breakdown sure said the first of the thicknecks  surest thing you know agreed his colleague  seems to me the tires punctured said the kid  all three concentrated their gaze on the machine  kids right said thickneck number one guys been an bust a tire  surest thing you know said thickneck number two  they observed the perspiring chauffeur in silence for a while  wonder how he did that now speculated the kid  ran over a nail i guess said thickneck number one  surest thing you know said the other who while perhaps somewhat deficient in the matter of original thought was a most useful fellow to have by onea sort of boswell  did you run over a nail the kid enquired of the chauffeur  the chauffeur worked on unheeding  this is his busy day said the first thickneck with satire guys too full of work to talk to us  deaf shouldnt wonder surmised the kid say wonder whats he doing with a taxi so far out of the city  some guy tells him to drive him out here i guess say itll cost him something too hell have to strip off a few from his roll to pay for this  john glanced at mr parker quivering with excitement it was his last chance would the kid think to look inside the cab or would he move on could he risk a shout  mr parker leaned forward and thrust the muzzle of the pistol against his body the possibilities of the situation had evidently not been lost upon him  keep quiet he whispered  outside the conversation had begun again and the kid had made his decision  pretty rich guy inside he said following up his companions train of thought im going to rubber through the window  john met mr parkers eye and smiled  there came the sound of the kids feet grating on the road as he turned and as he heard it mr parker for the first time lost his head with a vague idea of screening john he halfrose the pistol wavered it was the chance john had prayed for his left hand shot out grasped the others wrist and gave it a sharp wrench the pistol went off with a deafening report the bullet passing through the back of the cab then fell to the floor as the fingers lost their hold and the next moment johns right fist darting upward crashed home  the effect was instantaneous john had risen from his seat as he delivered the blow and it got the full benefit of his weight mr parker literally crumpled up his head jerked then fell limply forward john pushed him on to the seat as he slid toward the floor  the interested face of the kid appeared at the window behind him could be seen portions of the faces of the two thicknecks  hello kid said john i heard your voice i hoped you might look in for a chat  the kid stared amazed  whats doin he queried  a good deal ill explain later first will you kindly knock that chauffeur down and sit on his head  de guys beat it volunteered the first thickneck  surest thing you know said the other  whats been doin asked the kid what are you going to do with this guy  john inspected the prostrate mr parker who had begun to stir slightly  i guess well leave him here he said ive had all of his company that i need for today show me the nearest station kid i must be getting back to new york ill tell you all about it as we go a walk will do me good riding in a taxi is pleasant but believe me you can have too much of it     chapter xxix  a representative gathering   when john returned to the office he found that his absence had been causing betty an anxious hours waiting she had been informed by pugsy that he had gone out in the company of mr parker and she felt uneasy she turned white at his story of the ride but he minimized the dangers  i dont think he ever meant to shoot i think he was going to shut me up somewhere out there and keep me till i promised to be good  do you think my stepfather told him to do it  i doubt it i fancy parker is a man who acts a good deal on his own inspirations but well ask him when he calls today  is he going to call  i have an idea he will said john i sent him a note just now asking if he could manage a visit  it was unfortunate in the light of subsequent events that mr jarvis should have seen fit to bring with him to the office that afternoon two of his collection of cats and that long otto who as before accompanied him should have been fired by his example to the extent of introducing a large yellow dog for before the afternoon was ended space in the office was destined to be at premium  mr jarvis when he had recovered from the surprise of seeing betty and learning that she had returned to her old situation explained  tought id bring de kits along he said dey starts fussn wit each odder yesterday so i brings dem along  john inspected the menagerie without resentment  sure he said they add a kind of peaceful touch to the scene  the atmosphere was indeed one of peace the dog after an inquisitive journey round the room lay down and went to sleep the cats settled themselves comfortably one on each of mr jarvis knees long otto surveying the ceiling with his customary glassy stare smoked a long cigar and bat scratching one of the cats under the ear began to entertain john with some reminiscences of fits and kittens  but the peace did not last ten minutes had barely elapsed when the dog sitting up with a start uttered a whine the door burst open and a little man dashed in he was brown in the face and had evidently been living recently in the open air behind him was a crowd of uncertain numbers they were all strangers to john  yes he said  the little man glared speechlessly at the occupants of the room the two bowery boys rose awkwardly the cats fell to the floor  the rest of the party had entered betty recognized the reverend edwin t philpotts and mr b henderson asher  my name is renshaw said the little man having found speech  what can i do for you asked john  the question appeared to astound the other  what can you of all  mr renshaw is the editor of peaceful moments she said mr smith was only acting for him  mr renshaw caught the name  yes mr smith i want to see mr smith where is he  in prison said john  in prison  john nodded  a good many things have happened since you left for your vacation smith assaulted a policeman and is now on blackwells island  mr renshaw gasped mr b henderson asher stared and stumbled over the cat  and who are you asked the editor  my name is maude i  he broke off to turn his attention to mr jarvis and mr asher between whom unpleasantness seemed to have arisen mr jarvis holding a cat in his arms was scowling at mr asher who had backed away and appeared apprehensive  what is the trouble asked john  dis guy here wit two left feet said bat querulously treads on de kit  mr renshaw eying bat and the silent otto with disgust intervened  who are these persons he enquired  poison yourself rejoined bat justly incensed whos de little squirt mr maude  john waved his hands  gentlemen gentlemen he said why descend to mere personalities i ought to have introduced you this is mr renshaw our editor these mr renshaw are bat jarvis and long otto our acting fighting editors vice kid brady absent on unavoidable business  the name stung mr renshaw to indignation as smiths had done  brady he shrilled i insist that you give me a full explanation i go away by my doctors orders for a vacation leaving mr smith to conduct the paper on certain clearly defined lines by mere chance while on my vacation i saw a copy of the paper it had been ruined  ruined said john on the contrary the circulation has been going up every week  who is this person brady with mr philpotts i have been going carefully over the numbers which have been issued since my departure  an intellectual treat murmured john  and in each there is a picture of this young man in a costume which i will not particularize  there is hardly enough of it to particularize  together with a page of disgusting autobiographical matter  john held up his hand  i protest he said we court criticism but this is mere abuse i appeal to these gentlemen to say whether this for instance is not bright and interesting  he picked up the current number of peaceful moments and turned to the kids page  this he said describes a certain tenround unpleasantness with one mexican joe joe comes up for the second round and he gives me a nasty look but i thinks of my mother and swats him one in the lower ribs he gives me another nasty look all right kid he says now ill knock you up into the gallery and with that he cuts loose with a right swing but i falls into the clinch and then  pah exclaimed mr renshaw  go on boss urged mr jarvis approvingly its to de good dat stuff  there said john triumphantly you heard mr jarvis one of the most firmly established critics east of fifth avenue stamps kid bradys reminiscences with the hallmark of his approval  i falls fer de kid every time assented mr jarvis  sure you know a good thing when you see one why he went on warmly there is stuff in these reminiscences which would stir the blood of a jellyfish let me quote you another passage to show that they are not only enthralling but helpful as well let me see where is it ah i have it a bully good way of putting a guy out of business is this you dont want to use it in the ring because rightly speaking its a foul but you will find it mighty useful if any thickneck comes up to you in the street and tries to start anything its this way while hes setting himself for a punch just place the tips of the fingers of your left hand on the right side of the chest then bring down the heel of your left hand there isnt a guy living that could stand up against that the fingers give you a leverage to beat the band the guy doubles up and you uppercut him with your right and out he goes now i bet you never knew that before mr philpotts try it on your parishioners  peaceful moments said mr renshaw irately is no medium for exploiting low prizefighters  low prizefighters no no the kid is as decent a little chap as youd meet anywhere and right up in the championship class too hes matched against eddie wood at this very moment and mr waterman will support me in my statement that a victory over eddie wood means that he gets a castiron claim to meet jimmy garvin for the championship  it is abominable burst forth mr renshaw it is disgraceful the paper is ruined  you keep saying that it really isnt so the returns are excellent prosperity beams on us like a sun the proprietor is more than satisfied  indeed said mr renshaw sardonically  sure said john  mr renshaw laughed an acid laugh  you may not know it he said but mr scobell is in new york at this very moment we arrived together yesterday on the mauretania i was spending my vacation in england when i happened to see the copy of the paper i instantly communicated with mr scobell who was at mervo an island in the mediterranean  i seem to know the name  and received in reply a long cable desiring me to return to new york immediately i sailed on the mauretania and found that he was one of the passengers he was extremely agitated let me tell you so that your impudent assertion that the proprietor is pleased  john raised his eyebrows  i dont quite understand he said from what you say one would almost imagine that you thought mr scobell was the proprietor of this paper  mr renshaw stared everyone stared except mr jarvis who since the readings from the kids reminiscences had ceased had lost interest in the proceedings and was now entertaining the cats with a ball of paper tied to a string  thought that mr scobell repeated mr renshaw who is if he is not  i am said john  there was a moments absolute silence  you cried mr renshaw  you exclaimed mr waterman mr asher and the reverend edwin t philpotts  sure thing said john  mr renshaw groped for a chair and sat down  am i going mad he demanded feebly do i understand you to say that you own this paper  i do  since when  roughly speaking about three days  among his audience still excepting mr jarvis who was tickling one of the cats and whistling a plaintive melody there was a tendency toward awkward silence to start assailing a seeming nonentity and then to discover he is the proprietor of the paper to which you wish to contribute is like kicking an apparently empty hat and finding your rich uncle inside it mr renshaw in particular was disturbed editorships of the kind to which he aspired are not easy to get if he were to be removed from peaceful moments he would find it hard to place himself anywhere else editors like manuscripts are rejected from want of space  i had a little money to invest continued john and it seemed to me that i couldnt do better than put it into peaceful moments if it did nothing else it would give me a free hand in pursuing a policy in which i was interested smith told me that mr scobells representatives had instructions to accept any offer so i made an offer and they jumped at it  pugsy maloney entered bearing a card  ask him to wait just one moment said john reading it  he turned to mr renshaw  mr renshaw he said if you took hold of the paper again helped by these other gentlemen do you think you could gather in our old subscribers and generally make the thing a live proposition on the old lines because if so i should be glad if you would start in with the next number i am through with the present policy at least i hope to be in a few minutes do you think you can undertake that  mr renshaw with a sigh of relief intimated that he could  good said john and now im afraid i must ask you to go a rather private and delicate interview is in the offing bat im very much obliged to you and otto for your help i dont know what we should have done without it  aw chee said mr jarvis  then goodby for the present  goodby boss goodby loidy  long otto pulled his forelock and accompanied by the cats and the dog they left the room  when mr renshaw and the others had followed them john rang the bell for pugsy  ask mr scobell to step in he said  the man of many enterprises entered his appearance had deteriorated since john had last met him he had the air of one who has been caught in the machinery his face was even sallower than of yore and there was no gleam in his dull green eyes  he started at the sight of betty but he was evidently too absorbed in the business in hand to be surprised at seeing her he sank into a chair and stared gloomily at john  well he said  well said john  this observed mr scobell simply is hell he drew a cigar stump mechanically from his vest pocket and lighted it  what are you going to do about it he asked  what are you said john its up to you  mr scobell gazed heavily into vacancy  ever since i started in to monkey with that darned mervo he said sadly there aint a thing gone right i havent been able to turn around without bumping into myself everything i touch turns to mud i guess i can still breathe but im not betting on that lasting long of all the darned hoodoos that island was the worst say i gotta close down that casino what do you know about that sure thing the old lady wont stand for it i had a letter from her he turned to betty you got her all worked up betty im not blaming you its just my jinx she took it into her head id been treating you mean and she kicked at the casino i gotta close it down or nix on the heir thing that was enough for me im going to turn it into a hotel  he relighted his cigar  and now just as i got her smoothed down along comes this darned tenement business say prince for the love of mike cut it out if those houses are as bad as you say they are and the old lady finds out that i own them itll be katie bar the door for me she wouldnt stand for it for a moment i guess i didnt treat you good prince but lets forget it ease up on this rough stuff ill do anything you want  betty spoke  we only want you to make the houses fit to live in she said i dont believe you know what theyre like  why no i left parker in charge it was up to him to do what was wanted say prince i want to talk to you about that guy parker i understand hes been rather rough with you and your crowd that wasnt my doing i didnt know anything about it till he told me its the darned wild west strain in him coming out he used to do those sort of things out there and hes forgotten his manners i pay him well and i guess he thinks thats the way its up to him to earn it you mustnt mind parker  oh well so long as he means well said john ive no grudge against parker ive settled with him  well then what about this broster street thing you want me to fix some improvements is that it  thats it  why say ill do that sure and then youll quit handing out the newspaper stories that goes ill start right in  he rose  thats taken a heap off my mind he said  theres just one other thing said john have you by any chance such a thing as a stepfathers blessing on you  eh  john took bettys hand  weve come round to your views mr scobell he said that scheme of yours for our future looks good to us  mr scobell bit through his cigar in his emotion  now why the heck he moaned couldnt you have had the sense to do that before and save all this trouble     chapter xxx  conclusion   smith drew thoughtfully at his cigar and shifted himself more comfortably into his chair it was long since he had visited the west and he had found all the old magic in the still scented darkness of the prairie night he gave a little sigh of content when john a year before had announced his intention of buying this ranch and as it seemed to smith burying himself alive a thousand miles from anywhere he had disapproved he had pointed out that john was not doing what fate expected of him a miracle in the shape of a sixfigure wedding present from mrs oakley who had never been known before in the memory of man to give away a millionth of that sum had happened to him fate argued smith plainly intended him to stay in new york and spend his money in a civilized way  john had had only one reply but it was clinching  betty likes the idea he said and smith ceased to argue  now as he sat smoking on the porch on the first night of his inaugural visit to the ranch a conviction was creeping over him that john had chosen wisely  a door opened behind him betty came out on to the porch and dropped into a chair close to where johns cigar glowed redly in the darkness they sat there without speaking the stirring of unseen cattle in the corral made a soothing accompaniment to thought  it is very pleasant for an old jail bird like myself said smith at last to sit here at my ease i wish all our absent friends could be with us tonight or perhaps not quite all let us say comrade parker here comrades brady and maloney over there by you and our old friend renshaw sharing the floor with b henderson asher bat jarvis and the cats by the way i was round at broster street before i left new york there is certainly an improvement millionaires now stop there instead of going on to the plaza are you asleep john  no  excellent i also saw comrade brady before i left he has definitely got on his match with jimmy garvin  good hell win  the papers seem to think so peaceful moments however i am sorry to say is silent on the subject it was not like this in the good old days how is the paper going now john are the receipts satisfactory  pretty fair renshaw is rather a marvel in his way he seems to have roped in nearly all the old subscribers they eat out of his hand  smith stretched himself  these he said are the moments in life to which we look back with that wistful pleasure this peaceful scene john will remain with me when i have forgotten that such a man as spider reilly ever existed these are the real peaceful moments  he closed his eyes the cigar dropped from his fingers there was a long silence  mr smith said betty  there was no answer  hes asleep said john he had a long journey today  betty drew her chair closer from somewhere out in the darkness from the direction of the mens quarters came the soft tinkle of a guitar and a voice droning a mexican lovesong  her hand stole out and found his they began to talk in whispers     the end
