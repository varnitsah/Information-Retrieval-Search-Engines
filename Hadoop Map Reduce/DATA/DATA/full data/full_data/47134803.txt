47134803	tales and fantasies     contents  the misadventures of john nicholson the bodysnatcher the story of a lie   the misadventures of john nicholson     chapter i  in which john sows the wind    john varey nicholson was stupid yet stupider men than he are now sprawling in parliament and lauding themselves as the authors of their own distinction  he was of a fat habit even from boyhood and inclined to a cheerful and cursory reading of the face of life and possibly this attitude of mind was the original cause of his misfortunes  beyond this hint philosophy is silent on his career and superstition steps in with the more ready explanation that he was detested of the gods  his father  that iron gentleman  had long ago enthroned himself on the heights of the disruption principles  what these are and in spite of their grim name they are quite innocent no array of terms would render thinkable to the merely english intelligence but to the scot they often prove unctuously nourishing and mr nicholson found in them the milk of lions  about the period when the churches convene at edinburgh in their annual assemblies he was to be seen descending the mound in the company of divers redheaded clergymen these voluble he only contributing oracular nods brief negatives and the austere spectacle of his stretched upper lip  the names of candlish and begg were frequent in these interviews and occasionally the talk ran on the residuary establishment and the doings of one lee  a stranger to the tight little theological kingdom of scotland might have listened and gathered literally nothing  and mr nicholson who was not a dull man knew this and raged at it  he knew there was a vast world outside to whom disruption principles were as the chatter of treetop apes the paper brought him chill whiffs from it he had met englishmen who had asked lightly if he did not belong to the church of scotland and then had failed to be much interested by his elucidation of that nice point it was an evil wild rebellious world lying sunk in dozenedness for nothing short of a scots word will paint this scotsmans feelings and when he entered into his own house in randolph crescent south side and shut the door behind him his heart swelled with security  here at least was a citadel impregnable by righthand defections or lefthand extremes  here was a family where prayers came at the same hour where the sabbath literature was unimpeachably selected where the guest who should have leaned to any false opinion was instantly set down and over which there reigned all week and grew denser on sundays a silence that was agreeable to his ear and a gloom that he found comfortable  mrs nicholson had died about thirty and left him with three children a daughter two years and a son about eight years younger than john and john himself the unlucky bearer of a name infamous in english history  the daughter maria was a good girl  dutiful pious dull but so easily startled that to speak to her was quite a perilous enterprise  i dont think i care to talk about that if you please she would say and strike the boldest speechless by her unmistakable pain this upon all topics  dress pleasure morality politics in which the formula was changed to my papa thinks otherwise and even religion unless it was approached with a particular whining tone of voice  alexander the younger brother was sickly clever fond of books and drawing and full of satirical remarks  in the midst of these imagine that natural clumsy unintelligent and mirthful animal john mighty wellbehaved in comparison with other lads although not up to the mark of the house in randolph crescent full of a sort of blundering affection full of caresses which were never very warmly received full of sudden and loud laughter which rang out in that still house like curses  mr nicholson himself had a great fund of humour of the scots order  intellectual turning on the observation of men his own character for instance  if he could have seen it in another  would have been a rare feast to him but his sons empty guffaws over a broken plate and empty almost lighthearted remarks struck him with pain as the indices of a weak mind  outside the family john had early attached himself much as a dog may follow a marquis to the steps of alan houston a lad about a year older than himself idle a trifle wild the heir to a good estate which was still in the hands of a rigorous trustee and so royally content with himself that he took johns devotion as a thing of course  the intimacy was gall to mr nicholson it took his son from the house and he was a jealous parent it kept him from the office and he was a martinet lastly mr nicholson was ambitious for his family in which and the disruption principles he entirely lived and he hated to see a son of his play second fiddle to an idler  after some hesitation he ordered that the friendship should cease  an unfair command though seemingly inspired by the spirit of prophecy and john saying nothing continued to disobey the order under the rose  john was nearly nineteen when he was one day dismissed rather earlier than usual from his fathers office where he was studying the practice of the law  it was saturday and except that he had a matter of four hundred pounds in his pocket which it was his duty to hand over to the british linen companys bank he had the whole afternoon at his disposal  he went by princes street enjoying the mild sunshine and the little thrill of easterly wind that tossed the flags along that terrace of palaces and tumbled the green trees in the garden  the band was playing down in the valley under the castle and when it came to the turn of the pipers he heard their wild sounds with a stirring of the blood  something distantly martial woke in him and he thought of miss mackenzie whom he was to meet that day at dinner  now it is undeniable that he should have gone directly to the bank but right in the way stood the billiardroom of the hotel where alan was almost certain to be found and the temptation proved too strong  he entered the billiardroom and was instantly greeted by his friend cue in hand  nicholson said he i want you to lend me a pound or two till monday  youve come to the right shop havent you returned john i have twopence  nonsense said alan  you can get some  go and borrow at your tailors they all do it  or ill tell you what pop your watch  oh yes i dare say said john  and how about my father  how is he to know  he doesnt wind it up for you at night does he inquired alan at which john guffawed  no seriously i am in a fix continued the tempter  i have lost some money to a man here  ill give it you tonight and you can get the heirloom out again on monday  come its a small service after all  i would do a good deal more for you  whereupon john went forth and pawned his gold watch under the assumed name of john froggs 85 pleasance  but the nervousness that assailed him at the door of that inglorious haunt  a pawnshop  and the effort necessary to invent the pseudonym which somehow seemed to him a necessary part of the procedure had taken more time than he imagined and when he returned to the billiardroom with the spoils the bank had already closed its doors  this was a shrewd knock  a piece of business had been neglected  he heard these words in his fathers trenchant voice and trembled and then dodged the thought  after all who was to know  he must carry four hundred pounds about with him till monday when the neglect could be surreptitiously repaired and meanwhile he was free to pass the afternoon on the encircling divan of the billiardroom smoking his pipe sipping a pint of ale and enjoying to the masthead the modest pleasures of admiration  none can admire like a young man  of all youths passions and pleasures this is the most common and least alloyed and every flash of alans black eyes every aspect of his curly head every graceful reach every easy standoff attitude of waiting ay and down to his shirtsleeves and wristlinks were seen by john through a luxurious glory  he valued himself by the possession of that royal friend hugged himself upon the thought and swam in warm azure his own defects like vanquished difficulties becoming things on which to plume himself  only when he thought of miss mackenzie there fell upon his mind a shadow of regret that young lady was worthy of better things than plain john nicholson still known among schoolmates by the derisive name of fatty and he felt if he could chalk a cue or stand at ease with such a careless grace as alan he could approach the object of his sentiments with a less crushing sense of inferiority  before they parted alan made a proposal that was startling in the extreme  he would be at colettes that night about twelve he said  why should not john come there and get the money  to go to colettes was to see life indeed it was wrong it was against the laws it partook in a very dingy manner of adventure  were it known it was the sort of exploit that disconsidered a young man for good with the more serious classes but gave him a standing with the riotous and yet colettes was not a hell it could not come without vaulting hyperbole under the rubric of a gilded saloon and if it was a sin to go there the sin was merely local and municipal  colette whose name i do not know how to spell for i was never in epistolary communication with that hospitable outlaw was simply an unlicensed publican who gave suppers after eleven at night the edinburgh hour of closing  if you belonged to a club you could get a much better supper at the same hour and lose not a jot in public esteem  but if you lacked that qualification and were an hungered or inclined toward conviviality at unlawful hours colettes was your only port  you were very illsupplied the company was not recruited from the senate or the church though the bar was very well represented on the only occasion on which i flew in the face of my countrys laws and taking my reputation in my hand penetrated into that grim supper house  and colettes frequenters thrillingly conscious of wrongdoing and that twohanded engine the policeman at the door were perhaps inclined to somewhat feverish excess but the place was in no sense a very bad one and it is somewhat strange to me at this distance of time how it had acquired its dangerous repute  in precisely the same spirit as a man may debate a project to ascend the matterhorn or to cross africa john considered alans proposal and greatly daring accepted it  as he walked home the thoughts of this excursion out of the safe places of life into the wild and arduous stirred and struggled in his imagination with the image of miss mackenzie  incongruous and yet kindred thoughts for did not each imply unusual tightening of the pegs of resolution did not each woo him forth and warn him back again into himself  between these two considerations at least he was more than usually moved and when he got to randolph crescent he quite forgot the four hundred pounds in the inner pocket of his greatcoat hung up the coat with its rich freight upon his particular pin of the hatstand and in the very action sealed his doom    chapter ii  in which john reaps the whirlwind    about halfpast ten it was johns brave good fortune to offer his arm to miss mackenzie and escort her home  the night was chill and starry all the way eastward the trees of the different gardens rustled and looked black  up the stone gully of leith walk when they came to cross it the breeze made a rush and set the flames of the streetlamps quavering and when at last they had mounted to the royal terrace where captain mackenzie lived a great salt freshness came in their faces from the sea  these phases of the walk remained written on johns memory each emphasised by the touch of that light hand on his arm and behind all these aspects of the nocturnal city he saw in his mindseye a picture of the lighted drawingroom at home where he had sat talking with flora and his father from the other end had looked on with a kind and ironical smile  john had read the significance of that smile which might have escaped a stranger  mr nicholson had remarked his sons entanglement with satisfaction tinged by humour and his smile if it still was a thought contemptuous had implied consent  at the captains door the girl held out her hand with a certain emphasis and john took it and kept it a little longer and said goodnight flora dear and was instantly thrown into much fear by his presumption  but she only laughed ran up the steps and rang the bell and while she was waiting for the door to open kept close in the porch and talked to him from that point as out of a fortification  she had a knitted shawl over her head her blue highland eyes took the light from the neighbouring streetlamp and sparkled and when the door opened and closed upon her john felt cruelly alone  he proceeded slowly back along the terrace in a tender glow and when he came to greenside church he halted in a doubtful mind  over the crown of the calton hill to his left lay the way to colettes where alan would soon be looking for his arrival and where he would now have no more consented to go than he would have wilfully wallowed in a bog the touch of the girls hand on his sleeve and the kindly light in his fathers eyes both loudly forbidding  but right before him was the way home which pointed only to bed a place of little ease for one whose fancy was strung to the lyrical pitch and whose not very ardent heart was just then tumultuously moved  the hilltop the cool air of the night the company of the great monuments the sight of the city under his feet with its hills and valleys and crossing files of lamps drew him by all he had of the poetic and he turned that way and by that quite innocent deflection ripened the crop of his venial errors for the sickle of destiny  on a seat on the hill above greenside he sat for perhaps half an hour looking down upon the lamps of edinburgh and up at the lamps of heaven  wonderful were the resolves he formed beautiful and kindly were the vistas of future life that sped before him  he uttered to himself the name of flora in so many touching and dramatic keys that he became at length fairly melted with tenderness and could have sung aloud  at that juncture a certain creasing in his greatcoat caught his ear  he put his hand into his pocket pulled forth the envelope that held the money and sat stupefied  the calton hill about this period had an ill name of nights and to be sitting there with four hundred pounds that did not belong to him was hardly wise  he looked up  there was a man in a very bad hat a little on one side of him apparently looking at the scenery from a little on the other a second night walker was drawing very quietly near  up jumped john  the envelope fell from his hands he stooped to get it and at the same moment both men ran in and closed with him  a little after he got to his feet very sore and shaken the poorer by a purse which contained exactly one penny postage stamp by a cambric handkerchief and by the allimportant envelope  here was a young man on whom at the highest point of lovely exaltation there had fallen a blow too sharp to be supported alone and not many hundred yards away his greatest friend was sitting at supper  ay and even expecting him  was it not in the nature of man that he should run there  he went in quest of sympathy  in quest of that droll article that we all suppose ourselves to want when in a strait and have agreed to call advice and he went besides with vague but rather splendid expectations of relief  alan was rich or would be so when he came of age  by a stroke of the pen he might remedy this misfortune and avert that dreaded interview with mr nicholson from which john now shrunk in imagination as the hand draws back from fire  close under the calton hill there runs a certain narrow avenue part street part byroad  the head of it faces the doors of the prison its tail descends into the sunless slums of the low calton  on one hand it is overhung by the crags of the hill on the other by an old graveyard  between these two the roadway runs in a trench sparsely lighted at night sparsely frequented by day and bordered when it was cleared the place of tombs by dingy and ambiguous houses  one of these was the house of colette and at his door our ill starred john was presently beating for admittance  in an evil hour he satisfied the jealous inquiries of the contraband hotelkeeper in an evil hour he penetrated into the somewhat unsavoury interior  alan to be sure was there seated in a room lighted by noisy gasjets beside a dirty tablecloth engaged on a coarse meal and in the company of several tipsy members of the junior bar  but alan was not sober he had lost a thousand pounds upon a horse race had received the news at dinnertime and was now in default of any possible means of extrication drowning the memory of his predicament  he to help john  the thing was impossible he couldnt help himself  if you have a beast of a father said he i can tell you i have a brute of a trustee  im not going to hear my father called a beast said john with a beating heart feeling that he risked the last sound rivet of the chain that bound him to life  but alan was quite goodnatured  all right old fellow said he  mos respecable man your father  and he introduced his friend to his companions as old nicholson the whatdyecallums son  john sat in dumb agony  colettes foul walls and maculate tablelinen and even down to colettes villainous casters seemed like objects in a nightmare  and just then there came a knock and a scurrying the police so lamentably absent from the calton hill appeared upon the scene and the party taken flagrante delicto with their glasses at their elbow were seized marched up to the police office and all duly summoned to appear as witnesses in the consequent case against that archshebeener colette  it was a sorrowful and a mightily sobered company that came forth again  the vague terror of public opinion weighed generally on them all but there were private and particular horrors on the minds of individuals  alan stood in dread of his trustee already sorely tried  one of the group was the son of a country minister another of a judge john the unhappiest of all had david nicholson to father the idea of facing whom on such a scandalous subject was physically sickening  they stood awhile consulting under the buttresses of saint giles thence they adjourned to the lodgings of one of the number in north castle street where for that matter they might have had quite as good a supper and far better drink than in the dangerous paradise from which they had been routed  there over an almost tearful glass they debated their position  each explained he had the world to lose if the affair went on and he appeared as a witness  it was remarkable what bright prospects were just then in the very act of opening before each of that little company of youths and what pious consideration for the feelings of their families began now to well from them  each moreover was in an odd state of destitution  not one could bear his share of the fine not one but evinced a wonderful twinkle of hope that each of the others in succession was the very man who could step in to make good the deficit  one took a high hand he could not pay his share if it went to a trial he should bolt he had always felt the english bar to be his true sphere  another branched out into touching details about his family and was not listened to  john in the midst of this disorderly competition of poverty and meanness sat stunned contemplating the mountain bulk of his misfortunes  at last upon a pledge that each should apply to his family with a common frankness this convention of unhappy young asses broke up went down the common stair and in the grey of the spring morning with the streets lying dead empty all about them the lamps burning on into the daylight in diminished lustre and the birds beginning to sound premonitory notes from the groves of the town gardens went each his own way with bowed head and echoing footfall  the rooks were awake in randolph crescent but the windows looked down discreetly blinded on the return of the prodigal  johns passkey was a recent privilege this was the first time it had been used and oh with what a sickening sense of his unworthiness he now inserted it into the welloiled lock and entered that citadel of the proprieties  all slept the gas in the hall had been left faintly burning to light his return a dreadful stillness reigned broken by the deep ticking of the eightday clock he put the gas out and sat on a chair in the hall waiting and counting the minutes longing for any human countenance but when at last he heard the alarm spring its rattle in the lower story and the servants begin to be about he instantly lost heart and fled to his own room where he threw himself upon the bed    chapter iii  in which john enjoys the harvest home    shortly after breakfast at which he assisted with a highly tragical countenance john sought his father where he sat presumably in religious meditation on the sabbath mornings the old gentleman looked up with that sour inquisitive expression that came so near to smiling and was so different in effect  this is a time when i do not like to be disturbed he said  i know that returned john but i have  i want  ive made a dreadful mess of it he broke out and turned to the window  mr nicholson sat silent for an appreciable time while his unhappy son surveyed the poles in the back green and a certain yellow cat that was perched upon the wall  despair sat upon john as he gazed and he raged to think of the dreadful series of his misdeeds and the essential innocence that lay behind them  well said the father with an obvious effort but in very quiet tones what is it  maclean gave me four hundred pounds to put in the bank sir began john and im sorry to say that ive been robbed of it  robbed of it cried mr nicholson with a strong rising inflection  robbed  be careful what you say john  i cant say anything else sir i was just robbed of it said john in desperation sullenly  and where and when did this extraordinary event take place inquired the father  on the calton hill about twelve last night  the calton hill repeated mr nicholson  and what were you doing there at such a time of the night  nothing sir says john  mr nicholson drew in his breath  and how came the money in your hands at twelve last night he asked sharply  i neglected that piece of business said john anticipating comment and then in his own dialect i clean forgot all about it  well said his father its a most extraordinary story have you communicated with the police  i have answered poor john the blood leaping to his face they think they know the men that did it  i dare say the money will be recovered if that was all said he with a desperate indifference which his father set down to levity but which sprung from the consciousness of worse behind  your mothers watch too asked mr nicholson  oh the watch is all right cried john  at least i mean i was coming to the watch  the fact is i am ashamed to say i  i had pawned the watch before  here is the ticket they didnt find that the watch can be redeemed they dont sell pledges  the lad panted out these phrases one after another like minute guns but at the last word which rang in that stately chamber like an oath his heart failed him utterly and the dreaded silence settled on father and son  it was broken by mr nicholson picking up the pawnticket john froggs 85 pleasance he read and then turning upon john with a brief flash of passion and disgust who is john froggs he cried  nobody said john  it was just a name  an alias his father commented  oh  i think scarcely quite that said the culprit its a form they all do it the man seemed to understand we had a great deal of fun over the name    he paused at that for he saw his father wince at the picture like a man physically struck and again there was silence  i do not think said mr nicholson at last that i am an ungenerous father  i have never grudged you money within reason for any avowable purpose you had just to come to me and speak  and now i find that you have forgotten all decency and all natural feeling and actually pawned  pawned  your mothers watch  you must have had some temptation i will do you the justice to suppose it was a strong one  what did you want with this money  i would rather not tell you sir said john  it will only make you angry  i will not be fenced with cried his father  there must be an end of disingenuous answers  what did you want with this money  to lend it to houston sir says john  i thought i had forbidden you to speak to that young man asked the father  yes sir said john but i only met him  where came the deadly question  and in a billiardroom was the damning answer  thus had johns single departure from the truth brought instant punishment  for no other purpose but to see alan would he have entered a billiardroom but he had desired to palliate the fact of his disobedience and now it appeared that he frequented these disreputable haunts upon his own account  once more mr nicholson digested the vile tidings in silence and when john stole a glance at his fathers countenance he was abashed to see the marks of suffering  well said the old gentleman at last i cannot pretend not to be simply bowed down  i rose this morning what the world calls a happy man  happy at least in a son of whom i thought i could be reasonably proud    but it was beyond human nature to endure this longer and john interrupted almost with a scream  oh wheest he cried thats not all thats not the worst of it  its nothing  how could i tell you were proud of me  oh  i wish i wish that i had known but you always said i was such a disgrace  and the dreadful thing is this we were all taken up last night and we have to pay colettes fine among the six or well be had up for evidence  shebeening it is they made me swear to tell you but for my part he cried bursting into tears i just wish that i was dead  and he fell on his knees before a chair and hid his face  whether his father spoke or whether he remained long in the room or at once departed are points lost to history  a horrid turmoil of mind and body bursting sobs broken vanishing thoughts now of indignation now of remorse broken elementary whiffs of consciousness of the smell of the horsehair on the chair bottom of the jangling of church bells that now began to make day horrible throughout the confines of the city of the hard floor that bruised his knees of the taste of tears that found their way into his mouth for a period of time the duration of which i cannot guess while i refuse to dwell longer on its agony these were the whole of gods world for john nicholson  when at last as by the touching of a spring he returned again to clearness of consciousness and even a measure of composure the bells had but just done ringing and the sabbath silence was still marred by the patter of belated feet  by the clock above the fire as well as by these more speaking signs the service had not long begun and the unhappy sinner if his father had really gone to church might count on near two hours of only comparative unhappiness  with his father the superlative degree returned infallibly  he knew it by every shrinking fibre in his body he knew it by the sudden dizzy whirling of his brain at the mere thought of that calamity  an hour and a half perhaps an hour and threequarters if the doctor was longwinded and then would begin again that active agony from which even in the dull ache of the present he shrunk as from the bite of fire  he saw in a vision the family pew the somnolent cushions the bibles the psalmbooks maria with her smellingsalts his father sitting spectacled and critical and at once he was struck with indignation not unjustly  it was inhuman to go off to church and leave a sinner in suspense unpunished unforgiven  and at the very touch of criticism the paternal sanctity was lessened yet the paternal terror only grew and the two strands of feeling pushed him in the same direction  and suddenly there came upon him a mad fear lest his father should have locked him in  the notion had no ground in sense it was probably no more than a reminiscence of similar calamities in childhood for his fathers room had always been the chamber of inquisition and the scene of punishment but it stuck so rigorously in his mind that he must instantly approach the door and prove its untruth  as he went he struck upon a drawer left open in the business table  it was the moneydrawer a measure of his fathers disarray the moneydrawer  perhaps a pointing providence  who is to decide when even divines differ between a providence and a temptation or who sitting calmly under his own vine is to pass a judgment on the doings of a poor hunted dog slavishly afraid slavishly rebellious like john nicholson on that particular sunday  his hand was in the drawer almost before his mind had conceived the hope and rising to his new situation he wrote sitting in his fathers chair and using his fathers blottingpad his pitiful apology and farewell   my dear father  i have taken the money but i will pay it back as soon as i am able  you will never hear of me again i did not mean any harm by anything so i hope you will try and forgive me  i wish you would say goodbye to alexander and maria but not if you dont want to  i could not wait to see you really  please try to forgive me  your affectionate son  john nicholson   the coins abstracted and the missive written he could not be gone too soon from the scene of these transgressions and remembering how his father had once returned from church on some slight illness in the middle of the second psalm he durst not even make a packet of a change of clothes  attired as he was he slipped from the paternal doors and found himself in the cool spring air the thin spring sunshine and the great sabbath quiet of the city which was now only pointed by the cawing of the rooks  there was not a soul in randolph crescent nor a soul in queensferry street in this outdoor privacy and the sense of escape john took heart again and with a pathetic sense of leavetaking he even ventured up the lane and stood awhile a strange peri at the gates of a quaint paradise by the west end of st georges church  they were singing within and by a strange chance the tune was st georges edinburgh which bears the name and was first sung in the choir of that church  who is this king of glory went the voices from within and to john this was like the end of all christian observances for he was now to be a wild man like ishmael and his life was to be cast in homeless places and with godless people  it was thus with no rising sense of the adventurous but in mere desolation and despair that he turned his back on his native city and set out on foot for california with a more immediate eye to glasgow    chapter iv  the second sowing    it is no part of mine to narrate the adventures of john nicholson which were many but simply his more momentous misadventures which were more than he desired and by human standards more than he deserved how he reached california how he was rooked and robbed and beaten and starved how he was at last taken up by charitable folk restored to some degree of selfcomplacency and installed as a clerk in a bank in san francisco it would take too long to tell nor in these episodes were there any marks of the peculiar nicholsonic destiny for they were just such matters as befell some thousands of other young adventurers in the same days and places  but once posted in the bank he fell for a time into a high degree of good fortune which as it was only a longer way about to fresh disaster it behooves me to explain  it was his luck to meet a young man in what is technically called a dive and thanks to his monthly wages to extricate this new acquaintance from a position of present disgrace and possible danger in the future  this young man was the nephew of one of the nob hill magnates who run the san francisco stock exchange much as more humble adventurers in the corner of some public park at home may be seen to perform the simple artifice of pea and thimble for their own profit that is to say and the discouragement of public gambling  it was thus in his power  and as he was of grateful temper it was among the things that he desired  to put john in the way of growing rich and thus without thought or industry or so much as even understanding the game at which he played but by simply buying and selling what he was told to buy and sell that plaything of fortune was presently at the head of between eleven and twelve thousand pounds or as he reckoned it of upward of sixty thousand dollars  how he had come to deserve this wealth any more than how he had formerly earned disgrace at home was a problem beyond the reach of his philosophy  it was true that he had been industrious at the bank but no more so than the cashier who had seven small children and was visibly sinking in decline nor was the step which had determined his advance  a visit to a dive with a months wages in his pocket  an act of such transcendent virtue or even wisdom as to seem to merit the favour of the gods  from some sense of this and of the dizzy seesaw  heavenhigh helldeep  on which men sit clutching or perhaps fearing that the sources of his fortune might be insidiously traced to some root in the field of petty cash he stuck to his work said not a word of his new circumstances and kept his account with a bank in a different quarter of the town  the concealment innocent as it seems was the first step in the second tragicomedy of johns existence  meanwhile he had never written home  whether from diffidence or shame or a touch of anger or mere procrastination or because as we have seen he had no skill in literary arts or because as i am sometimes tempted to suppose there is a law in human nature that prevents young men  not otherwise beasts  from the performance of this simple act of piety  months and years had gone by and john had never written  the habit of not writing indeed was already fixed before he had begun to come into his fortune and it was only the difficulty of breaking this long silence that withheld him from an instant restitution of the money he had stolen or as he preferred to call it borrowed  in vain he sat before paper attending on inspiration that heavenly nymph beyond suggesting the words my dear father remained obstinately silent and presently john would crumple up the sheet and decide as soon as he had a good chance to carry the money home in person  and this delay which is indefensible was his second step into the snares of fortune  ten years had passed and john was drawing near to thirty he had kept the promise of his boyhood and was now of a lusty frame verging toward corpulence good features good eyes a genial manner a ready laugh a long pair of sandy whiskers a dash of an american accent a close familiarity with the great american joke and a certain likeness to a r yl prsnge who shall remain nameless for me made up the mans externals as he could be viewed in society  inwardly in spite of his gross body and highly masculine whiskers he was more like a maiden lady than a man of twentynine  it chanced one day as he was strolling down market street on the eve of his fortnights holiday that his eye was caught by certain railway bills and in very idleness of mind he calculated that he might be home for christmas if he started on the morrow  the fancy thrilled him with desire and in one moment he decided he would go  there was much to be done his portmanteau to be packed a credit to be got from the bank where he was a wealthy customer and certain offices to be transacted for that other bank in which he was an humble clerk and it chanced in conformity with human nature that out of all this business it was the last that came to be neglected  night found him not only equipped with money of his own but once more as on that former occasion saddled with a considerable sum of other peoples  now it chanced there lived in the same boardinghouse a fellowclerk of his an honest fellow with what is called a weakness for drink  though it might in this case have been called a strength for the victim had been drunk for weeks together without the briefest intermission  to this unfortunate john intrusted a letter with an inclosure of bonds addressed to the bank manager  even as he did so he thought he perceived a certain haziness of eye and speech in his trustee but he was too hopeful to be stayed silenced the voice of warning in his bosom and with one and the same gesture committed the money to the clerk and himself into the hands of destiny  i dwell even at the risk of tedium on johns minutest errors his case being so perplexing to the moralist but we have done with them now the roll is closed the reader has the worst of our poor hero and i leave him to judge for himself whether he or john has been the less deserving henceforth we have to follow the spectacle of a man who was a mere whiptop for calamity on whose unmerited misadventures not even the humourist can look without pity and not even the philosopher without alarm  that same night the clerk entered upon a bout of drunkenness so consistent as to surprise even his intimate acquaintance he was speedily ejected from the boardinghouse deposited his portmanteau with a perfect stranger who did not even catch his name wandered he knew not where and was at last hoveto all standing in a hospital at sacramento  there under the impenetrable alias of the number of his bed the crapulous being lay for some more days unconscious of all things and of one thing in particular that the police were after him  two months had come and gone before the convalescent in the sacramento hospital was identified with kirkman the absconding san francisco clerk even then there must elapse nearly a fortnight more till the perfect stranger could be hunted up the portmanteau recovered and johns letter carried at length to its destination the seal still unbroken the inclosure still intact  meanwhile john had gone upon his holidays without a word which was irregular and there had disappeared with him a certain sum of money which was out of all bounds of palliation  but he was known to be careless and believed to be honest the manager besides had a regard for him and little was said although something was no doubt thought until the fortnight was finally at an end and the time had come for john to reappear  then indeed the affair began to look black and when inquiries were made and the penniless clerk was found to have amassed thousands of dollars and kept them secretly in a rival establishment the stoutest of his friends abandoned him the books were overhauled for traces of ancient and artful fraud and though none were found there still prevailed a general impression of loss the telegraph was set in motion and the correspondent of the bank in edinburgh for which place it was understood that john had armed himself with extensive credits was warned to communicate with the police  now this correspondent was a friend of mr nicholsons he was well acquainted with the tale of johns calamitous disappearance from edinburgh and putting one thing with another hasted with the first word of this scandal not to the police but to his friend  the old gentleman had long regarded his son as one dead johns place had been taken the memory of his faults had already fallen to be one of those old aches which awaken again indeed upon occasion but which we can always vanquish by an effort of the will and to have the long lost resuscitated in a fresh disgrace was doubly bitter  macewen said the old man this must be hushed up if possible  if i give you a cheek for this sum about which they are certain could you take it on yourself to let the matter rest  i will said macewen  i will take the risk of it  you understand resumed mr nicholson speaking precisely but with ashen lips i do this for my family not for that unhappy young man  if it should turn out that these suspicions are correct and he has embezzled large sums he must lie on his bed as he has made it  and then looking up at macewen with a nod and one of his strange smiles good bye said he and macewen perceiving the case to be too grave for consolation took himself off and blessed god on his way home that he was childless    chapter v  the prodigals return    by a little after noon on the eve of christmas john had left his portmanteau in the cloakroom and stepped forth into princes street with a wonderful expansion of the soul such as men enjoy on the completion of longnourished schemes  he was at home again incognito and rich presently he could enter his fathers house by means of the passkey which he had piously preserved through all his wanderings he would throw down the borrowed money there would be a reconciliation the details of which he frequently arranged and he saw himself during the next month made welcome in many stately houses at many frigid dinnerparties taking his share in the conversation with the freedom of the man and the traveller and laying down the law upon finance with the authority of the successful investor  but this programme was not to be begun before evening  not till just before dinner indeed at which meal the reassembled family were to sit roseate and the best wine the modern fatted calf should flow for the prodigals return  meanwhile he walked familiar streets merry reminiscences crowding round him sad ones also both with the same surprising pathos  the keen frosty air the low rosy wintry sun the castle hailing him like an old acquaintance the names of friends on doorplates the sight of friends whom he seemed to recognise and whom he eagerly avoided in the streets the pleasant chant of the northcountry accent the dome of st georges reminding him of his last penitential moments in the lane and of that king of glory whose name had echoed ever since in the saddest corner of his memory and the gutters where he had learned to slide and the shop where he had bought his skates and the stones on which he had trod and the railings in which he had rattled his clachan as he went to school and all those thousand and one nameless particulars which the eye sees without noting which the memory keeps indeed yet without knowing and which taken one with another build up for us the aspect of the place that we call home all these besieged him as he went with both delight and sadness  his first visit was for houston who had a house on regent terrace kept for him in old days by an aunt  the door was opened to his surprise upon the chain and a voice asked him from within what he wanted  i want mr houston  mr alan houston said he  and who are ye said the voice  this is most extraordinary thought john and then aloud he told his name  no young mr john cried the voice with a sudden increase of scotch accent testifying to a friendlier feeling  the very same said john  and the old butler removed his defences remarking only i thocht ye were that man  but his master was not there he was staying it appeared at the house in murrayfield and though the butler would have been glad enough to have taken his place and given all the news of the family john struck with a little chill was eager to be gone  only the door was scarce closed again before he regretted that he had not asked about that man  he was to pay no more visits till he had seen his father and made all well at home alan had been the only possible exception and john had not time to go as far as murrayfield but here he was on regent terrace there was nothing to prevent him going round the end of the hill and looking from without on the mackenzies house  as he went he reflected that flora must now be a woman of near his own age and it was within the bounds of possibility that she was married but this dishonourable doubt he dammed down  there was the house sure enough but the door was of another colour and what was this  two doorplates  he drew nearer the top one bore with dignified simplicity the words mr proudfoot the lower one was more explicit and informed the passerby that here was likewise the abode of mr j a dunlop proudfoot advocate  the proudfoots must be rich for no advocate could look to have much business in so remote a quarter and john hated them for their wealth and for their name and for the sake of the house they desecrated with their presence  he remembered a proudfoot he had seen at school not known a little wheyfaced urchin the despicable member of some lower class  could it be this abortion that had climbed to be an advocate and now lived in the birthplace of flora and the home of johns tenderest memories  the chill that had first seized upon him when he heard of houstons absence deepened and struck inward  for a moment as he stood under the doors of that estranged house and looked east and west along the solitary pavement of the royal terrace where not a cat was stirring the sense of solitude and desolation took him by the throat and he wished himself in san francisco  and then the figure he made with his decent portliness his whiskers the money in his purse the excellent cigar that he now lighted recurred to his mind in consolatory comparison with that of a certain maddened lad who on a certain spring sunday ten years before and in the hour of churchtime silence had stolen from that city by the glasgow road  in the face of these changes it were impious to doubt fortunes kindness  all would be well yet the mackenzies would be found flora younger and lovelier and kinder than before alan would be found and would have so nicely discriminated his behaviour as to have grown on the one hand into a valued friend of mr nicholsons and to have remained upon the other of that exact shade of joviality which john desired in his companions  and so once more john fell to work discounting the delightful future his first appearance in the family pew his first visit to his uncle greig who thought himself so great a financier and on whose purblind edinburgh eyes john was to let in the dazzling daylight of the west and the details in general of that unrivalled transformation scene in which he was to display to all edinburgh a portly and successful gentleman in the shoes of the derided fugitive  the time began to draw near when his father would have returned from the office and it would be the prodigals cue to enter  he strolled westward by albany street facing the sunset embers pleased he knew not why to move in that cold air and indigo twilight starred with streetlamps  but there was one more disenchantment waiting him by the way  at the corner of pitt street he paused to light a fresh cigar the vesta threw as he did so a strong light upon his features and a man of about his own age stopped at sight of it  i think your name must be nicholson said the stranger  it was too late to avoid recognition and besides as john was now actually on the way home it hardly mattered and he gave way to the impulse of his nature  great scott he cried beatson and shook hands with warmth  it scarce seemed he was repaid in kind  so youre home again said beatson  where have you been all this long time  in the states said john  california  ive made my pile though and it suddenly struck me it would be a noble scheme to come home for christmas  i see said beatson  well i hope well see something of you now youre here  oh i guess so said john a little frozen  well tata concluded beatson and he shook hands again and went  this was a cruel first experience  it was idle to blink facts here was john home again and beatson  old beatson  did not care a rush  he recalled old beatson in the past  that merry and affectionate lad  and their joint adventures and mishaps the window they had broken with a catapult in india place the escalade of the castle rock and many another inestimable bond of friendship and his hurt surprise grew deeper  well after all it was only on a mans own family that he could count blood was thicker than water he remembered and the net result of this encounter was to bring him to the doorstep of his fathers house with tenderer and softer feelings  the night had come the fanlight over the door shone bright the two windows of the diningroom where the cloth was being laid and the three windows of the drawingroom where maria would be waiting dinner glowed softlier through yellow blinds  it was like a vision of the past  all this time of his absence life had gone forward with an equal foot and the fires and the gas had been lighted and the meals spread at the accustomed hours  at the accustomed hour too the bell had sounded thrice to call the family to worship  and at the thought a pang of regret for his demerit seized him he remembered the things that were good and that he had neglected and the things that were evil and that he had loved and it was with a prayer upon his lips that he mounted the steps and thrust the key into the keyhole  he stepped into the lighted hall shut the door softly behind him and stood there fixed in wonder  no surprise of strangeness could equal the surprise of that complete familiarity  there was the bust of chalmers near the stair railings there was the clothesbrush in the accustomed place and there on the hatstand hung hats and coats that must surely be the same as he remembered  ten years dropped from his life as a pin may slip between the fingers and the ocean and the mountains and the mines and crowded marts and mingled races of san francisco and his own fortune and his own disgrace became for that one moment the figures of a dream that was over  he took off his hat and moved mechanically toward the stand and there he found a small change that was a great one to him  the pin that had been his from boyhood where he had flung his balmoral when he loitered home from the academy and his first hat when he came briskly back from college or the office  his pin was occupied  they might have at least respected my pin he thought and he was moved as by a slight and began at once to recollect that he was here an interloper in a strange house which he had entered almost by a burglary and where at any moment he might be scandalously challenged  he moved at once his hat still in his hand to the door of his fathers room opened it and entered  mr nicholson sat in the same place and posture as on that last sunday morning only he was older and greyer and sterner and as he now glanced up and caught the eye of his son a strange commotion and a dark flush sprung into his face  father said john steadily and even cheerfully for this was a moment against which he was long ago prepared father here i am and here is the money that i took from you  i have come back to ask your forgiveness and to stay christmas with you and the children  keep your money said the father and go  father cried john for gods sake dont receive me this way  ive come for    understand me interrupted mr nicholson you are no son of mine and in the sight of god i wash my hands of you one last thing i will tell you one warning i will give you all is discovered and you are being hunted for your crimes if you are still at large it is thanks to me but i have done all that i mean to do and from this time forth i would not raise one finger  not one finger  to save you from the gallows  and now with a low voice of absolute authority and a single weighty gesture of the finger and now  go    chapter vi  the house at murrayfield    how john passed the evening in what windy confusion of mind in what squalls of anger and lulls of sick collapse in what pacing of streets and plunging into publichouses it would profit little to relate  his misery if it were not progressive yet tended in no way to diminish for in proportion as grief and indignation abated fear began to take their place  at first his fathers menacing words lay by in some safe drawer of memory biding their hour  at first john was all thwarted affection and blighted hope next bludgeoned vanity raised its head again with twenty mortal gashes and the father was disowned even as he had disowned the son  what was this regular course of life that john should have admired it what were these clockwork virtues from which love was absent  kindness was the test kindness the aim and soul and judged by such a standard the discarded prodigal  now rapidly drowning his sorrows and his reason in successive drams  was a creature of a lovelier morality than his selfrighteous father  yes he was the better man he felt it glowed with the consciousness and entering a publichouse at the corner of howard place whither he had somehow wandered he pledged his own virtues in a glass  perhaps the fourth since his dismissal  of that he knew nothing keeping no account of what he did or where he went and in the general crashing hurry of his nerves unconscious of the approach of intoxication  indeed it is a question whether he were really growing intoxicated or whether at first the spirits did not even sober him  for it was even as he drained this last glass that his fathers ambiguous and menacing words  popping from their hiding place in memory  startled him like a hand laid upon his shoulder  crimes hunted the gallows  they were ugly words in the ears of an innocent man perhaps all the uglier for if some judicial error were in act against him who should set a limit to its grossness or to how far it might be pushed  not john indeed he was no believer in the powers of innocence his cursed experience pointing in quite other ways and his fears once wakened grew with every hour and hunted him about the city streets  it was perhaps nearly nine at night he had eaten nothing since lunch he had drunk a good deal and he was exhausted by emotion when the thought of houston came into his head he turned not merely to the man as a friend but to his house as a place of refuge  the danger that threatened him was still so vague that he knew neither what to fear nor where he might expect it but this much at least seemed undeniable that a private house was safer than a public inn moved by these counsels he turned at once to the caledonian station passed not without alarm into the bright lights of the approach redeemed his portmanteau from the cloakroom and was soon whirling in a cab along the glasgow road  the change of movement and position the sight of the lamps twinkling to the rear and the smell of damp and mould and rotten straw which clung about the vehicle wrought in him strange alternations of lucidity and mortal giddiness  i have been drinking he discovered i must go straight to bed and sleep  and he thanked heaven for the drowsiness that came upon his mind in waves  from one of these spells he was wakened by the stoppage of the cab and getting down found himself in quite a country road the last lamp of the suburb shining some way below and the high walls of a garden rising before him in the dark the lodge as the place was named stood indeed very solitary  to the south it adjoined another house but standing in so large a garden as to be well out of cry on all other sides open fields stretched upward to the woods of corstorphine hill or backward to the dells of ravelston or downward toward the valley of the leith  the effect of seclusion was aided by the great height of the garden walls which were indeed conventual and as john had tested in former days defied the climbing schoolboy  the lamp of the cab threw a gleam upon the door and the not brilliant handle of the bell  shall i ring for ye said the cabman who had descended from his perch and was slapping his chest for the night was bitter  i wish you would said john putting his hand to his brow in one of his accesses of giddiness  the man pulled at the handle and the clanking of the bell replied from further in the garden twice and thrice he did it with sufficient intervals in the great frosty silence of the night the sounds fell sharp and small  does he expect ye asked the driver with that manner of familiar interest that well became his portwine face and when john had told him no well then said the cabman if yell tak my advice of it well just gang back  and thats disinterested mind ye for my stables are in the glesgie road  the servants must hear said john  hout said the driver  he keeps no servants here man theyre a in the town house i drive him often its just a kind of a hermitage this  give me the bell said john and he plucked at it like a man desperate  the clamour had not yet subsided before they heard steps upon the gravel and a voice of singular nervous irritability cried to them through the door who are you and what do you want  alan said john its me  its fatty  john you know im just come home and ive come to stay with you  there was no reply for a moment and then the door was opened  get the portmanteau down said john to the driver  do nothing of the kind said alan and then to john come in here a moment  i want to speak to you  john entered the garden and the door was closed behind him a candle stood on the gravel walk winking a little in the draughts it threw inconstant sparkles on the clumped holly struck the light and darkness to and fro like a veil on alans features and sent his shadow hovering behind him all beyond was inscrutable and johns dizzy brain rocked with the shadow  yet even so it struck him that alan was pale and his voice when he spoke unnatural  what brings you here tonight he began  i dont want god knows to seem unfriendly but i cannot take you in nicholson i cannot do it  alan said john youve just got to  you dont know the mess im in the governors turned me out and i darent show my face in an inn because theyre down on me for murder or something  for what cried alan starting  murder i believe says john  murder repeated alan and passed his hand over his eyes what was that you were saying he asked again  that they were down on me said john  im accused of murder by what i can make out and ive really had a dreadful day of it alan and i cant sleep on the roadside on a night like this  at least not with a portmanteau he pleaded  hush said alan with his head on one side and then did you hear nothing he asked  no said john thrilling he knew not why with communicated terror  no i heard nothing why  and then as there was no answer he reverted to his pleading but i say alan youve just got to take me in  ill go right away to bed if you have anything to do  i seem to have been drinking i was that knocked over  i wouldnt turn you away alan if you were down on your luck  no returned alan  neither will you then  come and lets get your portmanteau  the cabman was paid and drove off down the long lamp lighted hill and the two friends stood on the sidewalk beside the portmanteau till the last rumble of the wheels had died in silence  it seemed to john as though alan attached importance to this departure of the cab and john who was in no state to criticise shared profoundly in the feeling  when the stillness was once more perfect alan shouldered the portmanteau carried it in and shut and locked the garden door and then once more abstraction seemed to fall upon him and he stood with his hand on the key until the cold began to nibble at johns fingers  why are we standing here asked john  eh said alan blankly  why man you dont seem yourself said the other  no im not myself said alan and he sat down on the portmanteau and put his face in his hands  john stood beside him swaying a little and looking about him at the swaying shadows the flitting sparkles and the steady stars overhead until the windless cold began to touch him through his clothes on the bare skin  even in his bemused intelligence wonder began to awake  i say lets come on to the house he said at last  yes lets come on to the house repeated alan  and he rose at once reshouldered the portmanteau and taking the candle in his other hand moved forward to the lodge this was a long low building smothered in creepers and now except for some chinks of light between the diningroom shutters it was plunged in darkness and silence  in the hall alan lighted another candle gave it to john and opened the door of a bedroom  here said he go to bed  dont mind me john  youll be sorry for me when you know  wait a bit returned john ive got so cold with all that standing about  lets go into the diningroom a minute just one glass to warm me alan  on the table in the hall stood a glass and a bottle with a whisky label on a tray  it was plain the bottle had been just opened for the cork and corkscrew lay beside it  take that said alan passing john the whisky and then with a certain roughness pushed his friend into the bedroom and closed the door behind him  john stood amazed then he shook the bottle and to his further wonder found it partly empty  three or four glasses were gone  alan must have uncorked a bottle of whisky and drank three or four glasses one after the other without sitting down for there was no chair and that in his own cold lobby on this freezing night  it fully explained his eccentricities john reflected sagely as he mixed himself a grog  poor alan  he was drunk and what a dreadful thing was drink and what a slave to it poor alan was to drink in this unsociable uncomfortable fashion  the man who would drink alone except for healths sake  as john was now doing  was a man utterly lost  he took the grog out and felt hazier but warmer  it was hard work opening the portmanteau and finding his night things and before he was undressed the cold had struck home to him once more  well said he just a drop more  theres no sense in getting ill with all this other trouble  and presently dreamless slumber buried him  when john awoke it was day  the low winter sun was already in the heavens but his watch had stopped and it was impossible to tell the hour exactly  ten he guessed it and made haste to dress dismal reflections crowding on his mind but it was less from terror than from regret that he now suffered and with his regret there were mingled cutting pangs of penitence  there had fallen upon him a blow cruel indeed but yet only the punishment of old misdoing and he had rebelled and plunged into fresh sin  the rod had been used to chasten and he had bit the chastening fingers  his father was right john had justified him john was no guest for decent peoples houses and no fit associate for decent peoples children  and had a broader hint been needed there was the case of his old friend  john was no drunkard though he could at times exceed and the picture of houston drinking neat spirits at his halltable struck him with something like disgust  he hung back from meeting his old friend  he could have wished he had not come to him and yet even now where else was he to turn  these musings occupied him while he dressed and accompanied him into the lobby of the house  the door stood open on the garden doubtless alan had stepped forth and john did as he supposed his friend had done  the ground was hard as iron the frost still rigorous as he brushed among the hollies icicles jingled and glittered in their fall and wherever he went a volley of eager sparrows followed him  here were christmas weather and christmas morning duly met to the delight of children  this was the day of reunited families the day to which he had so long looked forward thinking to awake in his own bed in randolph crescent reconciled with all men and repeating the footprints of his youth and here he was alone pacing the alleys of a wintry garden and filled with penitential thoughts  and that reminded him why was he alone and where was alan the thought of the festal morning and the due salutations reawakened his desire for his friend and he began to call for him by name  as the sound of his voice died away he was aware of the greatness of the silence that environed him but for the twittering of the sparrows and the crunching of his own feet upon the frozen snow the whole windless world of air hung over him entranced and the stillness weighed upon his mind with a horror of solitude  still calling at intervals but now with a moderated voice he made the hasty circuit of the garden and finding neither man nor trace of man in all its evergreen coverts turned at last to the house  about the house the silence seemed to deepen strangely  the door indeed stood open as before but the windows were still shuttered the chimneys breathed no stain into the bright air there sounded abroad none of that low stir perhaps audible rather to the ear of the spirit than to the ear of the flesh by which a house announces and betrays its human lodgers  and yet alan must be there  alan locked in drunken slumbers forgetful of the return of day of the holy season and of the friend whom he had so coldly received and was now so churlishly neglecting johns disgust redoubled at the thought but hunger was beginning to grow stronger than repulsion and as a step to breakfast if nothing else he must find and arouse this sleeper  he made the circuit of the bedroom quarters  all until he came to alans chamber were locked from without and bore the marks of a prolonged disuse  but alans was a room in commission filled with clothes knickknacks letters books and the conveniences of a solitary man  the fire had been lighted but it had long ago burned out and the ashes were stone cold  the bed had been made but it had not been slept in  worse and worse then alan must have fallen where he sat and now sprawled brutishly no doubt upon the diningroom floor  the diningroom was a very long apartment and was reached through a passage so that john upon his entrance brought but little light with him and must move toward the windows with spread arms groping and knocking on the furniture suddenly he tripped and fell his length over a prostrate body  it was what he had looked for yet it shocked him and he marvelled that so rough an impact should not have kicked a groan out of the drunkard  men had killed themselves ere now in such excesses a dreary and degraded end that made john shudder  what if alan were dead  there would be a christmasday  by this john had his hand upon the shutters and flinging them back beheld once again the blessed face of the day even by that light the room had a discomfortable air  the chairs were scattered and one had been overthrown the tablecloth laid as if for dinner was twitched upon one side and some of the dishes had fallen to the floor  behind the table lay the drunkard still unaroused only one foot visible to john  but now that light was in the room the worst seemed over it was a disgusting business but not more than disgusting and it was with no great apprehension that john proceeded to make the circuit of the table his last comparatively tranquil moment for that day  no sooner had he turned the corner no sooner had his eyes alighted on the body than he gave a smothered breathless cry and fled out of the room and out of the house  it was not alan who lay there but a man well up in years of stern countenance and irongrey locks and it was no drunkard for the body lay in a black pool of blood and the open eyes stared upon the ceiling  to and fro walked john before the door  the extreme sharpness of the air acted on his nerves like an astringent and braced them swiftly  presently he not relaxing in his disordered walk the images began to come clearer and stay longer in his fancy and next the power of thought came back to him and the horror and danger of his situation rooted him to the ground  he grasped his forehead and staring on one spot of gravel pieced together what he knew and what he suspected  alan had murdered some one possibly that man against whom the butler chained the door in regent terrace possibly another some one at least a human soul whom it was death to slay and whose blood lay spilled upon the floor  this was the reason of the whisky drinking in the passage of his unwillingness to welcome john of his strange behaviour and bewildered words this was why he had started at and harped upon the name of murder this was why he had stood and hearkened or sat and covered his eyes in the black night and now he was gone now he had basely fled and to all his perplexities and dangers john stood heir  let me think  let me think he said aloud impatiently even pleadingly as if to some merciless interrupter  in the turmoil of his wits a thousand hints and hopes and threats and terrors dinning continuously in his ears he was like one plunged in the hubbub of a crowd  how was he to remember  he who had not a thought to spare  that he was himself the author as well as the theatre of so much confusion  but in hours of trial the junto of mans nature is dissolved and anarchy succeeds  it was plain he must stay no longer where he was for here was a new judicial error in the very making  it was not so plain where he must go for the old judicial error vague as a cloud appeared to fill the habitable world whatever it might be it watched for him fullgrown in edinburgh it must have had its birth in san francisco it stood guard no doubt like a dragon at the bank where he should cash his credit and though there were doubtless many other places who should say in which of them it was not ambushed  no he could not tell where he was to go he must not lose time on these insolubilities  let him go back to the beginning  it was plain he must stay no longer where he was  it was plain too that he must not flee as he was for he could not carry his portmanteau and to flee and leave it was to plunge deeper in the mire  he must go leave the house unguarded find a cab and return  return after an absence  had he courage for that  and just then he spied a stain about a handsbreadth on his trouserleg and reached his finger down to touch it  the finger was stained red it was blood he stared upon it with disgust and awe and terror and in the sharpness of the new sensation fell instantly to act  he cleansed his finger in the snow returned into the house drew near with hushed footsteps to the diningroom door and shut and locked it  then he breathed a little freer for here at least was an oaken barrier between himself and what he feared  next he hastened to his room tore off the spotted trousers which seemed in his eyes a link to bind him to the gallows flung them in a corner donned another pair breathlessly crammed his night things into his portmanteau locked it swung it with an effort from the ground and with a rush of relief came forth again under the open heavens  the portmanteau being of occidental build was no feather weight it had distressed the powerful alan and as for john he was crushed under its bulk and the sweat broke upon him thickly  twice he must set it down to rest before he reached the gate and when he had come so far he must do as alan did and take his seat upon one corner  here then he sat a while and panted but now his thoughts were sensibly lightened now with the trunk standing just inside the door some part of his dissociation from the house of crime had been effected and the cabman need not pass the garden wall it was wonderful how that relieved him for the house in his eyes was a place to strike the most cursory beholder with suspicion as though the very windows had cried murder  but there was to be no remission of the strokes of fate  as he thus sat taking breath in the shadow of the wall and hopped about by sparrows it chanced that his eye roved to the fastening of the door and what he saw plucked him to his feet  the thing locked with a spring once the door was closed the bolt shut of itself and without a key there was no means of entering from without  he saw himself obliged to one of two distasteful and perilous alternatives either to shut the door altogether and set his portmanteau out upon the wayside a wonder to all beholders or to leave the door ajar so that any thievish tramp or holiday schoolboy might stray in and stumble on the grisly secret  to the last as the least desperate his mind inclined but he must first insure himself that he was unobserved  he peered out and down the long road it lay dead empty  he went to the corner of the byroad that comes by way of dean there also not a passenger was stirring plainly it was now or never the high tide of his affairs and he drew the door as close as he durst slipped a pebble in the chink and made off downhill to find a cab  halfway down a gate opened and a troop of christmas children sallied forth in the most cheerful humour followed more soberly by a smiling mother  and this is christmasday thought john and could have laughed aloud in tragic bitterness of heart    chapter vii  a tragicomedy in a cab    in front of donaldsons hospital john counted it good fortune to perceive a cab a great way of and by much shouting and waving of his arm to catch the notice of the driver  he counted it good fortune for the time was long to him till he should have done for ever with the lodge and the further he must go to find a cab the greater the chance that the inevitable discovery had taken place and that he should return to find the garden full of angry neighbours  yet when the vehicle drew up he was sensibly chagrined to recognise the portwine cabman of the night before  here he could not but reflect here is another link in the judicial error  the driver on the other hand was pleased to drop again upon so liberal a fare and as he was a man  the reader must already have perceived  of easy not to say familiar manners he dropped at once into a vein of friendly talk commenting on the weather on the sacred season which struck him chiefly in the light of a day of liberal gratuities on the chance which had reunited him to a pleasing customer and on the fact that john had been as he was pleased to call it visibly on the randan the night before  and ye look dreidful bad theday sir i must say that he continued  theres nothing like a dram for ye  if yell take my advice of it and bein as its christmas im no saying he added with a fatherly smile but what i would join ye mysel  john had listened with a sick heart  ill give you a dram when weve got through said he affecting a sprightliness which sat on him most unhandsomely and not a drop till then  business first and pleasure afterward  with this promise the jarvey was prevailed upon to clamber to his place and drive with hideous deliberation to the door of the lodge  there were no signs as yet of any public emotion only two men stood not far off in talk and their presence seen from afar set johns pulses buzzing  he might have spared himself his fright for the pair were lost in some dispute of a theological complexion and with lengthened upper lip and enumerating fingers pursued the matter of their difference and paid no heed to john  but the cabman proved a thorn in the flesh  nothing would keep him on his perch he must clamber down comment upon the pebble in the door which he regarded as an ingenious but unsafe device help john with the portmanteau and enliven matters with a flow of speech and especially of questions which i thus condense  hell no be here himsel will he  no  well hes an eccentric man  a fair oddity  if ye ken the expression great trouble with his tenants they tell me  ive driven the famly for years  i drove a cab at his fathers waddin whatll your name be  i should ken your face  baigrey ye say  there were baigreys about gilmerton yell be one of that lot  then thisll be a friends portmantie like  why because the name upon its nucholson  oh if yere in a hurry thats another job  waverley brig  are ye for away  so the friendly toper prated and questioned and kept johns heart in a flutter  but to this also as to other evils under the sun there came a period and the victim of circumstances began at last to rumble toward the railway terminus at waverley bridge  during the transit he sat with raised glasses in the frosty chill and mouldy fetor of his chariot and glanced out sidelong on the holiday face of things the shuttered shops and the crowds along the pavement much as the rider in the tyburn cart may have observed the concourse gathering to his execution  at the station his spirits rose again another stage of his escape was fortunately ended  he began to spy blue water he called a railway porter and bade him carry the portmanteau to the cloakroom not that he had any notion of delay flight instant flight was his design no matter whither but he had determined to dismiss the cabman ere he named or even chose his destination thus possibly balking the judicial error of another link  this was his cunning aim and now with one foot on the roadway and one still on the coachstep he made haste to put the thing in practice and plunged his hand into his trousers pocket  there was nothing there  oh yes this time he was to blame  he should have remembered and when he deserted his bloodstained pantaloons he should not have deserted along with them his purse  make the most of his error and then compare it with the punishment  conceive his new position for i lack words to picture it conceive him condemned to return to that house from the very thought of which his soul revolted and once more to expose himself to capture on the very scene of the misdeed conceive him linked to the mouldy cab and the familiar cabman  john cursed the cabman silently and then it occurred to him that he must stop the incarceration of his portmanteau that at least he must keep close at hand and he turned to recall the porter  but his reflections brief as they had appeared must have occupied him longer than he supposed and there was the man already returning with the receipt  well that was settled he had lost his portmanteau also for the sixpence with which he had paid the murrayfield toll was one that had strayed alone into his waistcoat pocket and unless he once more successfully achieved the adventure of the house of crime his portmanteau lay in the cloakroom in eternal pawn for lack of a penny fee  and then he remembered the porter who stood suggestively attentive words of gratitude hanging on his lips  john hunted right and left he found a coin  prayed god that it was a sovereign   drew it out beheld a halfpenny and offered it to the porter  the mans jaw dropped  its only a halfpenny he said startled out of railway decency  i know that said john piteously  and here the porter recovered the dignity of man  thank you sir said he and would have returned the base gratuity  but john too would none of it and as they struggled who must join in but the cabman  hoots mr baigrey said he you surely forget what day it is  i tell you i have no change cried john  well said the driver and what then  i would rather give a man a shillin on a day like this than put him off with a derision like a bawbee  im surprised at the like of you mr baigrey  my name is not baigrey broke out john in mere childish temper and distress  ye told me it was yoursel said the cabman  i know i did and what the devil right had you to ask cried the unhappy one  oh very well said the driver  i know my place if you know yours  if you know yours he repeated as one who should imply grave doubt and muttered inarticulate thunders in which the grand old name of gentleman was taken seemingly in vain  oh to have been able to discharge this monster whom john now perceived with tardy clearsightedness to have begun betimes the festivities of christmas  but far from any such ray of consolation visiting the lost he stood bare of help and helpers his portmanteau sequestered in one place his money deserted in another and guarded by a corpse himself so sedulous of privacy the cynosure of all mens eyes about the station and as if these were not enough mischances he was now fallen in illblood with the beast to whom his poverty had linked him  in illblood as he reflected dismally with the witness who perhaps might hang or save him  there was no time to be lost he durst not linger any longer in that public spot and whether he had recourse to dignity or conciliation the remedy must be applied at once some happily surviving element of manhood moved him to the former  let us have no more of this said he his foot once more upon the step  go back to where we came from  he had avoided the name of any destination for there was now quite a little band of railway folk about the cab and he still kept an eye upon the court of justice and laboured to avoid concentric evidence  but here again the fatal jarvey outmanoeuvred him  back to the ludge cried he in shrill tones of protest  drive on at once roared john and slammed the door behind him so that the crazy chariot rocked and jingled  forth trundled the cab into the christmas streets the fare within plunged in the blackness of a despair that neighboured on unconsciousness the driver on the box digesting his rebuke and his customers duplicity  i would not be thought to put the pair in competition johns case was out of all parallel  but the cabman too is worth the sympathy of the judicious for he was a fellow of genuine kindliness and a high sense of personal dignity incensed by drink and his advances had been cruelly and publicly rebuffed  as he drove therefore he counted his wrongs and thirsted for sympathy and drink  now it chanced he had a friend a publican in queensferry street from whom in view of the sacredness of the occasion he thought he might extract a dram  queensferry street lies something off the direct road to murrayfield  but then there is the hilly crossroad that passes by the valley of the leith and the dean cemetery and queensferry street is on the way to that  what was to hinder the cabman since his horse was dumb from choosing the crossroad and calling on his friend in passing  so it was decided and the charioteer already somewhat mollified turned aside his horse to the right  john meanwhile sat collapsed his chin sunk upon his chest his mind in abeyance  the smell of the cab was still faintly present to his senses and a certain leaden chill about his feet all else had disappeared in one vast oppression of calamity and physical faintness  it was drawing on to noon  twoandtwenty hours since he had broken bread in the interval he had suffered tortures of sorrow and alarm and been partly tipsy and though it was impossible to say he slept yet when the cab stopped and the cabman thrust his head into the window his attention had to be recalled from depths of vacancy  if youll no stand me a dram said the driver with a wellmerited severity of tone and manner i dare say yell have no objection to my taking one mysel  yes  no  do what you like returned john and then as he watched his tormentor mount the stairs and enter the whisky shop there floated into his mind a sense as of something long ago familiar  at that he started fully awake and stared at the shopfronts  yes he knew them but when and how  long since he thought and then casting his eye through the front glass which had been recently occluded by the figure of the jarvey he beheld the treetops of the rookery in randolph crescent  he was close to home  home where he had thought at that hour to be sitting in the wellremembered drawingroom in friendly converse and instead    it was his first impulse to drop into the bottom of the cab his next to cover his face with his hands  so he sat while the cabman toasted the publican and the publican toasted the cabman and both reviewed the affairs of the nation so he still sat when his master condescended to return and drive off at last downhill along the curve of lynedoch place but even so sitting as he passed the end of his fathers street he took one glance from between shielding fingers and beheld a doctors carriage at the door  well just so thought he ill have killed my father and this is christmasday  if mr nicholson died it was down this same road he must journey to the grave and down this road on the same errand his wife had preceded him years before and many other leading citizens with the proper trappings and attendance of the end  and now in that frosty illsmelling straw carpeted and raggedcushioned cab with his breath congealing on the glasses where else was john himself advancing to  the thought stirred his imagination which began to manufacture many thousand pictures bright and fleeting like the shapes in a kaleidoscope and now he saw himself ruddy and comfortered sliding in the gutter and again a little woebegone bored urchin tricked forth in crape and weepers descending this same hill at the foots pace of mourning coaches his mothers body just preceding him and yet again his fancy running far in front showed him his destination  now standing solitary in the low sunshine with the sparrows hopping on the threshold and the dead man within staring at the roof  and now with a sudden change thronged about with whitefaced handuplifting neighbours and doctor bursting through their midst and fixing his stethoscope as he went the policeman shaking a sagacious head beside the body  it was to this he feared that he was driving in the midst of this he saw himself arrive heard himself stammer faint explanations and felt the hand of the constable upon his shoulder  heavens how he wished he had played the manlier part how he despised himself that he had fled that fatal neighbourhood when all was quiet and should now be tamely travelling back when it was thronging with avengers  any strong degree of passion lends even to the dullest the forces of the imagination  and so now as he dwelt on what was probably awaiting him at the end of this distressful drive  john who saw things little remembered them less and could not have described them at all beheld in his mindseye the garden of the lodge detailed as in a map he went to and fro in it feeding his terrors he saw the hollies the snowy borders the paths where he had sought alan the high conventual walls the shut door  what was the door shut  ay truly he had shut it  shut in his money his escape his future life  shut it with these hands and none could now open it  he heard the snap of the springlock like something bursting in his brain and sat astonied  and then he woke again terror jarring through his vitals this was no time to be idle he must be up and doing he must think  once at the end of this ridiculous cruise once at the lodge door there would be nothing for it but to turn the cab and trundle back again  why then go so far why add another feature of suspicion to a case already so suggestive why not turn at once  it was easy to say turn but whither he had nowhere now to go to he could never  he saw it in letters of blood  he could never pay that cab he was saddled with that cab for ever  oh that cab his soul yearned and burned and his bowels sounded to be rid of it he forgot all other cares  he must first quit himself of this illsmelling vehicle and of the human beast that guided it  first do that do that at least do that at once  and just then the cab suddenly stopped and there was his persecutor rapping on the front glass  john let it down and beheld the portwine countenance inflamed with intellectual triumph  i ken wha ye are cried the husky voice  i mind ye now yere a nucholson  i drove ye to hermiston to a christmas party and ye came back on the box and i let ye drive  it is a fact  john knew the man they had been even friends his enemy he now remembered was a fellow of great good nature  endless good nature  with a boy why not with a man  why not appeal to his better side  he grasped at the new hope  great scott and so you did he cried as if in a transport of delight his voice sounding false in his own ears  well if thats so ive something to say to you  ill just get out i guess  where are we any way  the driver had fluttered his ticket in the eyes of the branchtoll keeper and they were now brought to on the highest and most solitary part of the byroad  on the left a row of fieldside trees beshaded it on the right it was bordered by naked fallows undulating downhill to the queensferry road in front corstorphine hill raised its snowbedabbled darkling woods against the sky  john looked all about him drinking the clear air like wine then his eyes returned to the cabmans face as he sat not ungleefully awaiting johns communication with the air of one looking to be tipped  the features of that face were hard to read drink had so swollen them drink had so painted them in tints that varied from brickred to mulberry  the small grey eyes blinked the lips moved with greed greed was the ruling passion and though there was some good nature some genuine kindliness a true human touch in the old toper his greed was now so set afire by hope that all other traits of character lay dormant  he sat there a monument of gluttonous desire  johns heart slowly fell  he had opened his lips but he stood there and uttered nought  he sounded the well of his courage and it was dry  he groped in his treasury of words and it was vacant  a devil of dumbness had him by the throat the devil of terror babbled in his ears and suddenly without a word uttered with no conscious purpose formed in his will john whipped about tumbled over the roadside wall and began running for his life across the fallows  he had not gone far he was not past the midst of the first afield when his whole brain thundered within him fool you have your watch  the shock stopped him and he faced once more toward the cab  the driver was leaning over the wall brandishing his whip his face empurpled roaring like a bull  and john saw or thought that he had lost the chance  no watch would pacify the mans resentment now he would cry for vengeance also  john would be had under the eye of the police his tale would be unfolded his secret plumbed his destiny would close on him at last and for ever  he uttered a deep sigh and just as the cabman taking heart of grace was beginning at last to scale the wall his defaulting customer fell again to running and disappeared into the further fields     chapter viii  singular instance of the utility of passkeys    where he ran at first john never very clearly knew nor yet how long a time elapsed ere he found himself in the byroad near the lodge of ravelston propped against the wall his lungs heaving like bellows his legs leadenheavy his mind possessed by one sole desire  to lie down and be unseen  he remembered the thick coverts round the quarryhole pond an untrodden corner of the world where he might surely find concealment till the night should fall  thither he passed down the lane and when he came there behold he had forgotten the frost and the pond was alive with young people skating and the pondside coverts were thick with lookers on  he looked on a while himself  there was one tall graceful maiden skating hand in hand with a youth on whom she bestowed her bright eyes perhaps too patently and it was strange with what anger john beheld her  he could have broken forth in curses he could have stood there like a mortified tramp and shaken his fist and vented his gall upon her by the hour  or so he thought and the next moment his heart bled for the girl  poor creature its little she knows he sighed  let her enjoy herself while she can but was it possible when flora used to smile at him on the braid ponds she could have looked so fulsome to a sick hearted bystander  the thought of one quarry in his frozen wits suggested another and he plodded off toward craigleith  a wind had sprung up out of the northwest it was cruel keen it dried him like a fire and racked his fingerjoints  it brought clouds too pale swift hurrying clouds that blotted heaven and shed gloom upon the earth  he scrambled up among the hazelled rubbish heaps that surround the caldron of the quarry and lay flat upon the stones  the wind searched close along the earth the stones were cutting and icy the bare hazels wailed about him and soon the air of the afternoon began to be vocal with those strange and dismal harpings that herald snow  pain and misery turned in johns limbs to a harrowing impatience and blind desire of change now he would roll in his harsh lair and when the flints abraded him was almost pleased now he would crawl to the edge of the huge pit and look dizzily down  he saw the spiral of the descending roadway the steep crags the clinging bushes the peppering of snowwreaths and far down in the bottom the diminished crane  here no doubt was a way to end it  but it somehow did not take his fancy  and suddenly he was aware that he was hungry ay even through the tortures of the cold even through the frosts of despair a gross desperate longing after food no matter what no matter how began to wake and spur him  suppose he pawned his watch  but no on christmasday  this was christmasday  the pawnshop would be closed  suppose he went to the publichouse close by at blackhall and offered the watch which was worth ten pounds in payment for a meal of bread and cheese  the incongruity was too remarkable the good folks would either put him to the door or only let him in to send for the police  he turned his pockets out one after another some san francisco tramcar checks one cigar no lights the passkey to his fathers house a pocket handkerchief with just a touch of scent no money could be raised on none of these  there was nothing for it but to starve and after all what mattered it  that also was a door of exit  he crept close among the bushes the wind playing round him like a lash his clothes seemed thin as paper his joints burned his skin curdled on his bones  he had a vision of a highlying cattledrive in california and the bed of a dried stream with one muddy pool by which the vaqueros had encamped splendid sun over all the big bonfire blazing the strips of cow browning and smoking on a skewer of wood how warm it was how savoury the steam of scorching meat  and then again he remembered his manifold calamities and burrowed and wallowed in the sense of his disgrace and shame and next he was entering franks restaurant in montgomery street san francisco he had ordered a panstew and venison chops of which he was immoderately fond and as he sat waiting munroe the good attendant brought him a whisky punch he saw the strawberries float on the delectable cup he heard the ice chink about the straws  and then he woke again to his detested fate and found himself sitting humped together in a windy combe of quarry refuse  darkness thick about him thin flakes of snow flying here and there like rags of paper and the strong shuddering of his body clashing his teeth like a hiccough  we have seen john in nothing but the stormiest condition we have seen him reckless desperate tried beyond his moderate powers of his daily self cheerful regular not unthrifty we have seen nothing and it may thus be a surprise to the reader to learn that he was studiously careful of his health this favourite preoccupation now awoke  if he were to sit there and die of cold there would be mighty little gained better the police cell and the chances of a jury trial than the miserable certainty of death at a dykeside before the next winters dawn or death a little later in the gas lighted wards of an infirmary  he rose on aching legs and stumbled here and there among the rubbish heaps still circumvented by the yawning crater of the quarry or perhaps he only thought so for the darkness was already dense the snow was growing thicker and he moved like a blind man and with a blind mans terrors  at last he climbed a fence thinking to drop into the road and found himself staggering instead among the iron furrows of a ploughland endless it seemed as a whole county  and next he was in a wood beating among young trees and then he was aware of a house with many lighted windows christmas carriages waiting at the doors and christmas drivers for christmas has a double edge becoming swiftly hooded with snow  from this glimpse of human cheerfulness he fled like cain wandered in the night unpiloted careless of whither he went fell and lay and then rose again and wandered further and at last like a transformation scene behold him in the lighted jaws of the city staring at a lamp which had already donned the tilted nightcap of the snow  it came thickly now a feeding storm and while he yet stood blinking at the lamp his feet were buried  he remembered something like it in the past a streetlamp crowned and caked upon the windward side with snow the wind uttering its mournful hoot himself looking on even as now but the cold had struck too sharply on his wits and memory failed him as to the date and sequel of the reminiscence  his next conscious moment was on the dean bridge but whether he was john nicholson of a bank in a california street or some former john a clerk in his fathers office he had now clean forgotten  another blank and he was thrusting his passkey into the doorlock of his fathers house  hours must have passed  whether crouched on the cold stones or wandering in the fields among the snow was more than he could tell but hours had passed  the finger of the hall clock was close on twelve a narrow peep of gas in the hall lamp shed shadows and the door of the back room  his fathers room  was open and emitted a warm light  at so late an hour all this was strange the lights should have been out the doors locked the good folk safe in bed  he marvelled at the irregularity leaning on the halltable and marvelled to himself there and thawed and grew once more hungry in the warmer air of the house  the clock uttered its premonitory catch in five minutes christmasday would be among the days of the past  christmas  what a christmas  well there was no use waiting he had come into that house he scarce knew how if they were to thrust him forth again it had best be done at once and he moved to the door of the back room and entered  oh well then he was insane as he had long believed  there in his fathers room at midnight the fire was roaring and the gas blazing the papers the sacred papers  to lay a hand on which was criminal  had all been taken off and piled along the floor a cloth was spread and a supper laid upon the business table and in his fathers chair a woman habited like a nun sat eating  as he appeared in the doorway the nun rose gave a low cry and stood staring she was a large woman strong calm a little masculine her features marked with courage and good sense and as john blinked back at her a faint resemblance dodged about his memory as when a tune haunts us and yet will not be recalled  why its john cried the nun  i dare say im mad said john unconsciously following king lear but upon my word i do believe youre flora  of course i am replied she  and yet it is not flora at all thought john flora was slender and timid and of changing colour and dewyeyed and had flora such an edinburgh accent  but he said none of these things which was perhaps as well  what he said was then why are you a nun  such nonsense said flora  im a sicknurse and i am here nursing your sister with whom between you and me there is precious little the matter  but that is not the question  the point is how do you come here and are you not ashamed to show yourself  flora said john sepulchrally i havent eaten anything for three days  or at least i dont know what day it is but i guess im starving  you unhappy man she cried  here sit down and eat my supper and ill just run upstairs and see my patient not but what i doubt shes fast asleep for maria is a malade imaginaire  with this specimen of the french not of stratfordattebowe but of a finishing establishment in moray place she left john alone in his fathers sanctum  he fell at once upon the food and it is to be supposed that flora had found her patient wakeful and been detained with some details of nursing for he had time to make a full end of all there was to eat and not only to empty the teapot but to fill it again from a kettle that was fitfully singing on his fathers fire  then he sat torpid and pleased and bewildered his misfortunes were then half forgotten his mind considering not without regret this unsentimental return to his old love  he was thus engaged when that bustling woman noiselessly re entered  have you eaten said she  then tell me all about it  it was a long and as the reader knows a pitiful story but flora heard it with compressed lips  she was lost in none of those questionings of human destiny that have from time to time arrested the flight of my own pen for women such as she are no philosophers and behold the concrete only  and women such as she are very hard on the imperfect man  very well said she when he had done then down upon your knees at once and beg gods forgiveness  and the great baby plumped upon his knees and did as he was bid and none the worse for that  but while he was heartily enough requesting forgiveness on general principles the rational side of him distinguished and wondered if perhaps the apology were not due upon the other part  and when he rose again from that becoming exercise he first eyed the face of his old love doubtfully and then taking heart uttered his protest  i must say flora said he in all this business i can see very little fault of mine  if you had written home replied the lady there would have been none of it  if you had even gone to murrayfield reasonably sober you would never have slept there and the worst would not have happened  besides the whole thing began years ago  you got into trouble and when your father honest man was disappointed you took the pet or got afraid and ran away from punishment  well youve had your own way of it john and i dont suppose you like it  i sometimes fancy im not much better than a fool sighed john  my dear john said she not much  he looked at her and his eye fell  a certain anger rose within him here was a flora he disowned she was hard she was of a set colour a settled mature undecorative manner plain of speech plain of habit  he had come near saying plain of face  and this changeling called herself by the same name as the manycoloured clinging maid of yore she of the frequent laughter and the many sighs and the kind stolen glances  and to make all worse she took the upper hand with him which as john well knew was not the true relation of the sexes  he steeled his heart against this sicknurse  and how do you come to be here he asked  she told him how she had nursed her father in his long illness and when he died and she was left alone had taken to nurse others partly from habit partly to be of some service in the world partly it might be for amusement theres no accounting for taste said she  and she told him how she went largely to the houses of old friends as the need arose and how she was thus doubly welcome as an old friend first and then as an experienced nurse to whom doctors would confide the gravest cases  and indeed its a mere farce my being here for poor maria she continued but your father takes her ailments to heart and i cannot always be refusing him  we are great friends your father and i he was very kind to me long ago  ten years ago  a strange stir came in johns heart  all this while had he been thinking only of himself  all this while why had he not written to flora  in penitential tenderness he took her hand and to his awe and trouble it remained in his compliant  a voice told him this was flora after all  told him so quietly yet with a thrill of singing  and you never married said he  no john i never married she replied  the hall clock striking two recalled them to the sense of time  and now said she you have been fed and warmed and i have heard your story and now its high time to call your brother  oh cried john chapfallen do you think that absolutely necessary  i cant keep you here i am a stranger said she  do you want to run away again  i thought you had enough of that  he bowed his head under the reproof  she despised him he reflected as he sat once more alone a monstrous thing for a woman to despise a man and strangest of all she seemed to like him  would his brother despise him too  and would his brother like him  and presently the brother appeared under floras escort and standing afar off beside the doorway eyed the hero of this tale  so this is you he said at length  yes alick its me  its john replied the elder brother feebly  and how did you get in here inquired the younger  oh i had my passkey says john  the deuce you had said alexander  ah you lived in a better world  there are no passkeys going now  well father was always averse to them sighed john  and the conversation then broke down and the brothers looked askance at one another in silence  well and what the devil are we to do said alexander  i suppose if the authorities got wind of you you would be taken up  it depends on whether theyve found the body or not returned john  and then theres that cabman to be sure  oh bother the body said alexander  i mean about the other thing  thats serious  is that what my father spoke about asked john  i dont even know what it is  about your robbing your bank in california of course replied alexander  it was plain from floras face that this was the first she had heard of it it was plainer still from johns that he was innocent  i he exclaimed  i rob my bank  my god  flora this is too much even you must allow that  meaning you didnt asked alexander  i never robbed a soul in all my days cried john except my father if you call that robbery and i brought him back the money in this room and he wouldnt even take it  look here john said his brother let us have no misunderstanding upon this  macewen saw my father he told him a bank you had worked for in san francisco was wiring over the habitable globe to have you collared  that it was supposed you had nailed thousands and it was dead certain you had nailed three hundred  so macewen said and i wish you would be careful how you answer  i may tell you also that your father paid the three hundred on the spot  three hundred repeated john  three hundred pounds you mean  thats fifteen hundred dollars  why then its kirkman he broke out  thank heaven  i can explain all that  i gave them to kirkman to pay for me the night before i left  fifteen hundred dollars and a letter to the manager  what do they suppose i would steal fifteen hundred dollars for  im rich i struck it rich in stocks  its the silliest stuff i ever heard of  all thats needful is to cable to the manager kirkman has the fifteen hundred  find kirkman  he was a fellowclerk of mine and a hard case but to do him justice i didnt think he was as hard as this  and what do you say to that alick asked flora  i say the cablegram shall go tonight cried alexander with energy  answer prepaid too  if this can be cleared away  and upon my word i do believe it can  we shall all be able to hold up our heads again  here you john you stick down the address of your bank manager  you flora you can pack john into my bed for which i have no further use to night  as for me i am off to the postoffice and thence to the high street about the dead body  the police ought to know you see and they ought to know through john and i can tell them some rigmarole about my brother being a man of highly nervous organisation and the rest of it  and then ill tell you what john  did you notice the name upon the cab  john gave the name of the driver which as i have not been able to command the vehicle i here suppress  well resumed alexander ill call round at their place before i come back and pay your shot for you  in that way before breakfasttime youll be as good as new  john murmured inarticulate thanks  to see his brother thus energetic in his service moved him beyond expression if he could not utter what he felt he showed it legibly in his face and alexander read it there and liked it the better in that dumb delivery  but theres one thing said the latter cablegrams are dear and i dare say you remember enough of the governor to guess the state of my finances  the trouble is said john that all my stamps are in that beastly house  all your what asked alexander  stamps  money explained john  its an american expression im afraid i contracted one or two  i have some said flora  i have a pound note upstairs  my dear flora returned alexander a pound note wont see us very far and besides this is my fathers business and i shall be very much surprised if it isnt my father who pays for it  i would not apply to him yet i do not think that can be wise objected flora  you have a very imperfect idea of my resources and not at all of my effrontery replied alexander  please observe  he put john from his way chose a stout knife among the supper things and with surprising quickness broke into his fathers drawer  theres nothing easier when you come to try he observed pocketing the money  i wish you had not done that said flora  you will never hear the last of it  oh i dont know returned the young man the governor is human after all  and now john let me see your famous pass key  get into bed and dont move for any one till i come back  they wont mind you not answering when they knock i generally dont myself    chapter ix  in which mr nicholson accepts the principle of an allowance    in spite of the horrors of the day and the teadrinking of the night john slept the sleep of infancy  he was awakened by the maid as it might have been ten years ago tapping at the door  the winter sunrise was painting the east and as the window was to the back of the house it shone into the room with many strange colours of refracted light  without the houses were all cleanly roofed with snow the garden walls were coped with it a foot in height the greens lay glittering  yet strange as snow had grown to john during his years upon the bay of san francisco it was what he saw within that most affected him  for it was to his own room that alexander had been promoted there was the old paper with the device of flowers in which a cunning fancy might yet detect the face of skinny jim of the academy johns former dominie there was the old chest of drawers there were the chairs  one two three  three as before  only the carpet was new and the litter of alexanders clothes and books and drawing materials and a pencildrawing on the wall which in johns eyes appeared a marvel of proficiency  he was thus lying and looking and dreaming hanging as it were between two epochs of his life when alexander came to the door and made his presence known in a loud whisper john let him in and jumped back into the warm bed  well john said alexander the cablegram is sent in your name and twenty words of answer paid  i have been to the cab office and paid your cab even saw the old gentleman himself and properly apologised  he was mighty placable and indicated his belief you had been drinking  then i knocked up old macewen out of bed and explained affairs to him as he sat and shivered in a dressinggown  and before that i had been to the high street where they have heard nothing of your dead body so that i incline to the idea that you dreamed it  catch me said john  well the police never do know anything assented alexander and at any rate they have despatched a man to inquire and to recover your trousers and your money so that really your bill is now fairly clean and i see but one lion in your path  the governor  ill be turned out again youll see said john dismally  i dont imagine so returned the other not if you do what flora and i have arranged and your business now is to dress and lose no time about it  is your watch right  well you have a quarter of an hour  by five minutes before the half hour you must be at table in your old seat under uncle duthies picture  flora will be there to keep you countenance and we shall see what we shall see  wouldnt it be wiser for me to stay in bed said john  if you mean to manage your own concerns you can do precisely what you like replied alexander but if you are not in your place five minutes before the halfhour i wash my hands of you for one  and thereupon he departed  he had spoken warmly but the truth is his heart was somewhat troubled  and as he hung over the balusters watching for his father to appear he had hard ado to keep himself braced for the encounter that must follow  if he takes it well i shall be lucky he reflected  if he takes it ill why itll be a herring across johns tracks and perhaps all for the best  hes a confounded muff this brother of mine but he seems a decent soul  at that stage a door opened below with a certain emphasis and mr nicholson was seen solemnly to descend the stairs and pass into his own apartment  alexander followed quaking inwardly but with a steady face  he knocked was bidden to enter and found his father standing in front of the forced drawer to which he pointed as he spoke  this is a most extraordinary thing said he i have been robbed  i was afraid you would notice it observed his son it made such a beastly hash of the table  you were afraid i would notice it repeated mr nicholson and pray what may that mean  that i was a thief sir returned alexander  i took all the money in case the servants should get hold of it and here is the change and a note of my expenditure  you were gone to bed you see and i did not feel at liberty to knock you up but i think when you have heard the circumstances you will do me justice  the fact is i have reason to believe there has been some dreadful error about my brother john the sooner it can be cleared up the better for all parties it was a piece of business sir  and so i took it and decided on my own responsibility to send a telegram to san francisco  thanks to my quickness we may hear tonight there appears to be no doubt sir that john has been abominably used  when did this take place asked the father  last night sir after you were asleep was the reply  its most extraordinary said mr nicholson  do you mean to say you have been out all night  all night as you say sir  i have been to the telegraph and the police office and mr macewens  oh i had my hands full said alexander  very irregular said the father  you think of no one but yourself  i do not see that i have much to gain in bringing back my elder brother returned alexander shrewdly  the answer pleased the old man he smiled  well well i will go into this after breakfast said he  im sorry about the table said the son  the table is a small matter i think nothing of that said the father  its another example continued the son of the awkwardness of a man having no money of his own  if i had a proper allowance like other fellows of my age this would have been quite unnecessary  a proper allowance repeated his father in tones of blighting sarcasm for the expression was not new to him  i have never grudged you money for any proper purpose  no doubt no doubt said alexander but then you see you arent always on the spot to have the thing explained to you last night for instance    you could have wakened me last night interrupted his father  was it not some similar affair that first got john into a mess asked the son skilfully evading the point  but the father was not less adroit  and pray sir how did you come and go out of the house he asked  i forgot to lock the door it seems replied alexander  i have had cause to complain of that too often said mr nicholson  but still i do not understand  did you keep the servants up  i propose to go into all that at length after breakfast returned alexander  there is the halfhour going we must not keep miss mackenzie waiting  and greatly daring he opened the door  even alexander who it must have been perceived was on terms of comparative freedom with his parent  even alexander had never before dared to cut short an interview in this high handed fashion  but the truth is the very mass of his sons delinquencies daunted the old gentleman  he was like the man with the cart of apples  this was beyond him  that alexander should have spoiled his table taken his money stayed out all night and then coolly acknowledged all was something undreamed of in the nicholsonian philosophy and transcended comment  the return of the change which the old gentleman still carried in his hand had been a feature of imposing impudence it had dealt him a staggering blow  then there was the reference to johns original flight  a subject which he always kept resolutely curtained in his own mind for he was a man who loved to have made no mistakes and when he feared he might have made one kept the papers sealed  in view of all these surprises and reminders and of his sons composed and masterful demeanour there began to creep on mr nicholson a sickly misgiving  he seemed beyond his depth if he did or said anything he might come to regret it  the young man besides as he had pointed out himself was playing a generous part  and if wrong had been done  and done to one who was after and in spite of all a nicholson  it should certainly be righted  all things considered monstrous as it was to be cut short in his inquiries the old gentleman submitted pocketed the change and followed his son into the diningroom  during these few steps he once more mentally revolted and once more and this time finally laid down his arms a still small voice in his bosom having informed him authentically of a piece of news that he was afraid of alexander  the strange thing was that he was pleased to be afraid of him he was proud of his son he might be proud of him the boy had character and grit and knew what he was doing  these were his reflections as he turned the corner of the diningroom door  miss mackenzie was in the place of honour conjuring with a teapot and a cosy and behold there was another person present a large portly whiskered man of a very comfortable and respectable air who now rose from his seat and came forward holding out his hand  goodmorning father said he  of the contention of feeling that ran high in mr nicholsons starched bosom no outward sign was visible nor did he delay long to make a choice of conduct  yet in that interval he had reviewed a great field of possibilities both past and future whether it was possible he had not been perfectly wise in his treatment of john whether it was possible that john was innocent whether if he turned john out a second time as his outraged authority suggested it was possible to avoid a scandal and whether if he went to that extremity it was possible that alexander might rebel  hum said mr nicholson and put his hand limp and dead into johns  and then in an embarrassed silence all took their places and even the paper  from which it was the old gentlemans habit to suck mortification daily as he marked the decline of our institutions  even the paper lay furled by his side  but presently flora came to the rescue  she slid into the silence with a technicality asking if john still took his old inordinate amount of sugar  thence it was but a step to the burning question of the day and in tones a little shaken she commented on the interval since she had last made tea for the prodigal and congratulated him on his return and then addressing mr nicholson she congratulated him also in a manner that defied his illhumour and from that launched into the tale of johns misadventures not without some suitable suppressions  gradually alexander joined between them whether he would or no they forced a word or two from john and these fell so tremulously and spoke so eloquently of a mind oppressed with dread that mr nicholson relented  at length even he contributed a question and before the meal was at an end all four were talking even freely  prayers followed with the servants gaping at this newcomer whom no one had admitted and after prayers there came that moment on the clock which was the signal for mr nicholsons departure  john said he of course you will stay here  be very careful not to excite maria if miss mackenzie thinks it desirable that you should see her  alexander i wish to speak with you alone  and then when they were both in the back room you need not come to the office today said he you can stay and amuse your brother and i think it would be respectful to call on uncle greig  and by the bye this spoken with a certain dare we say  bashfulness i agree to concede the principle of an allowance and i will consult with doctor durie who is quite a man of the world and has sons of his own as to the amount  and my fine fellow you may consider yourself in luck he added with a smile  thank you said alexander  before noon a detective had restored to john his money and brought news sad enough in truth but perhaps the least sad possible  alan had been found in his own house in regent terrace under care of the terrified butler  he was quite mad and instead of going to prison had gone to morningside asylum  the murdered man it appeared was an evicted tenant who had for nearly a year pursued his late landlord with threats and insults and beyond this the cause and details of the tragedy were lost  when mr nicholson returned from dinner they were able to put a despatch into his hands john v nicholson randolph crescent edinburgh  kirkham has disappeared police looking for him  all understood  keep mind quite easy  austin having had this explained to him the old gentleman took down the cellar key and departed for two bottles of the 1820 port  uncle greig dined there that day and cousin robina and by an odd chance mr macewen and the presence of these strangers relieved what might have been otherwise a somewhat strained relation  ere they departed the family was welded once more into a fair semblance of unity  in the end of april john led flora  or as more descriptive flora led john  to the altar if altar that may be called which was indeed the drawingroom mantelpiece in mr nicholsons house with the reverend dr durie posted on the hearthrug in the guise of hymens priest  the last i saw of them on a recent visit to the north was at a dinnerparty in the house of my old friend gellatly macbride and after we had in classic phrase rejoined the ladies i had an opportunity to overhear flora conversing with another married woman on the much canvassed matter of a husbands tobacco  oh yes said she i only allow mr nicholson four cigars a day  three he smokes at fixed times  after a meal you know my dear and the fourth he can take when he likes with any friend  bravo thought i to myself this is the wife for my friend john    the bodysnatcher     every night in the year four of us sat in the small parlour of the george at debenham  the undertaker and the landlord and fettes and myself  sometimes there would be more but blow high blow low come rain or snow or frost we four would be each planted in his own particular armchair fettes was an old drunken scotchman a man of education obviously and a man of some property since he lived in idleness  he had come to debenham years ago while still young and by a mere continuance of living had grown to be an adopted townsman  his blue camlet cloak was a local antiquity like the churchspire  his place in the parlour at the george his absence from church his old crapulous disreputable vices were all things of course in debenham he had some vague radical opinions and some fleeting infidelities which he would now and again set forth and emphasise with tottering slaps upon the table  he drank rum  five glasses regularly every evening and for the greater portion of his nightly visit to the george sat with his glass in his right hand in a state of melancholy alcoholic saturation  we called him the doctor for he was supposed to have some special knowledge of medicine and had been known upon a pinch to set a fracture or reduce a dislocation but beyond these slight particulars we had no knowledge of his character and antecedents  one dark winter night  it had struck nine some time before the landlord joined us  there was a sick man in the george a great neighbouring proprietor suddenly struck down with apoplexy on his way to parliament and the great mans still greater london doctor had been telegraphed to his bedside it was the first time that such a thing had happened in debenham for the railway was but newly open and we were all proportionately moved by the occurrence  hes come said the landlord after he had filled and lighted his pipe  he said i  who  not the doctor  himself replied our host  what is his name  doctor macfarlane said the landlord  fettes was far through his third tumbler stupidly fuddled now nodding over now staring mazily around him but at the last word he seemed to awaken and repeated the name macfarlane twice quietly enough the first time but with sudden emotion at the second  yes said the landlord thats his name doctor wolfe macfarlane  fettes became instantly sober his eyes awoke his voice became clear loud and steady his language forcible and earnest  we were all startled by the transformation as if a man had risen from the dead  i beg your pardon he said i am afraid i have not been paying much attention to your talk  who is this wolfe macfarlane  and then when he had heard the landlord out it cannot be it cannot be he added and yet i would like well to see him face to face  do you know him doctor asked the undertaker with a gasp  god forbid was the reply  and yet the name is a strange one it were too much to fancy two  tell me landlord is he old  well said the host hes not a young man to be sure and his hair is white but he looks younger than you  he is older though years older  but with a slap upon the table its the rum you see in my face  rum and sin this man perhaps may have an easy conscience and a good digestion  conscience  hear me speak  you would think i was some good old decent christian would you not  but no not i i never canted  voltaire might have canted if hed stood in my shoes but the brains  with a rattling fillip on his bald head  the brains were clear and active and i saw and made no deductions  if you know this doctor i ventured to remark after a somewhat awful pause i should gather that you do not share the landlords good opinion  fettes paid no regard to me  yes he said with sudden decision i must see him face to face  there was another pause and then a door was closed rather sharply on the first floor and a step was heard upon the stair  thats the doctor cried the landlord  look sharp and you can catch him  it was but two steps from the small parlour to the door of the old george inn the wide oak staircase landed almost in the street there was room for a turkey rug and nothing more between the threshold and the last round of the descent but this little space was every evening brilliantly lit up not only by the light upon the stair and the great signallamp below the sign but by the warm radiance of the barroom window  the george thus brightly advertised itself to passersby in the cold street  fettes walked steadily to the spot and we who were hanging behind beheld the two men meet as one of them had phrased it face to face  dr macfarlane was alert and vigorous  his white hair set off his pale and placid although energetic countenance  he was richly dressed in the finest of broadcloth and the whitest of linen with a great gold watchchain and studs and spectacles of the same precious material  he wore a broad folded tie white and speckled with lilac and he carried on his arm a comfortable drivingcoat of fur  there was no doubt but he became his years breathing as he did of wealth and consideration and it was a surprising contrast to see our parlour sot  bald dirty pimpled and robed in his old camlet cloak  confront him at the bottom of the stairs  macfarlane he said somewhat loudly more like a herald than a friend  the great doctor pulled up short on the fourth step as though the familiarity of the address surprised and somewhat shocked his dignity  toddy macfarlane repeated fettes  the london man almost staggered  he stared for the swiftest of seconds at the man before him glanced behind him with a sort of scare and then in a startled whisper fettes he said you  ay said the other me  did you think i was dead too  we are not so easy shut of our acquaintance  hush hush exclaimed the doctor  hush hush this meeting is so unexpected  i can see you are unmanned  i hardly knew you i confess at first but i am overjoyed  overjoyed to have this opportunity  for the present it must be howdyedo and goodbye in one for my fly is waiting and i must not fail the train but you shall  let me see  yes  you shall give me your address and you can count on early news of me  we must do something for you fettes  i fear you are out at elbows but we must see to that for auld lang syne as once we sang at suppers  money cried fettes money from you  the money that i had from you is lying where i cast it in the rain  dr macfarlane had talked himself into some measure of superiority and confidence but the uncommon energy of this refusal cast him back into his first confusion  a horrible ugly look came and went across his almost venerable countenance  my dear fellow he said be it as you please my last thought is to offend you  i would intrude on none  i will leave you my address however    i do not wish it  i do not wish to know the roof that shelters you interrupted the other  i heard your name i feared it might be you i wished to know if after all there were a god i know now that there is none  begone  he still stood in the middle of the rug between the stair and doorway and the great london physician in order to escape would be forced to step to one side  it was plain that he hesitated before the thought of this humiliation white as he was there was a dangerous glitter in his spectacles but while he still paused uncertain he became aware that the driver of his fly was peering in from the street at this unusual scene and caught a glimpse at the same time of our little body from the parlour huddled by the corner of the bar  the presence of so many witnesses decided him at once to flee  he crouched together brushing on the wainscot and made a dart like a serpent striking for the door  but his tribulation was not yet entirely at an end for even as he was passing fettes clutched him by the arm and these words came in a whisper and yet painfully distinct have you seen it again  the great rich london doctor cried out aloud with a sharp throttling cry he dashed his questioner across the open space and with his hands over his head fled out of the door like a detected thief  before it had occurred to one of us to make a movement the fly was already rattling toward the station  the scene was over like a dream but the dream had left proofs and traces of its passage  next day the servant found the fine gold spectacles broken on the threshold and that very night we were all standing breathless by the bar room window and fettes at our side sober pale and resolute in look  god protect us mr fettes said the landlord coming first into possession of his customary senses  what in the universe is all this  these are strange things you have been saying  fettes turned toward us he looked us each in succession in the face  see if you can hold your tongues said he that man macfarlane is not safe to cross those that have done so already have repented it too late  and then without so much as finishing his third glass far less waiting for the other two he bade us goodbye and went forth under the lamp of the hotel into the black night  we three turned to our places in the parlour with the big red fire and four clear candles and as we recapitulated what had passed the first chill of our surprise soon changed into a glow of curiosity  we sat late it was the latest session i have known in the old george  each man before we parted had his theory that he was bound to prove and none of us had any nearer business in this world than to track out the past of our condemned companion and surprise the secret that he shared with the great london doctor  it is no great boast but i believe i was a better hand at worming out a story than either of my fellows at the george and perhaps there is now no other man alive who could narrate to you the following foul and unnatural events  in his young days fettes studied medicine in the schools of edinburgh  he had talent of a kind the talent that picks up swiftly what it hears and readily retails it for its own  he worked little at home but he was civil attentive and intelligent in the presence of his masters  they soon picked him out as a lad who listened closely and remembered well nay strange as it seemed to me when i first heard it he was in those days well favoured and pleased by his exterior there was at that period a certain extramural teacher of anatomy whom i shall here designate by the letter k  his name was subsequently too well known  the man who bore it skulked through the streets of edinburgh in disguise while the mob that applauded at the execution of burke called loudly for the blood of his employer  but mr k was then at the top of his vogue he enjoyed a popularity due partly to his own talent and address partly to the incapacity of his rival the university professor  the students at least swore by his name and fettes believed himself and was believed by others to have laid the foundations of success when he had acquired the favour of this meteorically famous man  mr k was a bon vivant as well as an accomplished teacher he liked a sly illusion no less than a careful preparation  in both capacities fettes enjoyed and deserved his notice and by the second year of his attendance he held the halfregular position of second demonstrator or sub assistant in his class  in this capacity the charge of the theatre and lectureroom devolved in particular upon his shoulders  he had to answer for the cleanliness of the premises and the conduct of the other students and it was a part of his duty to supply receive and divide the various subjects  it was with a view to this last  at that time very delicate  affair that he was lodged by mr k in the same wynd and at last in the same building with the dissectingrooms  here after a night of turbulent pleasures his hand still tottering his sight still misty and confused he would be called out of bed in the black hours before the winter dawn by the unclean and desperate interlopers who supplied the table  he would open the door to these men since infamous throughout the land he would help them with their tragic burden pay them their sordid price and remain alone when they were gone with the unfriendly relics of humanity  from such a scene he would return to snatch another hour or two of slumber to repair the abuses of the night and refresh himself for the labours of the day  few lads could have been more insensible to the impressions of a life thus passed among the ensigns of mortality  his mind was closed against all general considerations  he was incapable of interest in the fate and fortunes of another the slave of his own desires and low ambitions  cold light and selfish in the last resort he had that modicum of prudence miscalled morality which keeps a man from inconvenient drunkenness or punishable theft  he coveted besides a measure of consideration from his masters and his fellowpupils and he had no desire to fail conspicuously in the external parts of life  thus he made it his pleasure to gain some distinction in his studies and day after day rendered unimpeachable eyeservice to his employer mr k for his day of work he indemnified himself by nights of roaring blackguardly enjoyment and when that balance had been struck the organ that he called his conscience declared itself content  the supply of subjects was a continual trouble to him as well as to his master  in that large and busy class the raw material of the anatomists kept perpetually running out and the business thus rendered necessary was not only unpleasant in itself but threatened dangerous consequences to all who were concerned  it was the policy of mr k to ask no questions in his dealings with the trade  they bring the body and we pay the price he used to say dwelling on the alliteration  quid pro quo  and again and somewhat profanely ask no questions he would tell his assistants for conscience sake  there was no understanding that the subjects were provided by the crime of murder  had that idea been broached to him in words he would have recoiled in horror but the lightness of his speech upon so grave a matter was in itself an offence against good manners and a temptation to the men with whom he dealt  fettes for instance had often remarked to himself upon the singular freshness of the bodies  he had been struck again and again by the hangdog abominable looks of the ruffians who came to him before the dawn and putting things together clearly in his private thoughts he perhaps attributed a meaning too immoral and too categorical to the unguarded counsels of his master  he understood his duty in short to have three branches to take what was brought to pay the price and to avert the eye from any evidence of crime  one november morning this policy of silence was put sharply to the test  he had been awake all night with a racking toothache  pacing his room like a caged beast or throwing himself in fury on his bed  and had fallen at last into that profound uneasy slumber that so often follows on a night of pain when he was awakened by the third or fourth angry repetition of the concerted signal  there was a thin bright moonshine it was bitter cold windy and frosty the town had not yet awakened but an indefinable stir already preluded the noise and business of the day  the ghouls had come later than usual and they seemed more than usually eager to be gone  fettes sick with sleep lighted them upstairs  he heard their grumbling irish voices through a dream and as they stripped the sack from their sad merchandise he leaned dozing with his shoulder propped against the wall he had to shake himself to find the men their money  as he did so his eyes lighted on the dead face he started he took two steps nearer with the candle raised  god almighty he cried  that is jane galbraith  the men answered nothing but they shuffled nearer the door  i know her i tell you he continued  she was alive and hearty yesterday  its impossible she can be dead its impossible you should have got this body fairly  sure sir youre mistaken entirely said one of the men  but the other looked fettes darkly in the eyes and demanded the money on the spot  it was impossible to misconceive the threat or to exaggerate the danger  the lads heart failed him  he stammered some excuses counted out the sum and saw his hateful visitors depart  no sooner were they gone than he hastened to confirm his doubts  by a dozen unquestionable marks he identified the girl he had jested with the day before  he saw with horror marks upon her body that might well betoken violence a panic seized him and he took refuge in his room  there he reflected at length over the discovery that he had made considered soberly the bearing of mr ks instructions and the danger to himself of interference in so serious a business and at last in sore perplexity determined to wait for the advice of his immediate superior the class assistant  this was a young doctor wolfe macfarlane a high favourite among all the reckless students clever dissipated and unscrupulous to the last degree  he had travelled and studied abroad  his manners were agreeable and a little forward  he was an authority on the stage skilful on the ice or the links with skate or golfclub he dressed with nice audacity and to put the finishing touch upon his glory he kept a gig and a strong trottinghorse  with fettes he was on terms of intimacy indeed their relative positions called for some community of life and when subjects were scarce the pair would drive far into the country in macfarlanes gig visit and desecrate some lonely graveyard and return before dawn with their booty to the door of the dissectingroom  on that particular morning macfarlane arrived somewhat earlier than his wont  fettes heard him and met him on the stairs told him his story and showed him the cause of his alarm  macfarlane examined the marks on her body  yes he said with a nod it looks fishy  well what should i do asked fettes  do repeated the other  do you want to do anything least said soonest mended i should say  some one else might recognise her objected fettes  she was as well known as the castle rock  well hope not said macfarlane and if anybody does  well you didnt dont you see and theres an end  the fact is this has been going on too long  stir up the mud and youll get k into the most unholy trouble youll be in a shocking box yourself  so will i if you come to that  i should like to know how any one of us would look or what the devil we should have to say for ourselves in any christian witnessbox  for me you know theres one thing certain  that practically speaking all our subjects have been murdered  macfarlane cried fettes  come now sneered the other  as if you hadnt suspected it yourself  suspecting is one thing    and proof another  yes i know and im as sorry as you are this should have come here tapping the body with his cane the next best thing for me is not to recognise it and he added coolly i dont  you may if you please  i dont dictate but i think a man of the world would do as i do and i may add i fancy that is what k would look for at our hands  the question is why did he choose us two for his assistants  and i answer because he didnt want old wives  this was the tone of all others to affect the mind of a lad like fettes  he agreed to imitate macfarlane  the body of the unfortunate girl was duly dissected and no one remarked or appeared to recognise her  one afternoon when his days work was over fettes dropped into a popular tavern and found macfarlane sitting with a stranger  this was a small man very pale and dark with coalblack eyes  the cut of his features gave a promise of intellect and refinement which was but feebly realised in his manners for he proved upon a nearer acquaintance coarse vulgar and stupid  he exercised however a very remarkable control over macfarlane issued orders like the great bashaw became inflamed at the least discussion or delay and commented rudely on the servility with which he was obeyed this most offensive person took a fancy to fettes on the spot plied him with drinks and honoured him with unusual confidences on his past career  if a tenth part of what he confessed were true he was a very loathsome rogue and the lads vanity was tickled by the attention of so experienced a man  im a pretty bad fellow myself the stranger remarked but macfarlane is the boy  toddy macfarlane i call him  toddy order your friend another glass  or it might be toddy you jump up and shut the door  toddy hates me he said again  oh yes toddy you do  dont you call me that confounded name growled macfarlane  hear him  did you ever see the lads play knife  he would like to do that all over my body remarked the stranger  we medicals have a better way than that said fettes when we dislike a dead friend of ours we dissect him  macfarlane looked up sharply as though this jest were scarcely to his mind  the afternoon passed  gray for that was the strangers name invited fettes to join them at dinner ordered a feast so sumptuous that the tavern was thrown into commotion and when all was done commanded macfarlane to settle the bill it was late before they separated the man gray was incapably drunk  macfarlane sobered by his fury chewed the cud of the money he had been forced to squander and the slights he had been obliged to swallow  fettes with various liquors singing in his head returned home with devious footsteps and a mind entirely in abeyance  next day macfarlane was absent from the class and fettes smiled to himself as he imagined him still squiring the intolerable gray from tavern to tavern  as soon as the hour of liberty had struck he posted from place to place in quest of his last nights companions he could find them however nowhere so returned early to his rooms went early to bed and slept the sleep of the just  at four in the morning he was awakened by the wellknown signal  descending to the door he was filled with astonishment to find macfarlane with his gig and in the gig one of those long and ghastly packages with which he was so well acquainted  what he cried  have you been out alone  how did you manage  but macfarlane silenced him roughly bidding him turn to business  when they had got the body upstairs and laid it on the table macfarlane made at first as if he were going away then he paused and seemed to hesitate and then you had better look at the face said he in tones of some constraint  you had better he repeated as fettes only stared at him in wonder  but where and how and when did you come by it cried the other  look at the face was the only answer  fettes was staggered strange doubts assailed him  he looked from the young doctor to the body and then back again  at last with a start he did as he was bidden  he had almost expected the sight that met his eyes and yet the shock was cruel  to see fixed in the rigidity of death and naked on that coarse layer of sackcloth the man whom he had left well clad and full of meat and sin upon the threshold of a tavern awoke even in the thoughtless fettes some of the terrors of the conscience  it was a cras tibi which reechoed in his soul that two whom he had known should have come to lie upon these icy tables  yet these were only secondary thoughts his first concern regarded wolfe  unprepared for a challenge so momentous he knew not how to look his comrade in the face  he durst not meet his eye and he had neither words nor voice at his command  it was macfarlane himself who made the first advance  he came up quietly behind and laid his hand gently but firmly on the others shoulder  richardson said he may have the head  now richardson was a student who had long been anxious for that portion of the human subject to dissect  there was no answer and the murderer resumed talking of business you must pay me your accounts you see must tally  fettes found a voice the ghost of his own pay you he cried  pay you for that  why yes of course you must  by all means and on every possible account you must returned the other  i dare not give it for nothing you dare not take it for nothing it would compromise us both  this is another case like jane galbraiths  the more things are wrong the more we must act as if all were right  where does old k keep his money  there answered fettes hoarsely pointing to a cupboard in the corner  give me the key then said the other calmly holding out his hand  there was an instants hesitation and the die was cast macfarlane could not suppress a nervous twitch the infinitesimal mark of an immense relief as he felt the key between his fingers  he opened the cupboard brought out pen and ink and a paperbook that stood in one compartment and separated from the funds in a drawer a sum suitable to the occasion  now look here he said there is the payment made  first proof of your good faith first step to your security  you have now to clinch it by a second  enter the payment in your book and then you for your part may defy the devil  the next few seconds were for fettes an agony of thought but in balancing his terrors it was the most immediate that triumphed  any future difficulty seemed almost welcome if he could avoid a present quarrel with macfarlane  he set down the candle which he had been carrying all this time and with a steady hand entered the date the nature and the amount of the transaction  and now said macfarlane its only fair that you should pocket the lucre  ive had my share already  by the bye when a man of the world falls into a bit of luck has a few shillings extra in his pocket  im ashamed to speak of it but theres a rule of conduct in the case  no treating no purchase of expensive classbooks no squaring of old debts borrow dont lend  macfarlane began fettes still somewhat hoarsely i have put my neck in a halter to oblige you  to oblige me cried wolfe  oh come  you did as near as i can see the matter what you downright had to do in self defence  suppose i got into trouble where would you be this second little matter flows clearly from the first  mr gray is the continuation of miss galbraith  you cant begin and then stop  if you begin you must keep on beginning thats the truth  no rest for the wicked  a horrible sense of blackness and the treachery of fate seized hold upon the soul of the unhappy student  my god he cried but what have i done and when did i begin  to be made a class assistant  in the name of reason wheres the harm in that  service wanted the position service might have got it  would he have been where i am now  my dear fellow said macfarlane what a boy you are  what harm has come to you  what harm can come to you if you hold your tongue  why man do you know what this life is  there are two squads of us  the lions and the lambs  if youre a lamb youll come to lie upon these tables like gray or jane galbraith if youre a lion youll live and drive a horse like me like k like all the world with any wit or courage youre staggered at the first  but look at k  my dear fellow youre clever you have pluck  i like you and k likes you  you were born to lead the hunt and i tell you on my honour and my experience of life three days from now youll laugh at all these scarecrows like a high school boy at a farce  and with that macfarlane took his departure and drove off up the wynd in his gig to get under cover before daylight fettes was thus left alone with his regrets  he saw the miserable peril in which he stood involved  he saw with inexpressible dismay that there was no limit to his weakness and that from concession to concession he had fallen from the arbiter of macfarlanes destiny to his paid and helpless accomplice  he would have given the world to have been a little braver at the time but it did not occur to him that he might still be brave  the secret of jane galbraith and the cursed entry in the daybook closed his mouth  hours passed the class began to arrive the members of the unhappy gray were dealt out to one and to another and received without remark  richardson was made happy with the head and before the hour of freedom rang fettes trembled with exultation to perceive how far they had already gone toward safety  for two days he continued to watch with increasing joy the dreadful process of disguise  on the third day macfarlane made his appearance  he had been ill he said but he made up for lost time by the energy with which he directed the students  to richardson in particular he extended the most valuable assistance and advice and that student encouraged by the praise of the demonstrator burned high with ambitious hopes and saw the medal already in his grasp  before the week was out macfarlanes prophecy had been fulfilled  fettes had outlived his terrors and had forgotten his baseness  he began to plume himself upon his courage and had so arranged the story in his mind that he could look back on these events with an unhealthy pride  of his accomplice he saw but little  they met of course in the business of the class they received their orders together from mr k  at times they had a word or two in private and macfarlane was from first to last particularly kind and jovial  but it was plain that he avoided any reference to their common secret and even when fettes whispered to him that he had cast in his lot with the lions and foresworn the lambs he only signed to him smilingly to hold his peace  at length an occasion arose which threw the pair once more into a closer union  mr k was again short of subjects pupils were eager and it was a part of this teachers pretensions to be always well supplied  at the same time there came the news of a burial in the rustic graveyard of glencorse  time has little changed the place in question it stood then as now upon a cross road out of call of human habitations and buried fathom deep in the foliage of six cedar trees  the cries of the sheep upon the neighbouring hills the streamlets upon either hand one loudly singing among pebbles the other dripping furtively from pond to pond the stir of the wind in mountainous old flowering chestnuts and once in seven days the voice of the bell and the old tunes of the precentor were the only sounds that disturbed the silence around the rural church  the resurrection man  to use a byname of the period  was not to be deterred by any of the sanctities of customary piety  it was part of his trade to despise and desecrate the scrolls and trumpets of old tombs the paths worn by the feet of worshippers and mourners and the offerings and the inscriptions of bereaved affection  to rustic neighbourhoods where love is more than commonly tenacious and where some bonds of blood or fellowship unite the entire society of a parish the bodysnatcher far from being repelled by natural respect was attracted by the ease and safety of the task  to bodies that had been laid in earth in joyful expectation of a far different awakening there came that hasty lamplit terrorhaunted resurrection of the spade and mattock  the coffin was forced the cerements torn and the melancholy relics clad in sackcloth after being rattled for hours on moonless byways were at length exposed to uttermost indignities before a class of gaping boys  somewhat as two vultures may swoop upon a dying lamb fettes and macfarlane were to be let loose upon a grave in that green and quiet restingplace  the wife of a farmer a woman who had lived for sixty years and been known for nothing but good butter and a godly conversation was to be rooted from her grave at midnight and carried dead and naked to that faraway city that she had always honoured with her sundays best the place beside her family was to be empty till the crack of doom her innocent and almost venerable members to be exposed to that last curiosity of the anatomist  late one afternoon the pair set forth well wrapped in cloaks and furnished with a formidable bottle  it rained without remission  a cold dense lashing rain  now and again there blew a puff of wind but these sheets of falling water kept it down  bottle and all it was a sad and silent drive as far as penicuik where they were to spend the evening  they stopped once to hide their implements in a thick bush not far from the churchyard and once again at the fishers tryst to have a toast before the kitchen fire and vary their nips of whisky with a glass of ale  when they reached their journeys end the gig was housed the horse was fed and comforted and the two young doctors in a private room sat down to the best dinner and the best wine the house afforded the lights the fire the beating rain upon the window the cold incongruous work that lay before them added zest to their enjoyment of the meal  with every glass their cordiality increased  soon macfarlane handed a little pile of gold to his companion  a compliment he said  between friends these little dd accommodations ought to fly like pipelights  fettes pocketed the money and applauded the sentiment to the echo  you are a philosopher he cried  i was an ass till i knew you  you and k between you by the lord harry but youll make a man of me  of course we shall applauded macfarlane  a man  i tell you it required a man to back me up the other morning there are some big brawling fortyyearold cowards who would have turned sick at the look of the dd thing but not you  you kept your head  i watched you  well and why not fettes thus vaunted himself  it was no affair of mine  there was nothing to gain on the one side but disturbance and on the other i could count on your gratitude dont you see  and he slapped his pocket till the gold pieces rang  macfarlane somehow felt a certain touch of alarm at these unpleasant words  he may have regretted that he had taught his young companion so successfully but he had no time to interfere for the other noisily continued in this boastful strain  the great thing is not to be afraid  now between you and me i dont want to hang  thats practical but for all cant macfarlane i was born with a contempt  hell god devil right wrong sin crime and all the old gallery of curiosities  they may frighten boys but men of the world like you and me despise them  heres to the memory of gray  it was by this time growing somewhat late  the gig according to order was brought round to the door with both lamps brightly shining and the young men had to pay their bill and take the road  they announced that they were bound for peebles and drove in that direction till they were clear of the last houses of the town then extinguishing the lamps returned upon their course and followed a byroad toward glencorse  there was no sound but that of their own passage and the incessant strident pouring of the rain  it was pitch dark here and there a white gate or a white stone in the wall guided them for a short space across the night but for the most part it was at a foot pace and almost groping that they picked their way through that resonant blackness to their solemn and isolated destination  in the sunken woods that traverse the neighbourhood of the burying ground the last glimmer failed them and it became necessary to kindle a match and reillumine one of the lanterns of the gig  thus under the dripping trees and environed by huge and moving shadows they reached the scene of their unhallowed labours  they were both experienced in such affairs and powerful with the spade and they had scarce been twenty minutes at their task before they were rewarded by a dull rattle on the coffin lid  at the same moment macfarlane having hurt his hand upon a stone flung it carelessly above his head  the grave in which they now stood almost to the shoulders was close to the edge of the plateau of the graveyard and the gig lamp had been propped the better to illuminate their labours against a tree and on the immediate verge of the steep bank descending to the stream  chance had taken a sure aim with the stone  then came a clang of broken glass night fell upon them sounds alternately dull and ringing announced the bounding of the lantern down the bank and its occasional collision with the trees  a stone or two which it had dislodged in its descent rattled behind it into the profundities of the glen and then silence like night resumed its sway and they might bend their hearing to its utmost pitch but naught was to be heard except the rain now marching to the wind now steadily falling over miles of open country  they were so nearly at an end of their abhorred task that they judged it wisest to complete it in the dark  the coffin was exhumed and broken open the body inserted in the dripping sack and carried between them to the gig one mounted to keep it in its place and the other taking the horse by the mouth groped along by wall and bush until they reached the wider road by the fishers tryst  here was a faint diffused radiancy which they hailed like daylight by that they pushed the horse to a good pace and began to rattle along merrily in the direction of the town  they had both been wetted to the skin during their operations and now as the gig jumped among the deep ruts the thing that stood propped between them fell now upon one and now upon the other  at every repetition of the horrid contact each instinctively repelled it with the greater haste and the process natural although it was began to tell upon the nerves of the companions  macfarlane made some illfavoured jest about the farmers wife but it came hollowly from his lips and was allowed to drop in silence still their unnatural burden bumped from side to side and now the head would be laid as if in confidence upon their shoulders and now the drenching sackcloth would flap icily about their faces  a creeping chill began to possess the soul of fettes  he peered at the bundle and it seemed somehow larger than at first  all over the countryside and from every degree of distance the farm dogs accompanied their passage with tragic ululations and it grew and grew upon his mind that some unnatural miracle had been accomplished that some nameless change had befallen the dead body and that it was in fear of their unholy burden that the dogs were howling  for gods sake said he making a great effort to arrive at speech for gods sake lets have a light  seemingly macfarlane was affected in the same direction for though he made no reply he stopped the horse passed the reins to his companion got down and proceeded to kindle the remaining lamp  they had by that time got no farther than the crossroad down to auchenclinny  the rain still poured as though the deluge were returning and it was no easy matter to make a light in such a world of wet and darkness when at last the flickering blue flame had been transferred to the wick and began to expand and clarify and shed a wide circle of misty brightness round the gig it became possible for the two young men to see each other and the thing they had along with them  the rain had moulded the rough sacking to the outlines of the body underneath the head was distinct from the trunk the shoulders plainly modelled something at once spectral and human riveted their eyes upon the ghastly comrade of their drive  for some time macfarlane stood motionless holding up the lamp  a nameless dread was swathed like a wet sheet about the body and tightened the white skin upon the face of fettes a fear that was meaningless a horror of what could not be kept mounting to his brain  another beat of the watch and he had spoken  but his comrade forestalled him  that is not a woman said macfarlane in a hushed voice  it was a woman when we put her in whispered fettes  hold that lamp said the other  i must see her face  and as fettes took the lamp his companion untied the fastenings of the sack and drew down the cover from the head the light fell very clear upon the dark wellmoulded features and smoothshaven cheeks of a too familiar countenance often beheld in dreams of both of these young men  a wild yell rang up into the night each leaped from his own side into the roadway the lamp fell broke and was extinguished and the horse terrified by this unusual commotion bounded and went off toward edinburgh at a gallop bearing along with it sole occupant of the gig the body of the dead and longdissected gray    the story of a lie    chapter i  introduces the admiral    when dick naseby was in paris he made some odd acquaintances for he was one of those who have ears to hear and can use their eyes no less than their intelligence  he made as many thoughts as stuart mill but his philosophy concerned flesh and blood and was experimental as to its method  he was a typehunter among mankind  he despised small game and insignificant personalities whether in the shape of dukes or bagmen letting them go by like seaweed but show him a refined or powerful face let him hear a plangent or a penetrating voice fish for him with a living look in some ones eye a passionate gesture a meaning and ambiguous smile and his mind was instantaneously awakened  there was a man there was a woman he seemed to say and he stood up to the task of comprehension with the delight of an artist in his art  and indeed rightly considered this interest of his was an artistic interest  there is no science in the personal study of human nature  all comprehension is creation the woman i love is somewhat of my handiwork and the great lover like the great painter is he that can so embellish his subject as to make her more than human whilst yet by a cunning art he has so based his apotheosis on the nature of the case that the woman can go on being a true woman and give her character free play and show littleness or cherish spite or be greedy of common pleasures and he continue to worship without a thought of incongruity  to love a character is only the heroic way of understanding it  when we love by some noble method of our own or some nobility of mien or nature in the other we apprehend the loved one by what is noblest in ourselves  when we are merely studying an eccentricity the method of our study is but a series of allowances  to begin to understand is to begin to sympathise for comprehension comes only when we have stated anothers faults and virtues in terms of our own  hence the proverbial toleration of artists for their own evil creations  hence too it came about that dick naseby a highminded creature and as scrupulous and brave a gentleman as you would want to meet held in a sort of affection the various human creeping things whom he had met and studied  one of these was mr peter van tromp an englishspeaking twolegged animal of the international genus and by profession of general and more than equivocal utility  years before he had been a painter of some standing in a colony and portraits signed van tromp had celebrated the greatness of colonial governors and judges  in those days he had been married and driven his wife and infant daughter in a pony trap  what were the steps of his declension  no one exactly knew  here he was at least and had been any time these past ten years a sort of dismal parasite upon the foreigner in paris  it would be hazardous to specify his exact industry coarsely followed it would have merited a name grown somewhat unfamiliar to our ears  followed as he followed it with a skilful reticence in a kind of social chiaroscuro it was still possible for the polite to call him a professional painter  his lair was in the grand hotel and the gaudiest cafes  there he might be seen jotting off a sketch with an air of some inspiration and he was always affable and one of the easiest of men to fall in talk withal  a conversation usually ripened into a peculiar sort of intimacy and it was extraordinary how many little services van tromp contrived to render in the course of sixandthirty hours  he occupied a position between a friend and a courier which made him worse than embarrassing to repay  but those whom he obliged could always buy one of his villainous little pictures or where the favours had been prolonged and more than usually delicate might order and pay for a large canvas with perfect certainty that they would hear no more of the transaction  among resident artists he enjoyed celebrity of a non professional sort  he had spent more money  no less than three individual fortunes it was whispered  than any of his associates could ever hope to gain  apart from his colonial career he had been to greece in a brigantine with four brass carronades he had travelled europe in a chaise and four drawing bridle at the palacedoors of german princes queens of song and dance had followed him like sheep and paid his tailors bills  and to behold him now seeking small loans with plaintive condescension sponging for breakfast on an artstudent of nineteen a fallen don juan who had neglected to die at the propitious hour had a colour of romance for young imaginations  his name and his bright past seen through the prism of whispered gossip had gained him the nickname of the admiral  dick found him one day at the receipt of custom rapidly painting a pair of hens and a cock in a little watercolour sketching box and now and then glancing at the ceiling like a man who should seek inspiration from the muse  dick thought it remarkable that a painter should choose to work over an absinthe in a public cafe and looked the man over the aged rakishness of his appearance was set off by a youthful costume he had disreputable grey hair and a disreputable sore red nose but the coat and the gesture the outworks of the man were still designed for show  dick came up to his table and inquired if he might look at what the gentleman was doing  no one was so delighted as the admiral  a bit of a thing said he  i just dash them off like that  i  i dash them off he added with a gesture  quite so said dick who was appalled by the feebleness of the production  understand me continued van tromp i am a man of the world  and yet  once an artist always an artist  all of a sudden a thought takes me in the street i become its prey its like a pretty woman no use to struggle i must  dash it off  i see said dick  yes pursued the painter it all comes easily easily to me it is not my business its a pleasure  life is my business  life  this great city paris  paris after dark  its lights its gardens its odd corners  aha he cried to be young again  the heart is young but the heels are leaden  a poor mean business to grow old  nothing remains but the coup doeil the contemplative mans enjoyment mr   and he paused for the name  naseby returned dick  the other treated him at once to an exciting beverage and expatiated on the pleasure of meeting a compatriot in a foreign land to hear him you would have thought they had encountered in central africa  dick had never found any one take a fancy to him so readily nor show it in an easier or less offensive manner  he seemed tickled with him as an elderly fellow about town might be tickled by a pleasant and witty lad he indicated that he was no precision but in his wildest times had never been such a blade as he thought dick dick protested but in vain  this manner of carrying an intimacy at the bayonets point was van tromps stockin trade  with an older man he insinuated himself with youth he imposed himself and in the same breath imposed an ideal on his victim who saw that he must work up to it or lose the esteem of this old and vicious patron  and what young man can bear to lose a character for vice  at last as it grew towards dinnertime do you know paris asked van tromp  not so well as you i am convinced said dick  and so am i returned van tromp gaily  paris  my young friend  you will allow me  when you know paris as i do you will have seen strange things  i say no more all i say is strange things  we are men of the world you and i and in paris in the heart of civilised existence  this is an opportunity mr naseby  let us dine  let me show you where to dine  dick consented  on the way to dinner the admiral showed him where to buy gloves and made him buy them where to buy cigars and made him buy a vast store some of which he obligingly accepted  at the restaurant he showed him what to order with surprising consequences in the bill  what he made that night by his percentages it would be hard to estimate  and all the while dick smilingly consented understanding well that he was being done but taking his losses in the pursuit of character as a hunter sacrifices his dogs  as for the strange things the reader will be relieved to hear that they were no stranger than might have been expected and he may find things quite as strange without the expense of a van tromp for guide  yet he was a guide of no mean order who made up for the poverty of what he had to show by a copious imaginative commentary  and such said he with a hiccup such is paris  pooh said dick who was tired of the performance  the admiral hung an ear and looked up sidelong with a glimmer of suspicion  good night said dick im tired  so english cried van tromp clutching him by the hand so english  so blase  such a charming companion  let me see you home  look here returned dick i have said good night and now im going  youre an amusing old boy i like you in a sense but heres an end of it for tonight  not another cigar not another grog not another percentage out of me  i beg your pardon cried the admiral with dignity  tut man said dick youre not offended youre a man of the world i thought  ive been studying you and its over have i not paid for the lesson  au revoir  van tromp laughed gaily shook hands up to the elbows hoped cordially they would meet again and that often but looked after dick as he departed with a tremor of indignation after that they two not unfrequently fell in each others way and dick would often treat the old boy to breakfast on a moderate scale and in a restaurant of his own selection often too he would lend van tromp the matter of a pound in view of that gentlemans contemplated departure for australia there would be a scene of farewell almost touching in character and a week or a month later they would meet on the same boulevard without surprise or embarrassment  and in the meantime dick learned more about his acquaintance on all sides heard of his yacht his chaise and four his brief season of celebrity amid a more confiding population his daughter of whom he loved to whimper in his cups his sponging parasitical nameless way of life and with each new detail something that was not merely interest nor yet altogether affection grew up in his mind towards this disreputable stepson of the arts  ere he left paris van tromp was one of those whom he entertained to a farewell supper and the old gentleman made the speech of the evening and then fell below the table weeping smiling paralysed    chapter ii  a letter to the papers    old mr naseby had the sturdy untutored nature of the upper middle class  the universe seemed plain to him  the things right he would say or the things wrong and there was an end of it  there was a contained prophetic energy in his utterances even on the slightest affairs he saw the damned thing if you did not it must be from perversity of will and this sent the blood to his head apart from this which made him an exacting companion he was one of the most upright hottempered hotheaded old gentlemen in england  florid with white hair the face of an old jupiter and the figure of an old foxhunter he enlivened the vale of thyme from end to end on his big cantering chestnut  he had a hearty respect for dick as a lad of parts  dick had a respect for his father as the best of men tempered by the politic revolt of a youth who has to see to his own independence  whenever the pair argued they came to an open rupture and arguments were frequent for they were both positive and both loved the work of the intelligence  it was a treat to hear mr naseby defending the church of england in a volley of oaths or supporting ascetic morals with an enthusiasm not entirely innocent of port wine  dick used to wax indignant and none the less so because as his father was a skilful disputant he found himself not seldom in the wrong  on these occasions he would redouble in energy and declare that black was white and blue yellow with much conviction and heat of manner but in the morning such a licence of debate weighed upon him like a crime and he would seek out his father where he walked before breakfast on a terrace overlooking all the vale of thyme  i have to apologise sir for last night   he would begin  of course you have the old gentleman would cut in cheerfully  you spoke like a fool  say no more about it  you do not understand me sir  i refer to a particular point  i confess there is much force in your argument from the doctrine of possibilities  of course there is returned his father  come down and look at the stables  only he would add bear this in mind and do remember that a man of my age and experience knows more about what he is saying than a raw boy  he would utter the word boy even more offensively than the average of fathers and the light way in which he accepted these apologies cut richard to the heart  the latter drew slighting comparisons and remembered that he was the only one who ever apologised  this gave him a high station in his own esteem and thus contributed indirectly to his better behaviour for he was scrupulous as well as highspirited and prided himself on nothing more than on a just submission  so things went on until the famous occasion when mr naseby becoming engrossed in securing the election of a sound party candidate to parliament wrote a flaming letter to the papers  the letter had about every demerit of party letters in general it was expressed with the energy of a believer it was personal it was a little more than half unfair and about a quarter untrue  the old man did not mean to say what was untrue you may be sure but he had rashly picked up gossip as his prejudice suggested and now rashly launched it on the public with the sanction of his name  the liberal candidate he concluded is thus a public turncoat  is that the sort of man we want  he has been given the lie and has swallowed the insult  is that the sort of man we want  i answer no  with all the force of my conviction i answer no  and then he signed and dated the letter with an amateurs pride and looked to be famous by the morrow  dick who had heard nothing of the matter was up first on that inauspicious day and took the journal to an arbour in the garden  he found his fathers manifesto in one column and in another a leading article  no one that we are aware of ran the article had consulted mr naseby on the subject but if he had been appealed to by the whole body of electors his letter would be none the less ungenerous and unjust to mr dalton  we do not choose to give the lie to mr naseby for we are too well aware of the consequences but we shall venture instead to print the facts of both cases referred to by this redhot partisan in another portion of our issue  mr naseby is of course a large proprietor in our neighbourhood but fidelity to facts decent feeling and english grammar are all of them qualities more important than the possession of land  mr  is doubtless a great man in his large gardens and that halfmile of greenhouses where he has probably ripened his intellect and temper he may say what he will to his hired vassals but as the scotch say    here he mauna think to domineer   liberalism continued the anonymous journalist is of too free and sound a growth etc  richard naseby read the whole thing from beginning to end and a crushing shame fell upon his spirit  his father had played the fool he had gone out noisily to war and come back with confusion  the moment that his trumpets sounded he had been disgracefully unhorsed  there was no question as to the facts they were one and all against the squire richard would have given his ears to have suppressed the issue but as that could not be done he had his horse saddled and furnishing himself with a convenient staff rode off at once to thymebury  the editor was at breakfast in a large sad apartment  the absence of furniture the extreme meanness of the meal and the haggard brighteyed consumptive look of the culprit unmanned our hero but he clung to his stick and was stout and warlike  you wrote the article in this mornings paper he demanded  you are young mr naseby  i published it replied the editor rising  my father is an old man said richard and then with an outburst and a damned sight finer fellow than either you or dalton  he stopped and swallowed he was determined that all should go with regularity  i have but one question to put to you sir he resumed  granted that my father was misinformed would it not have been more decent to withhold the letter and communicate with him in private  believe me returned the editor that alternative was not open to me  mr naseby told me in a note that he had sent his letter to three other journals and in fact threatened me with what he called exposure if i kept it back from mine  i am really concerned at what has happened i sympathise and approve of your emotion young gentleman but the attack on mr dalton was gross very gross and i had no choice but to offer him my columns to reply  party has its duties sir added the scribe kindling as one who should propose a sentiment and the attack was gross  richard stood for half a minute digesting the answer and then the god of fair play came uppermost in his heart and murmuring good morning he made his escape into the street  his horse was not hurried on the way home and he was late for breakfast  the squire was standing with his back to the fire in a state bordering on apoplexy his fingers violently knitted under his coat tails  as richard came in he opened and shut his mouth like a codfish and his eyes protruded  have you seen that sir he cried nodding towards the paper  yes sir said richard  oh youve read it have you  yes i have read it replied richard looking at his foot  well demanded the old gentleman and what have you to say to it sir  you seem to have been misinformed said dick  well  what then  is your mind so sterile sir  have you not a word of comment no proposal  i fear sir you must apologise to mr dalton  it would be more handsome indeed it would be only just and a free acknowledgment would go far    richard paused no language appearing delicate enough to suit the case  that is a suggestion which should have come from me sir roared the father  it is out of place upon your lips  it is not the thought of a loyal son  why sir if my father had been plunged in such deplorable circumstances i should have thrashed the editor of that vile sheet within an inch of his life  i should have thrashed the man sir  it would have been the action of an ass but it would have shown that i had the blood and the natural affections of a man  son you are no son no son of mine sir  sir said dick  ill tell you what you are sir pursued the squire youre a benthamite  i disown you  your mother would have died for shame there was no modern cant about your mother she thought  she said to me sir  im glad shes in her grave dick naseby  misinformed  misinformed sir  have you no loyalty no spring no natural affections  are you clockwork hey  away  this is no place for you  away waving his hands in the air  go away  leave me  at this moment dick beat a retreat in a disarray of nerves a whistling and clamour of his own arteries and in short in such a final bodily disorder as made him alike incapable of speech or hearing  and in the midst of all this turmoil a sense of unpardonable injustice remained graven in his memory     chapter iii  in the admirals name    there was no return to the subject  dick and his father were henceforth on terms of coldness  the upright old gentleman grew more upright when he met his son buckrammed with immortal anger he asked after dicks health and discussed the weather and the crops with an appalling courtesy his pronunciation was pointdevice his voice was distant distinct and sometimes almost trembling with suppressed indignation  as for dick it seemed to him as if his life had come abruptly to an end  he came out of his theories and clevernesses his premature manoftheworldness on which he had prided himself on his travels shrank like a thing ashamed before this real sorrow  pride wounded honour pity and respect tussled together daily in his heart and now he was within an ace of throwing himself upon his fathers mercy and now of slipping forth at night and coming back no more to naseby house  he suffered from the sight of his father nay even from the neighbourhood of this familiar valley where every corner had its legend and he was besieged with memories of childhood  if he fled into a new land and among none but strangers he might escape his destiny who knew and begin again lightheartedly  from that chief peak of the hills that now and then like an uplifted finger shone in an arrow of sunlight through the broken clouds the shepherd in clear weather might perceive the shining of the sea  there he thought was hope  but his heart failed him when he saw the squire and he remained his fate was not that of the voyager by sea and land he was to travel in the spirit and begin his journey sooner than he supposed  for it chanced one day that his walk led him into a portion of the uplands which was almost unknown to him  scrambling through some rough woods he came out upon a moorland reaching towards the hills  a few lofty scotch firs grew hard by upon a knoll a clear fountain near the foot of the knoll sent up a miniature streamlet which meandered in the heather  a shower had just skimmed by but now the sun shone brightly and the air smelt of the pines and the grass  on a stone under the trees sat a young lady sketching  we have learned to think of women in a sort of symbolic transfiguration based on clothes and one of the readiest ways in which we conceive our mistress is as a composite thing principally petticoats  but humanity has triumphed over clothes the look the touch of a dress has become alive and the woman who stitched herself into these material integuments has now permeated right through and gone out to the tip of her skirt  it was only a black dress that caught dick nasebys eye but it took possession of his mind and all other thoughts departed  he drew near and the girl turned round  her face startled him it was a face he wanted and he took it in at once like breathing air  i beg your pardon he said taking off his hat you are sketching  oh she exclaimed for my own amusement  i despise the thing  ten to one you do yourself injustice returned dick besides its a freemasonry  i sketch myself and you know what that implies  no  what she asked  two things he answered  first that i am no very difficult critic and second that i have a right to see your picture  she covered the block with both her hands  oh no she said i am ashamed  indeed i might give you a hint said dick  although no artist myself i have known many in paris i had many for friends and used to prowl among studios  in paris she cried with a leap of light into her eyes did you ever meet mr van tromp  i  yes  why youre not the admirals daughter are you  the admiral  do they call him that she cried  oh how nice how nice of them  it is the younger men who call him so is it not  yes said dick somewhat heavily  you can understand now she said with an unspeakable accent of contented nobleminded pride why it is i do not choose to show my sketch  van tromps daughter  the admirals daughter  i delight in that name  the admiral and so you know my father  well said dick i met him often we were even intimate he may have mentioned my name  naseby  he writes so little  he is so busy so devoted to his art i have had a half wish she added laughing that my father was a plainer man whom i could help  to whom i could be a credit but only sometimes you know and with only half my heart  for a great painter  you have seen his works  i have seen some of them returned dick they  they are very nice  she laughed aloud  nice she repeated  i see you dont care much for art  not much he admitted but i know that many people are glad to buy mr van tromps pictures  call him the admiral she cried  it sounds kindly and familiar and i like to think that he is appreciated and looked up to by young painters  he has not always been appreciated he had a cruel life for many years and when i think   there were tears in her eyes  when i think of that i feel incline to be a fool she broke off  and now i shall go home  you have filled me full of happiness for think mr naseby i have not seen my father since i was six years old and yet he is in my thoughts all day  you must come and call on me my aunt will be delighted i am sure and then you will tell me all  all about my father will you not  dick helped her to get her sketching traps together and when all was ready she gave dick her hand and a frank return of pressure  you are my fathers friend she said we shall be great friends too  you must come and see me soon  then she was gone down the hillside at a run and dick stood by himself in a state of some bewilderment and even distress there were elements of laughter in the business but the black dress and the face that belonged to it and the hand that he had held in his inclined him to a serious view what was he under the circumstances called upon to do perhaps to avoid the girl  well he would think about that perhaps to break the truth to her  why ten to one such was her infatuation he would fail  perhaps to keep up the illusion to colour the raw facts to help her to false ideas while yet not plainly stating falsehoods  well he would see about that he would also see about avoiding the girl  he saw about this last so well that the next afternoon beheld him on his way to visit her  in the meantime the girl had gone straight home light as a bird tremulous with joy to the little cottage where she lived alone with a maiden aunt and to that lady a grim sixty years old scotchwoman with a nodding head communicated news of her encounter and invitation  a friend of his cried the aunt  what like is he  what did ye say was his name  she was dead silent and stared at the old woman darkling then very slowly i said he was my fathers friend i have invited him to my house and come he shall she said and with that she walked off to her room where she sat staring at the wall all the evening  miss mglashan for that was the aunts name read a large bible in the kitchen with some of the joys of martyrdom  it was perhaps halfpast three when dick presented himself rather scrupulously dressed before the cottage door he knocked and a voice bade him enter  the kitchen which opened directly off the garden was somewhat darkened by foliage but he could see her as she approached from the far end to meet him  this second sight of her surprised him her strong black brows spoke of temper easily aroused and hard to quiet her mouth was small nervous and weak there was something dangerous and sulky underlying in her nature much that was honest compassionate and even noble  my fathers name she said has made you very welcome  and she gave him her hand with a sort of curtsy  it was a pretty greeting although somewhat mannered and dick felt himself among the gods  she led him through the kitchen to a parlour and presented him to miss mglashan  esther said the aunt see and make mr naseby his tea  and as soon as the girl was gone upon this hospitable intent the old woman crossed the room and came quite near to dick as if in menace  ye know that man she asked in an imperious whisper  mr van tromp said dick  yes i know him  well and what brings ye here she said  i couldnt save the mother  her thats dead  but the bairn  she had a note in her voice that filled poor dick with consternation man she went on what is it now  is it money  my dear lady said dick i think you misinterpret my position  i am young mr naseby of naseby house  my acquaintance with mr van tromp is really very slender i am only afraid that miss van tromp has exaggerated our intimacy in her own imagination  i know positively nothing of his private affairs and do not care to know  i met him casually in paris  that is all  miss mglashan drew along breath  in paris she said well and what do you think of him  what do ye think of him she repeated with a different scansion as richard who had not much taste for such a question kept her waiting for an answer  i found him a very agreeable companion he said  ay said she did ye  and how does he win his bread  i fancy he gasped that mr van tromp has many generous friends  ill warrant she sneered and before dick could find more to say she was gone from the room  esther returned with the teathings and sat down  now she said cosily tell me all about my father  he  stammered dick he is a very agreeable companion  i shall begin to think it is more than you are mr naseby she said with a laugh  i am his daughter you forget begin at the beginning and tell me all you have seen of him all he said and all you answered  you must have met somewhere begin with that  so with that he began how he had found the admiral painting in a cafe how his art so possessed him that he could not wait till he got home to  well to dash off his idea how this in reply to a question his idea consisted of a cock crowing and two hens eating corn how he was fond of cocks and hens how this did not lead him to neglect more ambitious forms of art how he had a picture in his studio of a greek subject which was said to be remarkable from several points of view how no one had seen it nor knew the precise site of the studio in which it was being vigorously though secretly confected how in answer to a suggestion this shyness was common to the admiral michelangelo and others how they dick and van tromp had struck up an acquaintance at once and dined together that same night how he the admiral had once given money to a beggar how he spoke with effusion of his little daughter how he had once borrowed money to send her a doll  a trait worthy of newton she being then in her nineteenth year at least how if the doll never arrived which it appeared it never did the trait was only more characteristic of the highest order of creative intellect how he was  no not beautiful  striking yes dick would go so far decidedly striking in appearance how his boots were made to lace and his coat was black not cutaway a frock and so on and so on by the yard  it was astonishing how few lies were necessary  after all people exaggerated the difficulty of life  a little steering just a touch of the rudder now and then and with a willing listener there is no limit to the domain of equivocal speech  sometimes miss mglashan made a freezing sojourn in the parlour and then the task seemed unaccountably more difficult but to esther who was all eyes and ears her face alight with interest his stream of language flowed without break or stumble and his mind was ever fertile in ingenious evasions and   what an afternoon it was for esther  ah she said at last its good to hear all this  my aunt you should know is narrow and too religious she cannot understand an artists life  it does not frighten me she added grandly i am an artists daughter  with that speech dick consoled himself for his imposture she was not deceived so grossly after all and then if a fraud was not the fraud piety itself  and what could be more obligatory than to keep alive in the heart of a daughter that filial trust and honour which even although misplaced became her like a jewel of the mind  there might be another thought a shade of cowardice a selfish desire to please poor dick was merely human and what would you have had him do    chapter iv  esther on the filial relation    a month later dick and esther met at the stile beside the cross roads had there been any one to see them but the birds and summer insects it would have been remarked that they met after a different fashion from the day before  dick took her in his arms and their lips were set together for a long while  then he held her at armslength and they looked straight into each others eyes  esther he said you should have heard his voice  dick said she  my darling  it was some time before they started for their walk he kept an arm about her and their sides were close together as they walked the sun the birds the west wind running among the trees a pressure a look the grasp tightening round a single finger these things stood them in lieu of thought and filled their hearts with joy  the path they were following led them through a wood of pinetrees carpeted with heather and blueberry and upon this pleasant carpet dick not without some seriousness made her sit down  esther he began there is something you ought to know you know my father is a rich man and you would think now that we love each other we might marry when we pleased  but i fear darling we may have long to wait and shall want all our courage  i have courage for anything she said i have all i want with you and my father i am so well off and waiting is made so happy that i could wait a lifetime and not weary  he had a sharp pang at the mention of the admiral  hear me out he continued  i ought to have told you this before but it is a thought i shrink from if it were possible i should not tell you even now  my poor father and i are scarce on speaking terms  your father she repeated turning pale  it must sound strange to you but yet i cannot think i am to blame he said  i will tell you how it happened  oh dick she said when she had heard him to an end how brave you are and how proud  yet i would not be proud with a father  i would tell him all  what cried dick go in months after and brag that i had meant to thrash the man and then didnt  and why  because my father had made a bigger ass of himself than i supposed my dear thats nonsense  she winced at his words and drew away  but when that is all he asks she pleaded  if he only knew that you had felt that impulse it would make him so proud and happy  he would see you were his own son after all and had the same thoughts and the same chivalry of spirit  and then you did yourself injustice when you spoke just now  it was because the editor was weak and poor and excused himself that you repented your first determination  had he been a big red man with whiskers you would have beaten him  you know you would  if mr naseby had been ten times more committed  do you think if you can tell it to me and i understand at once that it would be more difficult to tell it to your own father or that he would not be more ready to sympathise with you than i am  and i love you dick but then he is your father  my dear said dick desperately you do not understand you do not know what it is to be treated with daily want of comprehension and daily small injustices through childhood and boyhood and manhood until you despair of a hearing until the thing rides you like a nightmare until you almost hate the sight of the man you love and whos your father after all  in short esther you dont know what it is to have a father and thats what blinds you  i see she said musingly you mean that i am fortunate in my father  but i am not so fortunate after all you forget i do not know him it is you who know him he is already more your father than mine  and here she took his hand  dicks heart had grown as cold as ice  but i am sorry for you too she continued it must be very sad and lonely  you misunderstand me said dick chokingly  my father is the best man i know in all this world he is worth a hundred of me only he doesnt understand me and he cant be made to  there was a silence for a while  dick she began again i am going to ask a favour its the first since you said you loved me  may i see your father  see him pass i mean where he will not observe me  why asked dick  it is a fancy you forget i am romantic about fathers  the hint was enough for dick he consented with haste and full of hangdog penitence and disgust took her down by a backway and planted her in the shrubbery whence she might see the squire ride by to dinner  there they both sat silent but holding hands for nearly half an hour  at last the trotting of a horse sounded in the distance the park gates opened with a clang and then mr naseby appeared with stooping shoulders and a heavy bilious countenance languidly rising to the trot  esther recognised him at once she had often seen him before though with her huge indifference for all that lay outside the circle of her love she had never so much as wondered who he was but now she recognised him and found him ten years older leaden and springless and stamped by an abiding sorrow  oh dick dick she said and the tears began to shine upon her face as she hid it in his bosom his own fell thickly too  they had a sad walk home and that night full of love and good counsel dick exerted every art to please his father to convince him of his respect and affection to heal up this breach of kindness and reunite two hearts  but alas the squire was sick and peevish he had been all day glooming over dicks estrangement  for so he put it to himself and now with growls cold words and the cold shoulder he beat off all advances and entrenched himself in a just resentment    chapter v  the prodigal father makes his debut at home    that took place upon a tuesday  on the thursday following as dick was walking by appointment earlier than usual in the direction of the cottage he was appalled to meet in the lane a fly from thymebury containing the human form of miss mglashan  the lady did not deign to remark him in her passage her face was suffused with tears and expressed much concern for the packages by which she was surrounded  he stood still and asked himself what this circumstance might portend  it was so beautiful a day that he was loth to forecast evil yet something must perforce have happened at the cottage and that of a decisive nature for here was miss mglashan on her travels with a small patrimony in brown paper parcels and the old ladys bearing implied hot battle and unqualified defeat  was the house to be closed against him  was esther left alone or had some new protector made his appearance from among the millions of europe  it is the character of love to loathe the near relatives of the loved one chapters in the history of the human race have justified this feeling and the conduct of uncles in particular has frequently met with censure from the independent novelist miss mglashan was now seen in the rosy colours of regret whoever succeeded her dick felt the change would be for the worse  he hurried forward in this spirit his anxiety grew upon him with every step as he entered the garden a voice fell upon his ear and he was once more arrested not this time by doubt but by indubitable certainty of ill  the thunderbolt had fallen the admiral was here  dick would have retreated in the panic terror of the moment but esther kept a bright lookout when her lover was expected  in a twinkling she was by his side brimful of news and pleasure too glad to notice his embarrassment and in one of those golden transports of exultation which transcend not only words but caresses  she took him by the end of the fingers reaching forward to take them for her great preoccupation was to save time she drew him towards her pushed him past her in the door and planted him face to face with mr van tromp in a suit of french country velveteens and with a remarkable carbuncle on his nose then as though this was the end of what she could endure in the way of joy esther turned and ran out of the room  the two men remained looking at each other with some confusion on both sides  van tromp was naturally the first to recover he put out his hand with a fine gesture  and you know my little lass my esther he said  this is pleasant this is what i have conceived of home  a strange word for the old rover but we all have a taste for home and the homelike disguise it how we may  it has brought me here mr naseby he concluded with an intonation that would have made his fortune on the stage so just so sad so dignified so like a man of the world and a philosopher and you see a man who is content  i see said dick  sit down continued the parasite setting the example fortune has gone against me  i am just sirrupping a little brandy  after my journey  i was going down mr naseby between you and me i was decave i borrowed fifty francs smuggled my valise past the concierge  a work of considerable tact  and here i am  yes said dick and here you are  he was quite idiotic  esther at this moment reentered the room  are you glad to see him she whispered in his ear the pleasure in her voice almost bursting through the whisper into song  oh yes said dick very  i knew you would be she replied i told him how you loved him  help yourself said the admiral help yourself and let us drink to a new existence  to a new existence repeated dick and he raised the tumbler to his lips but set it down untasted  he had had enough of novelties for one day  esther was sitting on a stool beside her fathers feet holding her knees in her arms and looking with pride from one to the other of her two visitors  her eyes were so bright that you were never sure if there were tears in them or not little voluptuous shivers ran about her body sometimes she nestled her chin into her throat sometimes threw back her head with ecstasy in a word she was in that state when it is said of people that they cannot contain themselves for happiness  it would be hard to exaggerate the agony of richard  and in the meantime van tromp ran on interminably  i never forget a friend said he nor yet an enemy of the latter i never had but two  myself and the public and i fancy i have had my vengeance pretty freely out of both  he chuckled  but those days are done  van tromp is no more he was a man who had successes i believe you knew i had successes  to which we shall refer no farther pulling down his neckcloth with a smile  that man exists no more by an exercise of will i have destroyed him  there is something like it in the poets  first a brilliant and conspicuous career  the observed i may say of all observers including the bumbailie and then presto a quiet sly old rustic bonhomme cultivating roses  in paris mr naseby    call him richard father said esther  richard if he will allow me  indeed we are old friends and now near neighbours and a propos how are we off for neighbours richard  the cottage stands i think upon your fathers land  a family which i respect  and the wood i understand is lord trevanions  not that i care i am an old bohemian  i have cut society with a cut direct i cut it when i was prosperous and now i reap my reward and can cut it with dignity in my declension  these are our little amours propres my daughter your father must respect himself  thank you yes just a leetle leetle tiny  thanks thanks you spoil me  but as i was saying richard or was about to say my daughter has been allowed to rust her aunt was a mere duenna hence in parenthesis richard her distrust of me my nature and that of the duenna are poles asunder  poles  but now that i am here now that i have given up the fight and live henceforth for one only of my works  i have the modesty to say it is my best  my daughter  well we shall put all that to rights  the neighbours richard  dick was understood to say that there were many good families in the vale of thyme  you shall introduce us said the admiral  dicks shirt was wet he made a lumbering excuse to go which esther explained to herself by a fear of intrusion and so set down to the merit side of dicks account while she proceeded to detain him  before our walk she cried  never  i must have my walk  let us all go said the admiral rising  you do not know that you are wanted she cried leaning on his shoulder with a caress  i might wish to speak to my old friend about my new father  but you shall come today you shall do all you want i have set my heart on spoiling you  i will just take one drop more said the admiral stooping to help himself to brandy  it is surprising how this journey has fatigued me  but i am growing old i am growing old i am growing old and  i regret to add  bald  he cocked a white wideawake coquettishly upon his head  the habit of the ladykiller clung to him and esther had already thrown on her hat and was ready while he was still studying the result in a mirror the carbuncle had somewhat painfully arrested his attention  we are papa now we must be respectable he said to dick in explanation of his dandyism and then he went to a bundle and chose himself a staff  where were the elegant canes of his parisian epoch  this was a support for age and designed for rustic scenes  dick began to see and appreciate the mans enjoyment in a new part when he saw how carefully he had made it up  he had invented a gait for this first country stroll with his daughter which was admirably in key he walked with fatigue he leaned upon the staff he looked round him with a sad smiling sympathy on all that he beheld he even asked the name of a plant and rallied himself gently for an old town bird ignorant of nature  this country life will make me young again he sighed  they reached the top of the hill towards the first hour of evening the sun was descending heaven the colour had all drawn into the west the hills were modelled in their least contour by the soft slanting shine and the wide moorlands veined with glens and hazelwoods ran west and north in a hazy glory of light then the painter wakened in van tromp  gad dick he cried what value  an ode in four hundred lines would not have seemed so touching to esther her eyes filled with happy tears yes here was the father of whom she had dreamed whom dick had described simple enthusiastic unworldly kind a painter at heart and a fine gentleman in manner  and just then the admiral perceived a house by the wayside and something depending over the house door which might be construed as a sign by the hopeful and thirsty  is that he asked pointing with his stick an inn  there was a marked change in his voice as though he attached importance to the inquiry esther listened hoping she should hear wit or wisdom  dick said it was  you know it inquired the admiral  i have passed it a hundred times but that is all replied dick  ah said van tromp with a smile and shaking his head you are not an old campaigner you have the world to learn now i you see find an inn so very near my own home and my first thought is my neighbours  i shall go forward and make my neighbours acquaintance no you neednt come i shall not be a moment  and he walked off briskly towards the inn leaving dick alone with esther on the road  dick she exclaimed i am so glad to get a word with you i am so happy i have such a thousand things to say and i want you to do me a favour  imagine he has come without a paintbox without an easel and i want him to have all  i want you to get them for me in thymebury  you saw this moment how his heart turned to painting  they cant live without it she added meaning perhaps van tromp and michel angelo  up to that moment she had observed nothing amiss in dicks behaviour  she was too happy to be curious and his silence in presence of the great and good being whom she called her father had seemed both natural and praiseworthy  but now that they were alone she became conscious of a barrier between her lover and herself and alarm sprang up in her heart  dick she cried you dont love me  i do that he said heartily  but you are unhappy you are strange you  you are not glad to see my father she concluded with a break in her voice  esther he said i tell you that i love you if you love me you know what that means and that all i wish is to see you happy  do you think i cannot enjoy your pleasures esther i do  if i am uneasy if i am alarmed if    oh believe me try and believe in me he cried giving up argument with perhaps a happy inspiration  but the girls suspicions were aroused and though she pressed the matter no farther indeed her father was already seen returning it by no means left her thoughts  at one moment she simply resented the selfishness of a man who had obtruded his dark looks and passionate language on her joy for there is nothing that a woman can less easily forgive than the language of a passion which even if only for the moment she does not share  at another she suspected him of jealousy against her father and for that although she could see excuses for it she yet despised him  and at least in one way or the other here was the dangerous beginning of a separation between two hearts  esther found herself at variance with her sweetest friend she could no longer look into his heart and find it written with the same language as her own she could no longer think of him as the sun which radiated happiness upon her life for she had turned to him once and he had breathed upon her black and chilly radiated blackness and frost  to put the whole matter in a word she was beginning although ever so slightly to fall out of love    chapter vi  the prodigal father goes on from strength to strength    we will not follow all the steps of the admirals return and installation but hurry forward towards the catastrophe merely chronicling by the way a few salient incidents wherein we must rely entirely upon the evidence of richard for esther to this day has never opened her mouth upon this trying passage of her life and as for the admiral  well that naval officer although still alive and now more suitably installed in a seaport town where he has a telescope and a flag in his front garden is incapable of throwing the slightest gleam of light upon the affair  often and often has he remarked to the present writer if i know what it was all about sir ill be   in short be what i hope he will not  and then he will look across at his daughters portrait a photograph shake his head with an amused appearance and mix himself another grog by way of consolation  once i heard him go farther and express his feelings with regard to esther in a single but eloquent word a minx sir he said not in anger rather in amusement and he cordially drank her health upon the back of it  his worst enemy must admit him to be a man without malice he never bore a grudge in his life lacking the necessary taste and industry of attention  yet it was during this obscure period that the drama was really performed and its scene was in the heart of esther shut away from all eyes  had this warm upright sullen girl been differently used by destiny had events come upon her even in a different succession for some things lead easily to others the whole course of this tale would have been changed and esther never would have run away  as it was through a series of acts and words of which we know but few and a series of thoughts which any one may imagine for himself she was awakened in four days from the dream of a life  the first tangible cause of disenchantment was when dick brought home a painters arsenal on friday evening  the admiral was in the chimneycorner once more sirrupping some brandy and water and esther sat at the table at work they both came forward to greet the new arrival and the girl relieving him of his monstrous burthen proceeded to display her offerings to her father  van tromps countenance fell several degrees he became quite querulous  god bless me he said and then i must really ask you not to interfere child in a tone of undisguised hostility  father she said forgive me i knew you had given up your art    oh yes cried the admiral ive done with it to the judgmentday  pardon me again she said firmly but i do not i cannot think that you are right in this  suppose the world is unjust suppose that no one understands you you have still a duty to yourself  and oh dont spoil the pleasure of your coming home to me show me that you can be my father and yet not neglect your destiny  i am not like some daughters i will not be jealous of your art and i will try to understand it  the situation was odiously farcical  richard groaned under it he longed to leap forward and denounce the humbug  and the humbug himself  do you fancy he was easier in his mind i am sure on the other hand that he was acutely miserable and he betrayed his sufferings by a perfectly silly and undignified access of temper during which he broke his pipe in several pieces threw his brandy and water in the fire and employed words which were very plain although the drift of them was somewhat vague  it was of very brief duration van tromp was himself again and in a most delightful humour within three minutes of the first explosion  i am an old fool he said frankly  i was spoiled when a child  as for you esther you take after your mother you have a morbid sense of duty particularly for others strive against it my dear  strive against it  and as for the pigments well ill use them some of these days and to show that im in earnest ill get dick here to prepare a canvas  dick was put to this menial task forthwith the admiral not even watching how he did but quite occupied with another grog and a pleasant vein of talk  a little after esther arose and making some pretext good or bad went off to bed  dick was left hobbled by the canvas and was subjected to van tromp for about an hour  the next day saturday it is believed that little intercourse took place between esther and her father but towards the afternoon dick met the latter returning from the direction of the inn where he had struck up quite a friendship with the landlord  dick wondered who paid for these excursions and at the thought that the reprobate must get his pocket money where he got his board and lodging from poor esthers generosity he had it almost in his heart to knock the old gentleman down  he on his part was full of airs and graces and geniality  dear dick he said taking his arm this is neighbourly of you it shows your tact to meet me when i had a wish for you i am in pleasant spirits and it is then that i desire a friend  i am glad to hear you are so happy retorted dick bitterly theres certainly not much to trouble you  no assented the admiral not much  i got out of it in time and here  well here everything pleases me  i am plain in my tastes  a propos you have never asked me how i liked my daughter  no said dick roundly i certainly have not  meaning you will not  and why dick  she is my daughter of course but then i am a man of the world and a man of taste and perfectly qualified to give an opinion with impartiality  yes dick with impartiality  frankly i am not disappointed in her  she has good looks she has them from her mother  so i may say i chose her looks  she is devoted quite devoted to me    she is the best woman in the world broke out dick  dick cried the admiral stopping short i have been expecting this  let us  let us go back to the trevanion arms and talk this matter out over a bottle  certainly not went dick  you have had far too much already  the parasite was on the point of resenting this but a look at dicks face and some recollection of the terms on which they had stood in paris came to the aid of his wisdom and restrained him  as you please he said although i dont know what you mean  nor care  but let us walk if you prefer it  you are still a young man when you are my age   but however to continue  you please me dick you have pleased me from the first and to say truth esther is a trifle fantastic and will be better when she is married  she has means of her own as of course you are aware  they come like the looks from her poor dear good creature of a mother  she was blessed in her mother  i mean she shall be blessed in her husband and you are the man dick you and not another this very night i will sound her affections  dick stood aghast  mr van tromp i implore you he said do what you please with yourself but for gods sake let your daughter alone  it is my duty replied the admiral and between ourselves you rogue my inclination too  i am as matchmaking as a dowager  it will be more discreet for you to stay away to night  farewell  you leave your case in good hands i have the tact of these little matters by heart it is not my first attempt  all arguments were in vain the old rascal stuck to his point nor did richard conceal from himself how seriously this might injure his prospects and he fought hard  once there came a glimmer of hope  the admiral again proposed an adjournment to the trevanion arms and when dick had once more refused it hung for a moment in the balance whether or not the old toper would return there by himself  had he done so of course dick could have taken to his heels and warned esther of what was coming and of how it had begun  but the admiral after a pause decided for the brandy at home and made off in that direction  we have no details of the sounding  next day the admiral was observed in the parish church very properly dressed  he found the places and joined in response and hymn as to the manner born and his appearance as he intended it should attracted some attention among the worshippers  old naseby for instance had observed him  there was a drunkenlooking blackguard opposite us in church he said to his son as they drove home do you know who he was  some fellow  van tromp i believe said dick  a foreigner too observed the squire  dick could not sufficiently congratulate himself on the escape he had effected  had the admiral met him with his father what would have been the result  and could such a catastrophe be long postponed  it seemed to him as if the storm were nearly ripe and it was so more nearly than he thought  he did not go to the cottage in the afternoon withheld by fear and shame but when dinner was over at naseby house and the squire had gone off into a comfortable doze dick slipped out of the room and ran across country in part to save time in part to save his own courage from growing cold for he now hated the notion of the cottage or the admiral and if he did not hate at least feared to think of esther  he had no clue to her reflections but he could not conceal from his own heart that he must have sunk in her esteem and the spectacle of her infatuation galled him like an insult  he knocked and was admitted  the room looked very much as on his last visit with esther at the table and van tromp beside the fire but the expression of the two faces told a very different story  the girl was paler than usual her eyes were dark the colour seemed to have faded from round about them and her swiftest glance was as intent as a stare  the appearance of the admiral on the other hand was rosy and flabby and moist his jowl hung over his shirt collar his smile was loose and wandering and he had so far relaxed the natural control of his eyes that one of them was aimed inward as if to watch the growth of the carbuncle  we are warned against bad judgments but the admiral was certainly not sober  he made no attempt to rise when richard entered but waved his pipe flightily in the air and gave a leer of welcome  esther took as little notice of him as might be  aha  dick cried the painter  ive been to church i have upon my word  and i saw you there though you didnt see me  and i saw a devilish pretty woman by gad  if it were not for this baldness and a kind of crapulous air i cant disguise from myself  if it werent for this and that and tother thing  i  ive forgot what i was saying  not that that matters ive heaps of things to say  im in a communicative vein tonight  ill let out all my cats even unto seventy times seven  im in what i call the stage and all i desire is a listener although he were deaf to be as happy as nebuchadnezzar  of the two hours which followed upon this it is unnecessary to give more than a sketch  the admiral was extremely silly now and then amusing and never really offensive  it was plain that he kept in view the presence of his daughter and chose subjects and a character of language that should not offend a lady  on almost any other occasion dick would have enjoyed the scene  van tromps egotism flown with drink struck a pitch above mere vanity  he became candid and explanatory sought to take his auditors entirely into his confidence and tell them his inmost conviction about himself  between his selfknowledge which was considerable and his vanity which was immense he had created a strange hybrid animal and called it by his own name  how he would plume his feathers over virtues which would have gladdened the heart of caesar or st paul and anon complete his own portrait with one of those touches of pitiless realism which the satirist so often seeks in vain  now theres dick he said hes shrewd he saw through me the first time we met and told me so  told me so to my face which i had the virtue to keep  i bear you no malice for it dick you were right i am a humbug  you may fancy how esther quailed at this new feature of the meeting between her two idols  and then again in a parenthesis  that said van tromp was when i had to paint those dirty daubs of mine  and a little further on laughingly said perhaps but yet with an air of truth  i never had the slightest hesitation in sponging upon any human creature  thereupon dick got up  i think perhaps he said we had better all be thinking of going to bed  and he smiled with a feeble and deprecatory smile  not at all cried the admiral i know a trick worth two of that  puss here indicating his daughter shall go to bed and you and i will keep it up till alls blue  thereupon esther arose in sullen glory  she had sat and listened for two mortal hours while her idol defiled himself and sneered away his godhead  one by one her illusions had departed  and now he wished to order her to bed in her own house now he called her puss now even as he uttered the words toppling on his chair he broke the stem of his tobaccopipe in three  never did the sheep turn upon her shearer with a more commanding front  her voice was calm her enunciation a little slow but perfectly distinct and she stood before him as she spoke in the simplest and most maidenly attitude  no she said mr naseby will have the goodness to go home at once and you will go to bed  the broken fragments of pipe fell from the admirals fingers he seemed by his countenance to have lived too long in a world unworthy of him but it is an odd circumstance he attempted no reply and sat thunderstruck with open mouth  dick she motioned sharply towards the door and he could only obey her  in the porch finding she was close behind him he ventured to pause and whisper you have done right  i have done as i pleased she said  can he paint  many people like his paintings returned dick in stifled tones i never did i never said i did he added fiercely defending himself before he was attacked  i ask you if he can paint  i will not be put off  can he paint she repeated  no said dick  does he even like it  not now i believe  and he is drunk  she leaned upon the word with hatred  he has been drinking  go she said and was turning to reenter the house when another thought arrested her  meet me tomorrow morning at the stile she said  i will replied dick  and then the door closed behind her and dick was alone in the darkness  there was still a chink of light above the sill a warm mild glow behind the window the roof of the cottage and some of the banks and hazels were defined in denser darkness against the sky but all else was formless breathless and noiseless like the pit  dick remained as she had left him standing squarely upon one foot and resting only on the toe of the other and as he stood he listened with his soul  the sound of a chair pushed sharply over the floor startled his heart into his mouth but the silence which had thus been disturbed settled back again at once upon the cottage and its vicinity  what took place during this interval is a secret from the world of men but when it was over the voice of esther spoke evenly and without interruption for perhaps half a minute and as soon as that ceased heavy and uncertain footfalls crossed the parlour and mounted lurching up the stairs  the girl had tamed her father van tromp had gone obediently to bed so much was obvious to the watcher in the road  and yet he still waited straining his ears and with terror and sickness at his heart for if esther had followed her father if she had even made one movement in this great conspiracy of men and nature to be still dick must have had instant knowledge of it from his station before the door and if she had not moved must she not have fainted or might she not be dead  he could hear the cottage clock deliberately measure out the seconds time stood still with him an almost superstitious terror took command of his faculties at last he could bear no more and springing through the little garden in two bounds he put his face against the window  the blind which had not been drawn fully down left an open chink about an inch in height along the bottom of the glass and the whole parlour was thus exposed to dicks investigation  esther sat upright at the table her head resting on her hand her eyes fixed upon the candle  her brows were slightly bent her mouth slightly open her whole attitude so still and settled that dick could hardly fancy that she breathed  she had not stirred at the sound of dicks arrival  soon after making a considerable disturbance amid the vast silence of the night the clock lifted up its voice whined for a while like a partridge and then eleven times hooted like a cuckoo  still esther continued immovable and gazed upon the candle midnight followed and then one of the morning and still she had not stirred nor had richard naseby dared to quit the window  and then about halfpast one the candle she had been thus intently watching flared up into a last blaze of paper and she leaped to her feet with an ejaculation looked about her once blew out the light turned round and was heard rapidly mounting the staircase in the dark  dick was left once more alone to darkness and to that dulled and dogged state of mind when a man thinks that misery must now have done her worst and is almost glad to think so  he turned and walked slowly towards the stile she had told him no hour and he was determined whenever she came that she should find him waiting  as he got there the day began to dawn and he leaned over a hurdle and beheld the shadows flee away  up went the sun at last out of a bank of clouds that were already disbanding in the east a herald wind had already sprung up to sweep the leafy earth and scatter the congregated dewdrops  alas thought dick naseby how can any other day come so distastefully to me  he still wanted his experience of the morrow    chapter vii  the elopement    it was probably on the stroke of ten and dick had been half asleep for some time against the bank when esther came up the road carrying a bundle  some kind of instinct or perhaps the distant light footfalls recalled him while she was still a good way off to the possession of his faculties and he half raised himself and blinked upon the world  it took him some time to recollect his thoughts  he had awakened with a certain blank and childish sense of pleasure like a man who had received a legacy overnight but this feeling gradually died away and was then suddenly and stunningly succeeded by a conviction of the truth  the whole story of the past night sprang into his mind with every detail as by an exercise of the direct and speedy sense of sight and he arose from the ditch and with rueful courage went to meet his love  she came up to him walking steady and fast her face still pale but to all appearance perfectly composed and she showed neither surprise relief nor pleasure at finding her lover on the spot  nor did she offer him her hand  here i am said he  yes she replied and then without a pause or any change of voice i want you to take me away she added  away he repeated  how  where  today she said  i do not care where it is but i want you to take me away  for how long  i do not understand gasped dick  i shall never come back here any more was all she answered  wild words uttered as these were with perfect quiet of manner and voice exercise a double influence on the hearers mind  dick was confounded he recovered from astonishment only to fall into doubt and alarm  he looked upon her frozen attitude so discouraging for a lover to behold and recoiled from the thoughts which it suggested  to me he asked  are you coming to me esther  i want you to take me away she repeated with weary impatience  take me away  take me away from here  the situation was not sufficiently defined  dick asked himself with concern whether she were altogether in her right wits  to take her away to marry her to work off his hands for her support dick was content to do all this yet he required some show of love upon her part  he was not one of those toughhided and smallhearted males who would marry their love at the point of the bayonet rather than not marry her at all  he desired that a woman should come to his arms with an attractive willingness if not with ardour  and esthers bearing was more that of despair than that of love it chilled him and taught him wisdom  dearest he urged tell me what you wish and you shall have it tell me your thoughts and then i can advise you but to go from here without a plan without forethought in the heat of a moment is madder than madness and can help nothing  i am not speaking like a man but i speak the truth and i tell you again the things absurd and wrong and hurtful  she looked at him with a lowering languid look of wrath  so you will not take me she said  well i will go alone  and she began to step forward on her way  but he threw himself before her  esther esther he cried  let me go  dont touch me  what right have you to interfere  who are you to touch me she flashed out shrill with anger  then being made bold by her violence he took her firmly almost roughly by the arm and held her while he spoke  you know well who i am and what i am and that i love you you say i will not help you but your heart knows the contrary  it is you who will not help me for you will not tell me what you want  you see  or you could see if you took the pains to look  how i have waited here all night to be ready at your service  i only asked information i only urged you to consider and i still urge and beg you to think better of your fancies  but if your mind is made up so be it i will beg no longer i give you my orders and i will not allow  not allow you to go hence alone  she looked at him for awhile with cold unkind scrutiny like one who tries the temper of a tool  well take me away then she said with a sigh  good said dick  come with me to the stables there we shall get the ponytrap and drive to the junction  tonight you shall be in london  i am yours so wholly that no words can make me more so and besides you know it and the words are needless  may god help me to be good to you esther  may god help me for i see that you will not  so without more speech they set out together and were already got some distance from the spot ere he observed that she was still carrying the handbag  she gave it up to him passively but when he offered her his arm merely shook her head and pursed up her lips  the sun shone clearly and pleasantly the wind was fresh and brisk upon their faces and smelt racily of woods and meadows  as they went down into the valley of the thyme the babble of the stream rose into the air like a perennial laughter  on the faraway hills sunburst and shadow raced along the slopes and leaped from peak to peak  earth air and water each seemed in better health and had more of the shrewd salt of life in them than upon ordinary mornings and from east to west from the lowest glen to the height of heaven from every look and touch and scent a human creature could gather the most encouraging intelligence as to the durability and spirit of the universe  through all this walked esther picking her small steps like a bird but silent and with a cloud under her thick eyebrows she seemed insensible not only of nature but of the presence of her companion  she was altogether engrossed in herself and looked neither to right nor to left but straight before her on the road  when they came to the bridge however she halted leaned on the parapet and stared for a moment at the clear brown pool and swift transient snowdrift of the rapids  i am going to drink she said and descended the winding footpath to the margin  there she drank greedily in her hands and washed her temples with water  the coolness seemed to break for an instant the spell that lay upon her for instead of hastening forward again in her dull indefatigable tramp she stood still where she was for near a minute looking straight before her  and dick from above on the bridge where he stood to watch her saw a strange equivocal smile dawn slowly on her face and pass away again at once and suddenly leaving her as grave as ever and the sense of distance which it is so cruel for a lover to endure pressed with every moment more heavily on her companion  her thoughts were all secret her heart was locked and bolted and he stood without vainly wooing her with his eves  do you feel better asked dick as she at last rejoined him and after the constraint of so long a silence his voice sounded foreign to his own ears  she looked at him for an appreciable fraction of a minute ere she answered and when she did it was in the monosyllable  yes  dicks solicitude was nipped and frosted  his words died away on his tongue  even his eyes despairing of encouragement ceased to attend on hers  and they went on in silence through kirton hamlet where an old man followed them with his eyes and perhaps envied them their youth and love and across the ivy beck where the mill was splashing and grumbling low thunder to itself in the chequered shadow of the dell and the miller before the door was beating flour from his hands as he whistled a modulation and up by the high spinney whence they saw the mountains upon either hand and down the hill again to the back courts and offices of naseby house  esther had kept ahead all the way and dick plodded obediently in her wake but as they neared the stables he pushed on and took the lead  he would have preferred her to await him in the road while he went on and brought the carriage back but after so many repulses and rebuffs he lacked courage to offer the suggestion  perhaps too he felt it wiser to keep his convoy within sight  so they entered the yard in indian file like a tramp and his wife  the grooms eyebrows rose as he received the order for the ponyphaeton and kept rising during all his preparations esther stood bolt upright and looked steadily at some chickens in the corner of the yard  master richard himself thought the groom was not in his ordinary for in truth he carried the handbag like a talisman and either stood listless or set off suddenly walking in one direction after another with brisk decisive footsteps  moreover he had apparently neglected to wash his hands and bore the air of one returning from a prolonged nutting ramble  upon the grooms countenance there began to grow up an expression as of one about to whistle  and hardly had the carriage turned the corner and rattled into the high road with this inexplicable pair than the whistle broke forth  prolonged and low and tremulous and the groom already so far relieved vented the rest of his surprise in one simple english word friendly to the mouth of jacktar and the sooty pitman and hurried to spread the news round the servants hall of naseby house  luncheon would be on the table in little beyond an hour and the squire on sitting down would hardly fail to ask for master richard  hence as the intelligent reader can foresee this groom has a part to play in the imbroglio  meantime dick had been thinking deeply and bitterly  it seemed to him as if his love had gone from him indeed yet gone but a little way as if he needed but to find the right touch or intonation and her heart would recognise him and be melted  yet he durst not open his mouth and drove in silence till they had passed the main parkgates and turned into the crosscut lane along the wall  then it seemed to him as if it must be now or never  cant you see you are killing me he cried  speak to me look at me treat me like a human man  she turned slowly and looked him in the face with eyes that seemed kinder  he dropped the reins and caught her hand and she made no resistance although her touch was unresponsive but when throwing one arm round her waist he sought to kiss her lips not like a lover indeed not because he wanted to do so but as a desperate man who puts his fortunes to the touch she drew away from him with a knot in her forehead backed and shied about fiercely with her head and pushed him from her with her hand  then there was no room left for doubt and dick saw as clear as sunlight that she had a distaste or nourished a grudge against him  then you dont love me he said drawing back from her he also as though her touch had burnt him and then as she made no answer he repeated with another intonation imperious and yet still pathetic you dont love me do you do you  i dont know she replied  why do you ask me  oh how should i know  it has all been lies together  lies and lies and lies  he cried her name sharply like a man who has taken a physical hurt and that was the last word that either of them spoke until they reached thymebury junction  this was a station isolated in the midst of moorlands yet lying on the great up line to london  the nearest town thymebury itself was seven miles distant along the branch they call the vale of thyme railway  it was now nearly half an hour past noon the down train had just gone by and there would be no more traffic at the junction until halfpast three when the local train comes in to meet the up express at a quarter before four  the stationmaster had already gone off to his garden which was half a mile away in a hollow of the moor a porter who was just leaving took charge of the phaeton and promised to return it before night to naseby house only a deaf snuffy and stern old man remained to play propriety for dick and esther  before the phaeton had driven off the girl had entered the station and seated herself upon a bench  the endless empty moorlands stretched before her entirely unenclosed and with no boundary but the horizon  two lines of rails a waggon shed and a few telegraph posts alone diversified the outlook  as for sounds the silence was unbroken save by the chant of the telegraph wires and the crying of the plovers on the waste  with the approach of midday the wind had more and more fallen it was now sweltering hot and the air trembled in the sunshine  dick paused for an instant on the threshold of the platform then in two steps he was by her side and speaking almost with a sob  esther he said have pity on me  what have i done  can you not forgive me  esther you loved me once  can you not love me still  how can i tell you  how am i to know she answered  you are all a lie to me  all a lie from first to last  you were laughing at my folly playing with me like a child at the very time when you declared you loved me  which was true was any of it true or was it all all a mockery  i am weary trying to find out  and you say i loved you i loved my fathers friend  i never loved i never heard of you until that man came home and i began to find myself deceived  give me back my father be what you were before and you may talk of love indeed  then you cannot forgive me  cannot he asked  i have nothing to forgive she answered  you do not understand  is that your last word esther said he very white and biting his lip to keep it still  yes that is my last word replied she  then we are here on false pretences and we stay here no longer he said  had you still loved me right or wrong i should have taken you away because then i could have made you happy  but as it is  i must speak plainly  what you propose is degrading to you and an insult to me and a rank unkindness to your father  your father may be this or that but you should use him like a fellowcreature  what do you mean she flashed  i leave him my house and all my money it is more than he deserves  i wonder you dare speak to me about that man  and besides it is all he cares for let him take it and let me never hear from him again  i thought you romantic about fathers he said  is that a taunt she demanded  no he replied it is an argument  no one can make you like him but dont disgrace him in his own eyes  he is old esther old and broken down  even i am sorry for him and he has been the loss of all i cared for  write to your aunt when i see her answer you can leave quietly and naturally and i will take you to your aunts door  but in the meantime you must go home  you have no money and so you are helpless and must do as i tell you and believe me esther i do all for your good and your good only so god help me  she had put her hand into her pocket and withdrawn it empty  i counted upon you she wailed  you counted rightly then he retorted  i will not to please you for a moment make both of us unhappy for our lives and since i cannot marry you we have only been too long away and must go home at once  dick she cried suddenly perhaps i might  perhaps in time  perhaps    there is no perhaps about the matter interrupted dick  i must go and bring the phaeton  and with that he strode from the station all in a glow of passion and virtue  esther whose eyes had come alive and her cheeks flushed during these last words relapsed in a second into a state of petrifaction  she remained without motion during his absence and when he returned suffered herself to be put back into the phaeton and driven off on the return journey like an idiot or a tired child  compared with what she was now her condition of the morning seemed positively natural  she sat white and cold and silent and there was no speculation in her eyes  poor dick flailed and flailed at the pony and once tried to whistle but his courage was going down huge clouds of despair gathered together in his soul and from time to time their darkness was divided by a piercing flash of longing and regret  he had lost his love  he had lost his love for good  the pony was tired and the hills very long and steep and the air sultrier than ever for now the breeze began to fail entirely  it seemed as if this miserable drive would never be done as if poor dick would never be able to go away and be comfortably wretched by himself for all his desire was to escape from her presence and the reproach of her averted looks  he had lost his love he thought  he had lost his love for good  they were already not far from the cottage when his heart again faltered and he appealed to her once more speaking low and eagerly in broken phrases  i cannot live without your love he concluded  i do not understand what you mean she replied and i believe with perfect truth  then said he wounded to the quick your aunt might come and fetch you herself  of course you can command me as you please  but i think it would be better so  oh yes she said wearily better so  this was the only exchange of words between them till about four oclock the phaeton mounting the lane opened out the cottage between the leafy banks  thin smoke went straight up from the chimney the flowers in the garden the hawthorn in the lane hung down their heads in the heat the stillness was broken only by the sound of hoofs  for right before the gate a livery servant rode slowly up and down leading a saddle horse  and in this last dick shuddered to identify his fathers chestnut  alas poor richard what should this portend  the servant as in duty bound dismounted and took the phaeton into his keeping yet dick thought he touched his hat to him with something of a grin  esther passive as ever was helped out and crossed the garden with a slow and mechanical gait and dick following close behind her heard from within the cottage his fathers voice upraised in an anathema and the shriller tones of the admiral responding in the key of war    chapter viii  battle royal    squire naseby on sitting down to lunch had inquired for dick whom he had not seen since the day before at dinner and the servant answering awkwardly that master richard had come back but had gone out again with the pony phaeton his suspicions became aroused and he crossquestioned the man until the whole was out  it appeared from this report that dick had been going about for nearly a month with a girl in the vale  a miss van tromp that she lived near lord trevanions upper wood that recently miss van tromps papa had returned home from foreign parts after a prolonged absence that this papa was an old gentleman very chatty and free with his money in the publichouse  whereupon mr nasebys face became encrimsoned that the papa furthermore was said to be an admiral  whereupon mr naseby spat out a whistle brief and fierce as an oath that master dick seemed very friendly with the papa  god help him said mr naseby that last night master dick had not come in and to day he had driven away in the phaeton with the young lady   young woman corrected mr naseby  yes sir said the man who had been unwilling enough to gossip from the first and was now cowed by the effect of his communications on the master  young woman sir  had they luggage demanded the squire  yes sir  mr naseby was silent for a moment struggling to keep down his emotion and he mastered it so far as to mount into the sarcastic vein when he was in the nearest danger of melting into the sorrowful  and was this  this van dunk with them he asked dwelling scornfully upon the name  the servant believed not and being eager to shift the responsibility of speech to other shoulders suggested that perhaps the master had better inquire further from george the stableman in person  tell him to saddle the chestnut and come with me  he can take the gray gelding for we may ride fast  and then you can take away this trash added mr naseby pointing to the luncheon and he arose lordly in his anger and marched forth upon the terrace to await his horse  there dicks old nurse shrunk up to him for the news went like wildfire over naseby house and timidly expressed a hope that there was nothing much amiss with the young master  ill pull him through the squire said grimly as though he meant to pull him through a threshingmill ill save him from this gang god help him with the next  he has a taste for low company and no natural affections to steady him his father was no society for him he must go fuddling with a dutchman nance and now hes caught  let us pray hell take the lesson he added more gravely but youth is here to make troubles and age to pull them out again  nance whimpered and recalled several episodes of dicks childhood which moved mr naseby to blow his nose and shake her hard by the hand and then the horse arriving opportunely to get himself without delay into the saddle and canter off  he rode straight hot spur to thymebury where as was to be expected he could glean no tidings of the runaways  they had not been seen at the george they had not been seen at the station  the shadow darkened on mr nasebys face the junction did not occur to him his last hope was for van tromps cottage thither he bade george guide him and thither he followed nursing grief anxiety and indignation in his heart  here it is sir said george stopping  what on my own land he cried  hows this  i let this place to somebody  mwhirter or mglashan  miss mglashan was the young ladys aunt sir i believe returned george  ay  dummies said the squire  i shall whistle for my rent too  here take my horse  the admiral this hot afternoon was sitting by the window with a long glass  he already knew the squire by sight and now seeing him dismount before the cottage and come striding through the garden concluded without doubt he was there to ask for esthers hand  this is why the girl is not yet home he thought a very suitable delicacy on young nasebys part  and he composed himself with some pomp answered the loud rattle of the ridingwhip upon the door with a dulcet invitation to enter and coming forward with a bow and a smile mr naseby i believe said he  the squire came armed for battle took in his man from top to toe in one rapid and scornful glance and decided on a course at once  he must let the fellow see that he understood him  you are mr van tromp he returned roughly and without taking any notice of the proffered hand  the same sir replied the admiral  pray be seated  no sir said the squire pointblank i will not be seated  i am told that you are an admiral he added  no sir i am not an admiral returned van tromp who now began to grow nettled and enter into the spirit of the interview  then why do you call yourself one sir  i have to ask your pardon i do not says van tromp as grand as the pope  but nothing was of avail against the squire  you sail under false colours from beginning to end he said  your very house was taken under a sham name  it is not my house  i am my daughters guest replied the admiral  if it were my house    well said the squire what then hey  the admiral looked at him nobly but was silent  look here said mr naseby this intimidation is a waste of time it is thrown away on me sir it will not succeed with me  i will not permit you even to gain time by your fencing  now sir i presume you understand what brings me here  i am entirely at a loss to account for your intrusion bows and waves van tromp  i will try to tell you then  i come here as a father  down came the ridingwhip upon the table  i have right and justice upon my side  i understand your calculations but you calculated without me  i am a man of the world and i see through you and your manoeuvres  i am dealing now with a conspiracy  i stigmatise it as such and i will expose it and crush it  and now i order you to tell me how far things have gone and whither you have smuggled my unhappy son  my god sir van tromp broke out i have had about enough of this  your son  god knows where he is for me  what the devil have i to do with your son  my daughter is out for the matter of that i might ask you where she was and what would you say to that  but this is all midsummer madness name your business distinctly and be off  how often am i to tell you cried the squire  where did your daughter take my son today in that cursed pony carriage  in a pony carriage repeated van tromp  yes sir  with luggage  luggage  van tromp had turned a little pale  luggage i said  luggage shouted naseby  you may spare me this dissimulation  wheres my son  you are speaking to a father sir a father  but sir if this be true out came van tromp in a new key it is i who have an explanation to demand  precisely  there is the conspiracy retorted naseby oh he added i am a man of the world  i can see through and through you  van tromp began to understand  you speak a great deal about being a father mr naseby said he i believe you forget that the appellation is common to both of us  i am at a loss to figure to myself however dimly how any man  i have not said any gentleman  could so brazenly insult another as you have been insulting me since you entered this house  for the first time i appreciate your base insinuations and i despise them and you  you were i am told a manufacturer i am an artist i have seen better days i have moved in societies where you would not be received and dined where you would be glad to pay a pound to see me dining  the socalled aristocracy of wealth sir i despise  i refuse to help you i refuse to be helped by you there lies the door  and the admiral stood forth in a halo  it was then that dick entered  he had been waiting in the porch for some time back and esther had been listlessly standing by his side  he had put out his hand to bar her entrance and she had submitted without surprise and though she seemed to listen she scarcely appeared to comprehend dick on his part was as white as a sheet his eyes burned and his lips trembled with anger as he thrust the door suddenly open introduced esther with ceremonious gallantry and stood forward and knocked his hat firmer on his head like a man about to leap  what is all this he demanded  is this your father mr naseby inquired the admiral  it is said the young man  i make you my compliments returned van tromp  dick cried his father suddenly breaking forth it is not too late is it  i have come here in time to save you come come away with me  come away from this place  and he fawned upon dick with his hands  keep your hands off me cried dick not meaning unkindness but because his nerves were shattered by so many successive miseries  no no said the old man dont repulse your father dick when he has come here to save you  dont repulse me my boy perhaps i have not been kind to you not quite considerate too harsh my boy it was not for want of love  think of old times  i was kind to you then was i not  when you were a child and your mother was with us  mr naseby was interrupted by a sort of sob  dick stood looking at him in a maze  come away pursued the father in a whisper you need not be afraid of any consequences  i am a man of the world dick and she can have no claim on you  no claim i tell you and well be handsome too dick  well give them a good round figure father and daughter and theres an end  he had been trying to get dick towards the door but the latter stood off  you had better take care sir how you insult that lady said the son as black as night  you would not choose between your father and your mistress said the father  what do you call her sir cried dick high and clear  forbearance and patience were not among mr nasebys qualities  i called her your mistress he shouted and i might have called her a    that is an unmanly lie replied dick slowly  dick cried the father dick  i do not care said the son strengthening himself against his own heart i  i have said it and it is the truth  there was a pause  dick said the old man at last in a voice that was shaken as by a gale of wind i am going  i leave you with your friends sir  with your friends  i came to serve you and now i go away a broken man  for years i have seen this coming and now it has come  you never loved me  now you have been the death of me  you may boast of that  now i leave you  god pardon you  with that he was gone and the three who remained together heard his horses hoofs descend the lane  esther had not made a sign throughout the interview and still kept silence now that it was over but the admiral who had once or twice moved forward and drawn back again now advanced for good  you are a man of spirit sir said he to dick but though i am no friend to parental interference i will say that you were heavy on the governor  then he added with a chuckle you began richard with a silver spoon and here you are in the water like the rest  work work nothing like work  you have parts you have manners why with application you may die a millionaire  dick shook himself  he took esther by the hand looking at her mournfully  then this is farewell he said  yes she answered  there was no tone in her voice and she did not return his gaze  for ever added dick  for ever she repeated mechanically  i have had hard measure he continued  in time i believe i could have shown you i was worthy and there was no time long enough to show how much i loved you  but it was not to be  i have lost all  he relinquished her hand still looking at her and she turned to leave the room  why what in fortunes name is the meaning of all this cried van tromp  esther come back  let her go said dick and he watched her disappear with strangely mingled feelings  for he had fallen into that stage when men have the vertigo of misfortune court the strokes of destiny and rush towards anything decisive that it may free them from suspense though at the cost of ruin it is one of the many minor forms of suicide  she did not love me he said turning to her father  i feared as much said he when i sounded her  poor dick poor dick  and yet i believe i am as much cut up as you are i was born to see others happy  you forget returned dick with something like a sneer that i am now a pauper  van tromp snapped his fingers  tut said he esther has plenty for us all  dick looked at him with some wonder  it had never dawned upon him that this shiftless thriftless worthless sponging parasite was yet after and in spite of all not mercenary in the issue of his thoughts yet so it was  now said dick i must go  go cried van tromp  where  not one foot mr richard naseby  here you shall stay in the meantime and  well and do something practical  advertise for a situation as private secretary  and when you have it go and welcome  but in the meantime sir no false pride we must stay with our friends we must sponge a while on papa van tromp who has sponged so often upon us  by god cried dick i believe you are the best of the lot  dick my boy replied the admiral winking you mark me i am not the worst  then why began dick and then paused  but esther he began again once more to interrupt himself  the fact is admiral he came out with it roundly now your daughter wished to run away from you today and i only brought her back with difficulty  in the pony carriage asked the admiral with the silliness of extreme surprise  yes dick answered  why what the devil was she running away from  dick found the question unusually hard to answer  why said he you know youre a bit of a rip  i behave to that girl sir like an archdeacon replied van tromp warmly  well  excuse me  but you know you drink insisted dick  i know that i was a sheet in the winds eye sir once  once only since i reached this place retorted the admiral and even then i was fit for any drawingroom  i should like you to tell me how many fathers lay and clerical go upstairs every day with a face like a lobster and cods eyes  and are dull upon the back of it  not even mirth for the money  no if thats what she runs for all i say is let her run  you see dick tried it again she has fancies    confound her fancies cried van tromp  i used her kindly she had her own way i was her father  besides i had taken quite a liking to the girl and meant to stay with her for good  but i tell you what it is dick since she has trifled with you  oh yes she did though  and since her old papas not good enough for her  the devil take her say i  you will be kind to her at least said dick  i never was unkind to a living soul replied the admiral firm i can be but not unkind  well said dick offering his hand god bless you and farewell  the admiral swore by all his gods he should not go  dick he said you are a selfish dog you forget your old admiral you wouldnt leave him alone would you  it was useless to remind him that the house was not his to dispose of that being a class of considerations to which his intelligence was closed so dick tore himself off by force and shouting a goodbye made off along the lane to thymebury     chapter ix  in which the liberal editor reappears as deus ex machina    it was perhaps a week later as old mr naseby sat brooding in his study that there was shown in upon him on urgent business a little hectic gentleman shabbily attired  i have to ask pardon for this intrusion mr naseby he said but i come here to perform a duty  my card has been sent in but perhaps you may not know what it does not tell you that i am the editor of the thymebury star  mr naseby looked up indignant  i cannot fancy he said that we have much in common to discuss  i have only a word to say  one piece of information to communicate  some months ago we had  you will pardon my referring to it it is absolutely necessary  but we had an unfortunate difference as to facts  have you come to apologise asked the squire sternly  no sir to mention a circumstance  on the morning in question your son mr richard naseby    i do not permit his name to be mentioned  you will however permit me replied the editor  you are cruel said the squire  he was right he was a broken man  then the editor described dicks warning visit and how he had seen in the lads eye that there was a thrashing in the wind and had escaped through pity only  so the editor put it  through pity only sir  and oh sir he went on if you had seen him speaking up for you i am sure you would have been proud of your son  i know i admired the lad myself and indeed thats what brings me here  i have misjudged him said the squire  do you know where he is  yes sir he lies sick at thymebury  you can take me to him  i can  i pray god he may forgive me said the father  and he and the editor made posthaste for the country town  next day the report went abroad that mr richard was reconciled to his father and had been taken home to naseby house  he was still ailing it was said and the squire nursed him like the proverbial woman  rumour in this instance did no more than justice to the truth and over the sickbed many confidences were exchanged and clouds that had been growing for years passed away in a few hours and as fond mankind loves to hope for ever  many long talks had been fruitless in external action though fruitful for the understanding of the pair but at last one showery tuesday the squire might have been observed upon his way to the cottage in the lane  the old gentleman had arranged his features with a view to selfcommand rather than external cheerfulness and he entered the cottage on his visit of conciliation with the bearing of a clergyman come to announce a death  the admiral and his daughter were both within and both looked upon their visitor with more surprise than favour  sir said he to van tromp i am told i have done you much injustice  there came a little sound in esthers throat and she put her hand suddenly to her heart  you have sir and the acknowledgment suffices replied the admiral  i am prepared sir to be easy with you since i hear you have made it up with my friend dick  but let me remind you that you owe some apologies to this young lady also  i shall have the temerity to ask for more than her forgiveness said the squire  miss van tromp he continued once i was in great distress and knew nothing of you or your character but i believe you will pardon a few rough words to an old man who asks forgiveness from his heart  i have heard much of you since then for you have a fervent advocate in my house  i believe you will understand that i speak of my son  he is i regret to say very far from well he does not pick up as the doctors had expected he has a great deal upon his mind and to tell you the truth my girl if you wont help us i am afraid i shall lose him  come now forgive him  i was angry with him once myself and i found i was in the wrong  this is only a misunderstanding like the other believe me and with one kind movement you may give happiness to him and to me and to yourself  esther made a movement towards the door but long before she reached it she had broken forth sobbing  it is all right said the admiral i understand the sex let me make you my compliments mr naseby  the squire was too much relieved to be angry  my dear said he to esther you must not agitate yourself  she had better go up and see him right away suggested van tromp  i had not ventured to propose it replied the squire  les convenances i believe    je men fiche cried the admiral snapping his fingers she shall go and see my friend dick  run and get ready esther  esther obeyed  she has not  has not run away again inquired mr naseby as soon as she was gone  no said van tromp not again  she is a devilish odd girl though mind you that  but i cannot stomach the man with the carbuncles thought the squire  and this is why there is a new household and a brandnew baby in naseby dower house and why the great van tromp lives in pleasant style upon the shores of england and why twentysix individual copies of the thymebury star are received daily at the door of naseby house
