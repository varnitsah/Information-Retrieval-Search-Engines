79485270	right ho jeeves  by  p g wodehouse  1922       to  raymond needham kc  with affection and admiration     1   jeeves i said may i speak frankly  certainly sir  what i have to say may wound you  not at all sir  well then  nowait hold the line a minute ive gone off the rails   i dont know if you have had the same experience but the snag i always come up against when im telling a story is this dashed difficult problem of where to begin it its a thing you dont want to go wrong over because one false step and youre sunk i mean if you fool about too long at the start trying to establish atmosphere as they call it and all that sort of rot you fail to grip and the customers walk out on you  get off the mark on the other hand like a scalded cat and your public is at a loss it simply raises its eyebrows and cant make out what youre talking about  and in opening my report of the complex case of gussie finknottle madeline bassett my cousin angela my aunt dahlia my uncle thomas young tuppy glossop and the cook anatole with the above spot of dialogue i see that i have made the second of these two floaters  i shall have to hark back a bit and taking it for all in all and weighing this against that i suppose the affair may be said to have had its inception if inception is the word i want with that visit of mine to cannes if i hadnt gone to cannes i shouldnt have met the bassett or bought that white mess jacket and angela wouldnt have met her shark and aunt dahlia wouldnt have played baccarat  yes most decidedly cannes was the point dappui  right ho then let me marshal my facts  i went to cannesleaving jeeves behind he having intimated that he did not wish to miss ascotround about the beginning of june with me travelled my aunt dahlia and her daughter angela tuppy glossop angelas betrothed was to have been of the party but at the last moment couldnt get away uncle tom aunt dahlias husband remained at home because he cant stick the south of france at any price  so there you have the layoutaunt dahlia cousin angela and self off to cannes round about the beginning of june  all pretty clear so far what  we stayed at cannes about two months and except for the fact that aunt dahlia lost her shirt at baccarat and angela nearly got inhaled by a shark while aquaplaning a pleasant time was had by all  on july the twentyfifth looking bronzed and fit i accompanied aunt and child back to london at seven pm on july the twentysixth we alighted at victoria and at seventwenty or thereabouts we parted with mutual expressions of esteemthey to shove off in aunt dahlias car to brinkley court her place in worcestershire where they were expecting to entertain tuppy in a day or two i to go to the flat drop my luggage clean up a bit and put on the soup and fish preparatory to pushing round to the drones for a bite of dinner  and it was while i was at the flat towelling the torso after a muchneeded rinse that jeeves as we chatted of this and thatpicking up the threads as it weresuddenly brought the name of gussie finknottle into the conversation  as i recall it the dialogue ran something as follows  self well jeeves here we are what  jeeves yes sir  self i mean to say home again  jeeves precisely sir  self seems ages since i went away  jeeves yes sir  self have a good time at ascot  jeeves most agreeable sir  self win anything  jeeves quite a satisfactory sum thank you sir  self good well jeeves what news on the rialto anybody been phoning or calling or anything during my abs  jeeves mr finknottle sir has been a frequent caller  i stared indeed it would not be too much to say that i gaped  mr finknottle  yes sir  you dont mean mr finknottle  yes sir  but mr finknottles not in london  yes sir  well im blowed  and ill tell you why i was blowed i found it scarcely possible to give credence to his statement this finknottle you see was one of those freaks you come across from time to time during lifes journey who cant stand london he lived year in and year out covered with moss in a remote village down in lincolnshire never coming up even for the eton and harrow match and when i asked him once if he didnt find the time hang a bit heavy on his hands he said no because he had a pond in his garden and studied the habits of newts  i couldnt imagine what could have brought the chap up to the great city i would have been prepared to bet that as long as the supply of newts didnt give out nothing could have shifted him from that village of his  are you sure  yes sir  you got the name correctly finknottle  yes sir  well its the most extraordinary thing it must be five years since he was in london he makes no secret of the fact that the place gives him the pip until now he has always stayed glued to the country completely surrounded by newts  sir  newts jeeves mr finknottle has a strong newt complex you must have heard of newts those little sort of lizard things that charge about in ponds  oh yes sir the aquatic members of the family salamandridae which constitute the genus molge  thats right well gussie has always been a slave to them he used to keep them at school  i believe young gentlemen frequently do sir  he kept them in his study in a kind of glasstank arrangement and pretty niffy the whole thing was i recall i suppose one ought to have been able to see what the end would be even then but you know what boys are careless heedless busy about our own affairs we scarcely gave this kink in gussies character a thought we may have exchanged an occasional remark about it taking all sorts to make a world but nothing more you can guess the sequel the trouble spread  indeed sir  absolutely jeeves the craving grew upon him the newts got him arrived at mans estate he retired to the depths of the country and gave his life up to these dumb chums i suppose he used to tell himself that he could take them or leave them alone and then foundtoo latethat he couldnt  it is often the way sir  too true jeeves at any rate for the last five years he has been living at this place of his down in lincolnshire as confirmed a speciesshunning hermit as ever put fresh water in the tank every second day and refused to see a soul thats why i was so amazed when you told me he had suddenly risen to the surface like this i still cant believe it i am inclined to think that there must be some mistake and that this bird who has been calling here is some different variety of finknottle the chap i know wears hornrimmed spectacles and has a face like a fish how does that check up with your data  the gentleman who came to the flat wore hornrimmed spectacles sir  and looked like something on a slab  possibly there was a certain suggestion of the piscine sir  then it must be gussie i suppose but what on earth can have brought him up to london  i am in a position to explain that sir mr finknottle confided to me his motive in visiting the metropolis he came because the young lady is here  young lady  yes sir  you dont mean hes in love  yes sir  well im dashed im really dashed i positively am dashed jeeves  and i was too i mean to say a jokes a joke but there are limits  then i found my mind turning to another aspect of this rummy affair conceding the fact that gussie finknottle against all the ruling of the form book might have fallen in love why should he have been haunting my flat like this no doubt the occasion was one of those when a fellow needs a friend but i couldnt see what had made him pick on me  it wasnt as if he and i were in any way bosom we had seen a lot of each other at one time of course but in the last two years i hadnt had so much as a post card from him  i put all this to jeeves  odd his coming to me still if he did he did no argument about that it must have been a nasty jar for the poor perisher when he found i wasnt here  no sir mr finknottle did not call to see you sir  pull yourself together jeeves youve just told me that this is what he has been doing and assiduously at that  it was i with whom he was desirous of establishing communication sir  you but i didnt know you had ever met him  i had not had that pleasure until he called here sir but it appears that mr sipperley a fellow student of whom mr finknottle had been at the university recommended him to place his affairs in my hands  the mystery had conked i saw all as i dare say you know jeevess reputation as a counsellor has long been established among the cognoscenti and the first move of any of my little circle on discovering themselves in any form of soup is always to roll round and put the thing up to him and when hes got a out of a bad spot a puts b on to him and then when he has fixed up b b sends c along and so on if you get my drift and so forth  thats how these big consulting practices like jeevess grow old sippy i knew had been deeply impressed by the mans efforts on his behalf at the time when he was trying to get engaged to elizabeth moon so it was not to be wondered at that he should have advised gussie to apply pure routine you might say  oh youre acting for him are you  yes sir  now i follow now i understand and what is gussies trouble  oddly enough sir precisely the same as that of mr sipperley when i was enabled to be of assistance to him no doubt you recall mr sipperleys predicament sir deeply attached to miss moon he suffered from a rooted diffidence which made it impossible for him to speak  i nodded  i remember yes i recall the sipperley case he couldnt bring himself to the scratch a marked coldness of the feet was there not i recollect you saying he was lettingwhat was itletting something do something cats entered into it if i am not mistaken  letting i dare not wait upon i would sir  thats right but how about the cats  like the poor cat i the adage sir  exactly it beats me how you think up these things and gussie you say is in the same posish  yes sir each time he endeavours to formulate a proposal of marriage his courage fails him  and yet if he wants this female to be his wife hes got to say so what i mean only civil to mention it  precisely sir  i mused  well i suppose this was inevitable jeeves i wouldnt have thought that this finknottle would ever have fallen a victim to the divine p but if he has no wonder he finds the going sticky  yes sir  look at the life hes led  yes sir  i dont suppose he has spoken to a girl for years what a lesson this is to us jeeves not to shut ourselves up in country houses and stare into glass tanks you cant be the dominant male if you do that sort of thing in this life you can choose between two courses you can either shut yourself up in a country house and stare into tanks or you can be a dasher with the sex you cant do both  no sir  i mused once more gussie and i as i say had rather lost touch but all the same i was exercised about the poor fish as i am about all my pals close or distant who find themselves treading upon lifes banana skins it seemed to me that he was up against it  i threw my mind back to the last time i had seen him about two years ago it had been i had looked in at his place while on a motor trip and he had put me right off my feed by bringing a couple of green things with legs to the luncheon table crooning over them like a young mother and eventually losing one of them in the salad that picture rising before my eyes didnt give me much confidence in the unfortunate goofs ability to woo and win i must say especially if the girl he had earmarked was one of these tough modern thugs all lipstick and cool hard sardonic eyes as she probably was  tell me jeeves i said wishing to know the worst what sort of a girl is this girl of gussies  i have not met the young lady sir mr finknottle speaks highly of her attractions  seemed to like her did he  yes sir  did he mention her name perhaps i know her  she is a miss bassett sir miss madeline bassett  what  yes sir  i was deeply intrigued  egad jeeves fancy that its a small world isnt it what  the young lady is an acquaintance of yours sir  i know her well your news has relieved my mind jeeves it makes the whole thing begin to seem far more like a practical working proposition  indeed sir  absolutely i confess that until you supplied this information i was feeling profoundly dubious about poor old gussies chances of inducing any spinster of any parish to join him in the saunter down the aisle you will agree with me that he is not everybodys money  there may be something in what you say sir  cleopatra wouldnt have liked him  possibly not sir  and i doubt if he would go any too well with tallulah bankhead  no sir  but when you tell me that the object of his affections is miss bassett why then jeeves hope begins to dawn a bit hes just the sort of chap a girl like madeline bassett might scoop in with relish  this bassett i must explain had been a fellow visitor of ours at cannes and as she and angela had struck up one of those effervescent friendships which girls do strike up i had seen quite a bit of her indeed in my moodier moments it sometimes seemed to me that i could not move a step without stubbing my toe on the woman  and what made it all so painful and distressing was that the more we met the less did i seem able to find to say to her  you know how it is with some girls they seem to take the stuffing right out of you i mean to say there is something about their personality that paralyses the vocal cords and reduces the contents of the brain to cauliflower it was like that with this bassett and me so much so that i have known occasions when for minutes at a stretch bertram wooster might have been observed fumbling with the tie shuffling the feet and behaving in all other respects in her presence like the complete dumb brick when therefore she took her departure some two weeks before we did you may readily imagine that in bertrams opinion it was not a day too soon  it was not her beauty mark you that thus numbed me she was a pretty enough girl in a droopy blonde saucereyed way but not the sort of breathtaker that takes the breath  no what caused this disintegration in a usually fairly fluent prattler with the sex was her whole mental attitude i dont want to wrong anybody so i wont go so far as to say that she actually wrote poetry but her conversation to my mind was of a nature calculated to excite the liveliest suspicions well i mean to say when a girl suddenly asks you out of a blue sky if you dont sometimes feel that the stars are gods daisychain you begin to think a bit  as regards the fusing of her soul and mine therefore there was nothing doing but with gussie the posish was entirely different the thing that had stymied meviz that this girl was obviously all loaded down with ideals and sentiment and what notwas quite in order as far as he was concerned  gussie had always been one of those dreamy soulful birdsyou cant shut yourself up in the country and live only for newts if youre notand i could see no reason why if he could somehow be induced to get the low burning words off his chest he and the bassett shouldnt hit it off like ham and eggs  shes just the type for him i said  i am most gratified to hear it sir  and hes just the type for her in fine a good thing and one to be pushed along with the utmost energy strain every nerve jeeves  very good sir replied the honest fellow i will attend to the matter at once  now up to this point as you will doubtless agree what you might call a perfect harmony had prevailed friendly gossip between employer and employed and everything as sweet as a nut but at this juncture i regret to say there was an unpleasant switch the atmosphere suddenly changed the storm clouds began to gather and before we knew where we were the jarring note had come bounding on the scene i have known this to happen before in the wooster home  the first intimation i had that things were about to hot up was a pained and disapproving cough from the neighbourhood of the carpet for during the above exchanges i should explain while i having dried the frame had been dressing in a leisurely manner donning here a sock there a shoe and gradually climbing into the vest the shirt the tie and the kneelength jeeves had been down on the lower level unpacking my effects  he now rose holding a white object and at the sight of it i realized that another of our domestic crises had arrived another of those unfortunate clashes of will between two strong men and that bertram unless he remembered his fighting ancestors and stood up for his rights was about to be put upon  i dont know if you were at cannes this summer if you were you will recall that anybody with any pretensions to being the life and soul of the party was accustomed to attend binges at the casino in the ordinary eveningwear trouserings topped to the north by a white messjacket with brass buttons and ever since i had stepped aboard the blue train at cannes station i had been wondering on and off how mine would go with jeeves  in the matter of evening costume you see jeeves is hidebound and reactionary i had had trouble with him before about softbosomed shirts and while these messjackets had as i say been all the ragetout ce quil y a de chicon the côte dazur i had never concealed it from myself even when treading the measure at the palm beach casino in the one i had hastened to buy that there might be something of an upheaval about it on my return  i prepared to be firm  yes jeeves i said and though my voice was suave a close observer in a position to watch my eyes would have noticed a steely glint nobody has a greater respect for jeevess intellect than i have but this disposition of his to dictate to the hand that fed him had got i felt to be checked this messjacket was very near to my heart and i jolly well intended to fight for it with all the vim of grand old sieur de wooster at the battle of agincourt  yes jeeves i said something on your mind jeeves  i fear that you inadvertently left cannes in the possession of a coat belonging to some other gentleman sir  i switched on the steely a bit more  no jeeves i said in a level tone the object under advisement is mine i bought it out there  you wore it sir  every night  but surely you are not proposing to wear it in england sir  i saw that we had arrived at the nub  yes jeeves  but sir  you were saying jeeves  it is quite unsuitable sir  i do not agree with you jeeves i anticipate a great popular success for this jacket it is my intention to spring it on the public tomorrow at pongo twistletons birthday party where i confidently expect it to be one long scream from start to finish no argument jeeves no discussion whatever fantastic objection you may have taken to it i wear this jacket  very good sir  he went on with his unpacking i said no more on the subject i had won the victory and we woosters do not triumph over a beaten foe presently having completed my toilet i bade the man a cheery farewell and in generous mood suggested that as i was dining out why didnt he take the evening off and go to some improving picture or something sort of olive branch if you see what i mean  he didnt seem to think much of it  thank you sir i will remain in  i surveyed him narrowly  is this dudgeon jeeves  no sir i am obliged to remain on the premises mr finknottle informed me he would be calling to see me this evening  oh gussies coming is he well give him my love  very good sir  yes sir  and a whisky and soda and so forth  very good sir  right ho jeeves  i then set off for the drones  at the drones i ran into pongo twistleton and he talked so much about his forthcoming merrymaking of his of which good reports had already reached me through my correspondents that it was nearing eleven when i got home again  and scarcely had i opened the door when i heard voices in the sittingroom and scarcely had i entered the sittingroom when i found that these proceeded from jeeves and what appeared at first sight to be the devil  a closer scrutiny informed me that it was gussie finknottle dressed as mephistopheles    2   whatho gussie i said  you couldnt have told it from my manner but i was feeling more than a bit nonplussed the spectacle before me was enough to nonplus anyone i mean to say this finknottle as i remembered him was the sort of shy shrinking goop who might have been expected to shake like an aspen if invited to so much as a social saturday afternoon at the vicarage and yet here he was if one could credit ones senses about to take part in a fancydress ball a form of entertainment notoriously a testing experience for the toughest  and he was attending that fancydress ball mark younot like every other wellbred englishman as a pierrot but as mephistophelesthis involving as i need scarcely stress not only scarlet tights but a pretty frightful false beard  rummy youll admit however one masks ones feelings i betrayed no vulgar astonishment but as i say whathoed with civil nonchalance  he grinned through the fungusrather sheepishly i thought  oh hullo bertie  long time since i saw you have a spot  no thanks i must be off in a minute i just came round to ask jeeves how he thought i looked how do you think i look bertie  well the answer to that of course was perfectly foul but we woosters are men of tact and have a nice sense of the obligations of a host we do not tell old friends beneath our rooftree that they are an offence to the eyesight i evaded the question  i hear youre in london i said carelessly  oh yes  must be years since you came up  oh yes  and now youre off for an evenings pleasure  he shuddered a bit he had i noticed a hunted air  pleasure  arent you looking forward to this rout or revel  oh i suppose itll be all right he said in a toneless voice anyway i ought to be off i suppose the thing starts round about eleven i told my cab to wait will you see if its there jeeves  very good sir  there was something of a pause after the door had closed a certain constraint i mixed myself a beaker while gussie a glutton for punishment stared at himself in the mirror finally i decided that it would be best to let him know that i was abreast of his affairs it might be that it would ease his mind to confide in a sympathetic man of experience i have generally found with those under the influence that what they want more than anything is the listening ear  well gussie old leper i said ive been hearing all about you  eh  this little trouble of yours jeeves has told me everything  he didnt seem any too braced its always difficult to be sure of course when a chap has dug himself in behind a mephistopheles beard but i fancy he flushed a trifle  i wish jeeves wouldnt go gassing all over the place it was supposed to be confidential  i could not permit this tone  dishing up the dirt to the young master can scarcely be described as gassing all over the place i said with a touch of rebuke anyway there it is i know all and i should like to begin i said sinking my personal opinion that the female in question was a sloppy pest in my desire to buck and encourage by saying that madeline bassett is a charming girl a winner and just the sort for you  you dont know her  certainly i know her what beats me is how you ever got in touch where did you meet  she was staying at a place near mine in lincolnshire the week before last  yes but even so i didnt know you called on the neighbours  i dont i met her out for a walk with her dog the dog had got a thorn in its foot and when she tried to take it out it snapped at her so of course i had to rally round  you extracted the thorn  yes  and fell in love at first sight  yes  well dash it with a thing like that to give you a sendoff why didnt you cash in immediately  i hadnt the nerve  what happened  we talked for a bit  what about  oh birds  birds what birds  the birds that happened to be hanging round and the scenery and all that sort of thing and she said she was going to london and asked me to look her up if i was ever there  and even after that you didnt so much as press her hand  of course not  well i mean it looked as though there was no more to be said if a chap is such a rabbit that he cant get action when hes handed the thing on a plate his case would appear to be pretty hopeless nevertheless i reminded myself that this nonstarter and i had been at school together one must make an effort for an old school friend  ah well i said we must see what can be done things may brighten at any rate you will be glad to learn that i am behind you in this enterprise you have bertram wooster in your corner gussie  thanks old man and jeeves of course which is the thing that really matters  i dont mind admitting that i winced he meant no harm i suppose but im bound to say that this tactless speech nettled me not a little people are always nettling me like that giving me to understand i mean to say that in their opinion bertram wooster is a mere cipher and that the only member of the household with brains and resources is jeeves  it jars on me  and tonight it jarred on me more than usual because i was feeling pretty dashed fed with jeeves over that matter of the mess jacket i mean true i had forced him to climb down quelling him as described with the quiet strength of my personality but i was still a trifle shirty at his having brought the thing up at all it seemed to me that what jeeves wanted was the iron hand  and what is he doing about it i inquired stiffly  hes been giving the position of affairs a lot of thought  he has has he  its on his advice that im going to this dance  why  she is going to be there in fact it was she who sent me the ticket of invitation and jeeves considered  and why not as a pierrot i said taking up the point which had struck me before why this break with a grand old tradition  he particularly wanted me to go as mephistopheles  i started  he did did he he specifically recommended that definite costume  yes  ha  eh  nothing just ha  and ill tell you why i said ha here was jeeves making heavy weather about me wearing a perfectly ordinary white mess jacket a garment not only tout ce quil y a de chic but absolutely de rigueur and in the same breath as you might say inciting gussie finknottle to be a blot on the london scene in scarlet tights ironical what one looks askance at this sort of inandout running  what has he got against pierrots  i dont think he objects to pierrots as pierrots but in my case he thought a pierrot wouldnt be adequate  i dont follow that  he said that the costume of pierrot while pleasing to the eye lacked the authority of the mephistopheles costume  i still dont get it  well its a matter of psychology he said  there was a time when a remark like that would have had me snookered but long association with jeeves has developed the wooster vocabulary considerably jeeves has always been a whale for the psychology of the individual and i now follow him like a bloodhound when he snaps it out of the bag  oh psychology  yes jeeves is a great believer in the moral effect of clothes he thinks i might be emboldened in a striking costume like this he said a pirate chief would be just as good in fact a pirate chief was his first suggestion but i objected to the boots  i saw his point there is enough sadness in life without having fellows like gussie finknottle going about in sea boots  and are you emboldened  well to be absolutely accurate bertie old man no  a gust of compassion shook me after all though we had lost touch a bit of recent years this man and i had once thrown inked darts at each other  gussie i said take an old friends advice and dont go within a mile of this binge  but its my last chance of seeing her shes off tomorrow to stay with some people in the country besides you dont know  dont know what  that this idea of jeevess wont work i feel a most frightful chump now yes but who can say whether that will not pass off when i get into a mob of other people in fancy dress i had the same experience as a child one year during the christmas festivities they dressed me up as a rabbit and the shame was indescribable yet when i got to the party and found myself surrounded by scores of other children many in costumes even ghastlier than my own i perked up amazingly joined freely in the revels and was able to eat so hearty a supper that i was sick twice in the cab coming home what i mean is you cant tell in cold blood  i weighed this it was specious of course  and you cant get away from it that fundamentally jeevess idea is sound in a striking costume like mephistopheles i might quite easily pull off something pretty impressive colour does make a difference look at newts during the courting season the male newt is brilliantly coloured it helps him a lot  but you arent a male newt  i wish i were do you know how a male newt proposes bertie he just stands in front of the female newt vibrating his tail and bending his body in a semicircle i could do that on my head no you wouldnt find me grousing if i were a male newt  but if you were a male newt madeline bassett wouldnt look at you not with the eye of love i mean  she would if she were a female newt  but she isnt a female newt  no but suppose she was  well if she was you wouldnt be in love with her  yes i would if i were a male newt  a slight throbbing about the temples told me that this discussion had reached saturation point  well anyway i said coming down to hard facts and cutting out all this visionary stuff about vibrating tails and what not the salient point that emerges is that you are booked to appear at a fancydress ball and i tell you out of my riper knowledge of fancydress balls gussie that you wont enjoy yourself  it isnt a question of enjoying yourself  i wouldnt go  i must go i keep telling you shes off to the country tomorrow  i gave it up  so be it i said have it your own way yes jeeves  mr finknottles cab sir  ah the cab eh your cab gussie  oh the cab oh right of course yes rather thanks jeeves  well so long bertie  and giving me the sort of weak smile roman gladiators used to give the emperor before entering the arena gussie trickled off and i turned to jeeves the moment had arrived for putting him in his place and i was all for it  it was a little difficult to know how to begin of course i mean to say while firmly resolved to tick him off i didnt want to gash his feelings too deeply even when displaying the iron hand we woosters like to keep the thing fairly matey  however on consideration i saw that there was nothing to be gained by trying to lead up to it gently it is never any use beating about the b  jeeves i said may i speak frankly  certainly sir  what i have to say may wound you  not at all sir  well then i have been having a chat with mr finknottle and he has been telling me about this mephistopheles scheme of yours  yes sir  now let me get it straight if i follow your reasoning correctly you think that stimulated by being upholstered throughout in scarlet tights mr finknottle on encountering the adored object will vibrate his tail and generally let himself go with a whoop  i am of opinion that he will lose much of his normal diffidence sir  i dont agree with you jeeves  no sir  no in fact not to put too fine a point upon it i consider that of all the dashed silly drivelling ideas i ever heard in my puff this is the most blithering and futile it wont work not a chance all you have done is to subject mr finknottle to the nameless horrors of a fancydress ball for nothing and this is not the first time this sort of thing has happened to be quite candid jeeves i have frequently noticed before now a tendency or disposition on your part to becomewhats the word  i could not say sir  eloquent no its not eloquent elusive no its not elusive its on the tip of my tongue begins with an e and means being a jolly sight too clever  elaborate sir  that is the exact word i was after too elaborate jeevesthat is what you are frequently prone to become your methods are not simple not straightforward you cloud the issue with a lot of fancy stuff that is not of the essence all that gussie needs is the elderbrotherly advice of a seasoned man of the world so what i suggest is that from now onward you leave this case to me  very good sir  you lay off and devote yourself to your duties about the home  very good sir  i shall no doubt think of something quite simple and straightforward yet perfectly effective ere long i will make a point of seeing gussie tomorrow  very good sir  right ho jeeves  but on the morrow all those telegrams started coming in and i confess that for twentyfour hours i didnt give the poor chap a thought having problems of my own to contend with    3   the first of the telegram arrived shortly after noon and jeeves brought it in with the beforeluncheon snifter it was from my aunt dahlia operating from market snodsbury a small town of sorts a mile or two along the main road as you leave her country seat  it ran as follows  come at once travers  and when i say it puzzled me like the dickens i am understating it if anything as mysterious a communication i considered as was ever flashed over the wires i studied it in a profound reverie for the best part of two dry martinis and a dividend i read it backwards i read it forwards as a matter of fact i have a sort of recollection of even smelling it but it still baffled me  consider the facts i mean it was only a few hours since this aunt and i had parted after being in constant association for nearly two months and yet here she waswith my farewell kiss still lingering on her cheek so to speakpleading for another reunion bertram wooster is not accustomed to this gluttonous appetite for his society ask anyone who knows me and they will tell you that after two months of my company what the normal person feels is that that will about do for the present indeed i have known people who couldnt stick it out for more than a few days  before sitting down to the wellcooked therefore i sent this reply  perplexed explain bertie  to this i received an answer during the afterluncheon sleep  what on earth is there to be perplexed about ass come at once travers  three cigarettes and a couple of turns about the room and i had my response ready  how do you mean come at once regards bertie  i append the comeback  i mean come at once you maddening halfwit what did you think i meant come at once or expect an aunts curse first post tomorrow love travers  i then dispatched the following message wishing to get everything quite clear  when you say come do you mean come to brinkley court and when you say at once do you mean at once fogged at a loss all the best bertie  i sent this one off on my way to the drones where i spent a restful afternoon throwing cards into a tophat with some of the better element returning in the evening hush i found the answer waiting for me  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes it doesnt matter whether you understand or not you just come at once as i tell you and for heavens sake stop this backchat do you think i am made of money that i can afford to send you telegrams every ten minutes stop being a fathead and come immediately love travers  it was at this point that i felt the need of getting a second opinion i pressed the bell  jeeves i said a vshaped rumminess has manifested itself from the direction of worcestershire read these i said handing him the papers in the case  he scanned them  what do you make of it jeeves  i think mrs travers wishes you to come at once sir  you gather that too do you  yes sir  i put the same construction on the thing but why jeeves dash it all shes just had nearly two months of me  yes sir  and many people consider the medium dose for an adult two days  yes sir i appreciate the point you raise nevertheless mrs travers appears very insistent i think it would be well to acquiesce in her wishes  pop down you mean  yes sir  well i certainly cant go at once ive an important conference on at the drones tonight pongo twistletons birthday party you remember  yes sir  there was a slight pause we were both recalling the little unpleasantness that had arisen i felt obliged to allude to it  youre all wrong about that mess jacket jeeves  these things are matters of opinion sir  when i wore it at the casino at cannes beautiful women nudged one another and whispered who is he  the code at continental casinos is notoriously lax sir  and when i described it to pongo last night he was fascinated  indeed sir  so were all the rest of those present one and all admitted that i had got hold of a good thing not a dissentient voice  indeed sir  i am convinced that you will eventually learn to love this messjacket jeeves  i fear not sir  i gave it up it is never any use trying to reason with jeeves on these occasions pigheaded is the word that springs to the lips one sighs and passes on  well anyway returning to the agenda i cant go down to brinkley court or anywhere else yet awhile thats final ill tell you what jeeves give me form and pencil and ill wire her that ill be with her some time next week or the week after dash it all she ought to be able to hold out without me for a few days it only requires will power  yes sir  right ho then ill wire expect me tomorrow fortnight or words to some such effect that ought to meet the case then if you will toddle round the corner and send it off that will be that  very good sir  and so the long day wore on till it was time for me to dress for pongos party  pongo had assured me while chatting of the affair on the previous night that this birthday binge of his was to be on a scale calculated to stagger humanity and i must say i have participated in less fruity functions it was well after four when i got home and by that time i was about ready to turn in i can just remember groping for the bed and crawling into it and it seemed to me that the lemon had scarcely touched the pillow before i was aroused by the sound of the door opening  i was barely ticking over but i contrived to raise an eyelid  is that my tea jeeves  no sir it is mrs travers  and a moment later there was a sound like a mighty rushing wind and the relative had crossed the threshold at fifty mph under her own steam    4   it has been well said of bertram wooster that while no one views his flesh and blood with a keener and more remorselessly critical eye he is nevertheless a man who delights in giving credit where credit is due and if you have followed these memoirs of mine with the proper care you will be aware that i have frequently had occasion to emphasise the fact that aunt dahlia is all right  she is the one if you remember who married old tom travers en secondes noces as i believe the expression is the year bluebottle won the cambridgeshire and once induced me to write an article on what the welldressed man is wearing for that paper she runsmiladys boudoir she is a large genial soul with whom it is a pleasure to hobnob in her spiritual makeup there is none of that subtle goshawfulness which renders such an exhibit as say my aunt agatha the curse of the home counties and a menace to one and all i have the highest esteem for aunt dahlia and have never wavered in my cordial appreciation of her humanity sporting qualities and general goodeggishness  this being so you may conceive of my astonishment at finding her at my bedside at such an hour i mean to say ive stayed at her place many a time and oft and she knows my habits she is well aware that until i have had my cup of tea in the morning i do not receive this crashing in at a moment when she knew that solitude and repose were of the essence was scarcely i could not but feel the good old form  besides what business had she being in london at all that was what i asked myself when a conscientious housewife has returned to her home after an absence of seven weeks one does not expect her to start racing off again the day after her arrival one feels that she ought to be sticking round ministering to her husband conferring with the cook feeding the cat combing and brushing the pomeranianin a word staying put i was more than a little blearyeyed but i endeavoured as far as the fact that my eyelids were more or less glued together would permit to give her an austere and censorious look  she didnt seem to get it  wake up bertie you old ass she cried in a voice that hit me between the eyebrows and went out at the back of my head  if aunt dahlia has a fault it is that she is apt to address a visàvis as if he were somebody half a mile away whom she had observed riding over hounds a throwback no doubt to the time when she counted the day lost that was not spent in chivvying some unfortunate fox over the countryside  i gave her another of the austere and censorious and this time it registered all the effect it had however was to cause her to descend to personalities  dont blink at me in that obscene way she said i wonder bertie she proceeded gazing at me as i should imagine gussie would have gazed at some newt that was not up to sample if you have the faintest conception how perfectly loathsome you look a cross between an orgy scene in the movies and some low form of pond life i suppose you were out on the tiles last night  i attended a social function yes i said coldly pongo twistletons birthday party i couldnt let pongo down noblesse oblige  well get up and dress  i felt i could not have heard her aright  get up and dress  yes  i turned on the pillow with a little moan and at this juncture jeeves entered with the vital oolong i clutched at it like a drowning man at a straw hat a deep sip or two and i felti wont say restored because a birthday party like pongo twistletons isnt a thing you get restored after with a mere mouthful of tea but sufficiently the old bertram to be able to bend the mind on this awful thing which had come upon me  and the more i bent same the less could i grasp the trend of the scenario  what is this aunt dahlia i inquired  it looks to me like tea was her response but you know best youre drinking it  if i hadnt been afraid of spilling the healing brew i have little doubt that i should have given an impatient gesture i know i felt like it  not the contents of this cup all this your barging in and telling me to get up and dress and all that rot  ive barged in as you call it because my telegrams seemed to produce no effect and i told you to get up and dress because i want you to get up and dress ive come to take you back with me i like your crust wiring that you would come next year or whenever it was youre coming now ive got a job for you  but i dont want a job  what you want my lad and what youre going to get are two very different things there is mans work for you to do at brinkley court be ready to the last button in twenty minutes  but i cant possibly be ready to any buttons in twenty minutes im feeling awful  she seemed to consider  yes she said i suppose its only humane to give you a day or two to recover all right then i shall expect you on the thirtieth at the latest  but dash it what is all this how do you mean a job why a job what sort of a job  ill tell you if youll only stop talking for a minute its quite an easy pleasant job you will enjoy it have you ever heard of market snodsbury grammar school  never  its a grammar school at market snodsbury  i told her a little frigidly that i had divined as much  well how was i to know that a man with a mind like yours would grasp it so quickly she protested all right then market snodsbury grammar school is as you have guessed the grammar school at market snodsbury im one of the governors  you mean one of the governesses  i dont mean one of the governesses listen ass there was a board of governors at eton wasnt there very well so there is at market snodsbury grammar school and im a member of it and they left the arrangements for the summer prizegiving to me this prizegiving takes place on the lastor thirtyfirstday of this month have you got that clear  i took another oz of the lifesaving and inclined my head even after a pongo twistleton birthday party i was capable of grasping simple facts like these  i follow you yes i see the point you are trying to make certainly market  snodsbury  grammar school  board of governors  prizegiving quite but whats it got to do with me  youre going to give away the prizes  i goggled her words did not appear to make sense they seemed the mere aimless vapouring of an aunt who has been sitting out in the sun without a hat  me  you  i goggled again  you dont mean me  i mean you in person  i goggled a third time  youre pulling my leg  i am not pulling your leg nothing would induce me to touch your beastly leg the vicar was to have officiated but when i got home i found a letter from him saying that he had strained a fetlock and must scratch his nomination you can imagine the state i was in i telephoned all over the place nobody would take it on and then suddenly i thought of you  i decided to check all this rot at the outset nobody is more eager to oblige deserving aunts than bertram wooster but there are limits and sharply defined limits at that  so you think im going to strew prizes at this bally dotheboys hall of yours  i do  and make a speech  exactly  i laughed derisively  for goodness sake dont start gargling now this is serious  i was laughing  oh were you well im glad to see you taking it in this merry spirit  derisively i explained i wont do it thats final i simply will not do it  you will do it young bertie or never darken my doors again and you know what that means no more of anatoles dinners for you  a strong shudder shook me she was alluding to her chef that superb artist a monarch of his profession unsurpassednay unequalledat dishing up the raw material so that it melted in the mouth of the ultimate consumer anatole had always been a magnet that drew me to brinkley court with my tongue hanging out many of my happiest moments had been those which i had spent champing this great mans roasts and ragouts and the prospect of being barred from digging into them in the future was a numbing one  no i say dash it  i thought that would rattle you greedy young pig  greedy young pigs have nothing to do with it i said with a touch of hauteur one is not a greedy young pig because one appreciates the cooking of a genius  well i will say i like it myself conceded the relative but not another bite of it do you get if you refuse to do this simple easy pleasant job no not so much as another sniff so put that in your twelveinch cigaretteholder and smoke it  i began to feel like some wild thing caught in a snare  but why do you want me i mean what am i ask yourself that  i often have  i mean to say im not the type you have to have some terrific nib to give away prizes i seem to remember when i was at school it was generally a prime minister or somebody  ah but that was at eton at market snodsbury we arent nearly so choosy anybody in spats impresses us  why dont you get uncle tom  uncle tom  well why not hes got spats  bertie she said i will tell you why not uncle tom you remember me losing all that money at baccarat at cannes well very shortly i shall have to sidle up to tom and break the news to him if right after that i ask him to put on lavender gloves and a topper and distribute the prizes at market snodsbury grammar school there will be a divorce in the family he would pin a note to the pincushion and be off like a rabbit no my lad youre for it so you may as well make the best of it  but aunt dahlia listen to reason i assure you youve got hold of the wrong man im hopeless at a game like that ask jeeves about the time i got lugged in to address a girls school i made the most colossal ass of myself  and i confidently anticipate that you will make an equally colossal ass of yourself on the thirtyfirst of this month thats why i want you the way i look at it is that as the thing is bound to be a frost anyway one may as well get a hearty laugh out of it i shall enjoy seeing you distribute those prizes bertie well i wont keep you as no doubt you want to do your swedish exercises i shall expect you in a day or two  and with these heartless words she beetled off leaving me a prey to the gloomiest emotions what with the natural reaction after pongos party and this stunning blow it is not too much to say that the soul was seared  and i was still writhing in the depths when the door opened and jeeves appeared  mr finknottle to see you sir he announced    5   i gave him one of my looks  jeeves i said i had scarcely expected this of you you are aware that i was up to an advanced hour last night you know that i have barely had my tea you cannot be ignorant of the effect of that hearty voice of aunt dahlias on a man with a headache and yet you come bringing me finknottles is this a time for fink or any other kind of nottle  but did you not give me to understand sir that you wished to see mr finknottle to advise him on his affairs  this i admit opened up a new line of thought in the stress of my emotions i had clean forgotten about having taken gussies interests in hand it altered things one cant give the raspberry to a client i mean you didnt find sherlock holmes refusing to see clients just because he had been out late the night before at doctor watsons birthday party i could have wished that the man had selected some more suitable hour for approaching me but as he appeared to be a sort of human lark leaving his watery nest at daybreak i supposed i had better give him an audience  true i said all right bung him in  very good sir  but before doing so bring me one of those pickmeups of yours  very good sir  and presently he returned with the vital essence  i have had occasion i fancy to speak before now of these pickmeups of jeevess and their effect on a fellow who is hanging to life by a thread on the morning after what they consist of i couldnt tell you he says some kind of sauce the yolk of a raw egg and a dash of red pepper but nothing will convince me that the thing doesnt go much deeper than that be that as it may however the results of swallowing one are amazing  for perhaps the split part of a second nothing happens it is as though all nature waited breathless then suddenly it is as if the last trump had sounded and judgment day set in with unusual severity  bonfires burst out all in parts of the frame the abdomen becomes heavily charged with molten lava a great wind seems to blow through the world and the subject is aware of something resembling a steam hammer striking the back of the head during this phase the ears ring loudly the eyeballs rotate and there is a tingling about the brow  and then just as you are feeling that you ought to ring up your lawyer and see that your affairs are in order before it is too late the whole situation seems to clarify the wind drops the ears cease to ring birds twitter brass bands start playing the sun comes up over the horizon with a jerk  and a moment later all you are conscious of is a great peace  as i drained the glass now new life seemed to burgeon within me i remember jeeves who however much he may go off the rails at times in the matter of dress clothes and in his advice to those in love has always had a neat turn of phrase once speaking of someone rising on steppingstones of his dead self to higher things it was that way with me now i felt that the bertram wooster who lay propped up against the pillows had become a better stronger finer bertram  thank you jeeves i said  not at all sir  that touched the exact spot i am now able to cope with lifes problems  i am gratified to hear it sir  what madness not to have had one of those before tackling aunt dahlia however too late to worry about that now tell me of gussie how did he make out at the fancydress ball  he did not arrive at the fancydress ball sir  i looked at him a bit austerely  jeeves i said i admit that after that pickmeup of yours i feel better but dont try me too high dont stand by my sick bed talking absolute rot we shot gussie into a cab and he started forth headed for wherever this fancydress ball was he must have arrived  no sir as i gather from mr finknottle he entered the cab convinced in his mind that the entertainment to which he had been invited was to be held at no 17 suffolk square whereas the actual rendezvous was no 71 norfolk terrace these aberrations of memory are not uncommon with those who like mr finknottle belong essentially to what one might call the dreamertype  one might also call it the fatheaded type  yes sir  well  on reaching no 17 suffolk square mr finknottle endeavoured to produce money to pay the fare  what stopped him  the fact that he had no money sir he discovered that he had left it together with his ticket of invitation on the mantelpiece of his bedchamber in the house of his uncle where he was residing bidding the cabman to wait accordingly he rang the doorbell and when the butler appeared requested him to pay the cab adding that it was all right as he was one of the guests invited to the dance the butler then disclaimed all knowledge of a dance on the premises  and declined to unbelt  yes sir  upon which  mr finknottle directed the cabman to drive him back to his uncles residence  well why wasnt that the happy ending all he had to do was go in collect cash and ticket and there he would have been on velvet  i should have mentioned sir that mr finknottle had also left his latchkey on the mantelpiece of his bedchamber  he could have rung the bell  he did ring the bell sir for some fifteen minutes at the expiration of that period he recalled that he had given permission to the caretakerthe house was officially closed and all the staff on holidayto visit his sailor son at portsmouth  golly jeeves  yes sir  these dreamer types do live dont they  yes sir  what happened then  mr finknottle appears to have realized at this point that his position as regards the cabman had become equivocal the figures on the clock had already reached a substantial sum and he was not in a position to meet his obligations  he could have explained  you cannot explain to cabmen sir on endeavouring to do so he found the fellow sceptical of his bona fides  i should have legged it  that is the policy which appears to have commended itself to mr finknottle he darted rapidly away and the cabman endeavouring to detain him snatched at his overcoat mr finknottle contrived to extricate himself from the coat and it would seem that his appearance in the masquerade costume beneath it came as something of a shock to the cabman mr finknottle informs me that he heard a species of whistling gasp and looking round observed the man crouching against the railings with his hands over his face mr finknottle thinks he was praying no doubt an uneducated superstitious fellow sir possibly a drinker  well if he hadnt been one before ill bet he started being one shortly afterwards i expect he could scarcely wait for the pubs to open  very possibly in the circumstances he might have found a restorative agreeable sir  and so in the circumstances might gussie too i should think what on earth did he do after that london late at nightor even in the daytime for that matteris no place for a man in scarlet tights  no sir  he invites comment  yes sir  i can see the poor old bird ducking down sidestreets skulking in alleyways diving into dustbins  i gathered from mr finknottles remarks sir that something very much on those lines was what occurred eventually after a trying night he found his way to mr sipperleys residence where he was able to secure lodging and a change of costume in the morning  i nestled against the pillows the brow a bit drawn it is all very well to try to do old school friends a spot of good but i could not but feel that in espousing the cause of a lunkhead capable of mucking things up as gussie had done i had taken on a contract almost too big for human consumption it seemed to me that what gussie needed was not so much the advice of a seasoned man of the world as a padded cell in colney hatch and a couple of good keepers to see that he did not set the place on fire  indeed for an instant i had half a mind to withdraw from the case and hand it back to jeeves but the pride of the woosters restrained me when we woosters put our hands to the plough we do not readily sheathe the sword besides after that business of the messjacket anything resembling weakness would have been fatal  i suppose you realize jeeves i said for though one dislikes to rub it in these things have to be pointed out that all this was your fault  sir  its no good saying sir you know it was if you had not insisted on his going to that dancea mad project as i spotted from the firstthis would not have happened  yes sir but i confess i did not anticipate  always anticipate everything jeeves i said a little sternly it is the only way even if you had allowed him to wear a pierrot costume things would not have panned out as they did a pierrot costume has pockets however i went on more kindly we need not go into that now if all this has shown you what comes of going about the place in scarlet tights that is something gained gussie waits without you say  yes sir  then shoot him in and i will see what i can do for him    6   gussie on arrival proved to be still showing traces of his grim experience the face was pale the eyes gooseberrylike the ears drooping and the whole aspect that of a man who has passed through the furnace and been caught in the machinery i hitched myself up a bit higher on the pillows and gazed at him narrowly it was a moment i could see when first aid was required and i prepared to get down to cases  well gussie  hullo bertie  what ho  what ho  these civilities concluded i felt that the moment had come to touch delicately on the past  i hear youve been through it a bit  yes  thanks to jeeves  it wasnt jeevess fault  entirely jeevess fault  i dont see that i forgot my money and latchkey  and now youd better forget jeeves for you will be interested to hear gussie i said deeming it best to put him in touch with the position of affairs right away that he is no longer handling your little problem  this seemed to slip it across him properly the jaws fell the ears drooped more limply he had been looking like a dead fish he now looked like a deader fish one of last years cast up on some lonely beach and left there at the mercy of the wind and tides  what  yes  you dont mean that jeeves isnt going to  no  but dash it  i was kind but firm  you will be much better off without him surely your terrible experiences of that awful night have told you that jeeves needs a rest the keenest of thinkers strikes a bad patch occasionally that is what has happened to jeeves i have seen it coming on for some time he has lost his form he wants his plugs decarbonized no doubt this is a shock to you i suppose you came here this morning to seek his advice  of course i did  on what point  madeline bassett has gone to stay with these people in the country and i want to know what he thinks i ought to do  well as i say jeeves is off the case  but bertie dash it  jeeves i said with a certain asperity is no longer on the case i am now in sole charge  but what on earth can you do  i curbed my resentment we woosters are fairminded we can make allowances for men who have been parading london all night in scarlet tights  that i said quietly we shall see sit down and let us confer i am bound to say the thing seems quite simple to me you say this girl has gone to visit friends in the country it would appear obvious that you must go there too and flock round her like a poultice elementary  but i cant plant myself on a lot of perfect strangers  dont you know these people  of course i dont i dont know anybody  i pursed the lips this did seem to complicate matters somewhat  all that i know is that their name is travers and its a place called brinkley court down in worcestershire  i unpursed my lips  gussie i said smiling paternally it was a lucky day for you when bertram wooster interested himself in your affairs as i foresaw from the start i can fix everything this afternoon you shall go to brinkley court an honoured guest  he quivered like a mousse i suppose it must always be rather a thrilling experience for the novice to watch me taking hold  but bertie you dont mean you know these traverses  they are my aunt dahlia  my gosh  you see now i pointed out how lucky you were to get me behind you you go to jeeves and what does he do he dresses you up in scarlet tights and one of the foulest false beards of my experience and sends you off to fancydress balls result agony of spirit and no progress i then take over and put you on the right lines could jeeves have got you into brinkley court not a chance aunt dahlia isnt his aunt i merely mention these things  by jove bertie i dont know how to thank you  my dear chap  but i say  now what  what do i do when i get there  if you knew brinkley court you would not ask that question in those romantic surroundings you cant miss great lovers through the ages have fixed up the preliminary formalities at brinkley the place is simply ill with atmosphere you will stroll with the girl in the shady walks you will sit with her on the shady lawns you will row on the lake with her and gradually you will find yourself working up to a point where  by jove i believe youre right  of course im right ive got engaged three times at brinkley no business resulted but the fact remains and i went there without the foggiest idea of indulging in the tender pash i hadnt the slightest intention of proposing to anybody yet no sooner had i entered those romantic grounds than i found myself reaching out for the nearest girl in sight and slapping my soul down in front of her its something in the air  i see exactly what you mean thats just what i want to be able to dowork up to it and in londoncurse the placeeverythings in such a rush that you dont get a chance  quite you see a girl alone for about five minutes a day and if you want to ask her to be your wife youve got to charge into it as if you were trying to grab the gold ring on a merrygoround  thats right london rattles one i shall be a different man altogether in the country what a bit of luck this travers woman turning out to be your aunt  i dont know what you mean turning out to be my aunt she has been my aunt all along  i mean how extraordinary that it should be your aunt that madelines going to stay with  not at all she and my cousin angela are close friends at cannes she was with us all the time  oh you met madeline at cannes did you by jove bertie said the poor lizard devoutly i wish i could have seen her at cannes how wonderful she must have looked in beach pyjamas oh bertie  quite i said a little distantly even when restored by one of jeevess depth bombs one doesnt want this sort of thing after a hard night i touched the bell and when jeeves appeared requested him to bring me telegraph form and pencil i then wrote a wellworded communication to aunt dahlia informing her that i was sending my friend augustus finknottle down to brinkley today to enjoy her hospitality and handed it to gussie  push that in at the first post office you pass i said she will find it waiting for her on her return  gussie popped along flapping the telegram and looking like a closeup of joan crawford and i turned to jeeves and gave him a précis of my operations  simple you observe jeeves nothing elaborate  no sir  nothing farfetched nothing strained or bizarre just natures remedy  yes sir  this is the attack as it should have been delivered what do you call it when two people of opposite sexes are bunged together in close association in a secluded spot meeting each other every day and seeing a lot of each other  is propinquity the word you wish sir  it is i stake everything on propinquity jeeves propinquity in my opinion is what will do the trick at the moment as you are aware gussie is a mere jelly when in the presence but ask yourself how he will feel in a week or so after he and she have been helping themselves to sausages out of the same dish day after day at the breakfast sideboard cutting the same ham ladling out communal kidneys and baconwhy  i broke off abruptly i had had one of my ideas  golly jeeves  sir  heres an instance of how you have to think of everything you heard me mention sausages kidneys and bacon and ham  yes sir  well there must be nothing of that fatal the wrong note entirely give me that telegraph form and pencil i must warn gussie without delay what hes got to do is to create in this girls mind the impression that he is pining away for love of her this cannot be done by wolfing sausages  no sir  very well then  and taking form and p i drafted the following  finknottle  brinkley court  market snodsbury  worcestershire  lay off the sausages avoid the ham bertie   send that off jeeves instanter  very good sir  i sank back on the pillows  well jeeves i said you see how i am taking hold you notice the grip i am getting on this case no doubt you realize now that it would pay you to study my methods  no doubt sir  and even now you arent on to the full depths of the extraordinary sagacity ive shown do you know what brought aunt dahlia up here this morning she came to tell me id got to distribute the prizes at some beastly seminary shes a governor of down at market snodsbury  indeed sir i fear you will scarcely find that a congenial task  ah but im not going to do it im going to shove it off on to gussie  sir  i propose jeeves to wire to aunt dahlia saying that i cant get down and suggesting that she unleashes him on these young borstal inmates of hers in my stead  but if mr finknottle should decline sir  decline can you see him declining just conjure up the picture in your mind jeeves scene the drawingroom at brinkley gussie wedged into a corner with aunt dahlia standing over him making hunting noises i put it to you jeeves can you see him declining  not readily sir i agree mrs travers is a forceful personality  he wont have a hope of declining his only way out would be to slide off and he cant slide off because he wants to be with miss bassett no gussie will have to toe the line and i shall be saved from a job at which i confess the soul shuddered getting up on a platform and delivering a short manly speech to a lot of foul schoolkids golly jeeves ive been through that sort of thing once what you remember that time at the girls school  very vividly sir  what an ass i made of myself  certainly i have seen you to better advantage sir  i think you might bring me just one more of those dynamite specials of yours jeeves this narrow squeak has made me come over all faint  i suppose it must have taken aunt dahlia three hours or so to get back to brinkley because it wasnt till well after lunch that her telegram arrived it read like a telegram that had been dispatched in a whitehot surge of emotion some two minutes after she had read mine  as follows  am taking legal advice to ascertain whether strangling an idiot nephew counts as murder if it doesnt look out for yourself consider your conduct frozen limit what do you mean by planting your loathsome friends on me like this do you think brinkley court is a leper colony or what is it who is this spinkbottle love travers  i had expected some such initial reaction i replied in temperate vein  not bottle nottle regards bertie  almost immediately after she had dispatched the above heart cry gussie must have arrived for it wasnt twenty minutes later when i received the following  cipher telegram signed by you has reached me here runs lay off the sausages avoid the ham wire key immediately finknottle  i replied  also kidneys cheerio bertie  i had staked all on gussie making a favourable impression on his hostess basing my confidence on the fact that he was one of those timid obsequious teacuppassing thinbreadandbutteroffering yesmen whom women of my aunt dahlias type nearly always like at first sight that i had not overrated my acumen was proved by her next in order which i was pleased to note assayed a markedly larger percentage of the milk of human kindness  as follows  well this friend of yours has got here and i must say that for a friend of yours he seems less subhuman than i had expected a bit of a popeyed bleater but on the whole clean and civil and certainly most informative about newts am considering arranging series of lectures for him in neighbourhood all the same i like your nerve using my house as a summerhotel resort and shall have much to say to you on subject when you come down expect you thirtieth bring spats love travers  to this i riposted  on consulting engagement book find impossible come brinkley court deeply regret toodleoo bertie  hers in reply stuck a sinister note  oh so its like that is it you and your engagement book indeed deeply regret my foot let me tell you my lad that you will regret it a jolly sight more deeply if you dont come down if you imagine for one moment that you are going to get out of distributing those prizes you are very much mistaken deeply regret brinkley court hundred miles from london as unable hit you with a brick love travers  i then put my fortune to the test to win or lose it all it was not a moment for petty economies i let myself go regardless of expense  no but dash it listen honestly you dont want me get finknottle distribute prizes a born distributor who will do you credit confidently anticipate augustus finknottle as master of revels on thirtyfirst inst would make genuine sensation do not miss this great chance which may never occur again tinkertytonk bertie  there was an hour of breathless suspense and then the joyful tidings arrived  well all right something in what you say i suppose consider you treacherous worm and contemptible spineless cowardly custard but have booked spinkbottle stay where you are then and i hope you get run over by an omnibus love travers  the relief as you may well imagine was stupendous a great weight seemed to have rolled off my mind it was as if somebody had been pouring jeevess pickmeups into me through a funnel i sang as i dressed for dinner that night at the drones i was so gay and cheery that there were several complaints and when i got home and turned into the old bed i fell asleep like a little child within five minutes of inserting the person between the sheets it seemed to me that the whole distressing affair might now be considered definitely closed  conceive my astonishment therefore when waking on the morrow and sitting up to dig into the morning teacup i beheld on the tray another telegram  my heart sank could aunt dahlia have slept on it and changed her mind could gussie unable to face the ordeal confronting him have legged it during the night down a waterpipe with these speculations racing through the bean i tore open the envelope and as i noted contents i uttered a startled yip  sir said jeeves pausing at the door  i read the thing again yes i had got the gist all right no i had not been deceived in the substance  jeeves i said do you know what  no sir  you know my cousin angela  yes sir  you know young tuppy glossop  yes sir  theyve broken off their engagement  i am sorry to hear that sir  i have here a communication from aunt dahlia specifically stating this i wonder what the row was about  i could not say sir  of course you couldnt dont be an ass jeeves  no sir  i brooded i was deeply moved  well this means that we shall have to go down to brinkley today aunt dahlia is obviously all of a twitter and my place is by her side you had better pack this morning and catch that 1245 train with the luggage i have a lunch engagement so will follow in the car  very good sir  i brooded some more  i must say this has come as a great shock to me jeeves  no doubt sir  a very great shock angela and tuppy tut tut why they seemed like the paper on the wall life is full of sadness jeeves  yes sir  still there it is  undoubtedly sir  right ho then switch on the bath  very good sir    7   i meditated pretty freely as i drove down to brinkley in the old twoseater that afternoon the news of this rift or rupture of angelas and tuppys had disturbed me greatly  the projected match you see was one on which i had always looked with kindly approval too often when a chap of your acquaintance is planning to marry a girl you know you find yourself knitting the brow a bit and chewing the lower lip dubiously feeling that he or she or both should be warned while there is yet time  but i have never felt anything of this nature about tuppy and angela tuppy when not making an ass of himself is a soundish sort of egg so is angela a soundish sort of egg and as far as being in love was concerned it had always seemed to me that you wouldnt have been far out in describing them as two hearts that beat as one  true they had had their little tiffs notably on the occasion when tuppywith what he said was fearless honesty and i considered thorough goofinesshad told angela that her new hat made her look like a pekingese but in every romance you have to budget for the occasional dustup and after that incident i had supposed that he had learned his lesson and that from then on life would be one grand sweet song  and now this wholly unforeseen severing of diplomatic relations had popped up through a trap  i gave the thing the cream of the wooster brain all the way down but it continued to beat me what could have caused the outbreak of hostilities and i bunged my foot sedulously on the accelerator in order to get to aunt dahlia with the greatest possible speed and learn the inside history straight from the horses mouth and what with all six cylinders hitting nicely i made good time and found myself closeted with the relative shortly before the hour of the evening cocktail  she seemed glad to see me in fact she actually said she was glad to see mea statement no other aunt on the list would have committed herself to the customary reaction of these near and dear ones to the spectacle of bertram arriving for a visit being a sort of sick horror  decent of you to rally round bertie she said  my place was by your side aunt dahlia i responded  i could see at a g that the unfortunate affair had got in amongst her in no uncertain manner her usually cheerful map was clouded and the genial smile conspic by its a i pressed her hand sympathetically to indicate that my heart bled for her  bad show this my dear old flesh and blood i said im afraid youve been having a sticky time you must be worried  she snorted emotionally she looked like an aunt who has just bitten into a bad oyster  worried is right i havent had a peaceful moment since i got back from cannes ever since i put my foot across this blasted threshold said aunt dahlia returning for the nonce to the hearty argot of the hunting field everythings been at sixes and sevens first there was that mixup about the prizegiving  she paused at this point and gave me a look i had been meaning to speak freely to you about your behaviour in that matter bertie she said i had some good things all stored up but as youve rallied round like this i suppose i shall have to let you off and anyway it is probably all for the best that you evaded your obligations in that sickeningly craven way i have an idea that this spinkbottle of yours is going to be good if only he can keep off newts  has he been talking about newts  he has fixing me with a glittering eye like the ancient mariner but if that was the worst i had to bear i wouldnt mind what im worrying about is what tom says when he starts talking  uncle tom  i wish there was something else you could call him except uncle tom said aunt dahlia a little testily every time you do it i expect to see him turn black and start playing the banjo yes uncle tom if you must have it i shall have to tell him soon about losing all that money at baccarat and when i do he will go up like a rocket  still no doubt time the great healer  time the great healer be blowed ive got to get a cheque for five hundred pounds out of him for miladys boudoir by august the third at the latest  i was concerned apart from a nephews natural interest in an aunts refined weekly paper i had always had a soft spot in my heart for miladys boudoir ever since i contributed that article to it on what the welldressed man is wearing sentimental possibly but we old journalists do have these feelings  is the boudoir on the rocks  it will be if tom doesnt cough up it needs help till it has turned the corner  but wasnt it turning the corner two years ago  it was and its still at it till youve run a weekly paper for women you dont know what corners are  and you think the chances of getting into uncleinto my uncle by marriages ribs are slight  ill tell you bertie up till now when these subsidies were required i have always been able to come to tom in the gay confident spirit of an only child touching an indulgent father for chocolate cream but hes just had a demand from the incometax people for an additional fiftyeight pounds one and threepence and all hes been talking about since i got back has been ruin and the sinister trend of socialistic legislation and what will become of us all  i could readily believe it this tom has a peculiarity ive noticed in other very oofy men nick him for the paltriest sum and he lets out a squawk you can hear at lands end he has the stuff in gobs but he hates giving up  if it wasnt for anatoles cooking i doubt if he would bother to carry on thank god for anatole i say  i bowed my head reverently  good old anatole i said  amen said aunt dahlia  then the look of holy ecstasy which is always the result of letting the mind dwell however briefly on anatoles cooking died out of her face  but dont let me wander from the subject she resumed i was telling you of the way hells foundations have been quivering since i got home first the prizegiving then tom and now on top of everything else this infernal quarrel between angela and young glossop  i nodded gravely i was frightfully sorry to hear of that terrible shock what was the row about  sharks  eh  sharks or rather one individual shark the brute that went for the poor child when she was aquaplaning at cannes you remember angelas shark  certainly i remembered angelas shark a man of sensibility does not forget about a cousin nearly being chewed by monsters of the deep the episode was still green in my memory  in a nutshell what had occurred was this you know how you aquaplane a motorboat nips on ahead trailing a rope you stand on a board holding the rope and the boat tows you along and every now and then you lose your grip on the rope and plunge into the sea and have to swim to your board again  a silly process it has always seemed to me though many find it diverting  well on the occasion referred to angela had just regained her board after taking a toss when a great beastly shark came along and cannoned into it flinging her into the salty once more it took her quite a bit of time to get on again and make the motorboat chap realize what was up and haul her to safety and during that interval you can readily picture her embarrassment  according to angela the finny denizen kept snapping at her ankles virtually without cessation so that by the time help arrived she was feeling more like a salted almond at a public dinner than anything human very shaken the poor child had been i recall and had talked of nothing else for weeks  i remember the whole incident vividly i said but how did that start the trouble  she was telling him the story last night  well  her eyes shining and her little hands clasped in girlish excitement  no doubt  and instead of giving her the understanding and sympathy to which she was entitled what do you think this blasted glossop did he sat listening like a lump of dough as if she had been talking about the weather and when she had finished he took his cigarette holder out of his mouth and said i expect it was only a floating log  he didnt  he did and when angela described how the thing had jumped and snapped at her he took his cigarette holder out of his mouth again and said ah probably a flatfish quite harmless no doubt it was just trying to play well i mean what would you have done if you had been angela she has pride sensibility all the natural feelings of a good woman she told him he was an ass and a fool and an idiot and didnt know what he was talking about  i must say i saw the girls viewpoint its only about once in a lifetime that anything sensational ever happens to one and when it does you dont want people taking all the colour out of it i remember at school having to read that stuff where that chap othello tells the girl what a hell of a time hed been having among the cannibals and what not well imagine his feelings if after he had described some particularly sticky passage with a cannibal chief and was waiting for the awestruck ohh not really she had said that the whole thing had no doubt been greatly exaggerated and that the man had probably really been a prominent local vegetarian  yes i saw angelas point of view  but dont tell me that when he saw how shirty she was about it the chump didnt back down  he didnt he argued and one thing led to another until by easy stages they had arrived at the point where she was saying that she didnt know if he was aware of it but if he didnt knock off starchy foods and do exercises every morning he would be getting as fat as a pig and he was talking about this modern habit of girls putting makeup on their faces of which he had always disapproved this continued for a while and then there was a loud pop and the air was full of mangled fragments of their engagement im distracted about it thank goodness youve come bertie  nothing could have kept me away i replied touched i felt you needed me  yes  quite  or rather she said not you of course but jeeves the minute all this happened i thought of him the situation obviously cries out for jeeves if ever in the whole history of human affairs there was a moment when that lofty brain was required about the home this is it  i think if i had been standing up i would have staggered in fact im pretty sure i would but it isnt so dashed easy to stagger when youre sitting in an armchair only my face therefore showed how deeply i had been stung by these words  until she spoke them i had been all sweetness and lightthe sympathetic nephew prepared to strain every nerve to do his bit i now froze and the face became hard and set  jeeves i said between clenched teeth  oom beroofen said aunt dahlia  i saw that she had got the wrong angle  i was not sneezing i was saying jeeves  and well you may what a man im going to put the whole thing up to him theres nobody like jeeves  my frigidity became more marked  i venture to take issue with you aunt dahlia  you take what  issue  you do do you  i emphatically do jeeves is hopeless  what  quite hopeless he has lost his grip completely only a couple of days ago i was compelled to take him off a case because his handling of it was so footling and anyway i resent this assumption if assumption is the word i want that jeeves is the only fellow with brain i object to the way everybody puts things up to him without consulting me and letting me have a stab at them first  she seemed about to speak but i checked her with a gesture  it is true that in the past i have sometimes seen fit to seek jeevess advice it is possible that in the future i may seek it again but i claim the right to have a pop at these problems as they arise in person without having everybody behave as if jeeves was the only onion in the hash i sometimes feel that jeeves though admittedly not unsuccessful in the past has been lucky rather than gifted  have you and jeeves had a row  nothing of the kind  you seem to have it in for him  not at all  and yet i must admit that there was a modicum of truth in what she said i had been feeling pretty austere about the man all day and ill tell you why  you remember that he caught that 1245 train with the luggage while i remained on in order to keep a luncheon engagement well just before i started out to the tryst i was pottering about the flat and suddenlyi dont know what put the suspicion into my head possibly the fellows manner had been furtivesomething seemed to whisper to me to go and have a look in the wardrobe  and it was as i had suspected there was the messjacket still on its hanger the hound hadnt packed it  well as anybody at the drones will tell you bertram wooster is a pretty hard chap to outgeneral i shoved the thing in a brownpaper parcel and put it in the back of the car and it was on a chair in the hall now but that didnt alter the fact that jeeves had attempted to do the dirty on me and i suppose a certain whatdyoucallit had crept into my manner during the above remarks  there has been no breach i said you might describe it as a passing coolness but no more we did not happen to see eye to eye with regard to my white messjacket with the brass buttons and i was compelled to assert my personality but  well it doesnt matter anyway the thing that matters is that you are talking piffle you poor fish jeeves lost his grip absurd why i saw him for a moment when he arrived and his eyes were absolutely glittering with intelligence i said to myself trust jeeves and i intend to  you would be far better advised to let me see what i can accomplish aunt dahlia  for heavens sake dont you start butting in youll only make matters worse  on the contrary it may interest you to know that while driving here i concentrated deeply on this trouble of angelas and was successful in formulating a plan based on the psychology of the individual which i am proposing to put into effect at an early moment  oh my god  my knowledge of human nature tells me it will work  bertie said aunt dahlia and her manner struck me as febrile lay off lay off for pitys sake lay off i know these plans of yours i suppose you want to shove angela into the lake and push young glossop in after her to save her life or something like that  nothing of the kind  its the sort of thing you would do  my scheme is far more subtle let me outline it for you  no thanks  i say to myself  but not to me  do listen for a second  i wont  right ho then i am dumb  and have been from a child  i perceived that little good could result from continuing the discussion i waved a hand and shrugged a shoulder  very well aunt dahlia i said with dignity if you dont want to be in on the ground floor that is your affair but you are missing an intellectual treat and anyway no matter how much you may behave like the deaf adder of scripture which as you are doubtless aware the more one piped the less it danced or words to that effect i shall carry on as planned i am extremely fond of angela and i shall spare no effort to bring the sunshine back into her heart  bertie you abysmal chump i appeal to you once more will you please lay off youll only make things ten times as bad as they are already  i remember reading in one of those historical novels once about a chapa buck he would have been no doubt or a macaroni or some such bird as thatwho when people said the wrong thing merely laughed down from lazy eyelids and flicked a speck of dust from the irreproachable mechlin lace at his wrists this was practically what i did now at least i straightened my tie and smiled one of those inscrutable smiles of mine i then withdrew and went out for a saunter in the garden  and the first chap i ran into was young tuppy his brow was furrowed and he was moodily bunging stones at a flowerpot    8   i think i have told you before about young tuppy glossop he was the fellow if you remember who callously ignoring the fact that we had been friends since boyhood betted me one night at the drones that i could swing myself across the swimming bath by the ringsa childish feat for one of my lissomenessand then having seen me well on the way looped back the last ring thus rendering it necessary for me to drop into the deep end in formal evening costume  to say that i had not resented this foul deed which seemed to me deserving of the title of the crime of the century would be paltering with the truth i had resented it profoundly chafing not a little at the time and continuing to chafe for some weeks  but you know how it is with these things the wound heals the agony abates  i am not saying mind you that had the opportunity presented itself of dropping a wet sponge on tuppy from some high spot or of putting an eel in his bed or finding some other form of selfexpression of a like nature i would not have embraced it eagerly but that let me out i mean to say grievously injured though i had been it gave me no pleasure to feel that the fellows bally life was being ruined by the loss of a girl whom despite all that had passed i was convinced he still loved like the dickens  on the contrary i was heart and soul in favour of healing the breach and rendering everything hotsytotsy once more between these two young sundered blighters you will have gleaned that from my remarks to aunt dahlia and if you had been present at this moment and had seen the kindly commiserating look i gave tuppy you would have gleaned it still more  it was one of those searching melting looks and was accompanied by the hearty clasp of the right hand and the gentle laying of the left on the collarbone  well tuppy old man i said how are you old man  my commiseration deepened as i spoke the words for there had been no lighting up of the eye no answering pressure of the palm no sign whatever in short of any disposition on his part to do spring dances at the sight of an old friend the man seemed sandbagged melancholy as i remember jeeves saying once about pongo twistleton when he was trying to knock off smoking had marked him for her own not that i was surprised of course in the circs no doubt a certain moodiness was only natural  i released the hand ceased to knead the shoulder and producing the old case offered him a cigarette  he took it dully  are you here bertie he asked  yes im here  just passing through or come to stay  i thought for a moment i might have told him that i had arrived at brinkley court with the express intention of bringing angela and himself together once more of knitting up the severed threads and so on and so forth and for perhaps half the time required for the lighting of a gasper i had almost decided to do so then i reflected better on the whole perhaps not to broadcast the fact that i proposed to take him and angela and play on them as on a couple of stringed instruments might have been injudicious chaps dont always like being played on as on a stringed instrument  it all depends i said i may remain i may push on my plans are uncertain  he nodded listlessly rather in the manner of a man who did not give a damn what i did and stood gazing out over the sunlit garden in build and appearance tuppy somewhat resembles a bulldog and his aspect now was that of one of these fine animals who has just been refused a slice of cake it was not difficult for a man of my discernment to read what was in his mind and it occasioned me no surprise therefore when his next words had to do with the subject marked with a cross on the agenda paper  youve heard of this business of mine i suppose me and angela  i have indeed tuppy old man  weve bust up  i know some little friction i gather in re angelas shark  yes i said it must have been a flatfish  so my informant told me  who did you hear it from  aunt dahlia  i suppose she cursed me properly  oh no  beyond referring to you in one passage as this blasted glossop she was i thought singularly temperate in her language for a woman who at one time hunted regularly with the quorn all the same i could see if you dont mind me saying so old man that she felt you might have behaved with a little more tact  tact  and i must admit i rather agreed with her was it nice tuppy was it quite kind to take the bloom off angelas shark like that you must remember that angelas shark is very dear to her could you not see what a sock on the jaw it would be for the poor child to hear it described by the man to whom she had given her heart as a flatfish  i saw that he was struggling with some powerful emotion  and what about my side of the thing he demanded in a voice choked with feeling  your side  you dont suppose said tuppy with rising vehemence that i would have exposed this dashed synthetic shark for the flatfish it undoubtedly was if there had not been causes that led up to it what induced me to speak as i did was the fact that angela the little squirt had just been most offensive and i seized the opportunity to get a bit of my own back  offensive  exceedingly offensive purely on the strength of my having let fall some casual remarksimply by way of saying something and keeping the conversation goingto the effect that i wondered what anatole was going to give us for dinner she said that i was too material and ought not always to be thinking of food material my elbow as a matter of fact im particularly spiritual  quite  i dont see any harm in wondering what anatole was going to give us for dinner do you  of course not a mere ordinary tribute of respect to a great artist  exactly  all the same  well  i was only going to say that it seems a pity that the frail craft of love should come a stinker like this when a few manly words of contrition  he stared at me  you arent suggesting that i should climb down  it would be the fine big thing old egg  i wouldnt dream of climbing down  but tuppy  no i wouldnt do it  but you love her dont you  this touched the spot he quivered noticeably and his mouth twisted quite the tortured soul  im not saying i dont love the little blighter he said obviously moved i love her passionately but that doesnt alter the fact that i consider that what she needs most in this world is a swift kick in the pants  a wooster could scarcely pass this tuppy old man  its no good saying tuppy old man  well i do say tuppy old man your tone shocks me one raises the eyebrows where is the fine old chivalrous spirit of the glossops  thats all right about the fine old chivalrous spirit of the glossops where is the sweet gentle womanly spirit of the angelas telling a fellow he was getting a double chin  did she do that  she did  oh well girls will be girls forget it tuppy go to her and make it up  he shook his head  no it is too late remarks have been passed about my tummy which it is impossible to overlook  but tummytuppy i meanbe fair you once told her her new hat made her look like a pekingese  it did make her look like a pekingese that was not vulgar abuse it was sound constructive criticism with no motive behind it but the kindly desire to keep her from making an exhibition of herself in public wantonly to accuse a man of puffing when he goes up a flight of stairs is something very different  i began to see that the situation would require all my address and ingenuity if the wedding bells were ever to ring out in the little church of market snodsbury bertram had plainly got to put in some shrewdish work i had gathered during my conversation with aunt dahlia that there had been a certain amount of frank speech between the two contracting parties but i had not realized till now that matters had gone so far  the pathos of the thing gave me the pip tuppy had admitted in so many words that love still animated the glossop bosom and i was convinced that even after all that occurred angela had not ceased to love him at the moment no doubt she might be wishing that she could hit him with a bottle but deep down in her i was prepared to bet that there still lingered all the old affection and tenderness only injured pride was keeping these two apart and i felt that if tuppy would make the first move all would be well  i had another whack at it  shes brokenhearted about this rift tuppy  how do you know have you seen her  no but ill bet she is  she doesnt look it  wearing the mask no doubt jeeves does that when i assert my authority  she wrinkles her nose at me as if i were a drain that had got out of order  merely the mask i feel convinced she loves you still and that a kindly word from you is all that is required  i could see that this had moved him he plainly wavered he did a sort of twiddly on the turf with his foot and when he spoke one spotted the tremolo in the voice  you really think that  absolutely  hm  if you were to go to her  he shook his head  i cant do that it would be fatal bing instantly would go my prestige i know girls grovel and the best of them get uppish he mused the only way to work the thing would be by tipping her off in some indirect way that i am prepared to open negotiations should i sigh a bit when we meet do you think  she would think you were puffing  thats true  i lit another cigarette and gave my mind to the matter and first crack out of the box as is so often the way with the woosters i got an idea i remembered the counsel i had given gussie in the matter of the sausages and ham  ive got it tuppy there is one infallible method of indicating to a girl that you love her and it works just as well when youve had a row and want to make it up dont eat any dinner tonight you can see how impressive that would be she knows how devoted you are to food  he started violently  i am not devoted to food  no no  i am not devoted to food at all  quite all i meant  this rot about me being devoted to food said tuppy warmly has got to stop i am young and healthy and have a good appetite but thats not the same as being devoted to food i admire anatole as a master of his craft and am always willing to consider anything he may put before me but when you say i am devoted to food  quite quite all i meant was that if she sees you push away your dinner untasted she will realize that your heart is aching and will probably be the first to suggest blowing the all clear  tuppy was frowning thoughtfully  push my dinner away eh  yes  push away a dinner cooked by anatole  yes  push it away untasted  yes  let us get this straight tonight at dinner when the butler offers me a ris de veau à la financiere or whatever it may be hot from anatoles hands you wish me to push it away untasted  yes  he chewed his lip one could sense the struggle going on within and then suddenly a sort of glow came into his face the old martyrs probably used to look like that  all right  youll do it  i will  fine  of course it will be agony  i pointed out the silver lining  only for the moment you could slip down tonight after everyone is in bed and raid the larder  he brightened  thats right i could couldnt i  i expect there would be something cold there  there is something cold there said tuppy with growing cheerfulness a steakandkidney pie we had it for lunch today one of anatoles ripest the thing i admire about that man said tuppy reverently the thing that i admire so enormously about anatole is that though a frenchman he does not like so many of these chefs confine himself exclusively to french dishes but is always willing and ready to weigh in with some good old simple english fare such as this steakandkidney pie to which i have alluded a masterly pie bertie and it wasnt more than half finished it will do me nicely  and at dinner you will push as arranged  absolutely as arranged  fine  its an excellent idea one of jeevess best you can tell him from me when you see him that im much obliged  the cigarette fell from my fingers it was as though somebody had slapped bertram wooster across the face with a wet dishrag  you arent suggesting that you think this scheme i have been sketching out is jeevess  of course it is its no good trying to kid me bertie you wouldnt have thought of a wheeze like that in a million years  there was a pause i drew myself up to my full height then seeing that he wasnt looking at me lowered myself again  come glossop i said coldly we had better be going it is time we were dressing for dinner    9   tuppys fatheaded words were still rankling in my bosom as i went up to my room they continued rankling as i shed the formfitting and had not ceased to rankle when clad in the old dressinggown i made my way along the corridor to the salle de bain  it is not too much to say that i was piqued to the tonsils  i mean to say one does not court praise the adulation of the multitude means very little to one but all the same when one has taken the trouble to whack out a highly juicy scheme to benefit an inthesoup friend in his hour of travail its pretty foul to find him giving the credit to ones personal attendant particularly if that personal attendant is a man who goes about the place not packing messjackets  but after i had been splashing about in the porcelain for a bit composure began to return i have always found that in moments of heartboweddownness there is nothing that calms the bruised spirit like a good go at the soap and water i dont say i actually sang in the tub but there were times when it was a mere spin of the coin whether i would do so or not  the spiritual anguish induced by that tactless speech had become noticeably lessened  the discovery of a toy duck in the soap dish presumably the property of some former juvenile visitor contributed not a little to this new and happier frame of mind what with one thing and another i hadnt played with toy ducks in my bath for years and i found the novel experience most invigorating for the benefit of those interested i may mention that if you shove the thing under the surface with the sponge and then let it go it shoots out of the water in a manner calculated to divert the most careworn ten minutes of this and i was enabled to return to the bedchamber much more the old merry bertram  jeeves was there laying out the dinner disguise he greeted the young master with his customary suavity  good evening sir  i responded in the same affable key  good evening jeeves  i trust you had a pleasant drive sir  very pleasant thank you jeeves hand me a sock or two will you  he did so and i commenced to don  well jeeves i said reaching for the underlinen here we are again at brinkley court in the county of worcestershire  yes sir  a nice mess things seem to have gone and got themselves into in this rustic joint  yes sir  the rift between tuppy glossop and my cousin angela would appear to be serious  yes sir opinion in the servants hall is inclined to take a grave view of the situation  and the thought that springs to your mind no doubt is that i shall have my work cut out to fix things up  yes sir  you are wrong jeeves i have the thing well in hand  you surprise me sir  i thought i should yes jeeves i pondered on the matter most of the way down here and with the happiest results i have just been in conference with mr glossop and everything is taped out  indeed sir might i inquire  you know my methods jeeves apply them have you i asked slipping into the shirt and starting to adjust the cravat been gnawing on the thing at all  oh yes sir i have always been much attached to miss angela and i felt that it would afford me great pleasure were i to be able to be of service to her  a laudable sentiment but i suppose you drew blank  no sir i was rewarded with an idea  what was it  it occurred to me that a reconciliation might be effected between mr glossop and miss angela by appealing to that instinct which prompts gentlemen in time of peril to hasten to the rescue of  i had to let go of the cravat in order to raise a hand i was shocked  dont tell me you were contemplating descending to that old hesavedherfromdrowning gag i am surprised jeeves surprised and pained when i was discussing the matter with aunt dahlia on my arrival she said in a sniffy sort of way that she supposed i was going to shove my cousin angela into the lake and push tuppy in to haul her out and i let her see pretty clearly that i considered the suggestion an insult to my intelligence and now if your words have the meaning i read into them you are mooting precisely the same drivelling scheme really jeeves  no sir not that but the thought did cross my mind as i walked in the grounds and passed the building where the firebell hangs that a sudden alarm of fire in the night might result in mr glossop endeavouring to assist miss angela to safety  i shivered  rotten jeeves  well sir  no good not a bit like it  i fancy sir  no jeeves no more enough has been said let us drop the subj  i finished tying the tie in silence my emotions were too deep for speech i knew of course that this man had for the time being lost his grip but i had never suspected that he had gone absolutely to pieces like this remembering some of the swift ones he had pulled in the past i shrank with horror from the spectacle of his present ineptitude or is it ineptness i mean this frightful disposition of his to stick straws in his hair and talk like a perfect ass it was the old old story i supposed a mans brain whizzes along for years exceeding the speed limit and something suddenly goes wrong with the steeringgear and it skids and comes a smeller in the ditch  a bit elaborate i said trying to put the thing in as kindly a light as possible your old failing you can see that its a bit elaborate  possibly the plan i suggested might be considered open to that criticism sir but faute de mieux  i dont get you jeeves  a french expression sir signifying for want of anything better  a moment before i had been feeling for this wreck of a once fine thinker nothing but a gentle pity these words jarred the wooster pride inducing asperity  i understand perfectly well what faute de mieux means jeeves i did not recently spend two months among our gallic neighbours for nothing besides i remember that one from school what caused my bewilderment was that you should be employing the expression well knowing that there is no bally faute de mieux about it at all where do you get that fautedemieux stuff didnt i tell you i had everything taped out  yes sir but  what do you meanbut  well sir  push on jeeves i am ready even anxious to hear your views  well sir if i may take the liberty of reminding you of it your plans in the past have not always been uniformly successful  there was a silencerather a throbbing oneduring which i put on my waistcoat in a marked manner not till i had got the buckle at the back satisfactorily adjusted did i speak  it is true jeeves i said formally that once or twice in the past i may have missed the bus this however i attribute purely to bad luck  indeed sir  on the present occasion i shall not fail and ill tell you why i shall not fail because my scheme is rooted in human nature  indeed sir  it is simple not elaborate and furthermore based on the psychology of the individual  indeed sir  jeeves i said dont keep saying indeed sir no doubt nothing is further from your mind than to convey such a suggestion but you have a way of stressing the in and then coming down with a thud on the deed which makes it virtually tantamount to oh yeah correct this jeeves  very good sir  i tell you i have everything nicely lined up would you care to hear what steps i have taken  very much sir  then listen tonight at dinner i have recommended tuppy to lay off the food  sir  tut jeeves surely you can follow the idea even though it is one that would never have occurred to yourself have you forgotten that telegram i sent to gussie finknottle steering him away from the sausages and ham this is the same thing pushing the food away untasted is a universally recognized sign of love it cannot fail to bring home the gravy you must see that  well sir  i frowned  i dont want to seem always to be criticizing your methods of voice production jeeves i said but i must inform you that that well sir of yours is in many respects fully as unpleasant as your indeed sir like the latter it seems to be tinged with a definite scepticism it suggests a lack of faith in my vision the impression i retain after hearing you shoot it at me a couple of times is that you consider me to be talking through the back of my neck and that only a feudal sense of what is fitting restrains you from substituting for it the words says you  oh no sir  well thats what it sounds like why dont you think this scheme will work  i fear miss angela will merely attribute mr glossops abstinence to indigestion sir  i hadnt thought of that and i must confess it shook me for a moment then i recovered myself i saw what was at the bottom of all this mortified by the consciousness of his own ineptnessor ineptitudethe fellow was simply trying to hamper and obstruct i decided to knock the stuffing out of him without further preamble  oh i said you do do you well be that as it may it doesnt alter the fact that youve put out the wrong coat be so good jeeves i said indicating with a gesture the gents ordinary dinner jacket or smoking as we call it on the côte dazur which was suspended from the hanger on the knob of the wardrobe as to shove that bally black thing in the cupboard and bring out my white messjacket with the brass buttons  he looked at me in a meaning manner and when i say a meaning manner i mean there was a respectful but at the same time uppish glint in his eye and a sort of muscular spasm flickered across his face which wasnt quite a quiet smile and yet wasnt quite not a quiet smile also the soft cough  i regret to say sir that i inadvertently omitted to pack the garment to which you refer  the vision of that parcel in the hall seemed to rise before my eyes and i exchanged a merry wink with it i may even have hummed a bar or two im not quite sure  i know you did jeeves i said laughing down from lazy eyelids and nicking a speck of dust from the irreproachable mechlin lace at my wrists but i didnt you will find it on a chair in the hall in a brownpaper parcel  the information that his low manoeuvres had been rendered null and void and that the thing was on the strength after all must have been the nastiest of jars but there was no play of expression on his finely chiselled to indicate it there very seldom is on jeevess fc in moments of discomfort as i had told tuppy he wears a mask preserving throughout the quiet stolidity of a stuffed moose  you might just slide down and fetch it will you  very good sir  right ho jeeves  and presently i was sauntering towards the drawingroom with me good old j nestling snugly abaft the shoulder blades  and dahlia was in the drawingroom she glanced up at my entrance  hullo eyesore she said what do you think youre made up as  i did not get the purport  the jacket you mean i queried groping  i do you look like one of the chorus of male guests at abernethy towers in act 2 of a touring musical comedy  you do not admire this jacket  i do not  you did at cannes  well this isnt cannes  but dash it  oh never mind let it go if you want to give my butler a laugh what does it matter what does anything matter now  there was a deathwhereisthystingfullness about her manner which i found distasteful it isnt often that i score off jeeves in the devastating fashion just described and when i do i like to see happy smiling faces about me  tails up aunt dahlia i urged buoyantly  tails up be dashed was her sombre response ive just been talking to tom  telling him  no listening to him i havent had the nerve to tell him yet  is he still upset about that incometax money  upset is right he says that civilisation is in the meltingpot and that all thinking men can read the writing on the wall  what wall  old testament ass belshazzars feast  oh that yes ive often wondered how that gag was worked with mirrors i expect  i wish i could use mirrors to break it to tom about this baccarat business  i had a word of comfort to offer here i had been turning the thing over in my mind since our last meeting and i thought i saw where she had got twisted where she made her error it seemed to me was in feeling she had got to tell uncle tom to my way of thinking the matter was one on which it would be better to continue to exercise a quiet reserve  i dont see why you need mention that you lost that money at baccarat  what do you suggest then letting miladys boudoir join civilisation in the meltingpot because that is what it will infallibly do unless i get a cheque by next week the printers have been showing a nasty spirit for months  you dont follow listen its an understood thing i take it that uncle tom foots the boudoir bills if the bally sheet has been turning the corner for two years he must have got used to forking out by this time well simply ask him for the money to pay the printers  i did just before i went to cannes  wouldnt he give it to you  certainly he gave it to me he brassed up like an officer and a gentleman that was the money i lost at baccarat  oh i didnt know that  there isnt much you do know  a nephews love made me overlook the slur  tut i said  what did you say  i said tut  say it once again and ill biff you where you stand ive enough to endure without being tutted at  quite  any tutting thats required ill attend to myself and the same applies to clicking the tongue if you were thinking of doing that  far from it  good  i stood awhile in thought i was concerned to the core my heart if you remember had already bled once for aunt dahlia this evening it now bled again i knew how deeply attached she was to this paper of hers seeing it go down the drain would be for her like watching a loved child sink for the third time in some pond or mere  and there was no question that unless carefully prepared for the touch uncle tom would see a hundred miladys boudoirs go phut rather than take the rap  then i saw how the thing could be handled this aunt i perceived must fall into line with my other clients tuppy glossop was knocking off dinner to melt angela gussie finknottle was knocking off dinner to impress the bassett aunt dahlia must knock off dinner to soften uncle tom for the beauty of this scheme of mine was that there was no limit to the number of entrants come one come all the more the merrier and satisfaction guaranteed in every case  ive got it i said there is only one course to pursue eat less meat  she looked at me in a pleading sort of way i wouldnt swear that her eyes were wet with unshed tears but i rather think they were certainly she clasped her hands in piteous appeal  must you drivel bertie wont you stop it just this once just for tonight to please aunt dahlia  im not drivelling  i dare say that to a man of your high standards it doesnt come under the head of drivel but  i saw what had happened i hadnt made myself quite clear  its all right i said have no misgivings this is the real tabasco when i said eat less meat what i meant was that you must refuse your oats at dinner tonight just sit there looking blistered and wave away each course as it comes with a weary gesture of resignation you see what will happen uncle tom will notice your loss of appetite and i am prepared to bet that at the conclusion of the meal he will come to you and say dahlia darlingi take it he calls you dahliadahlia darling he will say i noticed at dinner tonight that you were a bit off your feed is anything the matter dahlia darling why yes tom darling you will reply it is kind of you to ask darling the fact is darling i am terribly worried my darling he will say  aunt dahlia interrupted at this point to observe that these traverses seemed to be a pretty soppy couple of blighters to judge by their dialogue she also wished to know when i was going to get to the point  i gave her a look  my darling he will say tenderly is there anything i can do to which your reply will be that there jolly well isviz reach for his chequebook and start writing  i was watching her closely as i spoke and was pleased to note respect suddenly dawn in her eyes  but bertie this is positively bright  i told you jeeves wasnt the only fellow with brain  i believe it would work  its bound to work ive recommended it to tuppy  young glossop  in order to soften angela  splendid  and to gussie finknottle who wants to make a hit with the bassett  well well well what a busy little brain it is  always working aunt dahlia always working  youre not the chump i took you for bertie  when did you ever take me for a chump  oh some time last summer i forget what gave me the idea yes bertie this scheme is bright i suppose as a matter of fact jeeves suggested it  jeeves did not suggest it i resent these implications jeeves had nothing to do with it whatsoever  well all right no need to get excited about it yes i think it will work toms devoted to me  who wouldnt be  ill do it  and then the rest of the party trickled in and we toddled down to dinner  conditions being as they were at brinkley courti mean to say the place being loaded down above the plimsoll mark with aching hearts and standing room only as regarded tortured soulsi hadnt expected the evening meal to be particularly effervescent nor was it silent sombre the whole thing more than a bit like christmas dinner on devils island  i was glad when it was over  what with having on top of her other troubles to rein herself back from the trough aunt dahlia was a total loss as far as anything in the shape of brilliant badinage was concerned the fact that he was fifty quid in the red and expecting civilisation to take a toss at any moment had caused uncle tom who always looked a bit like a pterodactyl with a secret sorrow to take on a deeper melancholy the bassett was a silent bread crumbler angela might have been hewn from the living rock tuppy had the air of a condemned murderer refusing to make the usual hearty breakfast before tooling off to the execution shed  and as for gussie finknottle many an experienced undertaker would have been deceived by his appearance and started embalming him on sight  this was the first glimpse i had had of gussie since we parted at my flat and i must say his demeanour disappointed me i had been expecting something a great deal more sparkling  at my flat on the occasion alluded to he had if you recall practically given me a signed guarantee that all he needed to touch him off was a rural setting yet in this aspect now i could detect no indication whatsoever that he was about to round into midseason form he still looked like a cat in an adage and it did not take me long to realise that my very first act on escaping from this morgue must be to draw him aside and give him a pep talk  if ever a chap wanted the clarion note it looked as if it was this finknottle  in the general exodus of mourners however i lost sight of him and owing to the fact that aunt dahlia roped me in for a game of backgammon it was not immediately that i was able to institute a search but after we had been playing for a while the butler came in and asked her if she would speak to anatole so i managed to get away and some ten minutes later having failed to find scent in the house i started to throw out the dragnet through the grounds and flushed him in the rose garden  he was smelling a rose at the moment in a limp sort of way but removed the beak as i approached  well gussie i said  i had beamed genially upon him as i spoke such being my customary policy on meeting an old pal but instead of beaming back genially he gave me a most unpleasant look his attitude perplexed me it was as if he were not glad to see bertram for a moment he stood letting this unpleasant look play upon me as it were and then he spoke  you and your well gussie  he said this between clenched teeth always an unmatey thing to do and i found myself more fogged than ever  how do you meanme and my well gussie  i like your nerve coming bounding about the place saying well gussie thats about all the well gussie i shall require from you wooster and its no good looking like that you know what i mean that damned prizegiving it was a dastardly act to crawl out as you did and shove it off on to me i will not mince my words it was the act of a hound and a stinker  now though as i have shown i had devoted most of the time on the journey down to meditating upon the case of angela and tuppy i had not neglected to give a thought or two to what i was going to say when i encountered gussie i had foreseen that there might be some little temporary unpleasantness when we met and when a difficult interview is in the offing bertram wooster likes to have his story ready  so now i was able to reply with a manly disarming frankness the sudden introduction of the topic had given me a bit of a jolt it is true for in the stress of recent happenings i had rather let that prizegiving business slide to the back of my mind but i had speedily recovered and as i say was able to reply with a manly df  but my dear chap i said i took it for granted that you would understand that that was all part of my schemes  he said something about my schemes which i did not catch  absolutely crawling out is entirely the wrong way to put it you dont suppose i didnt want to distribute those prizes do you left to myself there is nothing i would find a greater treat but i saw that the square generous thing to do was to step aside and let you take it on so i did so i felt that your need was greater than mine you dont mean to say you arent looking forward to it  he uttered a coarse expression which i wouldnt have thought he would have known it just shows that you can bury yourself in the country and still somehow acquire a vocabulary no doubt one picks up things from the neighboursthe vicar the local doctor the man who brings the milk and so on  but dash it i said cant you see what this is going to do for you it will send your stock up with a jump there you will be up on that platform a romantic impressive figure the star of the whole proceedings the whatdyoucallit of all eyes madeline bassett will be all over you she will see you in a totally new light  she will will she  certainly she will augustus finknottle the newts friend she knows she is acquainted with augustus finknottle the dogs chiropodist but augustus finknottle the oratorthatll knock her sideways or i know nothing of the female heart girls go potty over a public man if ever anyone did anyone else a kindness it was i when i gave this extraordinary attractive assignment to you  he seemed impressed by my eloquence couldnt have helped himself of course the fire faded from behind his hornrimmed spectacles and in its place appeared the old fishlike goggle  myes he said meditatively have you ever made a speech bertie  dozens of times its pie nothing to it why i once addressed a girls school  you werent nervous  not a bit  how did you go  they hung on my lips i held them in the hollow of my hand  they didnt throw eggs or anything  not a thing  he expelled a deep breath and for a space stood staring in silence at a passing slug  well he said at length it may be all right possibly i am letting the thing prey on my mind too much i may be wrong in supposing it the fate that is worse than death but ill tell you this much the prospect of that prizegiving on the thirtyfirst of this month has been turning my existence into a nightmare i havent been able to sleep or think or eat  by the way that reminds me you never explained that cipher telegram about the sausages and ham  it wasnt a cipher telegram i wanted you to go light on the food so that she would realize you were in love  he laughed hollowly  i see well ive been doing that all right  yes i was noticing at dinner splendid  i dont see whats splendid about it its not going to get me anywhere i shall never be able to ask her to marry me i couldnt find nerve to do that if i lived on wafer biscuits for the rest of my life  but dash it gussie in these romantic surroundings i should have thought the whispering trees alone  i dont care what you would have thought i cant do it  oh come  i cant she seems so aloof so remote  she doesnt  yes she does especially when you see her sideways have you seen her sideways bertie that cold pure profile it just takes all the heart out of one  it doesnt  i tell you it does i catch sight of it and the words freeze on my lips  he spoke with a sort of dull despair and so manifest was his lack of ginger and the spirit that wins to success that for an instant i confess i felt a bit stymied it seemed hopeless to go on trying to steam up such a human jellyfish then i saw the way with that extraordinary quickness of mine i realized exactly what must be done if this finknottle was to be enabled to push his nose past the judges box  she must be softened up i said  be what  softened up sweetened worked on preliminary spadework must be put in here gussie is the procedure i propose to adopt i shall now return to the house and lug this bassett out for a stroll i shall talk to her of hearts that yearn intimating that there is one actually on the premises i shall pitch it strong sparing no effort you meanwhile will lurk on the outskirts and in about a quarter of an hour you will come along and carry on from there by that time her emotions having been stirred you ought to be able to do the rest on your head it will be like leaping on to a moving bus  i remember when i was a kid at school having to learn a poem of sorts about a fellow named pigsomethinga sculptor he would have been no doubtwho made a statue of a girl and what should happen one morning but that the bally thing suddenly came to life a pretty nasty shock for the chap of course but the point im working round to is that there were a couple of lines that went if i remember correctly  she starts she moves she seems to feel the stir of life along her keel  and what im driving at is that you couldnt get a better description of what happened to gussie as i spoke these heartening words his brow cleared his eyes brightened he lost that fishy look and he gazed at the slug which was still on the long long trail with something approaching bonhomie a marked improvement  i see what you mean you will sort of pave the way as it were  thats right spadework  its a terrific idea bertie it will make all the difference  quite but dont forget that after that it will be up to you you will have to haul up your slacks and give her the old oil or my efforts will have been in vain  something of his former gawdhelpusness seemed to return to him he gasped a bit  thats true what the dickens shall i say  i restrained my impatience with an effort the man had been at school with me  dash it there are hundreds of things you can say talk about the sunset  the sunset  certainly half the married men you meet began by talking about the sunset  but what can i say about the sunset  well jeeves got off a good one the other day i met him airing the dog in the park one evening and he said now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight sir and all the air a solemn stillness holds you might use that  what sort of landscape  glimmering g for gastritis l for lizard  oh glimmering yes thats not bad glimmering landscape  solemn stillness yes i call that pretty good  you could then say that you have often thought that the stars are gods daisy chain  but i havent  i dare say not but she has hand her that one and i dont see how she can help feeling that youre a twin soul  gods daisy chain  gods daisy chain and then you go on about how twilight always makes you sad i know youre going to say it doesnt but on this occasion it has jolly well got to  why  thats just what she will ask and you will then have got her going because you will reply that it is because yours is such a lonely life it wouldnt be a bad idea to give her a brief description of a typical home evening at your lincolnshire residence showing how you pace the meadows with a heavy tread  i generally sit indoors and listen to the wireless  no you dont you pace the meadows with a heavy tread wishing that you had someone to love you and then you speak of the day when she came into your life  like a fairy princess  absolutely i said with approval i hadnt expected such a hot one from such a quarter like a fairy princess nice work gussie  and then  well after that its easy you say you have something you want to say to her and then you snap into it i dont see how it can fail if i were you i should do it in this rose garden it is well established that there is no sounder move than to steer the adored object into rose gardens in the gloaming and you had better have a couple of quick ones first  quick ones  snifters  drinks do you mean but i dont drink  what  ive never touched a drop in my life  this made me a bit dubious i must confess on these occasions it is generally conceded that a moderate skinful is of the essence  however if the facts were as he had stated i supposed there was nothing to be done about it  well youll have to make out as best you can on ginger pop  i always drink orange juice  orange juice then tell me gussie to settle a bet do you really like that muck  very much  then there is no more to be said now lets just have a run through to see that youve got the layout straight start off with the glimmering landscape  stars gods daisy chain  twilight makes you feel sad  because mine lonely life  describe life  talk about the day i met her  add fairyprincess gag say theres something you want to say to her heave a couple of sighs grab her hand and give her the works right  and confident that he had grasped the scenario and that everything might now be expected to proceed through the proper channels i picked up the feet and hastened back to the house  it was not until i had reached the drawingroom and was enabled to take a square look at the bassett that i found the debonair gaiety with which i had embarked on this affair beginning to wane a trifle beholding her at close range like this i suddenly became cognisant of what i was in for the thought of strolling with this rummy specimen undeniably gave me a most unpleasant sinking feeling i could not but remember how often when in her company at cannes i had gazed dumbly at her wishing that some kindly motorist in a racing car would ease the situation by coming along and ramming her amidships as i have already made abundantly clear this girl was not one of my most congenial buddies  however a woosters word is his bond woosters may quail but they do not edge out only the keenest ear could have detected the tremor in the voice as i asked her if she would care to come out for half an hour  lovely evening i said  yes lovely isnt it  lovely reminds me of cannes  how lovely the evenings were there  lovely i said  lovely said the bassett  lovely i agreed  that completed the weather and news bulletin for the french riviera another minute and we were out in the great open spaces she cooing a bit about the scenery and self replying oh rather quite and wondering how best to approach the matter in hand    10   how different it all would have been i could not but reflect if this girl had been the sort of girl one chirrups cheerily to over the telephone and takes for spins in the old twoseater in that case i would simply have said listen and she would have said what and i would have said you know gussie finknottle and she would have said yes and i would have said he loves you and she would have said either what that mutt well thank heaven for one good laugh today or else in more passionate vein hot dog tell me more  i mean to say in either event the whole thing over and done with in under a minute  but with the bassett something less snappy and a good deal more glutinous was obviously indicated what with all this daylightsaving stuff we had hit the great open spaces at a moment when twilight had not yet begun to cheese it in favour of the shades of night there was a fagend of sunset still functioning stars were beginning to peep out bats were fooling round the garden was full of the aroma of those niffy white flowers which only start to put in their heavy work at the end of the dayin short the glimmering landscape was fading on the sight and all the air held a solemn stillness and it was plain that this was having the worst effect on her her eyes were enlarged and her whole map a good deal too suggestive of the souls awakening for comfort  her aspect was that of a girl who was expecting something fairly fruity from bertram  in these circs conversation inevitably flagged a bit i am never at my best when the situation seems to call for a certain soupiness and ive heard other members of the drones say the same thing about themselves i remember pongo twistleton telling me that he was out in a gondola with a girl by moonlight once and the only time he spoke was to tell her that old story about the chap who was so good at swimming that they made him a traffic cop in venice  fell rather flat he assured me and it wasnt much later when the girl said she thought it was getting a little chilly and how about pushing back to the hotel  so now as i say the talk rather hung fire it had been all very well for me to promise gussie that i would cut loose to this girl about aching hearts but you want a cue for that sort of thing and when toddling along we reached the edge of the lake and she finally spoke conceive my chagrin when i discovered that what she was talking about was stars  not a bit of good to me  oh look she said she was a confirmed ohlooker i had noticed this at cannes where she had drawn my attention in this manner on various occasions to such diverse objects as a french actress a provençal filling station the sunset over the estorels michael arlen a man selling coloured spectacles the deep velvet blue of the mediterranean and the late mayor of new york in a striped onepiece bathing suit oh look at that sweet little star up there all by itself  i saw the one she meant a little chap operating in a detached sort of way above a spinney  yes i said  i wonder if it feels lonely  oh i shouldnt think so  a fairy must have been crying  eh  dont you remember every time a fairy sheds a tear a wee bit star is born in the milky way have you ever thought that mr wooster  i never had most improbable i considered and it didnt seem to me to check up with her statement that the stars were gods daisy chain i mean you cant have it both ways  however i was in no mood to dissect and criticize i saw that i had been wrong in supposing that the stars were not germane to the issue quite a decent cue they had provided and i leaped on it promptly talking of shedding tears  but she was now on the subject of rabbits several of which were messing about in the park to our right  oh look the little bunnies  talking of shedding tears  dont you love this time of the evening mr wooster when the sun has gone to bed and all the bunnies come out to have their little suppers when i was a child i used to think that rabbits were gnomes and that if i held my breath and stayed quite still i should see the fairy queen  indicating with a reserved gesture that this was just the sort of loony thing i should have expected her to think as a child i returned to the point  talking of shedding tears i said firmly it may interest you to know that there is an aching heart in brinkley court  this held her she cheesed the rabbit theme her face which had been aglow with what i supposed was a pretty animation clouded she unshipped a sigh that sounded like the wind going out of a rubber duck  ah yes life is very sad isnt it  it is for some people this aching heart for instance  those wistful eyes of hers drenched irises and they used to dance like elves of delight and all through a foolish misunderstanding about a shark what a tragedy misunderstandings are that pretty romance broken and over just because mr glossop would insist that it was a flatfish  i saw that she had got the wires crossed  im not talking about angela  but her heart is aching  i know its aching but so is somebody elses  she looked at me perplexed  somebody else mr glossops you mean  no i dont  mrs traverss  the exquisite code of politeness of the woosters prevented me clipping her one on the earhole but i would have given a shilling to be able to do it there seemed to me something deliberately fatheaded in the way she persisted in missing the gist  no not aunt dahlias either  im sure she is dreadfully upset  quite but this heart im talking about isnt aching because of tuppys row with angela its aching for a different reason altogether i mean to saydash it you know why hearts ache  she seemed to shimmy a bit her voice when she spoke was whispery you meanfor love  absolutely right on the bullseye for love  oh mr wooster  i take it you believe in love at first sight  i do indeed  well thats what happened to this aching heart it fell in love at first sight and ever since its been eating itself out as i believe the expression is  there was a silence she had turned away and was watching a duck out on the lake it was tucking into weeds a thing ive never been able to understand anyone wanting to do though i suppose if you face it squarely theyre no worse than spinach she stood drinking it in for a bit and then it suddenly stood on its head and disappeared and this seemed to break the spell  oh mr wooster she said again and from the tone of her voice i could see that i had got her going  for you i mean to say i proceeded starting to put in the fancy touches i dare say you have noticed on these occasions that the difficulty is to plant the main idea to get the general outline of the thing well fixed the rest is mere detail work i dont say i became glib at this juncture but i certainly became a dashed glibber than i had been  its having the dickens of a time cant eat cant sleepall for love of you and what makes it all so particularly rotten is that itthis aching heartcant bring itself up to the scratch and tell you the position of affairs because your profile has gone and given it cold feet just as it is about to speak it catches sight of you sideways and words fail it silly of course but there it is  i heard her give a gulp and i saw that her eyes had become moistish drenched irises if you care to put it that way  lend you a handkerchief  no thank you im quite all right  it was more than i could say for myself my efforts had left me weak i dont know if you suffer in the same way but with me the act of talking anything in the nature of real mashed potatoes always induces a sort of prickly sensation and a hideous feeling of shame together with a marked starting of the pores  i remember at my aunt agathas place in hertfordshire once being put on the spot and forced to enact the role of king edward iii saying goodbye to that girl of his fair rosamund at some sort of pageant in aid of the distressed daughters of the clergy it involved some rather warmish medieval dialogue i recall racy of the days when they called a spade a spade and by the time the whistle blew ill bet no daughter of the clergy was half as distressed as i was not a dry stitch  my reaction now was very similar it was a highly liquid bertram who hearing his visàvis give a couple of hiccups and start to speak bent an attentive ear  please dont say any more mr wooster  well i wasnt going to of course  i understand  i was glad to hear this  yes i understand i wont be so silly as to pretend not to know what you mean i suspected this at cannes when you used to stand and stare at me without speaking a word but with whole volumes in your eyes  if angelas shark had bitten me in the leg i couldnt have leaped more convulsively so tensely had i been concentrating on gussies interests that it hadnt so much as crossed my mind that another and an unfortunate construction could be placed on those words of mine the persp already bedewing my brow became a regular niagara  my whole fate hung upon a womans word i mean to say i couldnt back out if a girl thinks a man is proposing to her and on that understanding books him up he cant explain to her that she has got hold of entirely the wrong end of the stick and that he hadnt the smallest intention of suggesting anything of the kind he must simply let it ride and the thought of being engaged to a girl who talked openly about fairies being born because stars blew their noses or whatever it was frankly appalled me  she was carrying on with her remarks and as i listened i clenched my fists till i shouldnt wonder if the knuckles didnt stand out white under the strain it seemed as if she would never get to the nub  yes all through those days at cannes i could see what you were trying to say a girl always knows and then you followed me down here and there was that same dumb yearning look in your eyes when we met this evening and then you were so insistent that i should come out and walk with you in the twilight and now you stammer out those halting words no this does not come as a surprise but i am sorry  the word was like one of jeevess pickmeups just as if a glassful of meat sauce red pepper and the yolk of an eggthough as i say i am convinced that these are not the sole ingredientshad been shot into me i expanded like some lovely flower blossoming in the sunshine it was all right after all my guardian angel had not been asleep at the switch  but i am afraid it is impossible  she paused  impossible she repeated  i had been so busy feeling saved from the scaffold that i didnt get on to it for a moment that an early reply was desired  oh right ho i said hastily  im sorry  quite all right  sorrier than i can say  dont give it another thought  we can still be friends  oh rather  then shall we just say no more about it keep what has happened as a tender little secret between ourselves  absolutely  we will like something lovely and fragrant laid away in lavender  in lavenderright  there was a longish pause she was gazing at me in a divinely pitying sort of way much as if i had been a snail she had happened accidentally to bring her short french vamp down on and i longed to tell her that it was all right and that bertram so far from being the victim of despair had never felt fizzier in his life but of course one cant do that sort of thing i simply said nothing and stood there looking brave  i wish i could she murmured  could i said for my attensh had been wandering  feel towards you as you would like me to feel  oh ah  but i cant im sorry  absolutely ok faults on both sides no doubt  because i am fond of you mrno i think i must call you bertie may i  oh rather  because we are real friends  quite  i do like you bertie and if things were differenti wonder  eh  after all we are real friends we have this common memory you have a right to know i dont want you to thinklife is such a muddle isnt it  to many men no doubt these broken utterances would have appeared mere drooling and would have been dismissed as such but the woosters are quickerwitted than the ordinary and can read between the lines i suddenly divined what it was that she was trying to get off the chest  you mean theres someone else  she nodded  youre in love with some other bloke  she nodded  engaged what  this time she shook the pumpkin  no not engaged  well that was something of course nevertheless from the way she spoke it certainly looked as if poor old gussie might as well scratch his name off the entry list and i didnt at all like the prospect of having to break the bad news to him i had studied the man closely and it was my conviction that this would about be his finish  gussie you see wasnt like some of my palsthe name of bingo little is one that springs to the lipswho if turned down by a girl would simply say well bungoh and toddle off quite happily to find another he was so manifestly a bird who having failed to score in the first chukker would turn the thing up and spend the rest of his life brooding over his newts and growing long grey whiskers like one of those chaps you read about in novels who live in the great white house you can just see over there through the trees and shut themselves off from the world and have pained faces  im afraid he doesnt care for me in that way at least he has said nothing you understand that i am only telling you this because  oh rather  its odd that you should have asked me if i believed in love at first sight she half closed her eyes who ever loved that loved not at first sight she said in a rummy voice that brought back to mei dont know whythe picture of my aunt agatha as boadicea reciting at that pageant i was speaking of its a silly little story i was staying with some friends in the country and i had gone for a walk with my dog and the poor wee mite got a nasty thorn in his little foot and i didnt know what to do and then suddenly this man came along  harking back once again to that pageant in sketching out for you my emotions on that occasion i showed you only the darker side of the picture there was i should now mention a splendid aftermath when having climbed out of my suit of chain mail and sneaked off to the local pub i entered the saloon bar and requested mine host to start pouring a moment later a tankard of their special homebrewed was in my hand and the ecstasy of that first gollup is still green in my memory the recollection of the agony through which i had passed was just what was needed to make it perfect  it was the same now when i realized listening to her words that she must be referring to gussiei mean to say there couldnt have been a whole platoon of men taking thorns out of her dog that day the animal wasnt a pincushionand became aware that gussie who an instant before had to all appearances gone so far back in the betting as not to be worth a quotation was the big winner after all a positive thrill permeated the frame and there escaped my lips a wow so crisp and hearty that the bassett leaped a liberal inch and a half from terra firma  i beg your pardon she said  i waved a jaunty hand  nothing i said nothing just remembered theres a letter i have to write tonight without fail if you dont mind i think ill be going in here i said comes gussie finknottle he will look after you  and as i spoke gussie came sidling out from behind a tree  i passed away and left them to it as regards these two everything was beyond a question absolutely in order all gussie had to do was keep his head down and not press already i felt as i legged it back to the house the happy ending must have begun to function i mean to say when you leave a girl and a man each of whom has admitted in set terms that she and he loves him and her in close juxtaposition in the twilight there doesnt seem much more to do but start pricing fish slices  something attempted something done seemed to me to have earned twopennorth of wassail in the smokingroom  i proceeded thither    11   the makings were neatly laid out on a sidetable and to pour into a glass an inch or so of the raw spirit and shoosh some sodawater on top of it was with me the work of a moment this done i retired to an armchair and put my feet up sipping the mixture with carefree enjoyment rather like caesar having one in his tent the day he overcame the nervii  as i let the mind dwell on what must even now be taking place in that peaceful garden i felt bucked and uplifted though never for an instant faltering in my opinion that augustus finknottle was natures final word in clothheaded guffins i liked the man wished him well and could not have felt more deeply involved in the success of his wooing if i and not he had been under the ether  the thought that by this time he might quite easily have completed the preliminary pourparlers and be deep in an informal discussion of honeymoon plans was very pleasant to me  of course considering the sort of girl madeline bassett wasstars and rabbits and all that i meanyou might say that a sober sadness would have been more fitting but in these matters you have got to realize that tastes differ the impulse of rightthinking men might be to run a mile when they saw the bassett but for some reason she appealed to the deeps in gussie so that was that  i had reached this point in my meditations when i was aroused by the sound of the door opening somebody came in and started moving like a leopard toward the sidetable and lowering the feet i perceived that it was tuppy glossop  the sight of him gave me a momentary twinge of remorse reminding me as it did that in the excitement of getting gussie fixed up i had rather forgotten about this other client it is often that way when youre trying to run two cases at once  however gussie now being off my mind i was prepared to devote my whole attention to the glossop problem  i had been much pleased by the way he had carried out the task assigned him at the dinnertable no easy one i can assure you for the browsing and sluicing had been of the highest quality and there had been one dish in particulari allude to the nonnettes de poulet agnès sorelwhich might well have broken down the most iron resolution but he had passed it up like a professional fasting man and i was proud of him  oh hullo tuppy i said i wanted to see you  he turned snifter in hand and it was easy to see that his privations had tried him sorely he was looking like a wolf on the steppes of russia which has seen its peasant shin up a high tree  yes he said rather unpleasantly well here i am  well  how do you meanwell  make your report  what report  have you nothing to tell me about angela  only that shes a blister  i was concerned  hasnt she come clustering round you yet  she has not  very odd  why odd  she must have noted your lack of appetite  he barked raspingly as if he were having trouble with the tonsils of the soul  lack of appetite im as hollow as the grand canyon  courage tuppy think of gandhi  what about gandhi  he hasnt had a square meal for years  nor have i or i could swear i hadnt gandhi my left foot  i saw that it might be best to let the gandhi motif slide i went back to where we had started  shes probably looking for you now  who is angela  yes she must have noticed your supreme sacrifice  i dont suppose she noticed it at all the little fathead ill bet it didnt register in any way whatsoever  come tuppy i urged this is morbid dont take this gloomy view she must at least have spotted that you refused those nonnettes de poulet agnès sorel it was a sensational renunciation and stuck out like a sore thumb and the cèpes à la rossini  a hoarse cry broke from his twisted lips  will you stop it bertie do you think i am made of marble isnt it bad enough to have sat watching one of anatoles supremest dinners flit by course after course without having you making a song about it dont remind me of those nonnettes i cant stand it  i endeavoured to hearten and console  be brave tuppy fix your thoughts on that cold steakandkidney pie in the larder as the good book says it cometh in the morning  yes in the morning and its now about halfpast nine at night you would bring that pie up wouldnt you just when i was trying to keep my mind off it  i saw what he meant hours must pass before he could dig into that pie i dropped the subject and we sat for a pretty good time in silence then he rose and began to pace the room in an overwrought sort of way like a zoo lion who has heard the dinnergong go and is hoping the keeper wont forget him in the general distribution i averted my gaze tactfully but i could hear him kicking chairs and things it was plain that the mans soul was in travail and his blood pressure high  presently he returned to his seat and i saw that he was looking at me intently there was that about his demeanour that led me to think that he had something to communicate  nor was i wrong he tapped me significantly on the knee and spoke  bertie  hullo  shall i tell you something  certainly old bird i said cordially i was just beginning to feel that the scene could do with a bit more dialogue  this business of angela and me  yes  ive been putting in a lot of solid thinking about it  oh yes  i have analysed the situation pitilessly and one thing stands out as clear as dammit there has been dirty work afoot  i dont get you  all right let me review the facts up to the time she went to cannes angela loved me she was all over me i was the blueeyed boy in every sense of the term youll admit that  indisputably  and directly she came back we had this bustup  quite  about nothing  oh dash it old man nothing you were a bit tactless what about her shark  i was frank and candid about her shark and thats my point do you seriously believe that a trifling disagreement about sharks would make a girl hand a man his hat if her heart were really his  certainly  it beats me why he couldnt see it but then poor old tuppy has never been very hot on the finer shades hes one of those large tough footballplaying blokes who lack the more delicate sensibilities as ive heard jeeves call them excellent at blocking a punt or walking across an opponents face in cleated boots but not so good when it comes to understanding the highlystrung female temperament it simply wouldnt occur to him that a girl might be prepared to give up her lifes happiness rather than waive her shark  rot it was just a pretext  what was  this shark business she wanted to get rid of me and grabbed at the first excuse  no no  i tell you she did  but what on earth would she want to get rid of you for  exactly thats the very question i asked myself and heres the answer because she has fallen in love with somebody else it sticks out a mile theres no other possible solution she goes to cannes all for me she comes back all off me obviously during those two months she must have transferred her affections to some foul blister she met out there  no no  dont keep saying no no she must have done well ill tell you one thing and you can take this as official if ever i find this slimy slithery snake in the grass he had better make all the necessary arrangements at his favourite nursinghome without delay because i am going to be very rough with him i propose if and when found to take him by his beastly neck shake him till he froths and pull him inside out and make him swallow himself  with which words he biffed off and i having given him a minute or two to get out of the way rose and made for the drawingroom the tendency of females to roost in drawingrooms after dinner being well marked i expected to find angela there it was my intention to have a word with angela  to tuppys theory that some insinuating bird had stolen the girls heart from him at cannes i had given as i have indicated little credence considering it the mere unbalanced apple sauce of a bereaved man it was of course the shark and nothing but the shark that had caused loves young dream to go temporarily off the boil and i was convinced that a word or two with the cousin at this juncture would set everything right  for frankly i thought it incredible that a girl of her natural sweetness and tenderheartedness should not have been moved to her foundations by what she had seen at dinner that night even seppings aunt dahlias butler a cold unemotional man had gasped and practically reeled when tuppy waved aside those nonnettes de poulet agnès sorel while the footman standing by with the potatoes had stared like one seeing a vision i simply refused to consider the possibility of the significance of the thing having been lost on a nice girl like angela i fully expected to find her in the drawingroom with her heart bleeding freely all ripe for an immediate reconciliation  in the drawingroom however when i entered only aunt dahlia met the eye it seemed to me that she gave me rather a jaundiced look as i hove in sight but this having so recently beheld tuppy in his agony i attributed to the fact that she like him had been going light on the menu you cant expect an empty aunt to beam like a full aunt  oh its you is it she said  well it was of course  wheres angela i asked  gone to bed  already  she said she had a headache  hm  i wasnt so sure that i liked the sound of that so much a girl who has observed the sundered lover sensationally off his feed does not go to bed with headaches if love has been reborn in her heart she sticks around and gives him the swift remorseful glance from beneath the drooping eyelashes and generally endeavours to convey to him that if he wants to get together across a round table and try to find a formula she is all for it too yes i am bound to say i found that goingtobed stuff a bit disquieting  gone to bed eh i murmured musingly  what did you want her for  i thought she might like a stroll and a chat  are you going for a stroll said aunt dahlia with a sudden show of interest where  oh hither and thither  then i wonder if you would mind doing something for me  give it a name  it wont take you long you know that path that runs past the greenhouses into the kitchen garden if you go along it you come to a pond  thats right  well will you get a good stout piece of rope or cord and go down that path till you come to the pond  to the pond right  and look about you till you find a nice heavy stone or a fairly large brick would do  i see i said though i didnt being still fogged stone or brick yes and then  then said the relative i want you like a good boy to fasten the rope to the brick and tie it around your damned neck and jump into the pond and drown yourself in a few days i will send and have you fished up and buried because i shall need to dance on your grave  i was more fogged than ever and not only foggedwounded and resentful i remember reading a book where a girl suddenly fled from the room afraid to stay for fear dreadful things would come tumbling from her lips determined that she would not remain another day in this house to be insulted and misunderstood i felt much about the same  then i reminded myself that one has got to make allowances for a woman with only about half a spoonful of soup inside her and i checked the redhot crack that rose to the lips  what i said gently is this all about you seem pipped with bertram  pipped  noticeably pipped why this illconcealed animus  a sudden flame shot from her eyes singeing my hair  who was the ass who was the chump who was the dithering idiot who talked me against my better judgment into going without my dinner i might have guessed  i saw that i had divined correctly the cause of her strange mood  its all right aunt dahlia i know just how youre feeling a bit on the hollow side what but the agony will pass if i were you id sneak down and raid the larder after the household have gone to bed i am told theres a pretty good steakandkidney pie there which will repay inspection have faith aunt dahlia i urged pretty soon uncle tom will be along full of sympathy and anxious inquiries  will he do you know where he is now  i havent seen him  he is in the study with his face buried in his hands muttering about civilization and melting pots  eh why  because it has just been my painful duty to inform him that anatole has given notice  i own that i reeled  what  given notice as the result of that drivelling scheme of yours what did you expect a sensitive temperamental french cook to do if you went about urging everybody to refuse all food i hear that when the first two courses came back to the kitchen practically untouched his feelings were so hurt that he cried like a child and when the rest of the dinner followed he came to the conclusion that the whole thing was a studied and calculated insult and decided to hand in his portfolio  golly  you may well say golly anatole gods gift to the gastric juices gone like the dew off the petal of a rose all through your idiocy perhaps you understand now why i want you to go and jump in that pond i might have known that some hideous disaster would strike this house like a thunderbolt if once you wriggled your way into it and started trying to be clever  harsh words of course as from aunt to nephew but i bore her no resentment no doubt if you looked at it from a certain angle bertram might be considered to have made something of a floater  i am sorry  whats the good of being sorry  i acted for what i deemed the best  another time try acting for the worst then we may possibly escape with a mere flesh wound  uncle toms not feeling too bucked about it all you say  hes groaning like a lost soul and any chance i ever had of getting that money out of him has gone  i stroked the chin thoughtfully there was i had to admit reason in what she said none knew better than i how terrible a blow the passing of anatole would be to uncle tom  i have stated earlier in this chronicle that this curious object of the seashore with whom aunt dahlia has linked her lot is a bloke who habitually looks like a pterodactyl that has suffered and the reason he does so is that all those years he spent in making millions in the far east put his digestion on the blink and the only cook that has ever been discovered capable of pushing food into him without starting something like old home week in moscow under the third waistcoat button is this uniquely gifted anatole deprived of anatoles services all he was likely to give the wife of his b was a dirty look yes unquestionably things seemed to have struck a somewhat rocky patch and i must admit that i found myself at moment of going to press a little destitute of constructive ideas  confident however that these would come ere long i kept the stiff upper lip  bad i conceded quite bad beyond a doubt certainly a nasty jar for one and all but have no fear aunt dahlia i will fix everything  i have alluded earlier to the difficulty of staggering when youre sitting down showing that it is a feat of which i personally am not capable aunt dahlia to my amazement now did it apparently without an effort she was well wedged into a deep armchair but nevertheless she staggered like billyo a sort of spasm of horror and apprehension contorted her face  if you dare to try any more of your lunatic schemes  i saw that it would be fruitless to try to reason with her quite plainly she was not in the vein contenting myself accordingly with a gesture of loving sympathy i left the room whether she did or did not throw a handsomely bound volume of the works of alfred lord tennyson at me i am not in a position to say i had seen it lying on the table beside her and as i closed the door i remember receiving the impression that some blunt instrument had crashed against the woodwork but i was feeling too preoccupied to note and observe  i blame myself for not having taken into consideration the possible effects of a sudden abstinence on the part of virtually the whole strength of the company on one of anatoles impulsive provençal temperament these gauls i should have remembered cant take it their tendency to fly off the handle at the slightest provocation is well known no doubt the man had put his whole soul into those nonnettes de poulet and to see them come homing back to him must have gashed him like a knife  however spilt milk blows nobody any good and it is useless to dwell upon it the task now confronting bertram was to put matters right and i was pacing the lawn pondering to this end when i suddenly heard a groan so lostsoulish that i thought it must have proceeded from uncle tom escaped from captivity and come to groan in the garden  looking about me however i could discern no uncles puzzled i was about to resume my meditations when the sound came again and peering into the shadows i observed a dim form seated on one of the rustic benches which so liberally dotted this pleasance and another dim form standing beside same a second and more penetrating glance and i had assembled the facts  these dim forms were in the order named gussie finknottle and jeeves and what gussie was doing groaning all over the place like this was more than i could understand  because i mean to say there was no possibility of error he wasnt singing as i approached he gave an encore and it was beyond question a groan moreover i could now see him clearly and his whole aspect was definitely sandbagged  good evening sir said jeeves mr finknottle is not feeling well  nor was i gussie had begun to make a low bubbling noise and i could no longer disguise it from myself that something must have gone seriously wrong with the works i mean i know marriage is a pretty solemn business and the realization that he is in for it frequently churns a chap up a bit but i had never come across a case of a newlyengaged man taking it on the chin so completely as this  gussie looked up his eye was dull he clutched the thatch  goodbye bertie he said rising  i seemed to spot an error  you mean hullo dont you  no i dont i mean goodbye im off  off where  to the kitchen garden to drown myself  dont be an ass  im not an ass am i an ass jeeves  possibly a little injudicious sir  drowning myself you mean  yes sir  you think on the whole not drown myself  i should not advocate it sir  very well jeeves i accept your ruling after all it would be unpleasant for mrs travers to find a swollen body floating in her pond  yes sir  and she has been very kind to me  yes sir  and you have been very kind to me jeeves  thank you sir  so have you bertie very kind everybody has been very kind to me very very kind very kind indeed i have no complaints to make all right ill go for a walk instead  i followed him with bulging eyes as he tottered off into the dark  jeeves i said and i am free to admit that in my emotion i bleated like a lamb drawing itself to the attention of the parent sheep what the dickens is all this  mr finknottle is not quite himself sir he has passed through a trying experience  i endeavoured to put together a brief synopsis of previous events  i left him out here with miss bassett  yes sir  i had softened her up  yes sir  he knew exactly what he had to do i had coached him thoroughly in lines and business  yes sir so mr finknottle informed me  well then  i regret to say sir that there was a slight hitch  you mean something went wrong  yes sir  i could not fathom the brain seemed to be tottering on its throne  but how could anything go wrong she loves him jeeves  indeed sir  she definitely told me so all he had to do was propose  yes sir  well didnt he  no sir  then what the dickens did he talk about  newts sir  newts  yes sir  newts  yes sir  but why did he want to talk about newts  he did not want to talk about newts sir as i gather from mr finknottle nothing could have been more alien to his plans  i simply couldnt grasp the trend  but you cant force a man to talk about newts  mr finknottle was the victim of a sudden unfortunate spasm of nervousness sir upon finding himself alone with the young lady he admits to having lost his morale in such circumstances gentlemen frequently talk at random saying the first thing that chances to enter their heads this in mr finknottles case would seem to have been the newt its treatment in sickness and in health  the scales fell from my eyes i understood i had had the same sort of thing happen to me in moments of crisis i remember once detaining a dentist with the drill at one of my lower bicuspids and holding him up for nearly ten minutes with a story about a scotchman an irishman and a jew purely automatic the more he tried to jab the more i said hoots mon begorrah and oy oy when one loses ones nerve one simply babbles  i could put myself in gussies place i could envisage the scene there he and the bassett were alone together in the evening stillness no doubt as i had advised he had shot the works about sunsets and fairy princesses and so forth and then had arrived at the point where he had to say that bit about having something to say to her at this i take it she lowered her eyes and said oh yes  he then i should imagine said it was something very important to which her response would one assumes have been something on the lines of really or indeed or possibly just the sharp intake of the breath and then their eyes met just as mine met the dentists and something suddenly seemed to catch him in the pit of the stomach and everything went black and he heard his voice starting to drool about newts yes i could follow the psychology  nevertheless i found myself blaming gussie on discovering that he was stressing the newt note in this manner he ought of course to have tuned out even if it had meant sitting there saying nothing no matter how much of a twitter he was in he should have had sense enough to see that he was throwing a spanner into the works no girl when she has been led to expect that a man is about to pour forth his soul in a fervour of passion likes to find him suddenly shelving the whole topic in favour of an address on aquatic salamandridae  bad jeeves  yes sir  and how long did this nuisance continue  for some not inconsiderable time i gather sir according to mr finknottle he supplied miss bassett with very full and complete information not only with respect to the common newt but also the crested and palmated varieties he described to her how newts during the breeding season live in the water subsisting upon tadpoles insect larvae and crustaceans how later they make their way to the land and eat slugs and worms and how the newly born newt has three pairs of long plumlike external gills and he was just observing that newts differ from salamanders in the shape of the tail which is compressed and that a marked sexual dimorphism prevails in most species when the young lady rose and said that she thought she would go back to the house  and then  she went sir  i stood musing more and more it was beginning to be borne in upon me what a particularly difficult chap gussie was to help he seemed to so marked an extent to lack snap and finish with infinite toil you manoeuvred him into a position where all he had to do was charge ahead and he didnt charge ahead but went off sideways missing the objective completely  difficult jeeves  yes sir  in happier circs of course i would have canvassed his views on the matter but after what had occurred in connection with that messjacket my lips were sealed  well i must think it over  yes sir  burnish the brain a bit and endeavour to find the way out  yes sir  well good night jeeves  good night sir  he shimmered off leaving a pensive bertram wooster standing motionless in the shadows it seemed to me that it was hard to know what to do for the best    12   i dont know if it has happened you to at all but a thing ive noticed with myself is that when im confronted by a problem which seems for the moment to stump and baffle a good sleep will often bring the solution in the morning  it was so on the present occasion  the nibs who study these matters claim i believe that this has got something to do with the subconscious mind and very possibly they may be right i wouldnt have said offhand that i had a subconscious mind but i suppose i must without knowing it and no doubt it was there sweating away diligently at the old stand all the while the corporeal wooster was getting his eight hours  for directly i opened my eyes on the morrow i saw daylight well i dont mean that exactly because naturally i did what i mean is that i found i had the thing all mapped out the good old subconscious m had delivered the goods and i perceived exactly what steps must be taken in order to put augustus finknottle among the practising romeos  i should like you if you can spare me a moment of your valuable time to throw your mind back to that conversation he and i had had in the garden on the previous evening not the glimmering landscape bit i dont mean that but the concluding passages of it having done so you will recall that when he informed me that he never touched alcoholic liquor i shook the head a bit feeling that this must inevitably weaken him as a force where proposing to girls was concerned  and events had shown that my fears were well founded  put to the test with nothing but orange juice inside him he had proved a complete bust in a situation calling for words of molten passion of a nature calculated to go through madeline bassett like a redhot gimlet through half a pound of butter he had said not a syllable that could bring a blush to the cheek of modesty merely delivering a wellphrased but in the circumstances quite misplaced lecture on newts  a romantic girl is not to be won by such tactics obviously before attempting to proceed further augustus finknottle must be induced to throw off the shackling inhibitions of the past and fuel up it must be a primed confident finknottle who squared up to the bassett for round no 2  only so could the morning post make its ten bob or whatever it is for printing the announcement of the forthcoming nuptials  having arrived at this conclusion i found the rest easy and by the time jeeves brought me my tea i had evolved a plan complete in every detail this i was about to place before himindeed i had got as far as the preliminary i say jeeveswhen we were interrupted by the arrival of tuppy  he came listlessly into the room and i was pained to observe that a nights rest had effected no improvement in the unhappy wrecks appearance indeed i should have said if anything that he was looking rather more motheaten than when i had seen him last if you can visualize a bulldog which has just been kicked in the ribs and had its dinner sneaked by the cat you will have hildebrand glossop as he now stood before me  stap my vitals tuppy old corpse i said concerned youre looking pretty blue round the rims  jeeves slid from the presence in that tactful eellike way of his and i motioned the remains to take a seat  whats the matter i said  he came to anchor on the bed and for awhile sat picking at the coverlet in silence  ive been through hell bertie  through where  hell  oh hell and what took you there  once more he became silent staring before him with sombre eyes following his gaze i saw that he was looking at an enlarged photograph of my uncle tom in some sort of masonic uniform which stood on the mantelpiece ive tried to reason with aunt dahlia about this photograph for years placing before her two alternative suggestions a to burn the beastly thing or b if she must preserve it to shove me in another room when i come to stay but she declines to accede she says its good for me a useful discipline she maintains teaching me that there is a darker side to life and that we were not put into this world for pleasure only  turn it to the wall if it hurts you tuppy i said gently  eh  that photograph of uncle tom as the bandmaster  i didnt come here to talk about photographs i came for sympathy  and you shall have it whats the trouble worrying about angela i suppose well have no fear i have another welllaid plan for encompassing that young shrimp ill guarantee that she will be weeping on your neck before yonder sun has set  he barked sharply  a fat chance  tup tushy  eh  i mean tush tuppy i tell you i will do it i was just going to describe this plan of mine to jeeves when you came in care to hear it  i dont want to hear any of your beastly plans plans are no good shes gone and fallen in love with this other bloke and now hates my gizzard  rot  it isnt rot  i tell you tuppy as one who can read the female heart that this angela loves you still  well it didnt look much like it in the larder last night  oh you went to the larder last night  i did  and angela was there  she was and your aunt also your uncle  i saw that i should require footnotes all this was new stuff to me i had stayed at brinkley court quite a lot in my time but i had no idea the larder was such a social vortex more like a snack bar on a racecourse than anything else it seemed to have become  tell me the whole story in your own words i said omitting no detail however apparently slight for one never knows how important the most trivial detail may be  he inspected the photograph for a moment with growing gloom  all right he said this is what happened you know my views about that steakandkidney pie  quite  well round about one am i thought the time was ripe i stole from my room and went downstairs the pie seemed to beckon me  i nodded i knew how pies do  i got to the larder i fished it out i set it on the table i found knife and fork i collected salt mustard and pepper there were some cold potatoes i added those and i was about to pitch in when i heard a sound behind me and there was your aunt at the door in a blueandyellow dressing gown  embarrassing  most  i suppose you didnt know where to look  i looked at angela  she came in with my aunt  no with your uncle a minute or two later he was wearing mauve pyjamas and carried a pistol have you ever seen your uncle in pyjamas and a pistol  never  you havent missed much  tell me tuppy i asked for i was anxious to ascertain this about angela was there any momentary softening in her gaze as she fixed it on you  she didnt fix it on me she fixed it on the pie  did she say anything  not right away your uncle was the first to speak he said to your aunt god bless my soul dahlia what are you doing here to which she replied well if it comes to that my merry somnambulist what are you your uncle then said that he thought there must be burglars in the house as he had heard noises  i nodded again i could follow the trend ever since the scullery window was found open the year shining light was disqualified in the cesarewitch for boring uncle tom has had a marked complex about burglars i can still recall my emotions when paying my first visit after he had bars put on all the windows and attempting to thrust the head out in order to get a sniff of country air i nearly fractured my skull on a sort of iron grille as worn by the tougher kinds of mediaeval prison  what sort of noises said your aunt funny noises said your uncle whereupon angelawith a nasty steely tinkle in her voice the little buzzardobserved i expect it was mr glossop eating and then she did give me a look it was the sort of wondering revolted look a very spiritual woman would give a fat man gulping soup in a restaurant the kind of look that makes a fellow feel hes fortysix round the waist and has great rolls of superfluous flesh pouring down over the back of his collar and still speaking in the same unpleasant tone she added i ought to have told you father that mr glossop always likes to have a good meal three or four times during the night it helps to keep him going till breakfast he has the most amazing appetite see he has practically finished a large steakandkidney pie already  as he spoke these words a feverish animation swept over tuppy his eyes glittered with a strange light and he thumped the bed violently with his fist nearly catching me a juicy one on the leg  that was what hurt bertie that was what stung i hadnt so much as started on that pie but thats a woman all over  the eternal feminine  she continued her remarks youve no idea she said how mr glossop loves food he just lives for it he always eats six or seven meals a day and then starts in again after bedtime i think its rather wonderful your aunt seemed interested and said it reminded her of a boa constrictor angela said didnt she mean a python and then they argued as to which of the two it was your uncle meanwhile poking about with that damned pistol of his till human life wasnt safe in the vicinity and the pie lying there on the table and me unable to touch it you begin to understand why i said i had been through hell  quite cant have been at all pleasant  presently your aunt and angela settled their discussion deciding that angela was right and that it was a python that i reminded them of and shortly after that we all pushed back to bed angela warning me in a motherly voice not to take the stairs too quickly after seven or eight solid meals she said a man of my build ought to be very careful because of the danger of apoplectic fits she said it was the same with dogs when they became very fat and overfed you had to see that they didnt hurry upstairs as it made them puff and pant and that was bad for their hearts she asked your aunt if she remembered the late spaniel ambrose and your aunt said poor old ambrose you couldnt keep him away from the garbage pail and angela said exactly so do please be careful mr glossop and you tell me she loves me still  i did my best to encourage  girlish banter what  girlish banter be dashed shes right off me once her ideal i am now less than the dust beneath her chariot wheels she became infatuated with this chap whoever he was at cannes and now she cant stand the sight of me  i raised my eyebrows  my dear tuppy you are not showing your usual good sense in this angelachapatcannes matter if you will forgive me saying so you have got an idée fixe  a what  an idée fixe you know one of those things fellows get like uncle toms delusion that everybody who is known even slightly to the police is lurking in the garden waiting for a chance to break into the house you keep talking about this chap at cannes and there never was a chap at cannes and ill tell you why im so sure about this during those two months on the riviera it so happens that angela and i were practically inseparable if there had been somebody nosing round her i should have spotted it in a second  he started i could see that this had impressed him  oh she was with you all the time at cannes was she  i dont suppose she said two words to anybody else except of course idle conv at the crowded dinner table or a chance remark in a throng at the casino  i see you mean that anything in the shape of mixed bathing and moonlight strolls she conducted solely in your company  thats right it was quite a joke in the hotel  you must have enjoyed that  oh rather ive always been devoted to angela  oh yes  when we were kids she used to call herself my little sweetheart  she did  absolutely  i see  he sat plunged in thought while i glad to have set his mind at rest proceeded with my tea and presently there came the banging of a gong from the hall below and he started like a war horse at the sound of the bugle  breakfast he said and was off to a flying start leaving me to brood and ponder and the more i brooded and pondered the more did it seem to me that everything now looked pretty smooth tuppy i could see despite that painful scene in the larder still loved angela with all the old fervour  this meant that i could rely on that plan to which i had referred to bring home the bacon and as i had found the way to straighten out the gussiebassett difficulty there seemed nothing more to worry about  it was with an uplifted heart that i addressed jeeves as he came in to remove the tea tray    13   jeeves i said  sir  ive just been having a chat with young tuppy jeeves did you happen to notice that he wasnt looking very roguish this morning  yes sir it seemed to me that mr glossops face was sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought  quite he met my cousin angela in the larder last night and a rather painful interview ensued  i am sorry sir  not half so sorry as he was she found him closeted with a steakandkidney pie and appears to have been a bit caustic about fat men who lived for food alone  most disturbing sir  very in fact many people would say that things had gone so far between these two nothing now could bridge the chasm a girl who could make cracks about human pythons who ate nine or ten meals a day and ought to be careful not to hurry upstairs because of the danger of apoplectic fits is a girl many people would say in whose heart love is dead wouldnt people say that jeeves  undeniably sir  they would be wrong  you think so sir  i am convinced of it i know these females you cant go by what they say  you feel that miss angelas strictures should not be taken too much au pied de la lettre sir  eh  in english we should say literally  literally thats exactly what i mean you know what girls are a tiff occurs and they shoot their heads off but underneath it all the old love still remains am i correct  quite correct sir the poet scott  right ho jeeves  very good sir  and in order to bring that old love whizzing to the surface once more all that is required is the proper treatment  by proper treatment sir you mean  clever handling jeeves a spot of the good old snaky work i see what must be done to jerk my cousin angela back to normalcy ill tell you shall i  if you would be so kind sir  i lit a cigarette and eyed him keenly through the smoke he waited respectfully for me to unleash the words of wisdom i must say for jeeves thattill as he is so apt to do he starts shoving his oar in and cavilling and obstructinghe makes a very good audience i dont know if he is actually agog but he looks agog and thats the great thing  suppose you were strolling through the illimitable jungle jeeves and happened to meet a tiger cub  the contingency is a remote one sir  never mind let us suppose it  very good sir  let us now suppose that you sloshed that tiger cub and let us suppose further that word reached its mother that it was being put upon what would you expect the attitude of that mother to be in what frame of mind do you consider that that tigress would approach you  i should anticipate a certain show of annoyance sir  and rightly due to what is known as the maternal instinct what  yes sir  very good jeeves we will now suppose that there has recently been some little coolness between this tiger cub and this tigress for some days let us say they have not been on speaking terms do you think that that would make any difference to the vim with which the latter would leap to the formers aid  no sir  exactly here then in brief is my plan jeeves i am going to draw my cousin angela aside to a secluded spot and roast tuppy properly  roast sir  knock slam tickoff abuse denounce i shall be very terse about tuppy giving it as my opinion that in all essentials he is more like a wart hog than an exmember of a fine old english public school what will ensue hearing him attacked my cousin angelas womanly heart will be as sick as mud the maternal tigress in her will awake no matter what differences they may have had she will remember only that he is the man she loves and will leap to his defence and from that to falling into his arms and burying the dead past will be but a step how do you react to that  the idea is an ingenious one sir  we woosters are ingenious jeeves exceedingly ingenious  yes sir  as a matter of fact i am not speaking without a knowledge of the form book i have tested this theory  indeed sir  yes in person and it works i was standing on the eden rock at antibes last month idly watching the bathers disport themselves in the water and a girl i knew slightly pointed at a male diver and asked me if i didnt think his legs were about the silliestlooking pair of props ever issued to human being i replied that i did indeed and for the space of perhaps two minutes was extraordinarily witty and satirical about this birds underpinning at the end of that period i suddenly felt as if i had been caught up in the tail of a cyclone  beginning with a critique of my own limbs which she said justly enough were nothing to write home about this girl went on to dissect my manners morals intellect general physique and method of eating asparagus with such acerbity that by the time she had finished the best you could say of bertram was that so far as was known he had never actually committed murder or set fire to an orphan asylum subsequent investigation proved that she was engaged to the fellow with the legs and had had a slight disagreement with him the evening before on the subject of whether she should or should not have made an original call of two spades having seven but without the ace that night i saw them dining together with every indication of relish their differences made up and the lovelight once more in their eyes that shows you jeeves  yes sir  i expect precisely similar results from my cousin angela when i start roasting tuppy by lunchtime i should imagine the engagement will be on again and the diamondandplatinum ring glittering as of yore on her third finger or is it the fourth  scarcely by luncheon time sir miss angelas maid informs me that miss angela drove off in her car early this morning with the intention of spending the day with friends in the vicinity  well within half an hour of whatever time she comes back then these are mere straws jeeves do not let us chop them  no sir  the point is that as far as tuppy and angela are concerned we may say with confidence that everything will shortly be hotsytotsy once more and what an agreeable thought that is jeeves  very true sir  if there is one thing that gives me the pip it is two loving hearts being estranged  i can readily appreciate the fact sir  i placed the stub of my gasper in the ash tray and lit another to indicate that that completed chap i  right ho then so much for the western front we now turn to the eastern  sir  i speak in parables jeeves what i mean is we now approach the matter of gussie and miss bassett  yes sir  here jeeves more direct methods are required in handling the case of augustus finknottle we must keep always in mind the fact that we are dealing with a poop  a sensitive plant would perhaps be a kinder expression sir  no jeeves a poop and with poops one has to employ the strong forceful straightforward policy psychology doesnt get you anywhere you if i may remind you without wounding your feelings fell into the error of mucking about with psychology in connection with this finknottle and the result was a washout you attempted to push him over the line by rigging him out in a mephistopheles costume and sending him off to a fancydress ball your view being that scarlet tights would embolden him futile  the matter was never actually put to the test sir  no because he didnt get to the ball and that strengthens my argument a man who can set out in a cab for a fancydress ball and not get there is manifestly a poop of no common order i dont think i have ever known anybody else who was such a dashed silly ass that he couldnt even get to a fancydress ball have you jeeves  no sir  but dont forget this because it is the point i wish above all to make even if gussie had got to that ball even if those scarlet tights taken in conjunction with his hornrimmed spectacles hadnt given the girl a fit of some kind even if she had rallied from the shock and he had been able to dance and generally hobnob with her even then your efforts would have been fruitless because mephistopheles costume or no mephistopheles costume augustus finknottle would never have been able to summon up the courage to ask her to be his all that would have resulted would have been that she would have got that lecture on newts a few days earlier and why jeeves shall i tell you why  yes sir  because he would have been attempting the hopeless task of trying to do the thing on orange juice  sir  gussie is an orangejuice addict he drinks nothing else  i was not aware of that sir  i have it from his own lips whether from some hereditary taint or because he promised his mother he wouldnt or simply because he doesnt like the taste of the stuff gussie finknottle has never in the whole course of his career pushed so much as the simplest gin and tonic over the larynx and he expectsthis poop expects jeevesthis wabbling shrinking diffident rabbit in human shape expects under these conditions to propose to the girl he loves one hardly knows whether to smile or weep what  you consider total abstinence a handicap to a gentleman who wishes to make a proposal of marriage sir  the question amazed me  why dash it i said astounded you must know it is use your intelligence jeeves reflect what proposing means it means that a decent selfrespecting chap has got to listen to himself saying things which if spoken on the silver screen would cause him to dash to the boxoffice and demand his money back let him attempt to do it on orange juice and what ensues shame seals his lips or if it doesnt do that makes him lose his morale and start to babble gussie for example as we have seen babbles of syncopated newts  palmated newts sir  palmated or syncopated it doesnt matter which the point is that he babbles and is going to babble again if he has another try at it unlessand this is where i want you to follow me very closely jeevesunless steps are taken at once through the proper channels only active measures promptly applied can provide this poor pusillanimous poop with the proper pep and that is why jeeves i intend tomorrow to secure a bottle of gin and lace his luncheon orange juice with it liberally  sir  i clicked the tongue  i have already had occasion jeeves i said rebukingly to comment on the way you say well sir and indeed sir i take this opportunity of informing you that i object equally strongly to your sir pure and simple the word seems to suggest that in your opinion i have made a statement or mooted a scheme so bizarre that your brain reels at it in the present instance there is absolutely nothing to say sir about the plan i have put forward is entirely reasonable and icily logical and should excite no sirring whatsoever or dont you think so  well sir  jeeves  i beg your pardon sir the expression escaped me inadvertently what i intended to say since you press me was that the action which you propose does seem to me somewhat injudicious  injudicious i dont follow you jeeves  a certain amount of risk would enter into it in my opinion sir it is not always a simple matter to gauge the effect of alcohol on a subject unaccustomed to such stimulant i have known it to have distressing results in the case of parrots  parrots  i was thinking of an incident of my earlier life sir before i entered your employment i was in the service of the late lord brancaster at the time a gentleman who owned a parrot to which he was greatly devoted and one day the bird chanced to be lethargic and his lordship with the kindly intention of restoring it to its customary animation offered it a portion of seed cake steeped in the 84 port the bird accepted the morsel gratefully and consumed it with every indication of satisfaction almost immediately afterwards however its manner became markedly feverish having bitten his lordship in the thumb and sung part of a seachanty it fell to the bottom of the cage and remained there for a considerable period of time with its legs in the air unable to move i merely mention this sir in order to  i put my finger on the flaw i had spotted it all along  but gussie isnt a parrot  no sir but  it is high time in my opinion that this question of what young gussie really is was threshed out and cleared up he seems to think he is a male newt and you now appear to suggest that he is a parrot the truth of the matter being that he is just a plain ordinary poop and needs a snootful as badly as ever man did so no more discussion jeeves my mind is made up there is only one way of handling this difficult case and that is the way i have outlined  very good sir  right ho jeeves so much for that then now heres something else you noticed that i said i was going to put this project through tomorrow and no doubt you wondered why i said tomorrow why did i jeeves  because you feel that if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly sir  partly jeeves but not altogether my chief reason for fixing the date as specified is that tomorrow though you have doubtless forgotten is the day of the distribution of prizes at market snodsbury grammar school at which as you know gussie is to be the male star and master of the revels so you see we shall by lacing that juice not only embolden him to propose to miss bassett but also put him so into shape that he will hold that market snodsbury audience spellbound  in fact you will be killing two birds with one stone sir  exactly a very neat way of putting it and now here is a minor point on second thoughts i think the best plan will be for you not me to lace the juice  sir  jeeves  i beg your pardon sir  and ill tell you why that will be the best plan because you are in a position to obtain ready access to the stuff it is served to gussie daily i have noticed in an individual jug this jug will presumably be lying about the kitchen or somewhere before lunch tomorrow it will be the simplest of tasks for you to slip a few fingers of gin in it  no doubt sir but  dont say but jeeves  i fear sir  i fear sir is just as bad  what i am endeavouring to say sir is that i am sorry but i am afraid i must enter an unequivocal nolle prosequi  do what  the expression is a legal one sir signifying the resolve not to proceed with a matter in other words eager though i am to carry out your instructions sir as a general rule on this occasion i must respectfully decline to cooperate  you wont do it you mean  precisely sir  i was stunned i began to understand how a general must feel when he has ordered a regiment to charge and has been told that it isnt in the mood  jeeves i said i had not expected this of you  no sir  no indeed naturally i realize that lacing gussies orange juice is not one of those regular duties for which you receive the monthly stipend and if you care to stand on the strict letter of the contract i suppose there is nothing to be done about it but you will permit me to observe that this is scarcely the feudal spirit  i am sorry sir  it is quite all right jeeves quite all right i am not angry only a little hurt  very good sir  right ho jeeves    14   investigation proved that the friends angela had gone to spend the day with were some statelyhome owners of the name of stretchleybudd hanging out in a joint called kingham manor about eight miles distant in the direction of pershore i didnt know these birds but their fascination must have been considerable for she tore herself away from them only just in time to get back and dress for dinner it was accordingly not until coffee had been consumed that i was able to get matters moving i found her in the drawingroom and at once proceeded to put things in train  it was with very different feelings from those which had animated the bosom when approaching the bassett twentyfour hours before in the same manner in this same drawingroom that i headed for where she sat as i had told tuppy i have always been devoted to angela and there is nothing i like better than a ramble in her company  and i could see by the look of her now how sorely in need she was of my aid and comfort  frankly i was shocked by the unfortunate young prunes appearance at cannes she had been a happy smiling english girl of the best type full of beans and buck her face now was pale and drawn like that of a hockey centreforward at a girls school who in addition to getting a fruity one on the shin has just been penalized for sticks in any normal gathering her demeanour would have excited instant remark but the standard of gloom at brinkley court had become so high that it passed unnoticed indeed i shouldnt wonder if uncle tom crouched in his corner waiting for the end didnt think she was looking indecently cheerful  i got down to the agenda in my debonair way  what ho angela old girl  hullo bertie darling  glad youre back at last i missed you  did you darling  i did indeed care to come for a saunter  id love it  fine i have much to say to you that is not for the public ear  i think at this moment poor old tuppy must have got a sudden touch of cramp he had been sitting hard by staring at the ceiling and he now gave a sharp leap like a gaffed salmon and upset a small table containing a vase a bowl of potpourri two china dogs and a copy of omar khayyám bound in limp leather  aunt dahlia uttered a startled hunting cry uncle tom who probably imagined from the noise that this was civilization crashing at last helped things along by breaking a coffeecup  tuppy said he was sorry aunt dahlia with a deathbed groan said it didnt matter and angela having stared haughtily for a moment like a princess of the old régime confronted by some notable example of gaucherie on the part of some particularly foul member of the underworld accompanied me across the threshold and presently i had deposited her and self on one of the rustic benches in the garden and was ready to snap into the business of the evening  i considered it best however before doing so to ease things along with a little informal chitchat you dont want to rush a delicate job like the one i had in hand and so for a while we spoke of neutral topics she said that what had kept her so long at the stretchleybudds was that hilda stretchleybudd had made her stop on and help with the arrangements for their servants ball tomorrow night a task which she couldnt very well decline as all the brinkley court domestic staff were to be present i said that a jolly nights revelry might be just what was needed to cheer anatole up and take his mind off things to which she replied that anatole wasnt going on being urged to do so by aunt dahlia she said he had merely shaken his head sadly and gone on talking of returning to provence where he was appreciated  it was after the sombre silence induced by this statement that angela said the grass was wet and she thought she would go in  this of course was entirely foreign to my policy  no dont do that i havent had a chance to talk to you since you arrived  i shall ruin my shoes  put your feet up on my lap  all right and you can tickle my ankles  quite  matters were accordingly arranged on these lines and for some minutes we continued chatting in desultory fashion then the conversation petered out i made a few observations in re the scenic effects featuring the twilight hush the peeping stars and the soft glimmer of the waters of the lake and she said yes something rustled in the bushes in front of us and i advanced the theory that it was possibly a weasel and she said it might be but it was plain that the girl was distraite and i considered it best to waste no more time  well old thing i said ive heard all about your little dustup so those wedding bells are not going to ring out what  no  definitely over is it  yes  well if you want my opinion i think thats a bit of goose for you angela old girl i think youre extremely well out of it its a mystery to me how you stood this glossop so long take him for all in all he ranks very low down among the wines and spirits a washout i should describe him as a frightful oik and a mass of side to boot id pity the girl who was linked for life to a bargee like tuppy glossop  and i emitted a hard laughone of the sneering kind  i always thought you were such friends said angela  i let go another hard one with a bit more top spin on it than the first time  friends absolutely not one was civil of course when one met the fellow but it would be absurd to say one was a friend of his a club acquaintance and a mere one at that and then one was at school with the man  at eton  good heavens no we wouldnt have a fellow like that at eton at a kids school before i went there a grubby little brute he was i recollect covered with ink and mire generally washing only on alternate thursdays in short a notable outsider shunned by all  i paused i was more than a bit perturbed apart from the agony of having to talk in this fashion of one who except when he was looping back rings and causing me to plunge into swimming baths in correct evening costume had always been a very dear and esteemed crony i didnt seem to be getting anywhere business was not resulting staring into the bushes without a yip she appeared to be bearing these slurs and innuendos of mine with an easy calm  i had another pop at it  uncouth about sums it up i doubt if ive ever seen an uncouther kid than this glossop ask anyone who knew him in those days to describe him in a word and the word they will use is uncouth and hes just the same today its the old story the boy is the father of the man  she appeared not to have heard  the boy i repeated not wishing her to miss that one is the father of the man  what are you talking about  im talking about this glossop  i thought you said something about somebodys father  i said the boy was the father of the man  what boy  the boy glossop  he hasnt got a father  i never said he had i said he was the father of the boyor rather of the man  what man  i saw that the conversation had reached a point where unless care was taken we should be muddled  the point i am trying to make i said is that the boy glossop is the father of the man glossop in other words each loathsome fault and blemish that led the boy glossop to be frowned upon by his fellows is present in the man glossop and causes himi am speaking now of the man glossopto be a hissing and a byword at places like the drones where a certain standard of decency is demanded from the inmates ask anyone at the drones and they will tell you that it was a black day for the dear old club when this chap glossop somehow wriggled into the list of members here you will find a man who dislikes his face there one who could stand his face if it wasnt for his habits but the universal consensus of opinion is that the fellow is a bounder and a tick and that the moment he showed signs of wanting to get into the place he should have been met with a firm nolle prosequi and heartily blackballed  i had to pause again here partly in order to take in a spot of breath and partly to wrestle with the almost physical torture of saying these frightful things about poor old tuppy  there are some chaps i resumed forcing myself once more to the nauseous task who in spite of looking as if they had slept in their clothes can get by quite nicely because they are amiable and suave there are others who for all that they excite adverse comment by being fat and uncouth find themselves on the credit side of the ledger owing to their wit and sparkling humour but this glossop i regret to say falls into neither class in addition to looking like one of those things that come out of hollow trees he is universally admitted to be a dumb brick of the first water no soul no conversation in short any girl who having been rash enough to get engaged to him has managed at the eleventh hour to slide out is justly entitled to consider herself dashed lucky  i paused once more and cocked an eye at angela to see how the treatment was taking all the while i had been speaking she had sat gazing silently into the bushes but it seemed to me incredible that she should not now turn on me like a tigress according to specifications it beat me why she hadnt done it already it seemed to me that a mere tithe of what i had said if said to a tigress about a tiger of which she was fond would have made herthe tigress i meanhit the ceiling  and the next moment you could have knocked me down with a toothpick  yes she said nodding thoughtfully youre quite right  eh  thats exactly what ive been thinking myself  what  dumb brick it just describes him one of the six silliest asses in england i should think he must be  i did not speak i was endeavouring to adjust the faculties which were in urgent need of a bit of firstaid treatment  i mean to say all this had come as a complete surprise in formulating the welllaid plan which i had just been putting into effect the one contingency i had not budgeted for was that she might adhere to the sentiments which i expressed i had braced myself for a gush of stormy emotion i was expecting the tearful ticking off the girlish recriminations and all the rest of the bag of tricks along those lines  but this cordial agreement with my remarks i had not foreseen and it gave me what you might call pause for thought  she proceeded to develop her theme speaking in ringing enthusiastic tones as if she loved the topic jeeves could tell you the word i want i think its ecstatic unless thats the sort of rash you get on your face and have to use ointment for but if that is the right word then thats what her manner was as she ventilated the subject of poor old tuppy if you had been able to go simply by the sound of her voice she might have been a court poet cutting loose about an oriental monarch or gussie finknottle describing his last consignment of newts  its so nice bertie talking to somebody who really takes a sensible view about this man glossop mother says hes a good chap which is simply absurd anybody can see that hes absolutely impossible hes conceited and opinionative and argues all the time even when he knows perfectly well that hes talking through his hat and he smokes too much and eats too much and drinks too much and i dont like the colour of his hair not that hell have any hair in a year or two because hes pretty thin on the top already and before he knows where he is hell be as bald as an egg and hes the last man who can afford to go bald and i think its simply disgusting the way he gorges all the time do you know i found him in the larder at one oclock this morning absolutely wallowing in a steakandkidney pie there was hardly any of it left and you remember what an enormous dinner he had quite disgusting i call it but i cant stop out here all night talking about men who arent worth wasting a word on and havent even enough sense to tell sharks from flatfish im going in  and gathering about her slim shoulders the shawl which she had put on as a protection against the evening dew she buzzed off leaving me alone in the silent night  well as a matter of fact not absolutely alone because a few moments later there was a sort of upheaval in the bushes in front of me and tuppy emerged    15   i gave him the eye the evening had begun to draw in a bit by now and the visibility in consequence was not so hot but there still remained ample light to enable me to see him clearly and what i saw convinced me that i should be a lot easier in my mind with a stout rustic bench between us i rose accordingly modelling my style on that of a rocketing pheasant and proceeded to deposit myself on the other side of the object named  my prompt agility was not without its effect he seemed somewhat taken aback he came to a halt and for about the space of time required to allow a bead of persp to trickle from the top of the brow to the tip of the nose stood gazing at me in silence  so he said at length and it came as a complete surprise to me that fellows ever really do say so i had always thought it was just a thing you read in books like quotha i mean to say or odds bodikins or even eh ba goom  still there it was quaint or not quaint bizarre or not bizarre he had said so and it was up to me to cope with the situation on those lines  it would have been a duller man than bertram wooster who had failed to note that the dear old chap was a bit steamed up whether his eyes were actually shooting forth flame i couldnt tell you but there appeared to me to be a distinct incandescence for the rest his fists were clenched his ears quivering and the muscles of his jaw rotating rhythmically as if he were making an early supper off something  his hair was full of twigs and there was a beetle hanging to the side of his head which would have interested gussie finknottle to this however i paid scant attention there is a time for studying beetles and a time for not studying beetles  so he said again  now those who know bertram wooster best will tell you that he is always at his shrewdest and most levelheaded in moments of peril who was it who when gripped by the arm of the law on boatrace night not so many years ago and hauled off to vine street police station assumed in a flash the identity of eustace h plimsoll of the laburnums alleyn road west dulwich thus saving the grand old name of wooster from being dragged in the mire and avoiding wide publicity of the wrong sort who was it   but i need not labour the point my record speaks for itself three times pinched but never once sentenced under the correct label ask anyone at the drones about this  so now in a situation threatening to become every moment more scaly i did not lose my head i preserved the old sangfroid smiling a genial and affectionate smile and hoping that it wasnt too dark for it to register i spoke with a jolly cordiality  why hallo tuppy you here  he said yes he was here  been here long  i have  fine i wanted to see you  well here i am come out from behind that bench  no thanks old man i like leaning on it it seems to rest the spine  in about two seconds said tuppy im going to kick your spine up through the top of your head  i raised the eyebrows not much good of course in that light but it seemed to help the general composition  is this hildebrand glossop speaking i said  he replied that it was adding that if i wanted to make sure i might move a few feet over in his direction he also called me an opprobrious name  i raised the eyebrows again  come come tuppy dont let us let this little chat become acrid is acrid the word i want  i couldnt say he replied beginning to sidle round the bench  i saw that anything i might wish to say must be said quickly already he had sidled some six feet and though by dint of sidling too i had managed to keep the bench between us who could predict how long this happy state of affairs would last  i came to the point therefore  i think i know whats on your mind tuppy i said if you were in those bushes during my conversation with the recent angela i dare say you heard what i was saying about you  i did  i see well we wont go into the ethics of the thing eavesdropping some people might call it and i can imagine stern critics drawing in the breath to some extent considering iti dont want to hurt your feelings tuppybut considering it unenglish a bit unenglish tuppy old man you must admit  im scotch  really i said i never knew that before rummy how you dont suspect a man of being scotch unless hes macsomething and says och aye and things like that i wonder i went on feeling that an academic discussion on some neutral topic might ease the tension if you can tell me something that has puzzled me a good deal what exactly is it that they put into haggis ive often wondered about that  from the fact that his only response to the question was to leap over the bench and make a grab at me i gathered that his mind was not on haggis  however i said leaping over the bench in my turn that is a side issue if to come back to it you were in those bushes and heard what i was saying about you  he began to move round the bench in a nornoreasterly direction i followed his example setting a course sousouwest  no doubt you were surprised at the way i was talking  not a bit  what did nothing strike you as odd in the tone of my remarks  it was just the sort of stuff i should have expected a treacherous sneaking hound like you to say  my dear chap i protested this is not your usual form a bit slow in the uptake surely i should have thought you would have spotted right away that it was all part of a welllaid plan  ill get you in a jiffy said tuppy recovering his balance after a swift clutch at my neck and so probable did this seem that i delayed no longer but hastened to place all the facts before him  speaking rapidly and keeping moving i related my emotions on receipt of aunt dahlias telegram my instant rush to the scene of the disaster my meditations in the car and the eventual framing of this welllaid plan of mine i spoke clearly and well and it was with considerable concern consequently that i heard him observebetween clenched teeth which made it worsethat he didnt believe a damned word of it  but tuppy i said why not to me the thing rings true to the last drop what makes you sceptical confide in me tuppy  he halted and stood taking a breather tuppy pungently though angela might have argued to the contrary isnt really fat during the winter months you will find him constantly booting the football with merry shouts and in the summer the tennis racket is seldom out of his hand  but at the recently concluded evening meal feeling no doubt that after that painful scene in the larder there was nothing to be gained by further abstinence he had rather let himself go and as it were made up leeway and after really immersing himself in one of anatoles dinners a man of his sturdy build tends to lose elasticity a bit during the exposition of my plans for his happiness a certain animation had crept into this roundandroundthe mulberrybush jamboree of oursso much so indeed that for the last few minutes we might have been a rather oversized greyhound and a somewhat slimmer electric hare doing their stuff on a circular track for the entertainment of the manyheaded  this it appeared had taken it out of him a bit and i was not displeased i was feeling the strain myself and welcomed a lull  it absolutely beats me why you dont believe it i said you know weve been pals for years you must be aware that except at the moment when you caused me to do a nose dive into the drones swimming bath an incident which i long since decided to put out of my mind and let the dead past bury its dead about if you follow what i meanexcept on that one occasion as i say i have always regarded you with the utmost esteem why then if not for the motives i have outlined should i knock you to angela answer me that be very careful  what do you mean be very careful  well as a matter of fact i didnt quite know myself it was what the magistrate had said to me on the occasion when i stood in the dock as eustace plimsoll of the laburnums and as it had impressed me a good deal at the time i just bunged it in now by way of giving the conversation a tone  all right never mind about being careful then just answer me that question why if i had not your interests sincerely at heart should i have ticked you off as stated  a sharp spasm shook him from base to apex the beetle which during the recent exchanges had been clinging to his head hoping for the best gave it up at this and resigned office it shot off and was swallowed in the night  ah i said your beetle i explained no doubt you were unaware of it but all this while there has been a beetle of sorts parked on the side of your head you have now dislodged it  he snorted  beetles  not beetles one beetle only  i like your crust cried tuppy vibrating like one of gussies newts during the courting season talking of beetles when all the time you know youre a treacherous sneaking hound  it was a debatable point of course why treacherous sneaking hounds should be considered ineligible to talk about beetles and i dare say a good crossexamining counsel would have made quite a lot of it  but i let it go  thats the second time youve called me that and i said firmly i insist on an explanation i have told you that i acted throughout from the best and kindliest motives in roasting you to angela it cut me to the quick to have to speak like that and only the recollection of our lifelong friendship would have made me do it and now you say you dont believe me and call me names for which i am not sure i couldnt have you up before a beak and jury and mulct you in very substantial damages i should have to consult my solicitor of course but it would surprise me very much if an action did not lie be reasonable tuppy suggest another motive i could have had just one  i will do you think i dont know youre in love with angela yourself  what  and you knocked me in order to poison her mind against me and finally remove me from your path  i had never heard anything so absolutely loopy in my life why dash it ive known angela since she was so high you dont fall in love with close relations youve known since they were so high besides isnt there something in the book of rules about a man may not marry his cousin or am i thinking of grandmothers  tuppy my dear old ass i cried this is pure banana oil youve come unscrewed  oh yes  me in love with angela haha  you cant get out of it with hahas she called you darling  i know and i disapproved this habit of the younger g of scattering darlings about like birdseed is one that i deprecate lax is how i should describe it  you tickled her ankles  in a purely cousinly spirit it didnt mean a thing why dash it you must know that in the deeper and truer sense i wouldnt touch angela with a barge pole  oh and why not not good enough for you  you misunderstand me i hastened to reply when i say i wouldnt touch angela with a barge pole i intend merely to convey that my feelings towards her are those of distant though cordial esteem in other words you may rest assured that between this young prune and myself there never has been and never could be any sentiment warmer and stronger than that of ordinary friendship  i believe it was you who tipped her off that i was in the larder last night so that she could find me there with that pie thus damaging my prestige  my dear tuppy a wooster i was shocked you think a wooster would do that  he breathed heavily  listen he said its no good your standing there arguing you cant get away from the facts somebody stole her from me at cannes you told me yourself that she was with you all the time at cannes and hardly saw anybody else you gloated over the mixed bathing and those moonlight walks you had together  not gloated just mentioned them  so now you understand why as soon as i can get you clear of this damned bench i am going to tear you limb from limb why they have these bally benches in gardens said tuppy discontentedly is more than i can see they only get in the way  he ceased and grabbing out missed me by a hairs breadth  it was a moment for swift thinking and it is at such moments as i have already indicated that bertram wooster is at his best i suddenly remembered the recent misunderstanding with the bassett and with a flash of clear vision saw that this was where it was going to come in handy  youve got it all wrong tuppy i said moving to the left true i saw a lot of angela but my dealings with her were on a basis from start to finish of the purest and most wholesome camaraderie i can prove it during that sojourn in cannes my affections were engaged elsewhere  what  engaged elsewhere my affections during that sojourn  i had struck the right note he stopped sidling his clutching hand fell to his side  is that true  quite official  who was she  my dear tuppy does one bandy a womans name  one does if one doesnt want ones ruddy head pulled off  i saw that it was a special case  madeline bassett i said  who  madeline bassett  he seemed stunned  you stand there and tell me you were in love with that bassett disaster  i wouldnt call her that bassett disaster tuppy not respectful  dash being respectful i want the facts you deliberately assert that you loved that weird gawdhelpus  i dont see why you should call her a weird gawdhelpus either a very charming and beautiful girl odd in some of her views perhapsone does not quite see eye to eye with her in the matter of stars and rabbitsbut not a weird gawdhelpus  anyway you stick to it that you were in love with her  i do  it sounds thin to me wooster very thin  i saw that it would be necessary to apply the finishing touch  i must ask you to treat this as entirely confidential glossop but i may as well inform you that it is not twentyfour hours since she turned me down  turned you down  like a bedspread in this very garden  twentyfour hours  call it twentyfive so you will readily see that i cant be the chap if any who stole angela from you at cannes  and i was on the brink of adding that i wouldnt touch angela with a barge pole when i remembered i had said it already and it hadnt gone frightfully well i desisted therefore  my manly frankness seemed to be producing good results the homicidal glare was dying out of tuppys eyes he had the aspect of a hired assassin who had paused to think things over  i see he said at length all right then sorry you were troubled  dont mention it old man i responded courteously  for the first time since the bushes had begun to pour forth glossops bertram wooster could be said to have breathed freely i dont say i actually came out from behind the bench but i did let go of it and with something of the relief which those three chaps in the old testament must have experienced after sliding out of the burning fiery furnace i even groped tentatively for my cigarette case  the next moment a sudden snort made me take my fingers off it as if it had bitten me i was distressed to note in the old friend a return of the recent frenzy  what the hell did you mean by telling her that i used to be covered with ink when i was a kid  my dear tuppy  i was almost finickingly careful about my personal cleanliness as a boy you could have eaten your dinner off me  quite but  and all that stuff about having no soul im crawling with soul and being looked on as an outsider at the drones  but my dear old chap i explained that it was all part of my ruse or scheme  it was was it well in future do me a favour and leave me out of your foul ruses  just as you say old boy  all right then thats understood  he relapsed into silence standing with folded arms staring before him rather like a strong silent man in a novel when hes just been given the bird by the girl and is thinking of looking in at the rocky mountains and bumping off a few bears his manifest pippedness excited my compash and i ventured a kindly word  i dont suppose you know what au pied de la lettre means tuppy but thats how i dont think you ought to take all that stuff angela was saying just now too much  he seemed interested  what the devil he asked are you talking about  i saw that i should have to make myself clearer  dont take all that guff of hers too literally old man you know what girls are like  i do he said with another snort that came straight up from his insteps and i wish id never met one  i mean to say its obvious that she must have spotted you in those bushes and was simply talking to score off you there you were i mean if you follow the psychology and she saw you and in that impulsive way girls have she seized the opportunity of ribbing you a bitjust told you a few home truths i mean to say  home truths  thats right  he snorted once more causing me to feel rather like royalty receiving a twentyone gun salute from the fleet i cant remember ever having met a better rightandlefthand snorter  what do you mean home truths im not fat  no no  and whats wrong with the colour of my hair  quite in order tuppy old man the hair i mean  and im not a bit thin on the top what the dickens are you grinning about  not grinning just smiling slightly i was conjuring up a sort of vision if you know what i mean of you as seen through angelas eyes fat in the middle and thin on the top rather funny  you think it funny do you  not a bit  youd better not  quite  it seemed to me that the conversation was becoming difficult again i wished it could be terminated and so it was for at this moment something came shimmering through the laurels in the quiet evenfall and i perceived that it was angela  she was looking sweet and saintlike and she had a plate of sandwiches in her hand ham i was to discover later  if you see mr glossop anywhere bertie she said her eyes resting dreamily on tuppys facade i wish you would give him these im so afraid he may be hungry poor fellow its nearly ten oclock and he hasnt eaten a morsel since dinner ill just leave them on this bench  she pushed off and it seemed to me that i might as well go with her nothing to keep me here i mean we moved towards the house and presently from behind us there sounded in the night the splintering crash of a wellkicked plate of ham sandwiches accompanied by the muffled oaths of a strong man in his wrath  how still and peaceful everything is said angela    16   sunshine was gilding the grounds of brinkley court and the ear detected a marked twittering of birds in the ivy outside the window when i woke next morning to a new day but there was no corresponding sunshine in bertram woosters soul and no answering twitter in his heart as he sat up in bed sipping his cup of strengthening tea it could not be denied that to bertram reviewing the happenings of the previous night the tuppyangela situation seemed more or less to have slipped a cog with every desire to look for the silver lining i could not but feel that the rift between these two haughty spirits had now reached such impressive proportions that the task of bridging same would be beyond even my powers  i am a shrewd observer and there had been something in tuppys manner as he booted that plate of ham sandwiches that seemed to tell me that he would not lightly forgive  in these circs i deemed it best to shelve their problem for the nonce and turn the mind to the matter of gussie which presented a brighter picture  with regard to gussie everything was in train jeevess morbid scruples about lacing the chaps orange juice had put me to a good deal of trouble but i had surmounted every obstacle in the old wooster way i had secured an abundance of the necessary spirit and it was now lying in its flask in the drawer of the dressingtable i had also ascertained that the jug duly filled would be standing on a shelf in the butlers pantry round about the hour of one to remove it from that shelf sneak it up to my room and return it laced in good time for the midday meal would be a task calling no doubt for address but in no sense an exacting one  it was with something of the emotions of one preparing a treat for a deserving child that i finished my tea and rolled over for that extra spot of sleep which just makes all the difference when there is mans work to be done and the brain must be kept clear for it  and when i came downstairs an hour or so later i knew how right i had been to formulate this scheme for gussies bucking up i ran into him on the lawn and i could see at a glance that if ever there was a man who needed a snappy stimulant it was he all nature as i have indicated was smiling but not augustus finknottle he was walking round in circles muttering something about not proposing to detain us long but on this auspicious occasion feeling compelled to say a few words  ah gussie i said arresting him as he was about to start another lap a lovely morning is it not  even if i had not been aware of it already i could have divined from the abruptness with which he damned the lovely morning that he was not in merry mood i addressed myself to the task of bringing the roses back to his cheeks  ive got good news for you gussie  he looked at me with a sudden sharp interest  has market snodsbury grammar school burned down  not that i know of  have mumps broken out is the place closed on account of measles  no no  then what do you mean youve got good news  i endeavoured to soothe  you mustnt take it so hard gussie why worry about a laughably simple job like distributing prizes at a school  laughably simple eh do you realize ive been sweating for days and havent been able to think of a thing to say yet except that i wont detain them long you bet i wont detain them long ive been timing my speech and it lasts five seconds what the devil am i to say bertie what do you say when youre distributing prizes  i considered once at my private school i had won a prize for scripture knowledge so i suppose i ought to have been full of inside stuff but memory eluded me  then something emerged from the mists  you say the race is not always to the swift  why  well its a good gag it generally gets a hand  i mean why isnt it why isnt the race to the swift  ah there you have me but the nibs say it isnt  but what does it mean  i take it its supposed to console the chaps who havent won prizes  whats the good of that to me im not worrying about them its the ones that have won prizes that im worrying about the little blighters who will come up on the platform suppose they make faces at me  they wont  how do you know they wont its probably the first thing theyll think of and even if they dontbertie shall i tell you something  what  ive a good mind to take that tip of yours and have a drink  i smiled he little knew about summed up what i was thinking  oh youll be all right i said  he became fevered again  how do you know ill be all right im sure to blow up in my lines  tush  or drop a prize  tut  or something i can feel it in my bones as sure as im standing here something is going to happen this afternoon which will make everybody laugh themselves sick at me i can hear them now like hyenas bertie  hullo  do you remember that kids school we went to before eton  quite it was there i won my scripture prize  never mind about your scripture prize im not talking about your scripture prize do you recollect the bosher incident  i did indeed it was one of the high spots of my youth  majorgeneral sir wilfred bosher came to distribute the prizes at that school proceeded gussie in a dull toneless voice he dropped a book he stooped to pick it up and as he stooped his trousers split up the back  how we roared  gussies face twisted  we did little swine that we were instead of remaining silent and exhibiting a decent sympathy for a gallant officer at a peculiarly embarrassing moment we howled and yelled with mirth i loudest of any that is what will happen to me this afternoon bertie it will be a judgment on me for laughing like that at majorgeneral sir wilfred bosher  no no gussie old man your trousers wont split  how do you know they wont better men than i have split their trousers general bosher was a dso with a fine record of service on the northwestern frontier of india and his trousers split i shall be a mockery and a scorn i know it and you fully cognizant of what i am in for come babbling about good news what news could possibly be good to me at this moment except the information that bubonic plague had broken out among the scholars of market snodsbury grammar school and that they were all confined to their beds with spots  the moment had come for me to speak i laid a hand gently on his shoulder he brushed it off i laid it on again he brushed it off once more i was endeavouring to lay it on for the third time when he moved aside and desired with a certain petulance to be informed if i thought i was a ruddy osteopath  i found his manner trying but one has to make allowances i was telling myself that i should be seeing a very different gussie after lunch  when i said i had good news old man i meant about madeline bassett  the febrile gleam died out of his eyes to be replaced by a look of infinite sadness  you cant have good news about her ive dished myself there completely  not at all i am convinced that if you take another whack at her all will be well  and keeping it snappy i related what had passed between the bassett and myself on the previous night  so all you have to do is play a return date and you cannot fail to swing the voting you are her dream man  he shook his head  no  what  no use  what do you mean  not a bit of good trying  but i tell you she said in so many words  it doesnt make any difference she may have loved me once last night will have killed all that  of course it wont  it will she despises me now  not a bit of it she knows you simply got cold feet  and i should get cold feet if i tried again its no good bertie im hopeless and theres an end of it fate made me the sort of chap who cant say bo to a goose  it isnt a question of saying bo to a goose the point doesnt arise at all it is simply a matter of  i know i know but its no good i cant do it the whole thing is off i am not going to risk a repetition of last nights fiasco you talk in a light way of taking another whack at her but you dont know what it means you have not been through the experience of starting to ask the girl you love to marry you and then suddenly finding yourself talking about the plumlike external gills of the newlyborn newt its not a thing you can do twice no i accept my destiny its all over and now bertie like a good chap shove off i want to compose my speech i cant compose my speech with you mucking around if you are going to continue to muck around at least give me a couple of stories the little hell hounds are sure to expect a story or two  do you know the one about  no good i dont want any of your offcolour stuff from the drones smokingroom i need something clean something that will be a help to them in their after lives not that i care a damn about their after lives except that i hope theyll all choke  i heard a story the other day i cant quite remember it but it was about a chap who snored and disturbed the neighbours and it ended it was his adenoids that adenoid them  he made a weary gesture  you expect me to work that in do you into a speech to be delivered to an audience of boys every one of whom is probably riddled with adenoids damn it theyd rush the platform leave me bertie push off thats all i ask you to do push off ladies and gentlemen said gussie in a low soliloquizing sort of way i do not propose to detain this auspicious occasion long  it was a thoughtful wooster who walked away and left him at it more than ever i was congratulating myself on having had the sterling good sense to make all my arrangements so that i could press a button and set things moving at an instants notice  until now you see i had rather entertained a sort of hope that when i had revealed to him the bassetts mental attitude nature would have done the rest bracing him up to such an extent that artificial stimulants would not be required because naturally a chap doesnt want to have to sprint about country houses lugging jugs of orange juice unless it is absolutely essential  but now i saw that i must carry on as planned the total absence of pep ginger and the right spirit which the man had displayed during these conversational exchanges convinced me that the strongest measures would be necessary immediately upon leaving him therefore i proceeded to the pantry waited till the butler had removed himself elsewhere and nipped in and secured the vital jug a few moments later after a wary passage of the stairs i was in my room and the first thing i saw there was jeeves fooling about with trousers  he gave the jug a look whichwrongly as it was to turn outi diagnosed as censorious i drew myself up a bit i intended to have no rot from the fellow  yes jeeves  sir  you have the air of one about to make a remark jeeves  oh no sir i note that you are in possession of mr finknottles orange juice i was merely about to observe that in my opinion it would be injudicious to add spirit to it  that is a remark jeeves and it is precisely  because i have already attended to the matter sir  what  yes sir i decided after all to acquiesce in your wishes  i stared at the man astounded i was deeply moved well i mean wouldnt any chap who had been going about thinking that the old feudal spirit was dead and then suddenly found it wasnt have been deeply moved  jeeves i said i am touched  thank you sir  touched and gratified  thank you very much sir  but what caused this change of heart  i chanced to encounter mr finknottle in the garden sir while you were still in bed and we had a brief conversation  and you came away feeling that he needed a bracer  very much so sir his attitude struck me as defeatist  i nodded  i felt the same defeatist sums it up to a nicety did you tell him his attitude struck you as defeatist  yes sir  but it didnt do any good  no sir  very well then jeeves we must act how much gin did you put in the jug  a liberal tumblerful sir  would that be a normal dose for an adult defeatist do you think  i fancy it should prove adequate sir  i wonder we must not spoil the ship for a haporth of tar i think ill add just another fluid ounce or so  i would not advocate it sir in the case of lord brancasters parrot  you are falling into your old error jeeves of thinking that gussie is a parrot fight against this i shall add the oz  very good sir  and by the way jeeves mr finknottle is in the market for bright clean stories to use in his speech do you know any  i know a story about two irishmen sir  pat and mike  yes sir  who were walking along broadway  yes sir  just what he wants any more  no sir  well every little helps you had better go and tell it to him  very good sir  he passed from the room and i unscrewed the flask and tilted into the jug a generous modicum of its contents and scarcely had i done so when there came to my ears the sound of footsteps without i had only just time to shove the jug behind the photograph of uncle tom on the mantelpiece before the door opened and in came gussie curveting like a circus horse  whatho bertie he said whatho whatho whatho and again whatho what a beautiful world this is bertie one of the nicest i ever met  i stared at him speechless we woosters are as quick as lightning and i saw at once that something had happened  i mean to say i told you about him walking round in circles i recorded what passed between us on the lawn and if i portrayed the scene with anything like adequate skill the picture you will have retained of this finknottle will have been that of a nervous wreck sagging at the knees green about the gills and picking feverishly at the lapels of his coat in an ecstasy of craven fear in a word defeatist gussie during that interview had in fine exhibited all the earmarks of one licked to a custard  vastly different was the gussie who stood before me now selfconfidence seemed to ooze from the fellows every pore his face was flushed there was a jovial light in his eyes the lips were parted in a swashbuckling smile and when with a genial hand he sloshed me on the back before i could sidestep it was as if i had been kicked by a mule  well bertie he proceeded as blithely as a linnet without a thing on his mind you will be glad to hear that you were right your theory has been tested and proved correct i feel like a fighting cock  my brain ceased to reel i saw all  have you been having a drink  i have as you advised unpleasant stuff like medicine burns your throat too and makes one as thirsty as the dickens how anyone can mop it up as you do for pleasure beats me still i would be the last to deny that it tunes up the system i could bite a tiger  what did you have  whisky at least that was the label on the decanter and i have no reason to suppose that a woman like your auntstaunch trueblue britishwould deliberately deceive the public if she labels her decanters whisky then i consider that we know where we are  a whisky and soda eh you couldnt have done better  soda said gussie thoughtfully i knew there was something i had forgotten  didnt you put any soda in it  it never occurred to me i just nipped into the diningroom and drank out of the decanter  how much  oh about ten swallows twelve maybe or fourteen say sixteen mediumsized gulps gosh im thirsty  he moved over to the washstand and drank deeply out of the water bottle i cast a covert glance at uncle toms photograph behind his back for the first time since it had come into my life i was glad that it was so large it hid its secret well if gussie had caught sight of that jug of orange juice he would unquestionably have been on to it like a knife  well im glad youre feeling braced i said  he moved buoyantly from the washhand stand and endeavoured to slosh me on the back again foiled by my nimble footwork he staggered to the bed and sat down upon it  braced did i say i could bite a tiger  you did  make it two tigers i could chew holes in a steel door what an ass you must have thought me out there in the garden i see now you were laughing in your sleeve  no no  yes insisted gussie that very sleeve he said pointing and i dont blame you i cant imagine why i made all that fuss about a potty job like distributing prizes at a rotten little country grammar school can you imagine bertie  exactly nor can i imagine theres simply nothing to it i just shin up on the platform drop a few gracious words hand the little blighters their prizes and hop down again admired by all not a suggestion of split trousers from start to finish i mean why should anybody split his trousers i cant imagine can you imagine  no  nor can i imagine i shall be a riot i know just the sort of stuff thats neededsimple manly optimistic stuff straight from the shoulder this shoulder said gussie tapping why i was so nervous this morning i cant imagine for anything simpler than distributing a few footling books to a bunch of grimyfaced kids i cant imagine still for some reason i cant imagine i was feeling a little nervous but now i feel fine bertiefine fine fineand i say this to you as an old friend because thats what you are old man when all the smoke has cleared awayan old friend i dont think ive ever met an older friend how long have you been an old friend of mine bertie  oh years and years  imagine though of course there must have been a time when you were a new friend hullo the luncheon gong come on old friend  and rising from the bed like a performing flea he made for the door  i followed rather pensively what had occurred was of course so much velvet as you might say i mean i had wanted a braced finknottle indeed all my plans had had a braced finknottle as their end and aim but i found myself wondering a little whether the finknottle now sliding down the banister wasnt perhaps a shade too braced his demeanour seemed to me that of a man who might quite easily throw bread about at lunch  fortunately however the settled gloom of those round him exercised a restraining effect upon him at the table it would have needed a far more plastered man to have been rollicking at such a gathering i had told the bassett that there were aching hearts in brinkley court and it now looked probable that there would shortly be aching tummies anatole i learned had retired to his bed with a fit of the vapours and the meal now before us had been cooked by the kitchen maidas c3 a performer as ever wielded a skillet  this coming on top of their other troubles induced in the company a pretty unanimous silencea solemn stillness as you might saywhich even gussie did not seem prepared to break except therefore for one short snatch of song on his part nothing untoward marked the occasion and presently we rose with instructions from aunt dahlia to put on festal raiment and be at market snodsbury not later than 330 this leaving me ample time to smoke a gasper or two in a shady bower beside the lake i did so repairing to my room round about the hour of three  jeeves was on the job adding the final polish to the old topper and i was about to apprise him of the latest developments in the matter of gussie when he forestalled me by observing that the latter had only just concluded an agreeable visit to the wooster bedchamber  i found mr finknottle seated here when i arrived to lay out your clothes sir  indeed jeeves gussie was in here was he  yes sir he left only a few moments ago he is driving to the school with mr and mrs travers in the large car  did you give him your story of the two irishmen  yes sir he laughed heartily  good had you any other contributions for him  i ventured to suggest that he might mention to the young gentlemen that education is a drawing out not a putting in the late lord brancaster was much addicted to presenting prizes at schools and he invariably employed this dictum  and how did he react to that  he laughed heartily sir  this surprised you no doubt this practically incessant merriment i mean  yes sir  you thought it odd in one who when you last saw him was well up in group a of the defeatists  yes sir  there is a ready explanation jeeves since you last saw him gussie has been on a bender hes as tight as an owl  indeed sir  absolutely his nerve cracked under the strain and he sneaked into the diningroom and started mopping the stuff up like a vacuum cleaner whisky would seem to be what he filled the radiator with i gather that he used up most of the decanter golly jeeves its lucky he didnt get at that laced orange juice on top of that what  extremely sir  i eyed the jug uncle toms photograph had fallen into the fender and it was standing there right out in the open where gussie couldnt have helped seeing it mercifully it was empty now  it was a most prudent act on your part if i may say so sir to dispose of the orange juice  i stared at the man  what didnt you  no sir  jeeves let us get this clear was it not you who threw away that oj  no sir i assumed when i entered the room and found the pitcher empty that you had done so  we looked at each other awed two minds with but a single thought  i very much fear sir  so do i jeeves  it would seem almost certain  quite certain weigh the facts sift the evidence the jug was standing on the mantelpiece for all eyes to behold gussie had been complaining of thirst you found him in here laughing heartily i think that there can be little doubt jeeves that the entire contents of that jug are at this moment reposing on top of the existing cargo in that already brilliantly lit mans interior disturbing jeeves  most disturbing sir  let us face the position forcing ourselves to be calm you inserted in that jugshall we say a tumblerful of the right stuff  fully a tumblerful sir  and i added of my plenty about the same amount  yes sir  and in two shakes of a ducks tail gussie with all that lapping about inside him will be distributing the prizes at market snodsbury grammar school before an audience of all that is fairest and most refined in the county  yes sir  it seems to me jeeves that the ceremony may be one fraught with considerable interest  yes sir  what in your opinion will the harvest be  one finds it difficult to hazard a conjecture sir  you mean imagination boggles  yes sir  i inspected my imagination he was right it boggled    17   and yet jeeves i said twiddling a thoughtful steering wheel there is always the bright side  some twenty minutes had elapsed and having picked the honest fellow up outside the front door i was driving in the twoseater to the picturesque town of market snodsbury since we had partedhe to go to his lair and fetch his hat i to remain in my room and complete the formal costumei had been doing some close thinking  the results of this i now proceeded to hand on to him  however dark the prospect may be jeeves however murkily the storm clouds may seem to gather a keen eye can usually discern the blue bird it is bad no doubt that gussie should be going some ten minutes from now to distribute prizes in a state of advanced intoxication but we must never forget that these things cut both ways  you imply sir  precisely i am thinking of him in his capacity of wooer all this ought to have put him in rare shape for offering his hand in marriage i shall be vastly surprised if it wont turn him into a sort of caveman have you ever seen james cagney in the movies  yes sir  something on those lines  i heard him cough and sniped him with a sideways glance he was wearing that informative look of his  then you have not heard sir  eh  you are not aware that a marriage has been arranged and will shortly take place between mr finknottle and miss bassett  what  yes sir  when did this happen  shortly after mr finknottle had left your room sir  ah in the postorangejuice era  yes sir  but are you sure of your facts how do you know  my informant was mr finknottle himself sir he appeared anxious to confide in me his story was somewhat incoherent but i had no difficulty in apprehending its substance prefacing his remarks with the statement that this was a beautiful world he laughed heartily and said that he had become formally engaged  no details  no sir  but one can picture the scene  yes sir  i mean imagination doesnt boggle  no sir  and it didnt i could see exactly what must have happened insert a liberal dose of mixed spirits in a normally abstemious man and he becomes a force he does not stand around twiddling his fingers and stammering he acts i had no doubt that gussie must have reached for the bassett and clasped her to him like a stevedore handling a sack of coals and one could readily envisage the effect of that sort of thing on a girl of romantic mind  well well well jeeves  yes sir  this is splendid news  yes sir  you see now how right i was  yes sir  it must have been rather an eyeopener for you watching me handle this case  yes sir  the simple direct method never fails  no sir  whereas the elaborate does  yes sir  right ho jeeves  we had arrived at the main entrance of market snodsbury grammar school i parked the car and went in well content true the tuppyangela problem still remained unsolved and aunt dahlias five hundred quid seemed as far off as ever but it was gratifying to feel that good old gussies troubles were over at any rate  the grammar school at market snodsbury had i understood been built somewhere in the year 1416 and as with so many of these ancient foundations there still seemed to brood over its great hall where the afternoons festivities were to take place not a little of the fug of the centuries it was the hottest day of the summer and though somebody had opened a tentative window or two the atmosphere remained distinctive and individual  in this hall the youth of market snodsbury had been eating its daily lunch for a matter of five hundred years and the flavour lingered the air was sort of heavy and languorous if you know what i mean with the scent of young england and boiled beef and carrots  aunt dahlia who was sitting with a bevy of the local nibs in the second row sighted me as i entered and waved to me to join her but i was too smart for that i wedged myself in among the standees at the back leaning up against a chap who from the aroma might have been a corn chandler or something on that order the essence of strategy on these occasions is to be as near the door as possible  the hall was gaily decorated with flags and coloured paper and the eye was further refreshed by the spectacle of a mixed drove of boys parents and what not the former running a good deal to shiny faces and eton collars the latter stressing the blacksatin note rather when female and looking as if their coats were too tight if male and presently there was some applausesporadic jeeves has since told me it wasand i saw gussie being steered by a bearded bloke in a gown to a seat in the middle of the platform  and i confess that as i beheld him and felt that there but for the grace of god went bertram wooster a shudder ran through the frame it all reminded me so vividly of the time i had addressed that girls school  of course looking at it dispassionately you may say that for horror and peril there is no comparison between an almost human audience like the one before me and a mob of small girls with pigtails down their backs and this i concede is true nevertheless the spectacle was enough to make me feel like a fellow watching a pal going over niagara falls in a barrel and the thought of what i had escaped caused everything for a moment to go black and swim before my eyes  when i was able to see clearly once more i perceived that gussie was now seated he had his hands on his knees with his elbows out at right angles like a nigger minstrel of the old school about to ask mr bones why a chicken crosses the road and he was staring before him with a smile so fixed and pebblebeached that i should have thought that anybody could have guessed that there sat one in whom the old familiar juice was plashing up against the back of the front teeth  in fact i saw aunt dahlia who having assisted at so many hunting dinners in her time is second to none as a judge of the symptoms give a start and gaze long and earnestly and she was just saying something to uncle tom on her left when the bearded bloke stepped to the footlights and started making a speech from the fact that he spoke as if he had a hot potato in his mouth without getting the raspberry from the lads in the ringside seats i deduced that he must be the head master  with his arrival in the spotlight a sort of perspiring resignation seemed to settle on the audience personally i snuggled up against the chandler and let my attention wander the speech was on the subject of the doings of the school during the past term and this part of a prizegiving is always apt rather to fail to grip the visiting stranger i mean you know how it is youre told that jb brewster has won an exhibition for classics at cats cambridge and you feel that its one of those stories where you cant see how funny it is unless you really know the fellow and the same applies to g bullett being awarded the lady jane wix scholarship at the birmingham college of veterinary science  in fact i and the corn chandler who was looking a bit fagged i thought as if he had had a hard morning chandling the corn were beginning to doze lightly when things suddenly brisked up bringing gussie into the picture for the first time  today said the bearded bloke we are all happy to welcome as the guest of the afternoon mr fitzwattle  at the beginning of the address gussie had subsided into a sort of daydream with his mouth hanging open about halfway through faint signs of life had begun to show and for the last few minutes he had been trying to cross one leg over the other and failing and having another shot and failing again but only now did he exhibit any real animation he sat up with a jerk  finknottle he said opening his eyes  fitznottle  finknottle  i should say finknottle  of course you should you silly ass said gussie genially all right get on with it  and closing his eyes he began trying to cross his legs again  i could see that this little spot of friction had rattled the bearded bloke a bit he stood for a moment fumbling at the fungus with a hesitating hand but they make these head masters of tough stuff the weakness passed he came back nicely and carried on  we are all happy i say to welcome as the guest of the afternoon mr finknottle who has kindly consented to award the prizes this task as you know is one that should have devolved upon that wellbeloved and vigorous member of our board of governors the rev william plomer and we are all i am sure very sorry that illness at the last moment should have prevented him from being here today but if i may borrow a familiar metaphor from theif i may employ a homely metaphor familiar to you allwhat we lose on the swings we gain on the roundabouts  he paused and beamed rather freely to show that this was comedy i could have told the man it was no use not a ripple the corn chandler leaned against me and muttered whoddidesay but that was all  its always a nasty jar to wait for the laugh and find that the gag hasnt got across the bearded bloke was visibly discomposed at that however i think he would have got by had he not at this juncture unfortunately stirred gussie up again  in other words though deprived of mr plomer we have with us this afternoon mr finknottle i am sure that mr finknottles name is one that needs no introduction to you it is i venture to assert a name that is familiar to us all  not to you said gussie  and the next moment i saw what jeeves had meant when he had described him as laughing heartily heartily was absolutely the mot juste it sounded like a gas explosion  you didnt seem to know it so dashed well what what said gussie and reminded apparently by the word what of the word wattle he repeated the latter some sixteen times with a rising inflection  wattle wattle wattle he concluded rightho push on  but the bearded bloke had shot his bolt he stood there licked at last and watching him closely i could see that he was now at the crossroads i could spot what he was thinking as clearly as if he had confided it to my personal ear he wanted to sit down and call it a day i mean but the thought that gave him pause was that if he did he must then either uncork gussie or take the finknottle speech as read and get straight on to the actual prizegiving  it was a dashed tricky thing of course to have to decide on the spur of the moment i was reading in the paper the other day about those birds who are trying to split the atom the nub being that they havent the foggiest as to what will happen if they do it may be all right on the other hand it may not be all right and pretty silly a chap would feel no doubt if having split the atom he suddenly found the house going up in smoke and himself torn limb from limb  so with the bearded bloke whether he was abreast of the inside facts in gussies case i dont know but it was obvious to him by this time that he had run into something pretty hot trial gallops had shown that gussie had his own way of doing things those interruptions had been enough to prove to the perspicacious that here seated on the platform at the big binge of the season was one who if pushed forward to make a speech might let himself go in a rather epochmaking manner  on the other hand chain him up and put a greenbaize cloth over him and where were you the proceeding would be over about half an hour too soon  it was as i say a difficult problem to have to solve and left to himself i dont know what conclusion he would have come to personally i think he would have played it safe as it happened however the thing was taken out of his hands for at this moment gussie having stretched his arms and yawned a bit switched on that pebblebeached smile again and tacked down to the edge of the platform  speech he said affably  he then stood with his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat waiting for the applause to die down  it was some time before this happened for he had got a very fine hand indeed i suppose it wasnt often that the boys of market snodsbury grammar school came across a man publicspirited enough to call their head master a silly ass and they showed their appreciation in no uncertain manner gussie may have been one over the eight but as far as the majority of those present were concerned he was sitting on top of the world  boys said gussie i mean ladies and gentlemen and boys i do not detain you long but i suppose on this occasion to feel compelled to say a few auspicious words ladiesand boys and gentlemenwe have all listened with interest to the remarks of our friend here who forgot to shave this morningi dont know his name but then he didnt know minefitzwattle i mean absolutely absurdwhich squares things up a bitand we are all sorry that the reverend whateverhewascalled should be dying of adenoids but after all here today gone tomorrow and all flesh is as grass and what not but that wasnt what i wanted to say what i wanted to say was thisand i say it confidentlywithout fear of contradictioni say in short i am happy to be here on this auspicious occasion and i take much pleasure in kindly awarding the prizes consisting of the handsome books you see laid out on that table as shakespeare says there are sermons in books stones in the running brooks or rather the other way about and there you have it in a nutshell  it went well and i wasnt surprised i couldnt quite follow some of it but anybody could see that it was real ripe stuff and i was amazed that even the course of treatment he had been taking could have rendered so normally tonguetied a dumb brick as gussie capable of it  it just shows what any member of parliament will tell you that if you want real oratory the preliminary noggin is essential unless pieeyed you cannot hope to grip  gentlemen said gussie i mean ladies and gentlemen and of course boys what a beautiful world this is a beautiful world full of happiness on every side let me tell you a little story two irishmen pat and mike were walking along broadway and one said to the other begorrah the race is not always to the swift and the other replied faith and begob education is a drawing out not a putting in  i must say it seemed to me the rottenest story i had ever heard and i was surprised that jeeves should have considered it worth while shoving into a speech however when i taxed him with this later he said that gussie had altered the plot a good deal and i dare say that accounts for it  at any rate that was the conte as gussie told it and when i say that it got a very fair laugh you will understand what a popular favourite he had become with the multitude there might be a bearded bloke or so on the platform and a small section in the second row who were wishing the speaker would conclude his remarks and resume his seat but the audience as a whole was for him solidly  there was applause and a voice cried hear hear  yes said gussie it is a beautiful world the sky is blue the birds are singing there is optimism everywhere and why not boys and ladies and gentlemen im happy youre happy were all happy even the meanest irishman that walks along broadway though as i say there were two of thempat and mike one drawing out the other putting in i should like you boys taking the time from me to give three cheers for this beautiful world all together now  presently the dust settled down and the plaster stopped falling from the ceiling and he went on  people who say it isnt a beautiful world dont know what they are talking about driving here in the car today to award the kind prizes i was reluctantly compelled to tick off my host on this very point old tom travers you will see him sitting there in the second row next to the large lady in beige  he pointed helpfully and the hundred or so market snodsburyians who craned their necks in the direction indicated were able to observe uncle tom blushing prettily  i ticked him off properly the poor fish he expressed the opinion that the world was in a deplorable state i said dont talk rot old tom travers i am not accustomed to talk rot he said then for a beginner i said you do it dashed well and i think you will admit boys and ladies and gentlemen that that was telling him  the audience seemed to agree with him the point went big the voice that had said hear hear said hear hear again and my corn chandler hammered the floor vigorously with a largesize walking stick  well boys resumed gussie having shot his cuffs and smirked horribly this is the end of the summer term and many of you no doubt are leaving the school and i dont blame you because theres a froust in here you could cut with a knife you are going out into the great world soon many of you will be walking along broadway and what i want to impress upon you is that however much you may suffer from adenoids you must all use every effort to prevent yourselves becoming pessimists and talking rot like old tom travers there in the second row the fellow with a face rather like a walnut  he paused to allow those wishing to do so to refresh themselves with another look at uncle tom and i found myself musing in some little perplexity long association with the members of the drones has put me pretty well in touch with the various ways in which an overdose of the blushful hippocrene can take the individual but i had never seen anyone react quite as gussie was doing  there was a snap about his work which i had never witnessed before even in barmy fotheringayphipps on new years eve  jeeves when i discussed the matter with him later said it was something to do with inhibitions if i caught the word correctly and the suppression of i think he said the ego what he meant i gathered was that owing to the fact that gussie had just completed a five years stretch of blameless seclusion among the newts all the goofiness which ought to have been spread out thin over those five years and had been bottled up during that period came to the surface on this occasion in a lumpor if you prefer to put it that way like a tidal wave  there may be something in this jeeves generally knows  anyway be that as it may i was dashed glad i had had the shrewdness to keep out of that second row it might be unworthy of the prestige of a wooster to squash in among the proletariat in the standingroomonly section but at least i felt i was out of the danger zone so thoroughly had gussie got it up his nose by now that it seemed to me that had he sighted me he might have become personal about even an old school friend  if theres one thing in the world i cant stand proceeded gussie its a pessimist be optimists boys you all know the difference between an optimist and a pessimist an optimist is a man whowell take the case of two irishmen walking along broadway one is an optimist and one is a pessimist just as ones name is pat and the others mike why hullo bertie i didnt know you were here  too late i endeavoured to go to earth behind the chandler only to discover that there was no chandler there some appointment suddenly rememberedpossibly a promise to his wife that he would be home to teahad caused him to ooze away while my attention was elsewhere leaving me right out in the open  between me and gussie who was now pointing in an offensive manner there was nothing but a sea of interested faces looking up at me  now there boomed gussie continuing to point is an instance of what i mean boys and ladies and gentlemen take a good look at that object standing up there at the backmorning coat trousers as worn quiet grey tie and carnation in buttonholeyou cant miss him bertie wooster that is and as foul a pessimist as ever bit a tiger i tell you i despise that man and why do i despise him because boys and ladies and gentlemen he is a pessimist his attitude is defeatist when i told him i was going to address you this afternoon he tried to dissuade me and do you know why he tried to dissuade me because he said my trousers would split up the back  the cheers that greeted this were the loudest yet anything about splitting trousers went straight to the simple hearts of the young scholars of market snodsbury grammar school two in the row in front of me turned purple and a small lad with freckles seated beside them asked me for my autograph  let me tell you a story about bertie wooster  a wooster can stand a good deal but he cannot stand having his name bandied in a public place picking my feet up softly i was in the very process of executing a quiet sneak for the door when i perceived that the bearded bloke had at last decided to apply the closure  why he hadnt done so before is beyond me spellbound i take it and of course when a chap is going like a breeze with the public as gussie had been its not so dashed easy to chip in however the prospect of hearing another of gussies anecdotes seemed to have done the trick rising rather as i had risen from my bench at the beginning of that painful scene with tuppy in the twilight he made a leap for the table snatched up a book and came bearing down on the speaker  he touched gussie on the arm and gussie turning sharply and seeing a large bloke with a beard apparently about to bean him with a book sprang back in an attitude of selfdefence  perhaps as time is getting on mr finknottle we had better  oh ah said gussie getting the trend he relaxed the prizes eh of course yes rightho yes might as well be shoving along with it whats this one  spelling and dictationpk purvis announced the bearded bloke  spelling and dictationpk purvis echoed gussie as if he were calling coals forward pk purvis  now that the whistle had been blown on his speech it seemed to me that there was no longer any need for the strategic retreat which i had been planning i had no wish to tear myself away unless i had to i mean i had told jeeves that this binge would be fraught with interest and it was fraught with interest there was a fascination about gussies methods which gripped and made one reluctant to pass the thing up provided personal innuendoes were steered clear of i decided accordingly to remain and presently there was a musical squeaking and pk purvis climbed the platform  the spellinganddictation champ was about three foot six in his squeaking shoes with a pink face and sandy hair gussie patted his hair he seemed to have taken an immediate fancy to the lad  you pk purvis  sir yes sir  its a beautiful world pk purvis  sir yes sir  ah youve noticed it have you good you married by any chance  sir no sir  get married pk purvis said gussie earnestly its the only life  well heres your book looks rather bilge to me from a glance at the title page but such as it is here you are  pk purvis squeaked off amidst sporadic applause but one could not fail to note that the sporadic was followed by a rather strained silence it was evident that gussie was striking something of a new note in market snodsbury scholastic circles looks were exchanged between parent and parent the bearded bloke had the air of one who has drained the bitter cup as for aunt dahlia her demeanour now told only too clearly that her last doubts had been resolved and her verdict was in i saw her whisper to the bassett who sat on her right and the bassett nodded sadly and looked like a fairy about to shed a tear and add another star to the milky way  gussie after the departure of pk purvis had fallen into a sort of daydream and was standing with his mouth open and his hands in his pockets becoming abruptly aware that a fat kid in knickerbockers was at his elbow he started violently  hullo he said visibly shaken who are you  this said the bearded bloke is rv smethurst  whats he doing here asked gussie suspiciously  you are presenting him with the drawing prize mr finknottle  this apparently struck gussie as a reasonable explanation his face cleared  thats right too he said well here it is cocky you off he said as the kid prepared to withdraw  sir yes sir  wait rv smethurst not so fast before you go there is a question i wish to ask you  but the beard blokes aim now seemed to be to rush the ceremonies a bit he hustled rv smethurst off stage rather like a chuckerout in a pub regretfully ejecting an old and respected customer and starting paging gg simmons a moment later the latter was up and coming and conceive my emotion when it was announced that the subject on which he had clicked was scripture knowledge one of us i mean to say  gg simmons was an unpleasant perkylooking stripling mostly front teeth and spectacles but i gave him a big hand we scriptureknowledge sharks stick together  gussie i was sorry to see didnt like him there was in his manner as he regarded gg simmons none of the chumminess which had marked it during his interview with pk purvis or in a somewhat lesser degree with rv smethurst he was cold and distant  well gg simmons  sir yes sir  what do you meansir yes sir dashed silly thing to say so youve won the scriptureknowledge prize have you  sir yes sir  yes said gussie you look just the sort of little tick who would and yet he said pausing and eyeing the child keenly how are we to know that this has all been open and above board let me test you gg simmons what was whatshisnamethe chap who begat thingummy can you answer me that simmons  sir no sir  gussie turned to the bearded bloke  fishy he said very fishy this boy appears to be totally lacking in scripture knowledge  the bearded bloke passed a hand across his forehead  i can assure you mr finknottle that every care was taken to ensure a correct marking and that simmons outdistanced his competitors by a wide margin  well if you say so said gussie doubtfully all right gg simmons take your prize  sir thank you sir  but let me tell you that theres nothing to stick on side about in winning a prize for scripture knowledge bertie wooster  i dont know when ive had a nastier shock i had been going on the assumption that now that they had stopped him making his speech gussies fangs had been drawn as you might say to duck my head down and resume my edging toward the door was with me the work of a moment  bertie wooster won the scriptureknowledge prize at a kids school we were at together and you know what hes like but of course bertie frankly cheated he succeeded in scrounging that scriptureknowledge trophy over the heads of better men by means of some of the rawest and most brazen swindling methods ever witnessed even at a school where such things were common if that mans pockets as he entered the examinationroom were not stuffed to burstingpoint with lists of the kings of judah  i heard no more a moment later i was out in gods air fumbling with a fevered foot at the selfstarter of the old car  the engine raced the clutch slid into position i tooted and drove off  my ganglions were still vibrating as i ran the car into the stables of brinkley court and it was a much shaken bertram who tottered up to his room to change into something loose having donned flannels i lay down on the bed for a bit and i suppose i must have dozed off for the next thing i remember is finding jeeves at my side  i sat up my tea jeeves  no sir it is nearly dinnertime  the mists cleared away  i must have been asleep  yes sir  nature taking its toll of the exhausted frame  yes sir  and enough to make it  yes sir  and now its nearly dinnertime you say all right i am in no mood for dinner but i suppose you had better lay out the clothes  it will not be necessary sir the company will not be dressing tonight a cold collation has been set out in the diningroom  whys that  it was mrs traverss wish that this should be done in order to minimize the work for the staff who are attending a dance at sir percival stretchleybudds residence tonight  of course yes i remember my cousin angela told me tonights the night what you going jeeves  no sir i am not very fond of this form of entertainment in the rural districts sir  i know what you mean these country binges are all the same a piano one fiddle and a floor like sandpaper is anatole going angela hinted not  miss angela was correct sir monsieur anatole is in bed  temperamental blighters these frenchmen  yes sir  there was a pause  well jeeves i said it was certainly one of those afternoons what  yes sir  i cannot recall one more packed with incident and i left before the finish  yes sir i observed your departure  you couldnt blame me for withdrawing  no sir mr finknottle had undoubtedly become embarrassingly personal  was there much more of it after i went  no sir the proceedings terminated very shortly mr finknottles remarks with reference to master gg simmons brought about an early closure  but he had finished his remarks about gg simmons  only temporarily sir he resumed them immediately after your departure if you recollect sir he had already proclaimed himself suspicious of master simmonss bona fides and he now proceeded to deliver a violent verbal attack upon the young gentleman asserting that it was impossible for him to have won the scriptureknowledge prize without systematic cheating on an impressive scale he went so far as to suggest that master simmons was well known to the police  golly jeeves  yes sir the words did create a considerable sensation the reaction of those present to this accusation i should describe as mixed the young students appeared pleased and applauded vigorously but master simmonss mother rose from her seat and addressed mr finknottle in terms of strong protest  did gussie seem taken aback did he recede from his position  no sir he said that he could see it all now and hinted at a guilty liaison between master simmonss mother and the head master accusing the latter of having cooked the marks as his expression was in order to gain favour with the former  you dont mean that  yes sir  egad jeeves and then  they sang the national anthem sir  surely not  yes sir  at a moment like that  yes sir  well you were there and you know of course but i should have thought the last thing gussie and this woman would have done in the circs would have been to start singing duets  you misunderstand me sir it was the entire company who sang the head master turned to the organist and said something to him in a low tone upon which the latter began to play the national anthem and the proceedings terminated  i see about time too  yes sir mrs simmonss attitude had become unquestionably menacing  i pondered what i had heard was of course of a nature to excite pity and terror not to mention alarm and despondency and it would be paltering with the truth to say that i was pleased about it on the other hand it was all over now and it seemed to me that the thing to do was not to mourn over the past but to fix the mind on the bright future i mean to say gussie might have lowered the existing worcestershire record for goofiness and definitely forfeited all chance of becoming market snodsburys favourite son but you couldnt get away from the fact that he had proposed to madeline bassett and you had to admit that she had accepted him  i put this to jeeves  a frightful exhibition i said and one which will very possibly ring down historys pages but we must not forget jeeves that gussie though now doubtless looked upon in the neighbourhood as the worlds worst freak is all right otherwise  no sir  i did not get quite this  when you say no sir do you mean yes sir  no sir i mean no sir  he is not all right otherwise  no sir  but hes betrothed  no longer sir miss bassett has severed the engagement  you dont mean that  yes sir  i wonder if you have noticed a rather peculiar thing about this chronicle i allude to the fact that at one time or another practically everybody playing a part in it has had occasion to bury his or her face in his or her hands i have participated in some pretty glutinous affairs in my time but i think that never before or since have i been mixed up with such a solid body of brow clutchers  uncle tom did it if you remember so did gussie so did tuppy so probably though i have no data did anatole and i wouldnt put it past the bassett and aunt dahlia i have no doubt would have done it too but for the risk of disarranging the carefully fixed coiffure  well what i am trying to say is that at this juncture i did it myself up went the hands and down went the head and in another jiffy i was clutching as energetically as the best of them  and it was while i was still massaging the coconut and wondering what the next move was that something barged up against the door like the delivery of a ton of coals  i think this may very possibly be mr finknottle himself sir said jeeves  his intuition however had led him astray it was not gussie but tuppy he came in and stood breathing asthmatically it was plain that he was deeply stirred    18   i eyed him narrowly i didnt like his looks mark you i dont say i ever had much because nature when planning this sterling fellow shoved in a lot more lower jaw than was absolutely necessary and made the eyes a bit too keen and piercing for one who was neither an empire builder nor a traffic policeman but on the present occasion in addition to offending the aesthetic sense this glossop seemed to me to be wearing a distinct air of menace and i found myself wishing that jeeves wasnt always so dashed tactful i mean its all very well to remove yourself like an eel sliding into mud when the employer has a visitor but there are momentsand it looked to me as if this was going to be one of themwhen the truer tact is to stick round and stand ready to lend a hand in the freeforall  for jeeves was no longer with us i hadnt seen him go and i hadnt heard him go but he had gone as far as the eye could reach one noted nobody but tuppy and in tuppys demeanour as i say there was a certain something that tended to disquiet he looked to me very much like a man who had come to reopen that matter of my tickling angelas ankles  however his opening remark told me that i had been alarming myself unduly it was of a pacific nature and came as a great relief  bertie he said i owe you an apology i have come to make it  my relief on hearing these words containing as they did no reference of any sort to tickled ankles was as i say great but i dont think it was any greater than my surprise months had passed since that painful episode at the drones and until now he hadnt given a sign of remorse and contrition indeed word had reached me through private sources that he frequently told the story at dinners and other gatherings and when doing so laughed his silly head off  i found it hard to understand accordingly what could have caused him to abase himself at this later date presumably he had been given the elbow by his better self but why  still there it was  my dear chap i said gentlemanly to the gills dont mention it  whats the sense of saying dont mention it i have mentioned it  i mean dont mention it any more dont give the matter another thought we all of us forget ourselves sometimes and do things which in our calmer moments we regret no doubt you were a bit tight at the time  what the devil do you think youre talking about  i didnt like his tone brusque  correct me if i am wrong i said with a certain stiffness but i assumed that you were apologizing for your foul conduct in looping back the last ring that night in the drones causing me to plunge into the swimming b in the full soup and fish  ass not that at all  then what  this bassett business  what bassett business  bertie said tuppy when you told me last night that you were in love with madeline bassett i gave you the impression that i believed you but i didnt the thing seemed too incredible however since then i have made inquiries and the facts appear to square with your statement i have now come to apologize for doubting you  made inquiries  i asked her if you had proposed to her and she said yes you had  tuppy you didnt  i did  have you no delicacy no proper feeling  no  oh well rightho of course but i think you ought to have  delicacy be dashed i wanted to be certain that it was not you who stole angela from me i now know it wasnt  so long as he knew that i didnt so much mind him having no delicacy  ah i said well thats fine hold that thought  i have found out who it was  what  he stood brooding for a moment his eyes were smouldering with a dull fire his jaw stuck out like the back of jeevess head  bertie he said do you remember what i swore i would do to the chap who stole angela from me  as nearly as i recall you planned to pull him inside out  and make him swallow himself correct the programme still holds good  but tuppy i keep assuring you as a competent eyewitness that nobody snitched angela from you during that cannes trip  no but they did after she got back  what  dont keep saying what you heard  but she hasnt seen anybody since she got back  oh no how about that newt bloke  gussie  precisely the serpent finknottle  this seemed to me absolute gibbering  but gussie loves the bassett  you cant all love this blighted bassett what astonishes me is that anyone can do it he loves angela i tell you and she loves him  but angela handed you your hat before gussie ever got here  no she didnt couple of hours after  he couldnt have fallen in love with her in a couple of hours  why not i fell in love with her in a couple of minutes i worshipped her immediately we met the popeyed little excrescence  but dash it  dont argue bertie the facts are all docketed she loves this newtnuzzling blister  quite absurd laddiequite absurd  oh he ground a heel into the carpeta thing ive often read about but had never seen done before then perhaps you will explain how it is that she happens to come to be engaged to him  you could have knocked me down with a f  engaged to him  she told me herself  she was kidding you  she was not kidding me shortly after the conclusion of this afternoons binge at market snodsbury grammar school he asked her to marry him and she appears to have righthoed without a murmur  there must be some mistake  there was the snake finknottle made it and by now i bet he realizes it ive been chasing him since 530  chasing him  all over the place i want to pull his head off  i see quite  you havent seen him by any chance  no  well if you do say goodbye to him quickly and put in your order for lilies oh jeeves  sir  i hadnt heard the door open but the man was on the spot once more my private belief as i think i have mentioned before is that jeeves doesnt have to open doors hes like one of those birds in india who bung their astral bodies aboutthe chaps i mean who having gone into thin air in bombay reassemble the parts and appear two minutes later in calcutta only some such theory will account for the fact that hes not there one moment and is there the next he just seems to float from spot a to spot b like some form of gas  have you seen mr finknottle jeeves  no sir  im going to murder him  very good sir  tuppy withdrew banging the door behind him and i put jeeves abreast  jeeves i said do you know what mr finknottle is engaged to my cousin angela  indeed sir  well how about it do you grasp the psychology does it make sense only a few hours ago he was engaged to miss bassett  gentlemen who have been discarded by one young lady are often apt to attach themselves without delay to another sir it is what is known as a gesture  i began to grasp  i see what you mean defiant stuff  yes sir  a sort of oh rightho please yourself but if you dont want me there are plenty who do  precisely sir my cousin george  never mind about your cousin george jeeves  very good sir  keep him for the long winter evenings what  just as you wish sir  and anyway i bet your cousin george wasnt a shrinking nongooseboing jellyfish like gussie that is what astounds me jeevesthat it should be gussie who has been putting in all this heavy gesturemaking stuff  you must remember sir that mr finknottle is in a somewhat inflamed cerebral condition  thats true a bit above par at the moment as it were  exactly sir  well ill tell you one thinghell be in a jolly sight more inflamed cerebral condition if tuppy gets hold of him whats the time  just on eight oclock sir  then tuppy has been chasing him for two hours and a half we must save the unfortunate blighter jeeves  yes sir  a human life is a human life what  exceedingly true sir  the first thing then is to find him after that we can discuss plans and schemes go forth jeeves and scour the neighbourhood  it will not be necessary sir if you will glance behind you you will see mr finknottle coming out from beneath your bed  and by jove he was absolutely right  there was gussie emerging as stated he was covered with fluff and looked like a tortoise popping forth for a bit of a breather  gussie i said  jeeves said gussie  sir said jeeves  is that door locked jeeves  no sir but i will attend to the matter immediately  gussie sat down on the bed and i thought for a moment that he was going to be in the mode by burying his face in his hands however he merely brushed a dead spider from his brow  have you locked the door jeeves  yes sir  because you can never tell that that ghastly glossop may not take it into his head to come  the word back froze on his lips he hadnt got any further than a bish sound when the handle of the door began to twist and rattle he sprang from the bed and for an instant stood looking exactly like a picture my aunt agatha has in her diningroomthe stag at baylandseer then he made a dive for the cupboard and was inside it before one really got on to it that he had started leaping i have seen fellows late for the 915 move less nippily  i shot a glance at jeeves he allowed his right eyebrow to flicker slightly which is as near as he ever gets to a display of the emotions  hullo i yipped  let me in blast you responded tuppys voice from without who locked this door  i consulted jeeves once more in the language of the eyebrow he raised one of his i raised one of mine he raised his other i raised my other then we both raised both finally there seeming no other policy to pursue i flung wide the gates and tuppy came shooting in  now what i said as nonchalantly as i could manage  why was the door locked demanded tuppy  i was in pretty good eyebrowraising form by now so i gave him a touch of it  is one to have no privacy glossop i said coldly i instructed jeeves to lock the door because i was about to disrobe  a likely story said tuppy and im not sure he didnt add forsooth you neednt try to make me believe that youre afraid people are going to run excursion trains to see you in your underwear you locked that door because youve got the snake finknottle concealed in here i suspected it the moment id left and i decided to come back and investigate im going to search this room from end to end i believe hes in that cupboard whats in this cupboard  just clothes i said having another stab at the nonchalant though extremely dubious as to whether it would come off the usual wardrobe of the english gentleman paying a countryhouse visit  youre lying  well i wouldnt have been if he had only waited a minute before speaking because the words were hardly out of his mouth before gussie was out of the cupboard i have commented on the speed with which he had gone in it was as nothing to the speed with which he emerged there was a sort of whir and blur and he was no longer with us  i think tuppy was surprised in fact im sure he was despite the confidence with which he had stated his view that the cupboard contained finknottles it plainly disconcerted him to have the chap fizzing out at him like this he gargled sharply and jumped back about five feet the next moment however he had recovered his poise and was galloping down the corridor in pursuit it only needed aunt dahlia after them shouting yoicks or whatever is customary on these occasions to complete the resemblance to a brisk run with the quorn  i sank into a handy chair i am not a man whom it is easy to discourage but it seemed to me that things had at last begun to get too complex for bertram  jeeves i said all this is a bit thick  yes sir  the head rather swims  yes sir  i think you had better leave me jeeves i shall need to devote the very closest thought to the situation which has arisen  very good sir  the door closed i lit a cigarette and began to ponder    19   most chaps in my position i imagine would have pondered all the rest of the evening without getting a bite but we woosters have an uncanny knack of going straight to the heart of things and i dont suppose it was much more than ten minutes after i had started pondering before i saw what had to be done  what was needed to straighten matters out i perceived was a heartto heart talk with angela she had caused all the trouble by her mutton headed behaviour in saying yes instead of no when gussie in the grip of mixed drinks and cerebral excitement had suggested teaming up she must obviously be properly ticked off and made to return him to store a quarter of an hour later i had tracked her down to the summerhouse in which she was taking a cooler and was seating myself by her side  angela i said and if my voice was stern well whose wouldnt have been this is all perfect drivel  she seemed to come out of a reverie she looked at me inquiringly  im sorry bertie i didnt hear what were you talking drivel about  i was not talking drivel  oh sorry i thought you said you were  is it likely that i would come out here in order to talk drivel  very likely  i thought it best to haul off and approach the matter from another angle  ive just been seeing tuppy  oh  and gussie finknottle  oh yes  it appears that you have gone and got engaged to the latter  quite right  well thats what i meant when i said it was all perfect drivel you cant possibly love a chap like gussie  why not  you simply cant  well i mean to say of course she couldnt nobody could love a freak like gussie except a similar freak like the bassett the shot wasnt on the board a splendid chap of course in many wayscourteous amiable and just the fellow to tell you what to do till the doctor came if you had a sick newt on your handsbut quite obviously not of mendelssohns march timber i have no doubt that you could have flung bricks by the hour in englands most densely populated districts without endangering the safety of a single girl capable of becoming mrs augustus finknottle without an anaesthetic  i put this to her and she was forced to admit the justice of it  all right then perhaps i dont  then what i said keenly did you want to go and get engaged to him for you unreasonable young fathead  i thought it would be fun  fun  and so it has been ive had a lot of fun out of it you should have seen tuppys face when i told him  a sudden bright light shone upon me  ha a gesture  what  you got engaged to gussie just to score off tuppy  i did  well then that was what i was saying it was a gesture  yes i suppose you could call it that  and ill tell you something else ill call itviz a dashed low trick im surprised at you young angela  i dont see why  i curled the lip about half an inch being a female you wouldnt you gentler sexes are like that you pull off the rawest stuff without a pang you pride yourselves on it look at jael the wife of heber  where did you ever hear of jael the wife of heber  possibly you are not aware that i once won a scriptureknowledge prize at school  oh yes i remember augustus mentioning it in his speech  quite i said a little hurriedly i had no wish to be reminded of augustuss speech well as i say look at jael the wife of heber dug spikes into the guests coconut while he was asleep and then went swanking about the place like a girl guide no wonder they say oh woman woman  who  the chaps who do coo what a sex but you arent proposing to keep this up of course  keep what up  this rot of being engaged to gussie  i certainly am  just to make tuppy look silly  do you think he looks silly  i do  so he ought to  i began to get the idea that i wasnt making real headway i remember when i won that scriptureknowledge prize having to go into the facts about balaams ass i cant quite recall what they were but i still retain a sort of general impression of something digging its feet in and putting its ears back and refusing to cooperate and it seemed to me that this was what angela was doing now she and balaams ass were so to speak sisters under the skin theres a word beginning with rre somethingrecal somethingno its gone but what i am driving at is that is what this angela was showing herself  silly young geezer i said  she pinkened  im not a silly young geezer  you are a silly young geezer and whats more you know it  i dont know anything of the kind  here you are wrecking tuppys life wrecking gussies life all for the sake of a cheap score  well its no business of yours  i sat on this promptly  no business of mine when i see two lives i used to go to school with wrecked ha besides you know youre potty about tuppy  im not  is that so if i had a quid for every time ive seen you gaze at him with the lovelight in your eyes  she gazed at me but without the lovelight  oh for goodness sake go away and boil your head bertie  i drew myself up  that i replied with dignity is just what i am going to go away and boil at least i mean i shall now leave you i have said my say  good  but permit me to add  i wont  very good i said coldly in that case tinkerty tonk  and i meant it to sting  moody and discouraged were about the two adjectives you would have selected to describe me as i left the summerhouse it would be idle to deny that i had expected better results from this little chat  i was surprised at angela odd how you never realize that every girl is at heart a vicious specimen until something goes wrong with her love affair this cousin and i had been meeting freely since the days when i wore sailor suits and she hadnt any front teeth yet only now was i beginning to get on to her hidden depths a simple jolly kindly young pimple she had always struck me asthe sort you could more or less rely on not to hurt a fly but here she was now laughing heartlesslyat least i seemed to remember hearing her laugh heartlesslylike something cold and callous out of a sophisticated talkie and fairly spitting on her hands in her determination to bring tuppys grey hairs in sorrow to the grave  ive said it before and ill say it againgirls are rummy old pop kipling never said a truer word than when he made that crack about the f of the s being more d than the m  it seemed to me in the circs that there was but one thing to dothat is head for the diningroom and take a slash at the cold collation of which jeeves had spoken i felt in urgent need of sustenance for the recent interview had pulled me down a bit there is no gainsaying the fact that this nakedemotion stuff reduces a chaps vitality and puts him in the vein for a good whack at the beef and ham  to the diningroom accordingly i repaired and had barely crossed the threshold when i perceived aunt dahlia at the sideboard tucking into salmon mayonnaise  the spectacle drew from me a quick oh ah for i was somewhat embarrassed the last time this relative and i had enjoyed a têteàtête it will be remembered she had sketched out plans for drowning me in the kitchengarden pond and i was not quite sure what my present standing with her was  i was relieved to find her in genial mood nothing could have exceeded the cordiality with which she waved her fork  hallo bertie you old ass was her very matey greeting i thought i shouldnt find you far away from the food try some of this salmon excellent  anatoles i queried  no hes still in bed but the kitchen maid has struck an inspired streak it suddenly seems to have come home to her that she isnt catering for a covey of buzzards in the sahara desert and she has put out something quite fit for human consumption there is good in the girl after all and i hope she enjoys herself at the dance  i ladled out a portion of salmon and we fell into pleasant conversation chatting of this servants ball at the stretchleybudds and speculating idly i recall as to what seppings the butler would look like doing the rumba  it was not till i had cleaned up the first platter and was embarking on a second that the subject of gussie came up considering what had passed at market snodsbury that afternoon it was one which i had been expecting her to touch on earlier when she did touch on it i could see that she had not yet been informed of angelas engagement  i say bertie she said meditatively chewing fruit salad this spinkbottle  nottle  bottle insisted the aunt firmly after that exhibition of his this afternoon bottle and nothing but bottle is how i shall always think of him however what i was going to say was that if you see him i wish you would tell him that he has made an old woman very very happy except for the time when the curate tripped over a loose shoelace and fell down the pulpit steps i dont think i have ever had a more wonderful moment than when good old bottle suddenly started ticking tom off from the platform in fact i thought his whole performance in the most perfect taste  i could not but demur  those references to myself  those were what i liked next best i thought they were fine is it true that you cheated when you won that scriptureknowledge prize  certainly not my victory was the outcome of the most strenuous and unremitting efforts  and how about this pessimism we hear of are you a pessimist bertie  i could have told her that what was occurring in this house was rapidly making me one but i said no i wasnt  thats right never be a pessimist everything is for the best in this best of all possible worlds its a long lane that has no turning it s always darkest before the dawn have patience and all will come right the sun will shine although the days a grey one try some of this salad  i followed her advice but even as i plied the spoon my thoughts were elsewhere i was perplexed it may have been the fact that i had recently been hobnobbing with so many boweddown hearts that made this cheeriness of hers seem so bizarre but bizarre was certainly what i found it  i thought you might have been a trifle peeved i said  peeved  by gussies manoeuvres on the platform this afternoon i confess that i had rather expected the tapping foot and the drawn brow  nonsense what was there to be peeved about i took the whole thing as a great compliment proud to feel that any drink from my cellars could have produced such a majestic jag it restores ones faith in postwar whisky besides i couldnt be peeved at anything tonight i am like a little child clapping its hands and dancing in the sunshine for though it has been some time getting a move on bertie the sun has at last broken through the clouds ring out those joy bells anatole has withdrawn his notice  what oh very hearty congratulations  thanks yes i worked on him like a beaver after i got back this afternoon and finally vowing he would neer consent he consented he stays on praises be and the way i look at it now is that gods in his heaven and alls right with  she broke off the door had opened and we were plus a butler  hullo seppings said aunt dahlia i thought you had gone  not yet madam  well i hope you will all have a good time  thank you madam  was there something you wanted to see me about  yes madam it is with reference to monsieur anatole is it by your wish madam that mr finknottle is making faces at monsieur anatole through the skylight of his bedroom    20   there was one of those long silences pregnant i believe is what theyre generally called aunt looked at butler butler looked at aunt i looked at both of them an eerie stillness seemed to envelop the room like a linseed poultice i happened to be biting on a slice of apple in my fruit salad at the moment and it sounded as if carnera had jumped off the top of the eiffel tower on to a cucumber frame  aunt dahlia steadied herself against the sideboard and spoke in a low husky voice  faces  yes madam  through the skylight  yes madam  you mean hes sitting on the roof  yes madam it has upset monsieur anatole very much  i suppose it was that word upset that touched aunt dahlia off experience had taught her what happened when anatole got upset i had always known her as a woman who was quite active on her pins but i had never suspected her of being capable of the magnificent burst of speed which she now showed pausing merely to get a rich huntingfield expletive off her chest she was out of the room and making for the stairs before i could swallow a sliver ofi thinkbanana and feeling as i had felt when i got that telegram of hers about angela and tuppy that my place was by her side i put down my plate and hastened after her seppings following at a loping gallop  i say that my place was by her side but it was not so dashed easy to get there for she was setting a cracking pace at the top of the first flight she must have led by a matter of half a dozen lengths and was still shaking off my challenge when she rounded into the second at the next landing however the gruelling going appeared to tell on her for she slackened off a trifle and showed symptoms of roaring and by the time we were in the straight we were running practically neck and neck our entry into anatoles room was as close a finish as you could have wished to see  result  1 aunt dahlia  2 bertram  3 seppings  won by a short head half a staircase separated second and third  the first thing that met the eye on entering was anatole this wizard of the cookingstove is a tubby little man with a moustache of the outsize or soupstrainer type and you can generally take a line through it as to the state of his emotions when all is well it turns up at the ends like a sergeantmajors when the soul is bruised it droops  it was drooping now striking a sinister note and if any shadow of doubt had remained as to how he was feeling the way he was carrying on would have dispelled it he was standing by the bed in pink pyjamas waving his fists at the skylight through the glass gussie was staring down his eyes were bulging and his mouth was open giving him so striking a resemblance to some rare fish in an aquarium that ones primary impulse was to offer him an ants egg  watching this fistwaving cook and this goggling guest i must say that my sympathies were completely with the former i considered him thoroughly justified in waving all the fists he wanted to  review the facts i mean to say there he had been lying in bed thinking idly of whatever french cooks do think about when in bed and he had suddenly become aware of that frightful face at the window a thing to jar the most phlegmatic i know i should hate to be lying in bed and have gussie popping up like that a chaps bedroomyou cant get away from itis his castle and he has every right to look askance if gargoyles come glaring in at him  while i stood musing thus aunt dahlia in her practical way was coming straight to the point  whats all this  anatole did a sort of swedish exercise starting at the base of the spine carrying on through the shoulderblades and finishing up among the back hair  then he told her  in the chats i have had with this wonder man i have always found his english fluent but a bit on the mixed side if you remember he was with mrs bingo little for a time before coming to brinkley and no doubt he picked up a good deal from bingo before that he had been a couple of years with an american family at nice and had studied under their chauffeur one of the maloneys of brooklyn so what with bingo and what with maloney he is as i say fluent but a bit mixed  he spoke in part as follows  hot dog you ask me what is it listen make some attention a little me i have hit the hay but i do not sleep so good and presently i wake and up i look and there is one who make faces against me through the dashed window is that a pretty affair is that convenient if you think i like it you jolly well mistake yourself i am so mad as a wet hen and why not i am somebody isnt it this is a bedroom whatwhat not a house for some apes then for what do blighters sit on my window so cool as a few cucumbers making some faces  quite i said dashed reasonable was my verdict  he threw another look up at gussie and did exercise 2the one where you clutch the moustache give it a tug and then start catching flies  wait yet a little i am not finish i say i see this type on my window making a few faces but what then does he buzz off when i shout a cry and leave me peaceable not on your life he remain planted there not giving any damns and sit regarding me like a cat watching a duck he make faces against me and again he make faces against me and the more i command that he should get to hell out of here the more he do not get to hell out of here he cry something towards me and i demand what is his desire but he do not explain oh no that arrives never he does but shrug his head what damn silliness is this amusing for me you think i like it i am not content with such folly i think the poor mutts loony je me fiche de ce type infect cest idiot de faire comme ça loiseau allezvousen louffier tell the boob to go away he is mad as some march hatters  i must say i thought he was making out a jolly good case and evidently aunt dahlia felt the same she laid a quivering hand on his shoulder  i will monsieur anatole i will she said and i couldnt have believed that robust voice capable of sinking to such an absolute coo more like a turtle dove calling to its mate than anything else its quite all right  she had said the wrong thing he did exercise 3  all right nom dun nom dun nom the hell you say its all right of what use to pull stuff like that wait one halfmoment not yet quite so quick my old sport it is by no means all right see yet again a little it is some very different dishes of fish i can take a few smooths with a rough it is true but i do not find it agreeable when one play larks against me on my windows that cannot do a nice thing no i am a serious man i do not wish a few larks on my windows i enjoy larks on my windows worse as any it is very little all right if such rannygazoo is to arrive i do not remain any longer in this house no more i buzz off and do not stay planted  sinister words i had to admit and i was not surprised that aunt dahlia hearing them should have uttered a cry like the wail of a master of hounds seeing a fox shot anatole had begun to wave his fists again at gussie and she now joined him seppings who was puffing respectfully in the background didnt actually wave his fists but he gave gussie a pretty austere look it was plain to the thoughtful observer that this finknottle in getting on to that skylight had done a mistaken thing he couldnt have been more unpopular in the home of gg simmons  go away you crazy loon cried aunt dahlia in that ringing voice of hers which had once caused nervous members of the quorn to lose stirrups and take tosses from the saddle  gussies reply was to waggle his eyebrows i could read the message he was trying to convey  i think he means i saidreasonable old bertram always trying to throw oil on the troubled wsthat if he does he will fall down the side of the house and break his neck  well why not said aunt dahlia  i could see her point of course but it seemed to me that there might be a nearer solution this skylight happened to be the only window in the house which uncle tom had not festooned with his bally bars i suppose he felt that if a burglar had the nerve to climb up as far as this he deserved what was coming to him  if you opened the skylight he could jump in  the idea got across  seppings how does this skylight open  with a pole madam  then get a pole get two poles ten  and presently gussie was mixing with the company like one of those chaps you read about in the papers the wretched man seemed deeply conscious of his position  i must say aunt dahlias bearing and demeanour did nothing to assist toward a restored composure of the amiability which she had exhibited when discussing this unhappy chumps activities with me over the fruit salad no trace remained and i was not surprised that speech more or less froze on the finknottle lips it isnt often that aunt dahlia normally as genial a bird as ever encouraged a gaggle of hounds to get their noses down to it lets her angry passions rise but when she does strong men climb trees and pull them up after them  well she said  in answer to this all that gussie could produce was a sort of strangled hiccough  well  aunt dahlias face grew darker hunting if indulged in regularly over a period of years is a pastime that seldom fails to lend a fairly deepish tinge to the patients complexion and her best friends could not have denied that even at normal times the relatives map tended a little toward the crushed strawberry but never had i seen it take on so pronounced a richness as now she looked like a tomato struggling for selfexpression  well  gussie tried hard and for a moment it seemed as if something was going to come through but in the end it turned out nothing more than a sort of deathrattle  oh take him away bertie and put ice on his head said aunt dahlia giving the thing up and she turned to tackle what looked like the rather mans size job of soothing anatole who was now carrying on a muttered conversation with himself in a rapid sort of way  seeming to feel that the situation was one to which he could not do justice in bingocummaloney angloamerican he had fallen back on his native tongue words like marmiton de domange pignouf hurluberlu and roustisseur were fluttering from him like bats out of a barn lost on me of course because though i sweated a bit at the gallic language during that cannes visit im still more or less in the eskervousavez stage i regretted this for they sounded good  i assisted gussie down the stairs a cooler thinker than aunt dahlia i had already guessed the hidden springs and motives which had led him to the roof where she had seen only a cockeyed reveller indulging himself in a drunken prank or whimsy i had spotted the hunted fawn  was tuppy after you i asked sympathetically  what i believe is called a frisson shook him  he nearly got me on the top landing i shinned out through a passage window and scrambled along a sort of ledge  that baffled him what  yes but then i found i had stuck the roof sloped down in all directions i couldnt go back i had to go on crawling along this ledge and then i found myself looking down the skylight who was that chap  that was anatole aunt dahlias chef  french  to the core  that explains why i couldnt make him understand what asses these frenchmen are they dont seem able to grasp the simplest thing youd have thought if a chap saw a chap on a skylight the chap would realize the chap wanted to be let in but no he just stood there  waving a few fists  yes silly idiot still here i am  here you are yesfor the moment  eh  i was thinking that tuppy is probably lurking somewhere  he leaped like a lamb in springtime  what shall i do  i considered this  sneak back to your room and barricade the door that is the manly policy  suppose thats where hes lurking  in that case move elsewhere  but on arrival at the room it transpired that tuppy if anywhere was infesting some other portion of the house gussie shot in and i heard the key turn and feeling that there was no more that i could do in that quarter i returned to the diningroom for further fruit salad and a quiet think and i had barely filled my plate when the door opened and aunt dahlia came in she sank into a chair looking a bit shopworn  give me a drink bertie  what sort  any sort so long as its strong  approach bertram wooster along these lines and you catch him at his best st bernard dogs doing the square thing by alpine travellers could not have bustled about more assiduously i filled the order and for some moments nothing was to be heard but the sloshing sound of an aunt restoring her tissues  shove it down aunt dahlia i said sympathetically these things take it out of one dont they youve had a toughish time no doubt soothing anatole i proceeded helping myself to anchovy paste on toast everything pretty smooth now i trust  she gazed at me in a long lingering sort of way her brow wrinkled as if in thought  attila she said at length thats the name attila the hun  eh  i was trying to think who you reminded me of somebody who went about strewing ruin and desolation and breaking up homes which until he came along had been happy and peaceful attila is the man its amazing she said drinking me in once more to look at you one would think you were just an ordinary sort of amiable idiotcertifiable perhaps but quite harmless yet in reality you are worse a scourge than the black death i tell you bertie when i contemplate you i seem to come up against all the underlying sorrow and horror of life with such a thud that i feel as if i had walked into a lamp post  pained and surprised i would have spoken but the stuff i had thought was anchovy paste had turned out to be something far more gooey and adhesive it seemed to wrap itself round the tongue and impede utterance like a gag and while i was still endeavouring to clear the vocal cords for action she went on  do you realize what you started when you sent that spinkbottle man down here as regards his getting blotto and turning the prizegiving ceremonies at market snodsbury grammar school into a sort of tworeel comic film i will say nothing for frankly i enjoyed it but when he comes leering at anatole through skylights just after i had with infinite pains and tact induced him to withdraw his notice and makes him so temperamental that he wont hear of staying on after tomorrow  the paste stuff gave way i was able to speak  what  yes anatole goes tomorrow and i suppose poor old tom will have indigestion for the rest of his life and that is not all i have just seen angela and she tells me she is engaged to this bottle  temporarily yes i had to admit  temporarily be blowed shes definitely engaged to him and talks with a sort of hideous coolness of getting married in october so there it is if the prophet job were to walk into the room at this moment i could sit swapping hardluck stories with him till bedtime not that job was in my class  he had boils  well what are boils  dashed painful i understand  nonsense id take all the boils on the market in exchange for my troubles cant you realize the position ive lost the best cook to england my husband poor soul will probably die of dyspepsia and my only daughter for whom i had dreamed such a wonderful future is engaged to be married to an inebriated newt fancier and you talk about boils  i corrected her on a small point  i dont absolutely talk about boils i merely mentioned that job had them yes i agree with you aunt dahlia that things are not looking too oojahcumspiff at the moment but be of good cheer a wooster is seldom baffled for more than the nonce  you rather expect to be coming along shortly with another of your schemes  at any minute  she sighed resignedly  i thought as much well it needed but this i dont see how things could possibly be worse than they are but no doubt you will succeed in making them so your genius and insight will find the way carry on bertie yes carry on i am past caring now i shall even find a faint interest in seeing into what darker and profounder abysses of hell you can plunge this home go to it lad whats that stuff youre eating  i find it a little difficult to classify some sort of paste on toast rather like glue flavoured with beef extract  gimme said aunt dahlia listlessly  be careful how you chew i advised it sticketh closer than a brother yes jeeves  the man had materialized on the carpet absolutely noiseless as usual  a note for you sir  a note for me jeeves  a note for you sir  from whom jeeves  from miss bassett sir  from whom jeeves  from miss bassett sir  from miss bassett jeeves  from miss bassett sir  at this point aunt dahlia who had taken one nibble at her whateveritwasontoast and laid it down begged usa little fretfully i thoughtfor heavens sake to cut out the crosstalk vaudeville stuff as she had enough to bear already without having to listen to us doing our imitation of the two macs always willing to oblige i dismissed jeeves with a nod and he flickered for a moment and was gone many a spectre would have been less slippy  but what i mused toying with the envelope can this female be writing to me about  why not open the damn thing and see  a very excellent idea i said and did so  and if you are interested in my movements proceeded aunt dahlia heading for the door i propose to go to my room do some yogi deep breathing and try to forget  quite i said absently skimming p l and then as i turned over a sharp howl broke from my lips causing aunt dahlia to shy like a startled mustang  dont do it she exclaimed quivering in every limb  yes but dash it  what a pest you are you miserable object she sighed i remember years ago when you were in your cradle being left alone with you one day and you nearly swallowed your rubber comforter and started turning purple and i ass that i was took it out and saved your life let me tell you young bertie it will go very hard with you if you ever swallow a rubber comforter again when only i am by to aid  but dash it i cried do you know whats happened madeline bassett says shes going to marry me  i hope it keeps fine for you said the relative and passed from the room looking like something out of an edgar allan poe story    21   i dont suppose i was looking so dashed unlike something out of an edgar allan poe story myself for as you can readily imagine the news item which i have just recorded had got in amongst me properly if the bassett in the belief that the wooster heart had long been hers and was waiting ready to be scooped in on demand had decided to take up her option i should as a man of honour and sensibility have no choice but to come across and kick in the matter was obviously not one that could be straightened out with a curt nolle prosequi all the evidence therefore seemed to point to the fact that the doom had come upon me and what was more had come to stay  and yet though it would be idle to pretend that my grip on the situation was quite the grip i would have liked it to be i did not despair of arriving at a solution a lesser man caught in this awful snare would no doubt have thrown in the towel at once and ceased to struggle but the whole point about the woosters is that they are not lesser men  by way of a start i read the note again not that i had any hope that a second perusal would enable me to place a different construction on its contents but it helped to fill in while the brain was limbering up i then to assist thought had another go at the fruit salad and in addition ate a slice of sponge cake and it was as i passed on to the cheese that the machinery started working i saw what had to be done  to the question which had been exercising the mindviz can bertram copei was now able to reply with a confident absolutely  the great wheeze on these occasions of dirty work at the crossroads is not to lose your head but to keep cool and try to find the ringleaders once find the ringleaders and you know where you are  the ringleader here was plainly the bassett it was she who had started the whole imbroglio by chucking gussie and it was clear that before anything could be done to solve and clarify she must be induced to revise her views and take him on again this would put angela back into circulation and that would cause tuppy to simmer down a bit and then we could begin to get somewhere  i decided that as soon as i had had another morsel of cheese i would seek this bassett out and be pretty eloquent  and at this moment in she came i might have foreseen that she would be turning up shortly i mean to say hearts may ache but if they know that there is a cold collation set out in the diningroom they are pretty sure to come popping in sooner or later  her eyes as she entered the room were fixed on the salmon mayonnaise and she would no doubt have made a beeline for it and started getting hers had i not in the emotion of seeing her dropped a glass of the best with which i was endeavouring to bring about a calmer frame of mind the noise caused her to turn and for an instant embarrassment supervened a slight flush mantled the cheek and the eyes popped a bit  oh she said  i have always found that there is nothing that helps to ease you over one of these awkward moments like a spot of stage business find something to do with your hands and its half the battle i grabbed a plate and hastened forward  a touch of salmon  thank you  with a suspicion of salad  if you please  and to drink name the poison  i think i would like a little orange juice  she gave a gulp not at the orange juice i dont mean because she hadnt got it yet but at all the tender associations those two words provoked it was as if someone had mentioned spaghetti to the relict of an italian organgrinder her face flushed a deeper shade she registered anguish and i saw that it was no longer within the sphere of practical politics to try to confine the conversation to neutral topics like cold boiled salmon  so did she i imagine for when i as a preliminary to getting down to brass tacks said er she said er too simultaneously the brace of ers clashing in midair  im sorry  i beg your pardon  you were saying  you were saying  no please go on  oh rightho  i straightened the tie my habit when in this girls society and had at it  with reference to yours of even date  she flushed again and took a rather strained forkful of salmon  you got my note  yes i got your note  i gave it to jeeves to give it to you  yes he gave it to me thats how i got it  there was another silence and as she was plainly shrinking from talking turkey i was reluctantly compelled to do so i mean somebody had got to too dashed silly a male and female in our position simply standing eating salmon and cheese at one another without a word  yes i got it all right  i see you got it  yes i got it ive just been reading it and what i was rather wanting to ask you if we happened to run into each other waswell what about it  what about it  thats what i say what about it  but it was quite clear  oh quite perfectly clear very well expressed and all that buti meanwell i mean deeply sensible of the honour and so forthbut well dash it  she had polished off her salmon and now put the plate down  fruit salad  no thank you  spot of pie  no thanks  one of those glue things on toast  no thank you  she took a cheese straw i found a cold egg which i had overlooked then i said i mean to say just as she said i think i know and there was another collision  i beg your pardon  im sorry  do go on  no you go on  i waved my cold egg courteously to indicate that she had the floor and she started again  i think i know what you are trying to say you are surprised  yes  you are thinking of  exactly  mr finknottle  the very man  you find what i have done hard to understand  absolutely  i dont wonder  i do  and yet it is quite simple  she took another cheese straw she seemed to like cheese straws  quite simple really i want to make you happy  dashed decent of you  i am going to devote the rest of my life to making you happy  a very matey scheme  i can at least do that butmay i be quite frank with you bertie  oh rather  then i must tell you this i am fond of you i will marry you i will do my best to make you a good wife but my affection for you can never be the flamelike passion i felt for augustus  just the very point i was working round to there as you say is the snag why not chuck the whole idea of hitching up with me wash it out altogether i mean if you love old gussie  no longer  oh come  no what happened this afternoon has killed my love a smear of ugliness has been drawn across a thing of beauty and i can never feel towards him as i did  i saw what she meant of course gussie had bunged his heart at her feet she had picked it up and almost immediately after doing so had discovered that he had been stewed to the eyebrows all the time the shock must have been severe no girl likes to feel that a chap has got to be thoroughly plastered before he can ask her to marry him it wounds the pride  nevertheless i persevered  but have you considered i said that you may have got a wrong line on gussies performance this afternoon admitted that all the evidence points to a more sinister theory what price him simply having got a touch of the sun chaps do get touches of the sun you know especially when the weathers hot  she looked at me and i saw that she was putting in a bit of the old drenchedirises stuff  it was like you to say that bertie i respect you for it  oh no  yes you have a splendid chivalrous soul  not a bit  yes you have you remind me of cyrano  who  cyrano de bergerac  the chap with the nose  yes  i cant say i was any too pleased i felt the old beak furtively it was a bit on the prominent side perhaps but dash it not in the cyrano class it began to look as if the next thing this girl would do would be to compare me to schnozzle durante  he loved but pleaded anothers cause  oh i see what you mean now  i like you for that bertie it was fine of youfine and big but it is no use there are things which kill love i can never forget augustus but my love for him is dead i will be your wife  well one has to be civil  right ho i said thanks awfully  then the dialogue sort of poofed out once more and we stood eating cheese straws and cold eggs respectively in silence there seemed to exist some little uncertainty as to what the next move was  fortunately before embarrassment could do much more supervening angela came in and this broke up the meeting then bassett announced our engagement and angela kissed her and said she hoped she would be very very happy and the bassett kissed her and said she hoped she would be very very happy with gussie and angela said she was sure she would because augustus was such a dear and the bassett kissed her again and angela kissed her again and in a word the whole thing got so bally feminine that i was glad to edge away  i would have been glad to do so of course in any case for if ever there was a moment when it was up to bertram to think and think hard this moment was that moment  it was it seemed to me the end not even on the occasion some years earlier when i had inadvertently become betrothed to tuppys frightful cousin honoria had i experienced a deeper sense of being waist high in the gumbo and about to sink without trace i wandered out into the garden smoking a tortured gasper with the iron well embedded in the soul and i had fallen into a sort of trance trying to picture what it would be like having the bassett on the premises for the rest of my life and at the same time if you follow me trying not to picture what it would be like when i charged into something which might have been a tree but was notbeing in point of fact jeeves  i beg your pardon sir he said i should have moved to one side  i did not reply i stood looking at him in silence for the sight of him had opened up a new line of thought  this jeeves now i reflected i had formed the opinion that he had lost his grip and was no longer the force he had been but was it not possible i asked myself that i might be mistaken start him off exploring avenues and might he not discover one through which i would be enabled to sneak off to safety leaving no hard feelings behind i found myself answering that it was quite on the cards that he might  after all his head still bulged out at the back as of old one noted in the eyes the same intelligent glitter  mind you after what had passed between us in the matter of that white messjacket with the brass buttons i was not prepared absolutely to hand over to the man i would of course merely take him into consultation but recalling some of his earlier triumphsthe sipperley case the episode of my aunt agatha and the dog mcintosh and the smoothly handled affair of uncle george and the barmaids niece were a few that sprang to my mindi felt justified at least in offering him the opportunity of coming to the aid of the young master in his hour of peril  but before proceeding further there was one thing that had got to be understood between us and understood clearly  jeeves i said a word with you  sir  i am up against it a bit jeeves  i am sorry to hear that sir can i be of any assistance  quite possibly you can if you have not lost your grip tell me frankly jeeves are you in pretty good shape mentally  yes sir  still eating plenty of fish  yes sir  then it may be all right but there is just one point before i begin in the past when you have contrived to extricate self or some pal from some little difficulty you have frequently shown a disposition to take advantage of my gratitude to gain some private end those purple socks for instance also the plus fours and the old etonian spats choosing your moment with subtle cunning you came to me when i was weakened by relief and got me to get rid of them and what i am saying now is that if you are successful on the present occasion there must be no rot of that description about that messjacket of mine  very good sir  you will not come to me when all is over and ask me to jettison the jacket  certainly not sir  on that understanding then i will carry on jeeves im engaged  i hope you will be very happy sir  dont be an ass im engaged to miss bassett  indeed sir i was not aware  nor was i it came as a complete surprise however there it is the official intimation was in that note you brought me  odd sir  what is  odd sir that the contents of that note should have been as you describe it seemed to me that miss bassett when she handed me the communication was far from being in a happy frame of mind  she is far from being in a happy frame of mind you dont suppose she really wants to marry me do you pshaw jeeves cant you see that this is simply another of those bally gestures which are rapidly rendering brinkley court a hell for man and beast dash all gestures is my view  yes sir  well whats to be done  you feel that miss bassett despite what has occurred still retains a fondness for mr finknottle sir  shes pining for him  in that case sir surely the best plan would be to bring about a reconciliation between them  how you see you stand silent and twiddle the fingers you are stumped  no sir if i twiddled my fingers it was merely to assist thought  then continue twiddling  it will not be necessary sir  you dont mean youve got a bite already  yes sir  you astound me jeeves lets have it  the device which i have in mind is one that i have already mentioned to you sir  when did you ever mention any device to me  if you will throw your mind back to the evening of our arrival sir you were good enough to inquire of me if i had any plan to put forward with a view to bringing miss angela and mr glossop together and i ventured to suggest  good lord not the old firealarm thing  precisely sir  youre still sticking to that  yes sir  it shows how much the ghastly blow i had received had shaken me when i say that instead of dismissing the proposal with a curt tchah or anything like that i found myself speculating as to whether there might not be something in it after all  when he had first mooted this firealarm scheme of his i had sat upon it if you remember with the maximum of promptitude and vigour rotten was the adjective i had employed to describe it and you may recall that i mused a bit sadly considering the idea conclusive proof of the general breakdown of a once fine mind but now it somehow began to look as if it might have possibilities the fact of the matter was that i had about reached the stage where i was prepared to try anything once however goofy  just run through that wheeze again jeeves i said thoughtfully i remember thinking it cuckoo but it may be that i missed some of the finer shades  your criticism of it at the time sir was that it was too elaborate but i do not think it is so in reality as i see it sir the occupants of the house hearing the fire bell ring will suppose that a conflagration has broken out  i nodded one could follow the train of thought  yes that seems reasonable  whereupon mr glossop will hasten to save miss angela while mr finknottle performs the same office for miss bassett  is that based on psychology  yes sir possibly you may recollect that it was an axiom of the late sir arthur conan doyles fictional detective sherlock holmes that the instinct of everyone upon an alarm of fire is to save the object dearest to them  it seems to me that there is a grave danger of seeing tuppy come out carrying a steakandkidney pie but resume jeeves resume you think that this would clean everything up  the relations of the two young couples could scarcely continue distant after such an occurrence sir  perhaps youre right but dash it if we go ringing fire bells in the night watches shant we scare half the domestic staff into fits there is one of the housemaidsjane i believewho already skips like the high hills if i so much as come on her unexpectedly round a corner  a neurotic girl sir i agree i have noticed her but by acting promptly we should avoid such a contingency the entire staff with the exception of monsieur anatole will be at the ball at kingham manor tonight  of course that just shows the condition this thing has reduced me to forget my own name next well then lets just try to envisage bong goes the bell gussie rushes and grabs the bassett wait why shouldnt she simply walk downstairs  you are overlooking the effect of sudden alarm on the feminine temperament sir  thats true  miss bassetts impulse i would imagine sir would be to leap from her window  well thats worse we dont want her spread out in a sort of purée on the lawn it seems to me that the flaw in this scheme of yours jeeves is that its going to litter the garden with mangled corpses  no sir you will recall that mr traverss fear of burglars has caused him to have stout bars fixed to all the windows  of course yes well it sounds all right i said though still a bit doubtfully quite possibly it may come off but i have a feeling that it will slip up somewhere however i am in no position to cavil at even a 100 to 1 shot i will adopt this policy of yours jeeves though as i say with misgivings at what hour would you suggest bonging the bell  not before midnight sir  that is to say some time after midnight  yes sir  rightho then at 1230 on the dot i will bong  very good sir    22   i dont know why it is but theres something about the rural districts after dark that always has a rummy effect on me in london i can stay out till all hours and come home with the milk without a tremor but put me in the garden of a country house after the strength of the company has gone to roost and the place is shut up and a sort of goosefleshy feeling steals over me the night wind stirs the treetops twigs crack bushes rustle and before i know where i am the morale has gone phut and im expecting the family ghost to come sneaking up behind me making groaning noises dashed unpleasant the whole thing and if you think it improves matters to know that you are shortly about to ring the loudest fire bell in england and start an allhandstothepumps panic in that quiet darkened house you err  i knew all about the brinkley court fire bell the dickens of a row it makes uncle tom in addition to not liking burglars is a bloke who has always objected to the idea of being cooked in his sleep so when he bought the place he saw to it that the fire bell should be something that might give you heart failure but which you couldnt possibly mistake for the drowsy chirping of a sparrow in the ivy  when i was a kid and spent my holidays at brinkley we used to have fire drills after closing time and many is the night ive had it jerk me out of the dreamless like the last trump  i confess that the recollection of what this bell could do when it buckled down to it gave me pause as i stood that night at 1230 pm prompt beside the outhouse where it was located the sight of the rope against the whitewashed wall and the thought of the bloodsome uproar which was about to smash the peace of the night into hash served to deepen that rummy feeling to which i have alluded  moreover now that i had had time to meditate upon it i was more than ever defeatist about this scheme of jeevess  jeeves seemed to take it for granted that gussie and tuppy faced with a hideous fate would have no thought beyond saving the bassett and angela  i could not bring myself to share his sunny confidence  i mean to say i know how moments when theyre faced with a hideous fate affect chaps i remember freddie widgeon one of the most chivalrous birds in the drones telling me how there was an alarm of fire once at a seaside hotel where he was staying and so far from rushing about saving women he was down the escape within ten seconds of the kickoff his mind concerned with but one thingviz the personal wellbeing of f widgeon  as far as any idea of doing the delicately nurtured a bit of good went he tells me he was prepared to stand underneath and catch them in blankets but no more  why then should this not be so with augustus finknottle and hildebrand glossop  such were my thoughts as i stood toying with the rope and i believe i should have turned the whole thing up had it not been that at this juncture there floated into my mind a picture of the bassett hearing that bell for the first time coming as a wholly new experience it would probably startle her into a decline  and so agreeable was this reflection that i waited no longer but seized the rope braced the feet and snapped into it  well as i say i hadnt been expecting that bell to hush things up to any great extent nor did it the last time i had heard it i had been in my room on the other side of the house and even so it had hoiked me out of bed as if something had exploded under me standing close to it like this i got the full force and meaning of the thing and ive never heard anything like it in my puff  i rather enjoy a bit of noise as a general rule i remember catsmeat potterpirbright bringing a police rattle into the drones one night and loosing it off behind my chair and i just lay back and closed my eyes with a pleasant smile like someone in a box at the opera and the same applies to the time when my aunt agathas son young thos put a match to the parcel of guy fawkes day fireworks to see what would happen  but the brinkley court fire bell was too much for me i gave about half a dozen tugs and then feeling that enough was enough sauntered round to the front lawn to ascertain what solid results had been achieved  brinkley court had given of its best a glance told me that we were playing to capacity the eye roving to and fro noted here uncle tom in a purple dressing gown there aunt dahlia in the old blue and yellow it also fell upon anatole tuppy gussie angela the bassett and jeeves in the order named there they all were present and correct  butand this was what caused me immediate concerni could detect no sign whatever that there had been any rescue work going on  what i had been hoping of course was to see tuppy bending solicitously over angela in one corner while gussie fanned the bassett with a towel in the other instead of which the bassett was one of the group which included aunt dahlia and uncle tom and seemed to be busy trying to make anatole see the bright side while angela and gussie were respectively leaning against the sundial with a peeved look and sitting on the grass rubbing a barked shin tuppy was walking up and down the path all by himself  a disturbing picture you will admit it was with a rather imperious gesture that i summoned jeeves to my side  well jeeves  sir  i eyed him sternly sir forsooth  its no good saying sir jeeves look round you see for yourself your scheme has proved a bust  certainly it would appear that matters have not arranged themselves quite as we anticipated sir  we  as i had anticipated sir  thats more like it didnt i tell you it would be a flop  i remember that you did seem dubious sir  dubious is no word for it jeeves i hadnt a scrap of faith in the idea from the start when you first mooted it i said it was rotten and i was right im not blaming you jeeves it is not your fault that you have sprained your brain but after thisforgive me if i hurt your feelings jeevesi shall know better than to allow you to handle any but the simplest and most elementary problems it is best to be candid about this dont you think kindest to be frank and straightforward  certainly sir  i mean the surgeons knife what  precisely sir  i consider  if you will pardon me for interrupting you sir i fancy mrs travers is endeavouring to attract your attention  and at this moment a ringing hoy which could have proceeded only from the relative in question assured me that his view was correct  just step this way a moment attila if you dont mind boomed that wellknownand under certain conditions welllovedvoice and i moved over  i was not feeling unmixedly at my ease for the first time it was beginning to steal upon me that i had not prepared a really good story in support of my questionable behaviour in ringing fire bells at such an hour and i have known aunt dahlia to express herself with a hearty freedom upon far smaller provocation  she exhibited however no signs of violence more a sort of frozen calm if you know what i mean you could see that she was a woman who had suffered  well bertie dear she said here we all are  quite i replied guardedly  nobody missing is there  i dont think so  splendid so much healthier for us out in the open like this than frowsting in bed i had just dropped off when you did your bellringing act for it was you my sweet child who rang that bell was knot  i did ring the bell yes  any particular reason or just a whim  i thought there was a fire  what gave you that impression dear  i thought i saw flames  where darling tell aunt dahlia  in one of the windows  i see so we have all been dragged out of bed and scared rigid because you have been seeing things  here uncle tom made a noise like a cork coming out of a bottle and anatole whose moustache had hit a new low said something about some apes and if i am not mistaken a rogommierwhatever that is  i admit i was mistaken i am sorry  dont apologize ducky cant you see how pleased we all are what were you doing out here anyway  just taking a stroll  i see and are you proposing to continue your stroll  no i think ill go in now  thats fine because i was thinking of going in too and i dont believe i could sleep knowing you were out here giving rein to that powerful imagination of yours the next thing that would happen would be that you would think you saw a pink elephant sitting on the drawingroom windowsill and start throwing bricks at it well come on tom the entertainment seems to be over but wait the newt king wishes a word with us yes mr finknottle  gussie as he joined our little group seemed upset about something  i say  say on augustus  i say what are we going to do  speaking for myself i intend to return to bed  but the doors shut  what door  the front door somebody must have shut it  then i shall open it  but it wont open  then i shall try another door  but all the other doors are shut  what who shut them  i dont know  i advanced a theory  the wind  aunt dahlias eyes met mine  dont try me too high she begged not now precious and indeed even as i spoke it did strike me that the night was pretty still  uncle tom said we must get in through a window aunt dahlia sighed a bit  how could lloyd george do it could winston do it could baldwin do it no not since you had those bars of yours put on  well well well god bless my soul ring the bell then  the fire bell  the door bell  to what end thomas theres nobody in the house the servants are all at kingham  but confound it all we cant stop out here all night  cant we you just watch us there is nothingliterally nothingwhich a country house party cant do with attila here operating on the premises seppings presumably took the backdoor key with him we must just amuse ourselves till he comes back  tuppy made a suggestion  why not take out one of the cars and drive over to kingham and get the key from seppings  it went well no question about that for the first time a smile lit up aunt dahlias drawn face uncle tom grunted approvingly anatole said something in provençal that sounded complimentary and i thought i detected even on angelas map a slight softening  a very excellent idea said aunt dahlia one of the best nip round to the garage at once  after tuppy had gone some extremely flattering things were said about his intelligence and resource and there was a disposition to draw rather invidious comparisons between him and bertram painful for me of course but the ordeal didnt last long for it couldnt have been more than five minutes before he was with us again  tuppy seemed perturbed  i say its all off  why  the garage is locked  unlock it  i havent the key  shout then and wake waterbury  whos waterbury  the chauffeur ass he sleeps over the garage  but hes gone to the dance at kingham  it was the final wallop until this moment aunt dahlia had been able to preserve her frozen calm the dam now burst the years rolled away from her and she was once more the dahlia wooster of the old yoicksandtantivy daysthe emotional freespeaking girl who had so often risen in her stirrups to yell derogatory personalities at people who were heading hounds  curse all dancing chauffeurs what on earth does a chauffeur want to dance for i mistrusted that man from the start something told me he was a dancer well this finishes it were out here till breakfasttime if those blasted servants come back before eight oclock i shall be vastly surprised you wont get seppings away from a dance till you throw him out i know him the jazzll go to his head and hell stand clapping and demanding encores till his hands blister damn all dancing butlers what is brinkley court a respectable english country house or a crimson dancing school one might as well be living in the middle of the russian ballet well all right if we must stay out here we must we shall all be frozen stiff excepthere she directed at me not one of her friendliest glancesexcept dear old attila who is i observe well and warmly clad we will resign ourselves to the prospect of freezing to death like the babes in the wood merely expressing a dying wish that our old pal attila will see that we are covered with leaves no doubt he will also toll that fire bell of his as a mark of respectand what might you want my good man  she broke off and stood glaring at jeeves during the latter portion of her address he had been standing by in a respectful manner endeavouring to catch the speakers eye  if i might make a suggestion madam  i am not saying that in the course of our long association i have always found myself able to view jeeves with approval there are aspects of his character which have frequently caused coldnesses to arise between us he is one of those fellows who if you give them a thingummy take a whatdyoucallit his work is often raw and he has been known to allude to me as mentally negligible more than once as i have shown it has been my painful task to squelch in him a tendency to get uppish and treat the young master as a serf or peon  these are grave defects  but one thing i have never failed to hand the man he is magnetic there is about him something that seems to soothe and hypnotize to the best of my knowledge he has never encountered a charging rhinoceros but should this contingency occur i have no doubt that the animal meeting his eye would check itself in midstride roll over and lie purring with its legs in the air  at any rate he calmed down aunt dahlia the nearest thing to a charging rhinoceros in under five seconds he just stood there looking respectful and though i didnt time the thingnot having a stopwatch on mei should say it wasnt more than three seconds and a quarter before her whole manner underwent an astounding change for the better she melted before ones eyes  jeeves you havent got an idea  yes madam  that great brain of yours has really clicked as ever in the hour of need  yes madam  jeeves said aunt dahlia in a shaking voice i am sorry i spoke so abruptly i was not myself i might have known that you would not come simply trying to make conversation tell us this idea of yours jeeves join our little group of thinkers and let us hear what you have to say make yourself at home jeeves and give us the good word can you really get us out of this mess  yes madam if one of the gentlemen would be willing to ride a bicycle  a bicycle  there is a bicycle in the gardeners shed in the kitchen garden madam possibly one of the gentlemen might feel disposed to ride over to kingham manor and procure the backdoor key from mr seppings  splendid jeeves  thank you madam  wonderful  thank you madam  attila said aunt dahlia turning and speaking in a quiet authoritative manner  i had been expecting it from the very moment those illjudged words had passed the fellows lips i had had a presentiment that a determined effort would be made to elect me as the goat and i braced myself to resist and obstruct  and as i was about to do so while i was in the very act of summoning up all my eloquence to protest that i didnt know how to ride a bike and couldnt possibly learn in the brief time at my disposal im dashed if the man didnt go and nip me in the bud  yes madam mr wooster would perform the task admirably he is an expert cyclist he has often boasted to me of his triumphs on the wheel  i hadnt i hadnt done anything of the sort its simply monstrous how ones words get twisted all i had ever done was to mention to himcasually just as an interesting item of information one day in new york when we were watching the sixday bicycle racethat at the age of fourteen while spending my holidays with a vicar of sorts who had been told off to teach me latin i had won the choir boys handicap at the local school treat  a different thing from boasting of ones triumphs on the wheel  i mean he was a man of the world and must have known that the form of school treats is never of the hottest and if im not mistaken i had specifically told him that on the occasion referred to i had received half a lap start and that willie punting the oddson favourite to whom the race was expected to be a gift had been forced to retire owing to having pinched his elder brothers machine without asking the elder brother and the elder brother coming along just as the pistol went and giving him one on the side of the head and taking it away from him thus rendering him a scratchedatthepost nonstarter yet from the way he talked you would have thought i was one of those chaps in sweaters with medals all over them whose photographs bob up from time to time in the illustrated press on the occasion of their having ridden from hyde park corner to glasgow in three seconds under the hour or whatever it is  and as if this were not bad enough tuppy had to shove his oar in  thats right said tuppy bertie has always been a great cyclist i remember at oxford he used to take all his clothes off on bumpsupper nights and ride around the quad singing comic songs jolly fast he used to go too  then he can go jolly fast now said aunt dahlia with animation he cant go too fast for me he may also sing comic songs if he likes and if you wish to take your clothes off bertie my lamb by all means do so but whether clothed or in the nude whether singing comic songs or not singing comic songs get a move on  i found speech  but i havent ridden for years  then its high time you began again  ive probably forgotten how to ride  youll soon get the knack after youve taken a toss or two trial and error the only way  but its miles to kingham  so the sooner youre off the better  but  bertie dear  but dash it  bertie darling  yes but dash it  bertie my sweet  and so it was arranged presently i was moving sombrely off through the darkness jeeves at my side aunt dahlia calling after me something about trying to imagine myself the man who brought the good news from ghent to aix the first i had heard of the chap  so jeeves i said as we reached the shed and my voice was cold and bitter this is what your great scheme has accomplished tuppy angela gussie and the bassett not on speaking terms and self faced with an eightmile ride  nine i believe sir  a ninemile ride and another ninemile ride back  i am sorry sir  no good being sorry now where is this foul boneshaker  i will bring it out sir  he did so i eyed it sourly  wheres the lamp  i fear there is no lamp sir  no lamp  no sir  but i may come a fearful stinker without a lamp suppose i barge into something  i broke off and eyed him frigidly  you smile jeeves the thought amuses you  i beg your pardon sir i was thinking of a tale my uncle cyril used to tell me as a child an absurd little story sir though i confess that i have always found it droll according to my uncle cyril two men named nicholls and jackson set out to ride to brighton on a tandem bicycle and were so unfortunate as to come into collision with a brewers van and when the rescue party arrived on the scene of the accident it was discovered that they had been hurled together with such force that it was impossible to sort them out at all adequately the keenest eye could not discern which portion of the fragments was nicholls and which jackson so they collected as much as they could and called it nixon i remember laughing very much at that story when i was a child sir  i had to pause a moment to master my feelings  you did eh  yes sir  you thought it funny  yes sir  and your uncle cyril thought it funny  yes sir  golly what a family next time you meet your uncle cyril jeeves you can tell him from me that his sense of humour is morbid and unpleasant  he is dead sir  thank heaven for that well give me the blasted machine  very good sir  are the tyres inflated  yes sir  the nuts firm the brakes in order the sprockets running true with the differential gear  yes sir  right ho jeeves  in tuppys statement that when at the university of oxford i had been known to ride a bicycle in the nude about the quadrangle of our mutual college there had been i cannot deny a certain amount of substance correct however though his facts were so far as they went he had not told all what he had omitted to mention was that i had invariably been well oiled at the time and when in that condition a chap is capable of feats at which in cooler moments his reason would rebel  stimulated by the juice i believe men have even been known to ride alligators  as i started now to pedal out into the great world i was icily sober and the old skill in consequence had deserted me entirely i found myself wobbling badly and all the stories i had ever heard of nasty bicycle accidents came back to me with a rush headed by jeevess uncle cyrils cheery little anecdote about nicholls and jackson  pounding wearily through the darkness i found myself at a loss to fathom the mentality of men like jeevess uncle cyril what on earth he could see funny in a disaster which had apparently involved the complete extinction of a human creatureor at any rate of half a human creature and half another human creaturewas more than i could understand to me the thing was one of the most poignant tragedies that had ever been brought to my attention and i have no doubt that i should have continued to brood over it for quite a time had my thoughts not been diverted by the sudden necessity of zigzagging sharply in order to avoid a pig in the fairway  for a moment it looked like being real nichollsandjackson stuff but fortunately a quick zig on my part coinciding with an adroit zag on the part of the pig enabled me to win through and i continued my ride safe but with the heart fluttering like a captive bird  the effect of this narrow squeak upon me was to shake the nerve to the utmost the fact that pigs were abroad in the night seemed to bring home to me the perilous nature of my enterprise it set me thinking of all the other things that could happen to a man out and about on a velocipede without a lamp after lightingup time in particular i recalled the statement of a pal of mine that in certain sections of the rural districts goats were accustomed to stray across the road to the extent of their chains thereby forming about as sound a booby trap as one could well wish  he mentioned i remember the case of a friend of his whose machine got entangled with a goat chain and who was dragged seven mileslike skijoring in switzerlandso that he was never the same man again and there was one chap who ran into an elephant left over from a travelling circus  indeed taking it for all in all it seemed to me that with the possible exception of being bitten by sharks there was virtually no frontpage disaster that could not happen to a fellow once he had allowed his dear ones to override his better judgment and shove him out into the great unknown on a pushbike and i am not ashamed to confess that taking it by and large the amount of quailing i did from this point on was pretty considerable  however in respect to goats and elephants i must say things panned out unexpectedly well  oddly enough i encountered neither but when you have said that you have said everything for in every other way the conditions could scarcely have been fouler  apart from the ceaseless anxiety of having to keep an eye skinned for elephants i found myself much depressed by barking dogs and once i received a most unpleasant shock when alighting to consult a signpost i saw sitting on top of it an owl that looked exactly like my aunt agatha so agitated indeed had my frame of mind become by this time that i thought at first it was aunt agatha and only when reason and reflection told me how alien to her habits it would be to climb signposts and sit on them could i pull myself together and overcome the weakness  in short what with all this mental disturbance added to the more purely physical anguish in the billowy portions and the calves and ankles the bertram wooster who eventually toppled off at the door of kingham manor was a very different bertram from the gay and insouciant boulevardier of bond street and piccadilly  even to one unaware of the inside facts it would have been evident that kingham manor was throwing its weight about a bit tonight lights shone in the windows music was in the air and as i drew nearer my ear detected the sibilant shuffling of the feet of butlers footmen chauffeurs parlourmaids housemaids tweenies and i have no doubt cooks who were busily treading the measure i suppose you couldnt sum it up much better than by saying that there was a sound of revelry by night  the orgy was taking place in one of the groundfloor rooms which had french windows opening on to the drive and it was to these french windows that i now made my way an orchestra was playing something with a good deal of zip to it and under happier conditions i dare say my feet would have started twitching in time to the melody but i had sterner work before me than to stand hoofing it by myself on gravel drives  i wanted that backdoor key and i wanted it instanter  scanning the throng within i found it difficult for a while to spot seppings presently however he hove in view doing fearfully lissom things in midfloor i hiseppingsed a couple of times but his mind was too much on his job to be diverted and it was only when the swirl of the dance had brought him within prodding distance of my forefinger that a quick one to the lower ribs enabled me to claim his attention  the unexpected buffet caused him to trip over his partners feet and it was with marked austerity that he turned as he recognized bertram however coldness melted to be replaced by astonishment  mr wooster  i was in no mood for bandying words  less of the mr wooster and more backdoor keys i said curtly give me the key of the back door seppings  he did not seem to grasp the gist  the key of the back door sir  precisely the brinkley court backdoor key  but it is at the court sir  i clicked the tongue annoyed  dont be frivolous my dear old butler i said i havent ridden nine miles on a pushbike to listen to you trying to be funny youve got it in your trousers pocket  no sir i left it with mr jeeves  you didwhat  yes sir before i came away mr jeeves said that he wished to walk in the garden before retiring for the night he was to place the key on the kitchen windowsill  i stared at the man dumbly his eye was clear his hand steady he had none of the appearance of a butler who has had a couple  you mean that all this while the key has been in jeevess possession  yes sir  i could speak no more emotion had overmastered my voice i was at a loss and not abreast but of one thing it seemed to me there could be no doubt for some reason not to be fathomed now but most certainly to be gone well into as soon as i had pushed this infernal sewingmachine of mine over those nine miles of lonely country road and got within striking distance of him jeeves had been doing the dirty knowing that at any given moment he could have solved the whole situation he had kept aunt dahlia and others roosting out on the front lawn en déshabille and worse still had stood calmly by and watched his young employer set out on a wholly unnecessary eighteenmile bicycle ride  i could scarcely believe such a thing of him of his uncle cyril yes with that distorted sense of humour of his uncle cyril might quite conceivably have been capable of such conduct but that it should be jeeves  i leaped into the saddle and stifling the cry of agony which rose to the lips as the bruised person touched the hard leather set out on the homeward journey    23   i remember jeeves saying on one occasioni forgot how the subject had arisenhe may simply have thrown the observation out as he does sometimes for me to take or leavethat hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and until tonight i had always felt that there was a lot in it i had never scorned a woman myself but pongo twistleton once scorned an aunt of his flatly refusing to meet her son gerald at paddington and give him lunch and see him off to school at waterloo and he never heard the end of it letters were written he tells me which had to be seen to be believed also two very strong telegrams and a bitter picture post card with a view of the little chilbury war memorial on it  until tonight therefore as i say i had never questioned the accuracy of the statement scorned women first and the rest nowhere was how it had always seemed to me  but tonight i revised my views if you want to know what hell can really do in the way of furies look for the chap who has been hornswoggled into taking a long and unnecessary bicycle ride in the dark without a lamp  mark that word unnecessary that was the part of it that really jabbed the iron into the soul i mean if it was a case of riding to the doctors to save the child with croup or going off to the local pub to fetch supplies in the event of the cellar having run dry no one would leap to the handlebars more readily than i young lochinvar absolutely but this business of being put through it merely to gratify ones personal attendants diseased sense of the amusing was a bit too thick and i chafed from start to finish  so what i mean to say although the providence which watches over good men saw to it that i was enabled to complete the homeward journey unscathed except in the billowy portions removing from my path all goats elephants and even owls that looked like my aunt agatha it was a frowning and jaundiced bertram who finally came to anchor at the brinkley court front door and when i saw a dark figure emerging from the porch to meet me i prepared to let myself go and uncork all that was fizzing in the mind  jeeves i said  it is i bertie  the voice which spoke sounded like warm treacle and even if i had not recognized it immediately as that of the bassett i should have known that it did not proceed from the man i was yearning to confront for this figure before me was wearing a simple tweed dress and had employed my first name in its remarks and jeeves whatever his moral defects would never go about in skirts calling me bertie  the last person of course whom i would have wished to meet after a long evening in the saddle but i vouchsafed a courteous what ho  there was a pause during which i massaged the calves mine of course i mean  you got in then i said in allusion to the change of costume  oh yes about a quarter of an hour after you left jeeves went searching about and found the backdoor key on the kitchen windowsill  ha  what  nothing  i thought you said something  no nothing  and i continued to do so for at this juncture as had so often happened when this girl and i were closeted the conversation once more went blue on us the night breeze whispered but not the bassett a bird twittered but not so much as a chirp escaped bertram it was perfectly amazing the way her mere presence seemed to wipe speech from my lipsand mine for that matter from hers it began to look as if our married life together would be rather like twenty years among the trappist monks  seen jeeves anywhere i asked eventually coming through  yes in the diningroom  the diningroom  waiting on everybody they are having eggs and bacon and champagne what did you say  i had said nothingmerely snorted there was something about the thought of these people carelessly revelling at a time when for all they knew i was probably being dragged about the countryside by goats or chewed by elephants that struck home at me like a poisoned dart it was the sort of thing you read about as having happened just before the french revolutionthe haughty nobles in their castles callously digging in and quaffing while the unfortunate blighters outside were suffering frightful privations  the voice of the bassett cut in on these mordant reflections  bertie  hullo  silence  hullo i said again  no response whole thing rather like one of those telephone conversations where you sit at your end of the wire saying hullo hullo unaware that the party of the second part has gone off to tea  eventually however she came to the surface again  bertie i have something to say to you  what  i have something to say to you  i know i said what  oh i thought you didnt hear what i said  yes i heard what you said all right but not what you were going to say  oh i see  rightho  so that was straightened out nevertheless instead of proceeding she took time off once more she stood twisting the fingers and scratching the gravel with her foot when finally she spoke it was to deliver an impressive boost  bertie do you read tennyson  not if i can help  you remind me so much of those knights of the round table in the idylls of the king  of course i had heard of themlancelot galahad and all that lot but i didnt see where the resemblance came in it seemed to me that she must be thinking of a couple of other fellows  how do you mean  you have such a great heart such a fine soul you are so generous so unselfish so chivalrous i have always felt that about youthat you are one of the few really chivalrous men i have ever met  well dashed difficult of course to know what to say when someone is giving you the old oil on a scale like that i muttered an oh yes or something on those lines and rubbed the billowy portions in some embarrassment and there was another silence broken only by a sharp howl as i rubbed a bit too hard  bertie  hullo  i heard her give a sort of gulp  bertie will you be chivalrous now  rather only too pleased how do you mean  i am going to try you to the utmost i am going to test you as few men have ever been tested i am going  i didnt like the sound of this  well i said doubtfully always glad to oblige you know but ive just had the dickens of a bicycle ride and im a bit stiff and sore especially in theas i say a bit stiff and sore if its anything to be fetched from upstairs  no no you dont understand  i dont quite no  oh its so difficult how can i say it cant you guess  no im dashed if i can  bertielet me go  but i havent got hold of you  release me  re  and then i suddenly got it i suppose it was fatigue that had made me so slow to apprehend the nub  what  i staggered and the left pedal came up and caught me on the shin but such was the ecstasy in the soul that i didnt utter a cry  release you  yes  i didnt want any confusion on the point  you mean you want to call it all off youre going to hitch up with gussie after all  only if you are fine and big enough to consent  oh i am  i gave you my promise  dash promises  then you really  absolutely  oh bertie  she seemed to sway like a sapling it is saplings that sway i believe  a very parfait knight i heard her murmur and there not being much to say after that i excused myself on the ground that i had got about two pecks of dust down my back and would like to go and get my maid to put me into something loose  you go back to gussie i said and tell him that all is well  she gave a sort of hiccup and darting forward kissed me on the forehead unpleasant of course but as anatole would say i can take a few smooths with a rough the next moment she was legging it for the diningroom while i having bunged the bicycle into a bush made for the stairs  i need not dwell upon my buckedness it can be readily imagined talk about chaps with the noose round their necks and the hangman about to let her go and somebody galloping up on a foaming horse waving the reprievenot in it absolutely not in it at all i dont know that i can give you a better idea of the state of my feelings than by saying that as i started to cross the hall i was conscious of so profound a benevolence toward all created things that i found myself thinking kindly thoughts even of jeeves  i was about to mount the stairs when a sudden what ho from my rear caused me to turn tuppy was standing in the hall he had apparently been down to the cellar for reinforcements for there were a couple of bottles under his arm  hullo bertie he said you back he laughed amusedly you look like the wreck of the hesperus get run over by a steamroller or something  at any other time i might have found his coarse badinage hard to bear but such was my uplifted mood that i waved it aside and slipped him the good news  tuppy old man the bassetts going to marry gussie finknottle  tough luck on both of them what  but dont you understand dont you see what this means it means that angela is once more out of pawn and you have only to play your cards properly  he bellowed rollickingly i saw now that he was in the pink as a matter of fact i had noticed something of the sort directly i met him but had attributed it to alcoholic stimulant  good lord youre right behind the times bertie only to be expected of course if you will go riding bicycles half the night angela and i made it up hours ago  what  certainly nothing but a passing tiff all you need in these matters is a little give and take a bit of reasonableness on both sides we got together and talked things over she withdrew my double chin i conceded her shark perfectly simple all done in a couple of minutes  but  sorry bertie cant stop chatting with you all night there is a rather impressive beano in progress in the diningroom and they are waiting for supplies  endorsement was given to this statement by a sudden shout from the apartment named i recognizedas who would notaunt dahlias voice  glossop  hullo  hurry up with that stuff  coming coming  well come then yoicks hard forrard  tallyho not to mention tantivy your aunt said tuppy is a bit above herself i dont know all the facts of the case but it appears that anatole gave notice and has now consented to stay on and also your uncle has given her a cheque for that paper of hers i didnt get the details but she is much braced see you later i must rush  to say that bertram was now definitely nonplussed would be but to state the simple truth i could make nothing of this i had left brinkley court a stricken home with hearts bleeding wherever you looked and i had returned to find it a sort of earthly paradise it baffled me  i bathed bewilderedly the toy duck was still in the soapdish but i was too preoccupied to give it a thought still at a loss i returned to my room and there was jeeves and it is proof of my fogged condish that my first words to him were words not of reproach and stern recrimination but of inquiry  i say jeeves  good evening sir i was informed that you had returned i trust you had an enjoyable ride  at any other moment a crack like that would have woken the fiend in bertram wooster i barely noticed it i was intent on getting to the bottom of this mystery  but i say jeeves what  sir  what does all this mean  you refer sir  of course i refer you know what im talking about what has been happening here since i left the place is positively stiff with happy endings  yes sir i am glad to say that my efforts have been rewarded  what do you mean your efforts you arent going to try to make out that that rotten fire bell scheme of yours had anything to do with it  yes sir  dont be an ass jeeves it flopped  not altogether sir i fear sir that i was not entirely frank with regard to my suggestion of ringing the fire bell i had not really anticipated that it would in itself produce the desired results i had intended it merely as a preliminary to what i might describe as the real business of the evening  you gibber jeeves  no sir it was essential that the ladies and gentlemen should be brought from the house in order that once out of doors i could ensure that they remained there for the necessary period of time  how do you mean  my plan was based on psychology sir  how  it is a recognized fact sir that there is nothing that so satisfactorily unites individuals who have been so unfortunate as to quarrel amongst themselves as a strong mutual dislike for some definite person in my own family if i may give a homely illustration it was a generally accepted axiom that in times of domestic disagreement it was necessary only to invite my aunt annie for a visit to heal all breaches between the other members of the household in the mutual animosity excited by aunt annie those who had become estranged were reconciled almost immediately remembering this it occurred to me that were you sir to be established as the person responsible for the ladies and gentlemen being forced to spend the night in the garden everybody would take so strong a dislike to you that in this common sympathy they would sooner or later come together  i would have spoken but he continued  and such proved to be the case all as you see sir is now well after your departure on the bicycle the various estranged parties agreed so heartily in their abuse of you that the ice if i may use the expression was broken and it was not long before mr glossop was walking beneath the trees with miss angela telling her anecdotes of your career at the university in exchange for hers regarding your childhood while mr finknottle leaning against the sundial held miss bassett enthralled with stories of your schooldays mrs travers meanwhile was telling monsieur anatole  i found speech  oh i said i see and now i suppose as the result of this dashed psychology of yours aunt dahlia is so sore with me that it will be years before i can dare to show my face here againyears jeeves during which night after night anatole will be cooking those dinners of his  no sir it was to prevent any such contingency that i suggested that you should bicycle to kingham manor when i informed the ladies and gentlemen that i had found the key and it was borne in upon them that you were having that long ride for nothing their animosity vanished immediately to be replaced by cordial amusement there was much laughter  there was eh  yes sir i fear you may possibly have to submit to a certain amount of goodnatured chaff but nothing more all if i may say so is forgiven sir  oh  yes sir  i mused awhile  you certainly seem to have fixed things  yes sir  tuppy and angela are once more betrothed also gussie and the bassett uncle tom appears to have coughed up that money for miladys boudoir and anatole is staying on  yes sir  i suppose you might say that alls well that ends well  very apt sir  i mused again  all the same your methods are a bit rough jeeves  one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs sir  i started  omelette do you think you could get me one  certainly sir  together with half a bot of something  undoubtedly sir  do so jeeves and with all speed  i climbed into bed and sank back against the pillows i must say that my generous wrath had ebbed a bit i was aching the whole length of my body particularly toward the middle but against this you had to set the fact that i was no longer engaged to madeline bassett in a good cause one is prepared to suffer yes looking at the thing from every angle i saw that jeeves had done well and it was with an approving beam that i welcomed him as he returned with the needful  he did not check up with this beam a bit grave he seemed to me to be looking and i probed the matter with a kindly query  something on your mind jeeves  yes sir i should have mentioned it earlier but in the evenings disturbance it escaped my memory i fear i have been remiss sir  yes jeeves i said champing contentedly  in the matter of your messjacket sir  a nameless fear shot through me causing me to swallow a mouthful of omelette the wrong way  i am sorry to say sir that while i was ironing it this afternoon i was careless enough to leave the hot instrument upon it i very much fear that it will be impossible for you to wear it again sir  one of those old pregnant silences filled the room  i am extremely sorry sir  for a moment i confess that generous wrath of mine came bounding back hitching up its muscles and snorting a bit through the nose but as we say on the riviera à quoi sertil there was nothing to be gained by gw now  we woosters can bite the bullet i nodded moodily and speared another slab of omelette  right ho jeeves  very good sir
