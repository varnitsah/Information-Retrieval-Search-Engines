45905138	cashel byrons profession  by  george bernard shaw        prologue  i      moncrief house panley common scholastic establishment for the sons of gentlemen etc  panley common viewed from the back windows of moncrief house is a tract of grass furze and rushes stretching away to the western horizon  one wet spring afternoon the sky was full of broken clouds and the common was swept by their shadows between which patches of green and yellow gorse were bright in the broken sunlight the hills to the northward were obscured by a heavy shower traces of which were drying off the slates of the school a square white building formerly a gentlemans countryhouse in front of it was a wellkept lawn with a few clipped hollytrees at the rear a quarter of an acre of land was enclosed for the use of the boys strollers on the common could hear at certain hours a hubbub of voices and racing footsteps from within the boundary wall sometimes when the strollers were boys themselves they climbed to the coping and saw on the other side a piece of common trampled bare and brown with a few square yards of concrete so worn into hollows as to be unfit for its original use as a ballalley also a long shed a pump a door defaced by innumerable incised inscriptions the back of the house in much worse repair than the front and about fifty boys in tailless jackets and broad turneddown collars when the fifty boys perceived a stranger on the wall they rushed to the spot with a wild halloo overwhelmed him with insult and defiance and dislodged him by a volley of clods stones lumps of bread and such other projectiles as were at hand  on this rainy spring afternoon a brougham stood at the door of moncrief house the coachman enveloped in a white indiarubber coat was bestirring himself a little after the recent shower withindoors in the drawingroom dr moncrief was conversing with a stately lady aged about thirtyfive elegantly dressed of attractive manner and only falling short of absolute beauty in her complexion which was deficient in freshness  no progress whatever i am sorry to say the doctor was remarking  that is very disappointing said the lady contracting her brows  it is natural that you should feel disappointed replied the doctor i would myself earnestly advise you to try the effect of placing him at some other the doctor stopped the ladys face had lit up with a wonderful smile and she had raised her hand with a bewitching gesture of protest  oh no dr moncrief she said i am not disappointed with you but i am all the more angry with cashel because i know that if he makes no progress with you it must be his own fault as to taking him away that is out of the question i should not have a moments peace if he were out of your care i will speak to him very seriously about his conduct before i leave today you will give him another trial will you not  certainly with the greatest pleasure exclaimed the doctor confusing himself by an inept attempt at gallantry he shall stay as long as you please buthere the doctor became grave againyou cannot too strongly urge upon him the importance of hard work at the present time which may be said to be the turningpoint of his career as a student he is now nearly seventeen and he has so little inclination for study that i doubt whether he could pass the examination necessary to entering one of the universities you probably wish him to take a degree before he chooses a profession  yes of course said the lady vaguely evidently assenting to the doctors remark rather than expressing a conviction of her own what profession would you advise for him you know so much better than i  hum said dr moncrief puzzled that would doubtless depend to some extent on his own taste  not at all said the lady interrupting him with vivacity what does he know about the world poor boy his own taste is sure to be something ridiculous very likely he would want to go on the stage like me  oh then you would not encourage any tendency of that sort  most decidedly not i hope he has no such idea  not that i am aware of he shows so little ambition to excel in any particular branch that i should say his choice of a profession may be best determined by his parents i am of course ignorant whether his relatives possess influence likely to be of use to him that is often the chief point to be considered particularly in cases like your sons where no special aptitude manifests itself  i am the only relative he ever had poor fellow said the lady with a pensive smile then seeing an expression of astonishment on the doctors face she added quickly they are all dead  dear me  however she continued i have no doubt i can make plenty of interest for him but it is difficult to get anything nowadays without passing competitive examinations he really must work if he is lazy he ought to be punished  the doctor looked perplexed the fact is he said your son can hardly be dealt with as a child any longer he is still quite a boy in his habits and ideas but physically he is rapidly springing up into a young man that reminds me of another point on which i will ask you to speak earnestly to him i must tell you that he has attained some distinction among his schoolfellows here as an athlete within due bounds i do not discourage bodily exercises they are a recognized part of our system but i am sorry to say that cashel has not escaped that tendency to violence which sometimes results from the possession of unusual strength and dexterity he actually fought with one of the village youths in the main street of panley some months ago the matter did not come to my ears immediately and when it did i allowed it to pass unnoticed as he had interfered it seems to protect one of the smaller boys unfortunately he was guilty of a much more serious fault a little later he and a companion of his had obtained leave from me to walk to panley abbey together i afterwards found that their real object was to witness a prizefight that took placeillegally of courseon the common apart from the deception practised i think the taste they betrayed a dangerous one and i felt bound to punish them by a severe imposition and restriction to the grounds for six weeks i do not hold however that everything has been done in these cases when a boy has been punished i set a high value on a mothers influence for softening the natural roughness of boys  i dont think he minds what i say to him in the least said the lady with a sympathetic air as if she pitied the doctor in a matter that chiefly concerned him i will speak to him about it of course fighting is an unbearable habit his fathers people were always fighting and they never did any good in the world  if you will be so kind there are just the three points the necessity for greatermuch greaterapplication to his studies a word to him on the subject of rough habits and to sound him as to his choice of a career i agree with you in not attaching much importance to his ideas on that subject as yet still even a boyish fancy may be turned to account in rousing the energies of a lad  quite so assented the lady i will certainly give him a lecture  the doctor looked at her mistrustfully thinking perhaps that she herself would be the better for a lecture on her duties as a mother but he did not dare to tell her so indeed having a prejudice to the effect that actresses were deficient in natural feeling he doubted the use of daring he also feared that the subject of her son was beginning to bore her and though a doctor of divinity he was as reluctant as other men to be found wanting in address by a pretty woman so he rang the bell and bade the servant send master cashel byron presently a door was heard to open below and a buzz of distant voices became audible the doctor fidgeted and tried to think of something to say but his invention failed him he sat in silence while the inarticulate buzz rose into a shouting of byron cash the latter cry imitated from the summons usually addressed to cashiers in haberdashers shops finally there was a piercing yell of mammaaaaah apparently in explanation of the demand for byrons attendance in the drawingroom the doctor reddened mrs byron smiled then the door below closed shutting out the tumult and footsteps were heard on the stairs  come in cried the doctor encouragingly  master cashel byron entered blushing made his way awkwardly to his mother and kissed the critical expression which was on her upturned face as she examined his appearance being only seventeen he had not yet acquired a taste for kissing he inexpertly gave mrs byron quite a shock by the collision of their teeth conscious of the failure he drew himself upright and tried to hide his hands which were exceedingly dirty in the scanty folds of his jacket he was a wellgrown youth with neck and shoulders already strongly formed and short auburn hair curling in little rings close to his scalp he had blue eyes and an expression of boyish goodhumor which however did not convey any assurance of good temper  how do you do cashel said mrs byron in a queenly manner after a prolonged look at him  very well thanks said he grinning and avoiding her eye  sit down byron said the doctor byron suddenly forgot how to sit down and looked irresolutely from one chair to another the doctor made a brief excuse and left the room much to the relief of his pupil  you have grown greatly cashel and i am afraid you are very awkward cashel colored and looked gloomy  i do not know what to do with you continued mrs byron dr moncrief tells me that you are very idle and rough  i am not said cashel sulkily it is bec  there is no use in contradicting me in that fashion said mrs byron interrupting him sharply i am sure that whatever dr moncrief says is perfectly true  he is always talking like that said cashel plaintively i cant learn latin and greek and i dont see what good they are i work as hard as any of the restexcept the regular stews perhaps as to my being rough that is all because i was out one day with gully molesworth and we saw a crowd on the common and when we went to see what was up it was two men fighting it wasnt our fault that they came there to fight  yes i have no doubt that you have fifty good excuses cashel but i will not allow any fighting and you really must work harder do you ever think of how hard i have to work to pay dr moncrief one hundred and twenty pounds a year for you  i work as hard as i can old moncrief seems to think that a fellow ought to do nothing else from morning till night but write latin verses tatham that the doctor thinks such a genius does all his constering from cribs if i had a crib i could conster as wellvery likely better  you are very idle cashel i am sure of that it is too provoking to throw away so much money every year for nothing besides you must soon be thinking of a profession  i shall go into the army said cashel it is the only profession for a gentleman  mrs byron looked at him for a moment as if amazed at his presumption but she checked herself and only said i am afraid you will have to choose some less expensive profession than that besides you would have to pass an examination to enable you to enter the army and how can you do that unless you study  oh i shall do that all right enough when the time comes  dear dear you are beginning to speak so coarsely cashel after all the pains i took with you at home  i speak the same as other people he replied sullenly i dont see the use of being so jolly particular over every syllable i used to have to stand no end of chaff about my way of speaking the fellows here know all about you of course  all about me repeated mrs byron looking at him curiously  all about your being on the stage i mean said cashel you complain of my fighting but i should have a precious bad time of it if i didnt lick the chaff out of some of them  mrs byron smiled doubtfully to herself and remained silent and thoughtful for a moment then she rose and said glancing at the weather i must go now cashel before another shower begins and do pray try to learn something and to polish your manners a little you will have to go to cambridge soon you know  cambridge exclaimed cashel excited when mamma when  oh i dont know not yet as soon as dr moncrief says you are fit to go  that will be long enough said cashel much dejected by this reply he will not turn one hundred and twenty pounds a year out of doors in a hurry he kept big inglis here until he was past twenty look here mamma might i go at the end of this half i feel sure i should do better at cambridge than here  nonsense said mrs byron decidedly i do not expect to have to take you away from dr moncrief for the next eighteen months at least and not then unless you work properly now dont grumble cashel you annoy me exceedingly when you do i am sorry i mentioned cambridge to you  i would rather go to some other school then said cashel ruefully old moncrief is so awfully down on me  you only want to leave because you are expected to work here and that is the very reason i wish you to stay  cashel made no reply but his face darkened ominously  i have a word to say to the doctor before i go she added reseating herself you may return to your play now goodbye cashel and she again raised her face to be kissed  goodbye said cashel huskily as he turned toward the door pretending that he had not noticed her action  cashel she said with emphatic surprise are you sulky  no he retorted angrily i havent said anything i suppose my manners are not good enough im very sorry but i cant help it  very well said mrs byron firmly you can go cashel i am not pleased with you  cashel walked out of the room and slammed the door at the foot of the staircase he was stopped by a boy about a year younger than himself who accosted him eagerly  how much did she give you he whispered  not a halfpenny replied cashel grinding his teeth  oh i say exclaimed the other much disappointed that was beastly mean  shes as mean as she can be said cashel its all old monkeys fault he has been cramming her with lies about me but shes just as bad as he is i tell you gully i hate my mother  oh come said gully shocked thats a little too strong old chap but she certainly ought to have stood something  i dont know what you intend to do gully but i mean to bolt if she thinks i am going to stick here for the next two years she is jolly much mistaken  it would be an awful lark to bolt said gully with a chuckle but he added seriously if you really mean it by george ill go too wilson has just given me a thousand lines and ill be hanged if i do them  gully said cashel his eyes sparkling i should like to see one of those chaps we saw on the common pitch into the doctorget him on the ropes you know  gullys mouth watered yes he said breathlessly particularly the fellow they called the fibber just one round would be enough for the old beggar lets come out into the playground i shall catch it if i am found here       ii      that night there was just sufficient light struggling through the clouds to make panley common visible as a black expanse against the lightest tone of which a piece of ebony would have appeared pale not a human being was stirring within a mile of moncrief house the chimneys of which ghostly white on the side next the moon threw long shadows on the silvergray slates the stillness had just been broken by the stroke of a quarter past twelve from a distant church tower when from the obscurity of one of these chimney shadows a head emerged it belonged to a boy whose body presently wriggled through an open skylight when his shoulders were through he turned himself face upward seized the miniature gable in which the skylight was set drew himself completely out and made his way stealthily down to the parapet he was immediately followed by another boy  the door of moncrief house was at the lefthand corner of the front and was surmounted by a tall porch the top of which was flat and could be used as a balcony a wall of the same height as the porch connected the house front with the boundary wall and formed part of the enclosure of a fruit garden which lay at the side of the house between the lawn and the playground when the two boys had crept along the parapet to a point directly above the porch they stopped and each lowered a pair of boots to the balcony by means of fishinglines when the boots were safely landed their owners let the lines drop and reentered the house by another skylight a minute elapsed then they reappeared on the top of the porch having come out through the window to which it served as a balcony here they put on their boots and stepped on to the wall of the fruit garden as they crawled along it the hindmost boy whispered  i say cashy  shut up will you replied the other under his breath whats wrong  i should like to have one more go at old mother moncriefs peartree thats all  there are no pears on it this season you fool  i know this is the last time we shall go this road cashy usent it to be a lark eh  if you dont shut up it wont be the last time for youll be caught now for it  cashel had reached the outer wall and he finished his sentence by dropping from it to the common gully held his breath for some moments after the noise made by his companions striking the ground then he demanded in a whisper whether all was right  yes returned cashel impatiently drop as soft as you can  gully obeyed and was so careful lest his descent should shake the earth and awake the doctor that his feet shrank from the concussion he alighted in a sitting posture and remained there looking up at cashel with a stunned expression  crikey he ejaculated presently that was a buster  get up i tell you said cashel i never saw such a jolly ass as you are here up with you have you got your wind back  i should think so bet you twopence ill be first at the cross roads i say lets pull the bell at the front gate and give an awful yell before we start theyll never catch us  yes said cashel ironically i fancy i see myself doing it or you either now then one two three and away  they ran off together and reached the cross roads about eight minutes later gully completely out of breath and cashel nearly so here according to their plan gully was to take the north road and run to scotland where he felt sure that his uncles gamekeeper would hide him cashel was to go to sea where he argued he could if his affairs became desperate turn pirate and achieve eminence in that profession by adding a chivalrous humanity to the ruder virtues for which it is already famous  cashel waited until gully had recovered from his race then he said  now old fellow weve got to separate  gully thus confronted with the lonely realities of his scheme did not like the prospect after a moments reflection he exclaimed  damme old chap but ill come with you scotland may go and be hanged  but cashel being the stronger of the two was as anxious to get rid of gully as gully was to cling to him no he said im going to rough it and you wouldnt be able for that youre not strong enough for a sea life why man those sailor fellows are as hard as nails and even they can hardly stand it  well then do you come with me urged gully my uncles gamekeeper wont mind hes a jolly good sort and we shall have no end of shooting  thats all very well for you gully but i dont know your uncle and im not going to put myself under a compliment to his gamekeeper besides we should run too much risk of being caught if we went through the country together of course i should be only too glad if we could stick to one another but it wouldnt do i feel certain we should be nabbed goodbye  but wait a minute pleaded gully suppose they do try to catch us we shall have a better chance against them if there are two of us  stuff said cashel thats all boyish nonsense there will be at least six policemen sent after us and even if i did my very best i could barely lick two if they came on together and you would hardly be able for one yon just keep moving and dont go near any railway station and you will get to scotland all safe enough look here we have wasted five minutes already i have got my wind now and i must be off goodbye  gully disdained to press his company on cashel any further goodbye he said mournfully shaking his hand success old chap  success echoed cashel grasping gullys hand with a pang of remorse for leaving him ill write to you as soon as i have anything to tell you it may be some months you know before i get regularly settled  he gave gully a final squeeze released him and darted off along the road leading to panley village gully looked after him for a moment and then ran away scotlandwards  panley village consisted of a high street with an oldfashioned inn at one end a modern railway station and bridge at the other and a pump and pound midway between cashel stood for a while in the shadow under the bridge before venturing along the broad moonlit street seeing no one he stepped out at a brisk walking pace for he had by this time reflected that it was not possible to run all the way to the spanish main there was however another person stirring in the village besides cashel this was mr wilson dr moncriefs professor of mathematics who was returning from a visit to the theatre mr wilson had an impression that theatres were wicked places to be visited by respectable men only on rare occasions and by stealth the only plays he went openly to witness were those of shakespeare and his favorite was as you like it rosalind in tights having an attraction for him which he missed in lady macbeth in petticoats on this evening he had seen rosalind impersonated by a famous actress who had come to a neighboring town on a starring tour after the performance he had returned to panley supped there with a friend and was now making his way back to moncrief house of which he had been intrusted with the key he was in a frame of mind favorable for the capture of a runaway boy an habitual delight in being too clever for his pupils fostered by frequently overreaching them in mathematics was just now stimulated by the effect of a liberal supper and the roguish consciousness of having been to the play he saw and recognized cashel as he approached the village pound understanding the situation at once he hid behind the pump waited until the unsuspecting truant was passing within armslength and then stepped out and seized him by the collar of his jacket  well sir he said what are you doing here at this hour eh  cashel scared and white looked up at him and could not answer a word  come along with me said wilson sternly  cashel suffered himself to be led for some twenty yards then he stopped and burst into tears  there is no use in my going back he said sobbing i have never done any good there i cant go back  indeed said wilson with magisterial sarcasm we shall try to make you do better in future and he forced the fugitive to resume his march  cashel bitterly humiliated by his own tears and exasperated by a certain cold triumph which his captor evinced on witnessing them did not go many steps farther without protest  you neednt hold me he said angrily i can walk without being held the master tightened his grasp and pushed his captive forward i wont run away sir said cashel more humbly shedding fresh tears please let me go he added in a suffocated voice trying to turn his face toward his captor but wilson twisted him back again and urged him still onward cashel cried out passionately let me go and struggled to break loose  come come byron said the master controlling him with a broad strong hand none of your nonsense sir  then cashel suddenly slipped out of his jacket turned on wilson and struck up at him savagely with his right fist the master received the blow just beside the point of his chin and his eyes seemed to cashel roll up and fall back into his head with the shock he drooped forward for a moment and fell in a heap face downward cashel recoiled wringing his hand to relieve the tingling of his knuckles and terrified by the thought that he had committed murder but wilson presently moved and dispelled that misgiving some of cashels fury returned as he shook his fist at his prostrate adversary and exclaiming you wont brag much of having seen me cry wrenched the jacket from him with unnecessary violence and darted away at full speed  mr wilson though he was soon conscious and able to rise did not feel disposed to stir for a long time he began to moan with a dazed faith that some one would eventually come to him with sympathy and assistance five minutes elapsed and brought nothing but increased cold and pain it occurred to him that if the police found him they would suppose him to be drunk also that it was his duty to go to them and give them the alarm he rose and after a struggle with dizziness and nausea concluded that his most pressing duty was to get to bed and leave dr moncrief to recapture his ruffianly pupil as best he could  accordingly at halfpast one oclock the doctor was roused by a knocking at his chamberdoor outside which he presently found his professor of mathematics bruised muddy and apparently inebriated five minutes elapsed before wilson could get his principals mind on the right track then the boys were awakened and the roll called byron and molesworth were reported absent no one had seen them go no one had the least suspicion of how they got out of the house one little boy mentioned the skylight but observing a threatening expression on the faces of a few of the bigger boys who were fond of fruit he did not press his suggestion and submitted to be snubbed by the doctor for having made it it was nearly three oclock before the alarm reached the village where the authorities tacitly declined to trouble themselves about it until morning the doctor convinced that the lad had gone to his mother did not believe that any search was necessary and contented himself with writing a note to mrs byron describing the attack on mr wilson and expressing regret that no proposal having for its object the readmission of master byron to the academy could be entertained  the pursuit was now directed entirely after molesworth an it wan plain from mr wilsons narrative that he had separated from cashel outside panley information was soon forthcoming peasants in all parts of the country had seen they said a lad that might be him the search lasted until five oclock next afternoon when it was rendered superfluous by the appearance of gully in person footsore and repentant after parting from cashel and walking two miles he had lost heart and turned back half way to the cross roads he had reproached himself with cowardice and resumed his flight this time he placed eight miles betwixt himself and moncrief house then he left the road to make a short cut through a plantation and went astray after wandering until morning thinking dejectedly of the story of the babes in the wood he saw a woman working in a field and asked her the shortest way to scotland she had never heard of scotland and when he asked the way to panley she lost patience and threatened to set her dog at him this discouraged him so much that he was afraid to speak to the other strangers whom he met having the sun as a compass he oscillated between scotland and panley according to the fluctuation of his courage at last he yielded to hunger fatigue and loneliness devoted his remaining energy to the task of getting back to school struck the common at last and hastened to surrender himself to the doctor who menaced him with immediate expulsion gully was greatly concerned at having to leave the place he had just run away from and earnestly begged the doctor to give him another chance his prayer was granted after a prolonged lecture the doctor in consideration of the facts that gully had been seduced by the example of a desperate associate that he had proved the sincerity of his repentance by coming back of his own accord and had not been accessory to the concussion of the brain from which mr wilson supposed himself to be suffering accepted his promise of amendment and gave him a free pardon it should be added that gully kept his promise and being now the oldest pupil graced his position by becoming a moderately studious and on one occasion even a sensible lad  meanwhile mrs byron not suspecting the importance of the doctors note and happening to be in a hurry when it arrived laid it by unopened intending to read it at her leisure she would have forgotten it altogether but for a second note which came two days later requesting some acknowledgment of the previous communication on learning the truth she immediately drove to moncrief house and there abused the doctor as he had never been abused in his life before after which she begged his pardon and implored him to assist her to recover her darling boy when he suggested that she should offer a reward for information and capture she indignantly refused to spend a farthing on the little ingrate wept and accused herself of having driven him away by her unkindness stormed and accused the doctor of having treated him harshly and finally said that she would give one hundred pounds to have him back but that she would never speak to him again the doctor promised to undertake the search and would have promised anything to get rid of his visitor a reward of fifty pounds wag offered but whether the fear of falling into the clutches of the law for murderous assault stimulated cashel to extraordinary precaution or whether he had contrived to leave the country in the four days which elapsed between his flight and the offer of the reward the doctors efforts were unsuccessful and he had to confess their failure to mrs byron she agreeably surprised him by writing a pleasant letter to the effect that it was very provoking and that she could never thank him sufficiently for all the trouble he had taken and so the matter dropped  long after that generation of scholars had passed away from moncrief house the name of cashel byron was remembered there as that of a hero who after many fabulous exploits had licked a master and bolted to the spanish main       iii      there was at this time in the city of melbourne in australia a wooden building above the door of which was a board inscribed gymnasium and school of arms in the long narrow entry hung a framed manuscript which set forth that ned skene exchampion of england and the colonies was to be heard of within daily by gentlemen desirous of becoming proficient in the art of selfdefence also the terms on which mrs skene assisted by a competent staff of professors would give lessons in dancing deportment and calisthenics  one evening a man sat smoking on a common wooden chair outside the door of this establishment on the ground beside him were some tin tacks and a hammer with which he had just nailed to the doorpost a card on which was written in a womans handwriting wanted a male attendant who can keep accounts inquire within the smoker was a powerful man with a thick neck that swelled out beneath his broad flat earlobes he had small eyes and large teeth over which his lips were slightly parted in a goodhumored but cunning smile his hair was black and closecut his skin indurated and the bridge of his nose smashed level with his face the tip however was uninjured it was squab and glossy and by giving the whole feature an air of being on the point of expanding to its original shape produced a snubbed expression which relieved the otherwise formidable aspect of the man and recommended him as probably a modest and affable fellow when sober and unprovoked he seemed about fifty years of age and was clad in a straw hat and a suit of white linen  he had just finished his pipe when a youth stopped to read the card on the doorpost this youth was attired in a coarse sailors jersey and a pair of gray tweed trousers which he had considerably outgrown  looking for a job inquired the exchampion of england and the colonies  the youth blushed and replied yes i should like to get something to do  mr skene stared at him with stern curiosity his piofessional pursuits had familiarized him with the manners and speech of english gentlemen and he immediately recognized the shabby sailor lad as one of that class  perhaps youre a scholar said the prizefighter after a moments reflection  i have been at school but i didnt learn much there replied the youth i think i could bookkeep by double entry he added glancing at the card  double entry whats that  its the way merchants books are kept it is called so because everything is entered twice over  ah said skene unfavorably impressed by the system once is enough for me whats your weight  i dont know said the lad with a grin  not know your own weight exclaimed skene that aint the way to get on in life  i havent been weighed since i was in england said the other beginning to get the better of his shyness i was eight stone four then so you see i am only a lightweight  and what do you know about lightweights perhaps being so well educated you know how to fight eh  i dont think i could fight you said the youth with another grin  skene chuckled and the stranger with boyish communicativeness gave him an account of a real fight meaning apparently one between professional pugilists which he had seen in england he went on to describe how he had himself knocked down a master with one blow when running away from school skene received this sceptically and crossexamined the narrator as to the manner and effect of the blow with the result of convincing himself that the story was true at the end of a quarter of an hour the lad had commended himself so favorably by his conversation that the champion took him into the gymnasium weighed him measured him and finally handed him a pair of boxing gloves and invited him to show what he was made of the youth though impressed by the prizefighters attitude with a hopeless sense of the impossibility of reaching him rushed boldly at him several times knocking his face on each occasion against skenes left fist which seemed to be ubiquitous and to have the property of imparting the consistency of iron to padded leather at last the novice directed a frantic assault at the champions nose rising on his toes in his excitement as he did so skene struck up the blow with his right arm and the impetuous youth spun and stumbled away until he fell supine in a corner rapping his head smartly on the floor at the same time he rose with unabated cheerfulness and offered to continue the combat but skene declined any further exercise just then and much pleased with his novices game promised to give him a scientific education and make a man of him  the champion now sent for his wife whom he revered as a preeminently sensible and wellmannered woman the newcomer could see in her only a ridiculous dancingmistress but he treated her with great deference and thereby improved the favorable opinion which skene had already formed of him he related to her how after running away from school he had made his way to liverpool gone to the docks and contrived to hide himself on board a ship bound for australia also how he had suffered severely from hunger and thirst before he discovered himself and how notwithstanding his unpopular position as stowaway he had been fairly treated as soon as he had shown that he was willing to work and in proof that he was still willing and had profited by his maritime experience he offered to sweep the floor of the gymnasium then and there this proposal convinced the skenes who had listened to his story like children listening to a fairy tale that he was not too much of a gentleman to do rough work and it was presently arranged that he should thenceforth board and lodge with them have five shillings a week for pocketmoney and be manofallwork servant gymnasium attendant clerk and apprentice to the exchampion of england and the colonies  he soon found his bargain no easy one the gymnasium was open from nine in the morning until eleven at night and the athletic gentlemen who came there not only ordered him about without ceremony but varied the monotony of being set at naught by the invincible skene by practising what he taught them on the person of his apprentice whom they pounded with great relish and threw backwards forwards and over their shoulders as though he had been but a senseless effigy provided for that purpose meanwhile the champion looked on and laughed being too lazy to redeem his promise of teaching the novice to defend himself the latter however watched the lessons which he saw daily given to others and before the end of a month he so completely turned the tables on the amateur pugilists of melbourne that skene one day took occasion to remark that he was growing uncommon clever but that gentlemen liked to be played easy with and that he should be careful not to knock them about too much besides these bodily exertions he had to keep account of gloves and foils sold and bought and of the fees due both to mr and mrs skene this was the most irksome part of his duty for he wrote a large schoolboy hand and was not quick at figures when he at last began to assist his master in giving lessons the accounts had fallen into arrear and mrs skene had to resume her former care of them a circumstance which gratified her husband who regarded it as a fresh triumph of her superior intelligence then a chinaman was engaged to do the more menial work of the establishment skenes novice as he was now generally called was elevated to the rank of assistant professor to the champion and became a person of some consequence in the gymnasium  he had been there more than nine months and had developed from an active youth into an athletic young man of eighteen when an important conversation took place between him and his principal it was evening and the only persons in the gymnasium were ned skene who sat smoking at his ease with his coat off and the novice who had just come downstairs from his bedroom where he had been preparing for a visit to the theatre  well my gentleman said skene mockingly youre a fancy man you are gloves too theyre too small for you dont you get hittin nobody with them on or youll mebbe sprain your wrist  not much fear of that said the novice looking at his watch and finding that he had some minutes to spare sitting down opposite skene  no assented the champion when you rise to be a regular professional you wont care to spar with nobody without youre well paid for it  i may say i am in the profession already you dont call me an amateur do you  oh no said skene soothingly not so bad as that but mind you my boy i dont call no man a fightingman what aint been in the ring youre a sparrer and a clever pretty sparrer but sparring aint the real thing some day please god well make up a little match for you and show what you can do without the gloves  i would just as soon have the gloves off as on said the novice a little sulkily  thats because you have a heart as big as a lion said skene patting him on the shoulder but the novice who was accustomed to hear his master pay the same compliment to his patrons whenever they were seized with fits of boasting which usually happened when they got beaten looked obdurate and said nothing  sam ducket of milltown was here today while you was out giving captain noble his lesson continued skene watching his apprentices face cunningly now sam is a real fightingman if you like  i dont think much of him hes a liar for one thing  thats a failing of the profession i dont mind telling you so said skene mournfully now the novice had found out this for himself already he never for instance believed the accounts which his master gave of the accidents and conspiracies which had led to his being defeated three times in the ring however as skene had won fifteen battles his next remark was undeniable men fight none the worse for being liars sam ducket bet ebony muley in twenty minutes  yes said the novice scornfully and what is ebony muley a wretched old nigger nearly sixty years old who is drunk seven days in the week and would sell a fight for a glass of brandy ducket ought to have knocked him out of time in seventy seconds ducket has no science  not a bit said ned but he has lots of game  pshaw come now ned you know as well as i do that that is one of the stalest commonplaces going if a fellow knows how to box they always say he has science but no pluck if he doesnt know his right hand from his left they say that he isnt clever but that he is full of game  skene looked with secret wonder at his pupil whose powers of observation and expression sometimes seemed to him almost to rival those of mrs skene sam was saying something like that today he remarked he says youre only a sparrer and that youd fall down with fright if you was put into a twentyfourfoot ring  the novice flushed i wish i had been here when sum ducket said that  why what could you ha done to him said skene his small eyes twinkling  id have punched his head thats what i could and would have done to him  why man hed eat you  he might and he might eat you too ned if he had salt enough with you he talks big because he knows i have no money and he pretends he wont strip for less than fifty pounds a side  no money cried skene i know them asll make up fifty pound before twelve tomorrow for any man as i will answer for thered be a start for a young man why my fust fight was for five shillings in tottnam fields and proud i was when i won it i dont want to set you on to fight a crack like sam ducket anyway against your inclinations but dont go for to say that money isnt to be had let ned skene pint to a young man and say thats the young man as ned backs and others will come forarday crowds of em  the novice hesitated do you think i ought to ned he said  that aint for me to say said skene doggedly i know what i would ha said at your age but perhaps youre right to be cautious i tell you the truth i wouldnt care to see you whipped by the like of sam ducket  will you train me if i challenge him  will i train you echoed skene rising with enthusiasm ay will i train you and put my money on you too and you shall knock fireworks out of him my boy as sure as my names ned skene  then cried the novice reddening with excitement ill fight him and if i lick him you will have to hand over your belt as champion of the colonies to me  so i will said skene affectionately dont out late and dont for your life touch a drop of liquor you must go into training tomorrow  this was cashel byrons first professional engagement       chapter i      wiltstoken castle was a square building with circular bastions at the corners each bastion terminating skyward in a turkish minaret the southwest face was the front and was pierced by a moorish arch fitted with glass doors which could be secured on occasion by gates of fantastically hammered iron the arch was enshrined by a palladian portico which rose to the roof and was surmounted by an open pediment in the cleft of which stood a blackmarble figure of an egyptian erect and gazing steadfastly at the midday sun on the ground beneath was an italian terrace with two great stone elephants at the ends of the balustrade the windows on the upper story were like the entrance moorish but the principal ones below were square bays mullioned the castle was considered grand by the illiterate but architects and readers of books on architecture condemned it as a nondescript mixture of styles in the worst possible taste it stood on an eminence surrounded by hilly woodland thirty acres of which were enclosed as wiltstoken park half a mile south was the little town of wiltstoken accessible by rail from london in about two hours  most of the inhabitants of wiltstoken were conservatives they stood in awe of the castle and some of them would at any time have cut half a dozen of their oldest friends to obtain an invitation to dinner or oven a bow in public from miss lydia carew its orphan mistress this miss carew was a remarkable person she had inherited the castle and park from her aunt who had considered her nieces large fortune in railways and mines incomplete without land so many other legacies had lydia received from kinsfolk who hated poor relations that she was now in her twentyfifth year the independent possessor of an annual income equal to the years earnings of five hundred workmen and under no external compulsion to do anything in return for it in addition to the advantage of being a single woman in unusually easy circumstances she enjoyed a reputation for vast learning and exquisite culture it was said in wiltstoken that she knew fortyeight living languages and all dead ones could play on every known musical instrument was an accomplished painter and had written poetry all this might as well have been true as far as the wiltstokeners were concerned since she knew more than they she had spent her life travelling with her father a man of active mind and bad digestion with a taste for sociology science in general and the fine arts on these subjects he had written books by which he had earned a considerable reputation as a critic and philosopher they were the outcome of much reading observation of men and cities sightseeing and theatregoing of which his daughter had done her share and indeed as she grew more competent and he weaker and older more than her share he had had to combine healthhunting with pleasureseeking and being very irritable and fastidious had schooled her in selfcontrol and endurance by harder lessons than those which had made her acquainted with the works of greek and german philosophers long before she understood the english into which she translated them  when lydia was in her twentyfirst year her fathers health failed seriously he became more dependent on her and she anticipated that he would also become more exacting in his demands on her time the contrary occurred one day at naples she had arranged to go riding with an english party that was staying there shortly before the appointed hour he asked her to make a translation of a long extract from lessing lydia in whom selfquestionings as to the justice of her fathers yoke had been for some time stirring paused thoughtfully for perhaps two seconds before she consented carew said nothing but he presently intercepted a servant who was bearing an apology to the english party read the note and went back to his daughter who was already busy at lessing  lydia he said with a certain hesitation which she would have ascribed to shyness had that been at all credible of her father when addressing her i wish you never to postpone your business to literary trifling  she looked at him with the vague fear that accompanies a new and doubtful experience and he dissatisfied with his way of putting the case added it is of greater importance that you should enjoy yourself for an hour than that my book should be advanced far greater  lydia after some consideration put down her pen and said i shall not enjoy riding if there is anything else left undone  i shall not enjoy your writing if your excursion is given up for it he said i prefer your going  lydia obeyed silently an odd thought struck her that she might end the matter gracefully by kissing him but as they were unaccustomed to make demonstrations of this kind nothing came of the impulse she spent the day on horseback reconsidered her late rebellious thoughts and made the translation in the evening  thenceforth lydia had a growing sense of the power she had unwittingly been acquiring during her long subordination timidly at first and more boldly as she became used to dispense with the parental leadingstrings she began to follow her own bent in selecting subjects for study and even to defend certain recent developments of art against her fathers conservatism he approved of this independent mental activity on her part and repeatedly warned her not to pin her faith more on him than on any other critic she once told him that one of her incentives to disagree with him was the pleasure it gave her to find out ultimately that he was right he replied gravely  that pleases me lydia because i believe you but such things are better left unsaid they seem to belong to the art of pleasing which you will perhaps soon be tempted to practise because it seems to ail young people easy well paid amiable and a mark of good breeding in truth it is vulgar cowardly egotistical and insincere a virtue in a shopman a vice in a free woman it is better to leave genuine praise unspoken than to expose yourself to the suspicion of flattery  shortly after this at his desire she spent a season in london and went into english polite society which she found to be in the main a temple for the worship of wealth and a market for the sale of virgins having become familiar with both the cult and the trade elsewhere she found nothing to interest her except the english manner of conducting them and the novelty of this soon wore off she was also incommoded by her involuntary power of inspiring affection in her own sex impulsive girls she could keep in awe but old women notably two aunts who had never paid her any attention during her childhood now persecuted her with slavish fondness and tempted her by mingled entreaties and bribes to desert her father and live with them for the remainder of their lives her reserve fanned their longing to have her for a pet and to escape them she returned to the continent with her father and ceased to hold any correspondence with london her aunts declared themselves deeply hurt and lydia was held to have treated them very injudiciously but when they died and their wills became public it was found that they had vied with one another in enriching her  when she was twentyfive years old the first startling event of her life took place this was the death of her father at avignon no endearments passed between them even on that occasion she was sitting opposite to him at the fireside one evening reading aloud when he suddenly said my heart has stopped lydia goodbye and immediately died she had some difficulty in quelling the tumult that arose when the bell was answered the whole household felt bound to be overwhelmed and took it rather ill that she seemed neither grateful to them nor disposed to imitate their behavior  carews relatives agreed that he had made a most unbecoming will it was a brief document dated five years before his death and was to the effect that he bequeathed to his dear daughter lydia all he possessed he had however left her certain private instructions one of these which excited great indignation in his family was that his body should be conveyed to milan and there cremated having disposed of her fathers remains as he had directed she came to set her affairs in order in england where she inspired much hopeless passion in the toilers in lincolns inn fields and chancery lane and agreeably surprised her solicitors by evincing a capacity for business and a patience with the laws delay that seemed incompatible with her age and sex when all was arranged and she was once more able to enjoy perfect tranquillity she returned to avignon and there discharged her last duty to her father this was to open a letter she had found in his desk inscribed by his hand for lydia to be read by her at leisure when i and my affairs shall be finally disposed of the letter ran thus  my dear lydiai belong to the great company of disappointed men but for you i should now write myself down a failure like the rest it is only a few years since it first struck me that although i had failed in many ambitions with which having failed i need not trouble you now i had achieved some success as a father i had no sooner made this discovery than it began to stick in my thoughts that you could draw no other conclusion from the course of our life together than that i have with entire selfishness used you throughout as my mere amanuensis and clerk and that you are under no more obligation to me for your attainments than a slave is to his master for the strength which enforced labor has given to his muscles lest i should leave you suffering from so mischievous and oppressive an influence as a sense of injustice i now justify myself to you  i have never asked you whether you remember your mother had you at any time broached the subject i should have spoken quite freely to you on it but as some wise instinct led you to avoid it i was content to let it rest until circumstances such as the present should render further reserve unnecessary if any regret at having known so little of the woman who gave you birth troubles you shake it off without remorse she was the most disagreeable person i ever knew i speak dispassionately all my bitter personal feeling against her is as dead while i write as it will be when you read i have even come to cherish tenderly certain of her characteristics which you have inherited so that i confidently say that i never since the perishing of the infatuation in which i married felt more kindly toward her than i do now i made the best and she the worst of our union for six years and then we parted i permitted her to give what account of the separation she pleased and allowed her about five times as much money as she had any right to expect by these means i induced her to leave me in undisturbed possession of you whom i had already as a measure of precaution carried off to belgium the reason why we never visited england during her lifetime was that she could and probably would have made my previous conduct and my hostility to popular religion an excuse for wresting you from me i need say no more of her and am sorry it was necessary to mention her at all  i will now tell you what induced me to secure you for myself it was not natural affection i did not love you then and i knew that you would be a serious encumbrance to me but having brought you into the world and then broken through my engagements with your mother i felt bound to see that you should not suffer for my mistake gladly would i have persuaded myself that she was as the gossips said the fittest person to have charge of you but i knew better and made up my mind to discharge my responsibility as well as i could in course of time you became useful to me and as you know i made use of you without scruple but never without regard to your own advantage i always kept a secretary to do whatever i considered mere copyists work much as you did for me i think i may say with truth that i never imposed a task of absolutely no educational value on you i fear you found the hours you spent over my money affairs very irksome but i need not apologize for that now you must already know by experience how necessary a knowledge of business is to the possessor of a large fortune  i did not think when i undertook your education that i was laying the foundation of any comfort for myself for a long time you were only a good girl and what ignorant people called a prodigy of learning in your circumstances a commonplace child might have been both i subsequently came to contemplate your existence with a pleasure which i never derived from the contemplation of my own i have not succeeded and shall not succeed in expressing the affection i feel for you or the triumph with which i find that what i undertook as a distasteful and thankless duty has rescued my life and labor from waste my literary travail seriously as it has occupied us both i now value only for the share it has had in educating you and you will be guilty of no disloyalty to me when you come to see that though i sifted as much sand as most men i found no gold i ask you to remember then that i did my duty to you long before it became pleasurable or even hopeful and when you are older and have learned from your mothers friends how i failed in my duty to her you will perhaps give me some credit for having conciliated the world for your sake by abandoning habits and acquaintances which whatever others may have thought of them did much while they lasted to make life endurable to me  although your future will not concern me i often find myself thinking of it i fear you will soon find that the world has not yet provided a place and a sphere of action for wise and wellinstructed women in my younger days when the companionship of my fellows was a necessity to me i voluntarily set aside my culture relaxed my principles and acquired common tastes in order to fit myself for the society of the only men within my reach for if i had to live among bears i had rather be a bear than a man let me warn you against this never attempt to accommodate yourself to the world by selfdegradation be patient and you will enjoy frivolity all the more because you are not frivolous much as the world will respect your knowledge all the more because of its own ignorance  some day i expect and hope you will marry you will then have an opportunity of making an irremediable mistake against the possibility of which no advice of mine or subtlety of yours can guard you i think you will not easily find a man able to satisfy in you that desire to be relieved of the responsibility of thinking out and ordering our course of life that makes us each long for a guide whom we can thoroughly trust if you fail remember that your father after suffering a bitter and complete disappointment in his wife yet came to regard his marriage as the happiest event in his career let me remind you also since you are so rich that it would he a great folly for you to be jealous of your own income and to limit your choice of a husband to those already too rich to marry for money no vulgar adventurer will be able to recommend himself to you and better men will be at least as much frightened as attracted by your wealth the only class against which i need warn you is that to which i myself am supposed to belong never think that a man must prove a suitable and satisfying friend for you merely because he has read much criticism that he must feel the influences of art as you do because he knows and adopts the classification of names and schools with which you are familiar or that because he agrees with your favorite authors he must necessarily interpret their words to himself as you understand them beware of men who have read more than they have worked or who love to read better than to work beware of painters poets musicians and artists of all sorts except very great artists beware even of them as husbands and fathers selfsatisfied workmen who have learned their business well whether they be chancellors of the exchequer or farmers i recommend to you as on the whole the most tolerable class of men i have met  i shall make no further attempt to advise you as fast as my counsels rise to my mind follow reflections that convince me of their futility  you may perhaps wonder why i never said to you what i have written down here i have tried to do so and failed if i understand myself aright i have written these lines mainly to relieve a craving to express my affection for you the awkwardness which an overcivilized man experiences in admitting that he is something more than an educated stone prevented me from confusing you by demonstrations of a kind i had never accustomed you to besides i wish this assurance of my lovemy last wordto reach you when no further commonplaces to blur the impressiveness of its simple truth are possible  i know i have said too much and i feel that i have not said enough but the writing of this letter has been a difficult task practised as i am with my pen i have never even in my earliest efforts composed with such labor and sense of inadequacy  here the manuscript broke off the letter had never been finished       chapter ii      in the month of may seven years after the flight of the two boys from moncrief house a lady sat in an island of shadow which was made by a cedartree in the midst of a glittering green lawn she did well to avoid the sun for her complexion was as delicately tinted as motherofpearl she was a small graceful woman with sensitive lips and nostrils green eyes with quiet unarched brows and ruddy gold hair now shaded by a large untrimmed straw hat her dress of indian muslin with halfsleeves terminating at the elbows in wide ruffles hardly covered her shoulders where it was supplemented by a scarf through which a glimpse of her throat was visible in a nest of soft tourkaris lace she was reading a little ivorybound volumea miniature edition of the second part of goethes faust  as the afternoon wore on and the light mellowed the lady dropped her book and began to think and dream unconscious of a prosaic black object crossing the lawn towards her this was a young gentleman in a frock coat he was dark and had a long grave face with a reserved expression but not illlooking  going so soon lucian said the lady looking up as he came into the shadow  lucian looked at her wistfully his name as she uttered it always stirred him vaguely he was fond of finding out the reasons of things and had long ago decided that this inward stir was due to her fine pronunciation his other intimates called him looshn  yes he said i have arranged everything and have come to give an account of my stewardship and to say goodbye  he placed a gardenchair near her and sat down she laid her hands one on the other in her lap and composed herself to listen  first he said as to the warren lodge it is let for a month only so you can allow mrs goff to have it rent free in july if you still wish to i hope you will not act so unwisely  she smiled and said who are the present tenants i hear that they object to the dairymaids and men crossing the elm vista  we must not complain of that it was expressly stipulated when they took the lodge that the vista should be kept private for them i had no idea at that time that you were coming to the castle or i should of course have declined such a condition  but we do keep it private for them strangers are not admitted our people pass and repass once a day on their way to and from the dairy that is all  it seems churlish lydia but this it appears is a special casea young gentleman who has come to recruit his health he needs daily exercise in the open air but he cannot bear observation and he has only a single attendant with him under these circumstances i agreed that they should have the sole use of the elm vista in fact they are paying more rent than would be reasonable without this privilege  i hope the young gentleman is not mad  i satisfied myself before i let the lodge to him that he would be a proper tenant said lucian with reproachful gravity he was strongly recommended to me by lord worthington whom i believe to be a man of honor notwithstanding his inveterate love of sport as it happens i expressed to him the suspicion you have just suggested worthington vouched for the tenants sanity and offered to take the lodge in his own name and be personally responsible for the good behavior of this young invalid who has i fancy upset his nerves by hard reading probably some college friend of worthingtons  perhaps so but i should rather expect a college friend of lord worthingtons to be a hard rider or drinker than a hard reader  you may be quite at ease lydia i took lord worthington at his word so far as to make the letting to him i have never seen the real tenant but though i do not even recollect his name i will venture to answer for him at secondhand  i am quite satisfied lucian and i am greatly obliged to you i will give orders that no one shall go to the dairy by way of the warren it is natural that he should wish to be out of the world  the next point resumed lucian is more important as it concerns you personally miss goff is willing to accept your offer and a most unsuitable companion she will be for you  why lucian  on all accounts she is younger than you and therefore cannot chaperone yon she has received only an ordinary education and her experience of society is derived from local subscription balls and as she is not unattractive and is considered a beauty in wiltstoken she is selfwilled and will probably take your patronage in bad part  is she more selfwilled than i  you are not selfwilled lydia except that you are deaf to advice  you mean that i seldom follow it and so you think i had better employ a professional companiona decayed gentlewomanthan save this young girl from going out as a governess and beginning to decay at twentythree  the business of getting a suitable companion and the pleasure or duty of relieving poor people are two different things lydia  true lucian when will miss goff call  this evening mind nothing is settled as yet if you think better of it on seeing her you have only to treat her as an ordinary visitor and the subject will drop for my own part i prefer her sister but she will not leave mrs goff who has not yet recovered from the shock of her husbands death  lydia looked reflectively at the little volume in her hand and seemed to think out the question of miss goff presently with an air of having made up her mind she said can you guess which of goethes characters you remind me of when you try to be worldlywise for my sake  when i trywhat an extraordinary irrelevance i have not read goethe lately mephistopheles i suppose but i did not mean to be cynical  no not mephistopheles but wagnerwith a difference wagner taking mephistopheles instead of faust for his model seeing by his face that he did not relish the comparison she added i am paying you a compliment wagner represents a very clever man  the saving clause is unnecessary he said somewhat sarcastically i know your opinion of me quite well lydia  she looked quickly at him detecting the concern in her glance he shook his head sadly saying i must go now lydia i leave you in charge of the housekeeper until miss goff arrives  she gave him her hand and a dull glow came into his gray jaws as he took it then he buttoned his coat and walked gravely away as he went she watched the sun mirrored in his glossy hat and drowned in his respectable coat she sighed and took up goethe again  but after a little while she began to be tired of sitting still and she rose and wandered through the park for nearly an hour trying to find the places in which she had played in her childhood during a visit to her late aunt she recognized a great toppling druids altar that had formerly reminded her of mount sinai threatening to fall on the head of christian in the pilgrims progress farther on she saw and avoided a swamp in which she had once earned a scolding from her nurse by filling her stockings with mud then she found herself in a long avenue of green turf running east and west and apparently endless this seemed the most delightful of all her possessions and she had begun to plan a pavilion to build near it when she suddenly recollected that this must be the elm vista of which the privacy was so stringently insisted upon by her invalid tenant at the warren lodge she fled into the wood at once and when she was safe there laughed at the oddity of being a trespasser in her own domain she made a wide detour in order to avoid intruding a second time consequently after walking for a quarter of an hour she lost herself the trees seemed never ending she began to think she must possess a forest as well as a park at last she saw an opening hastening toward it she came again into the sunlight and stopped dazzled by an apparition which she at first took to be a beautiful statue but presently recognized with a strange glow of delight as a living man  to so mistake a gentleman exercising himself in the open air on a nineteenthcentury afternoon would under ordinary circumstances imply incredible ignorance either of men or statues but the circumstances in miss carews case were not ordinary for the man was clad in a jersey and kneebreeches of white material and his bare arms shone like those of a gladiator his broad pectoral muscles in their white covering were like slabs of marble even his hair short crisp and curly seemed like burnished bronze in the evening light it came into lydias mind that she had disturbed an antique god in his sylvan haunt the fancy was only momentary for she perceived that there was a third person present a man impossible to associate with classic divinity he looked like a well to do groom and was contemplating his companion much as a groom might contemplate an exceptionally fine horse he was the first to see lydia and his expression as he did so plainly showed that he regarded her as a most unwelcome intruder the statueman following his sinister look saw her too but with different feelings for his lips parted his color rose and he stared at her with undisguised admiration and wonder lydias first impulse was to turn and fly her next to apologize for her presence finally she went away quietly through the trees  the moment she was out of their sight she increased her pace almost to a run the day was too warm for rapid movement and she soon stopped and listened there were the usual woodland sounds leaves rustling grasshoppers chirping and birds singing but not a human voice or footstep she began to think that the godlike figure was only the hermes of praxiteles suggested to her by goethes classical sabbat and changed by a daydream into the semblance of a living reality the groom must have been one of those incongruities characteristic of dreamsprobably a reminiscence of lucians statement that the tenant of the warren lodge had a single male attendant it was impossible that this glorious vision of manly strength and beauty could be substantially a student broken down by excessive study that irrational glow of delight too was one of the absurdities of dreamland otherwise she should have been ashamed of it  lydia made her way back to the castle in some alarm as to the state of her nerves but dwelling on her vision with a pleasure that she would not have ventured to indulge had it concerned a creature of flesh and blood once or twice it recurred to her so vividly that she asked herself whether it could have been real but a little reasoning convinced her that it must have been an hallucination  if you please madam said one of her staff of domestics a native of wiltstoken who stood in deep awe of the lady of the castle miss goff is waiting for you in the drawingroom  the drawingroom of the castle was a circular apartment with a domeshaped ceiling broken into gilt ornaments resembling thick bamboos which projected vertically downward like stalagmites the heavy chandeliers were loaded with flattened brass balls magnified facsimiles of which crowned the uprights of the low broad massivelyframed chairs which were covered in leather stamped with japanese dragon designs in coppercolored metal near the fireplace was a great bronze bell of chinese shape mounted like a mortar on a black wooden carriage for use as a coalscuttle the wall was decorated with large gold crescents on a ground of light blue  in this barbaric rotunda miss carew found awaiting her a young lady of twentythree with a welldeveloped resilient figure and a clear complexion porcelain surfaced and with a fine red in the cheeks the lofty pose of her head expressed an habitual sense of her own consequence given her by the admiration of the youth of the neighborhood which was also perhaps the cause of the neatness of her inexpensive black dress and of her irreproachable gloves boots and hat she had been waiting to introduce herself to the lady of the castle for ten minutes in a state of nervousness that culminated as lydia entered  how do you do miss goff have i kept you waiting i was out  not at all said miss goff with a confused impression that red hair was aristocratic and dark brown the color of her own vulgar she had risen to shake hands and now after hesitating a moment to consider what etiquette required her to do next resumed her seat miss carew sat down too and gazed thoughtfully at her visitor who held herself rigidly erect and striving to mask her nervousness unintentionally looked disdainful  miss goff said lydia after a silence that made her speech impressive will you come to me on a long visit in this lonely place i am greatly in want of a friend and companion of my own age and position i think you must be equally so  alice goff was very young and very determined to accept no credit that she did not deserve with the unconscious vanity and conscious honesty of youth she proceeded to set miss carew right as to her social position not considering that the lady of the castle probably understood it better than she did herself and indeed thinking it quite natural that she should be mistaken  you are very kind she replied stiffly but our positions are quite different miss carew the fact is that i cannot afford to live an idle life we are very poor and my mother is partly dependent on my exertions  i think you will be able to exert yourself to good purpose if you come to me said lydia unimpressed it is true that i shall give you very expensive habits but i will of course enable you to support them  i do not wish to contract expensive habits said alice reproachfully i shall have to content myself with frugal ones throughout my life  not necessarily tell me frankly how had you proposed to exert yourself as a teacher was it not  alice flushed but assented  you are not at all fitted for it and you will end by marrying as a teacher you could not marry well as an idle lady with expensive habits you will marry very well indeed it is quite an art to know how to be richan indispensable art if you mean to marry a rich man  i have no intention of marrying said alice loftily she thought it time to check this cool aristocrat if i come at all i shall come without any ulterior object  that is just what i had hoped come without condition or second thought of any kind  but began alice and stopped bewildered by the pace at which the negotiation was proceeding she murmured a few words and waited for lydia to proceed but lydia had said her say and evidently expected a reply though she seemed assured of having her own way whatever alices views might be  i do not quite understand miss carew what dutieswhat would you expect of me  a great deal said lydia gravely much more than i should from a mere professional companion  but i am a professional companion protested alice  whose  alice flushed again angrily this time i did not mean to say  you do not mean to say that you will have nothing to do with me said lydia stopping her quietly why are you so scrupulous miss goff you will be close to your home and can return to it at any moment if you become dissatisfied with your position here  fearful that she had disgraced herself by ill manners loath to be taken possession of as if her wishes were of no consequence when a rich ladys whim was to be gratified suspicioussince she had often heard gossiping tales of the dishonesty of people in high positionslest she should be cheated out of the salary she had come resolved to demand and withal unable to defend herself against miss carew alice caught at the first excuse that occurred to her  i should like a little time to consider she said  time to accustom yourself to me is it not you can have as long as you plea  oh i can let you know tomorrow interrupted alice officiously  thank you i will send a note to mrs goff to say that she need not expect you back until tomorrow  but i did not meani am not prepared to stay remonstrated alice feeling that she was being entangled in a snare  we shall take a walk after dinner then and call at your house where you can make your preparations but i think i can supply you with all you will require  alice dared make no further objection i am afraid she stammered you will think me horribly rude but i am so useless and you are so sure to be disappointed thatthat  you are not rude miss goff but i find you very shy you want to run away and hide from new faces and new surroundings alice who was selfpossessed and even overbearing in wiltstoken society felt that she was misunderstood but did not know how to vindicate herself lydia resumed i have formed my habits in the course of my travels and so live without ceremony we dine earlyat six  alice had dined at two but did not feel bound to confess it  let me show you your room said lydia rising this is a curious drawingroom she added glancing around i only use it occasionally to receive visitors she looked about her again with some interest as if the apartment belonged to some one else and led the way to a room on the first floor furnished as a ladys bedchamber if you dislike this she said or cannot arrange it to suit you there are others of which you can have your choice come to my boudoir when you are ready  where is that said alice anxiously  it isyou had better ring for some one to show you i will send you my maid  alice even more afraid of the maid than of the mistress declined hastily i am accustomed to attend to myself miss carew with proud humility  you will find it more convenient to call me lydia said miss carew otherwise you will be supposed to refer to my grandaunt a very old lady she then left the room  alice was fond of thinking that she had a womanly taste and touch in making a room pretty she was accustomed to survey with pride her mothers drawingroom which she had garnished with cheap cretonnes japanese paper fans and knickknacks in ornamental pottery she felt now that if she slept once in the bed before her she could never be content in her mothers house again all that she had read and believed of the beauty of cheap and simple ornament and the vulgarity of costliness recurred to her as a hypocritical paraphrase of the sour grapes of the fox in the fable she pictured to herself with a shudder the effect of a sixpenny chinese umbrella in that fireplace a cretonne valance to that bed or chintz curtains to those windows there was in the room a series of mirrors consisting of a great glass in which she could see herself at full length another framed in the carved oaken dressingtable and smaller ones of various shapes fixed to jointed arms that turned every way to use them for the first time was like having eyes in the back of the head she had never seen herself from all points of view before as she gazed she strove not to be ashamed of her dress but even her face and figure which usually afforded her unqualified delight seemed robust and middleclass in miss carews mirrors  after all she said seating herself on a chair that was even more luxurious to rest in than to look at putting the lace out of the questionand my old lace that belongs to mamma is quite as valuableher whole dress cannot have cost much more than mine at any rate it is not worth much more whatever she may have chosen to pay for it  but alice was clever enough to envy miss carew her manners more than her dress she would not admit to herself that she was not thoroughly a lady but she felt that lydia in the eye of a stranger would answer that description better than she still as far as she had observed miss carew was exceedingly cool in her proceedings and did not take any pains to please those with whom she conversed alice had often made compacts of friendship with young ladies and had invited them to call her by her christian name but on such occasions she had always called themn dear or darling and while the friendship lasted which was often longer than a month for alice was a steadfast girl had never met them without exchanging an embrace and a hearty kiss  and nothing she said springing from the chair as she thought of this and speaking very resolutely shall tempt me to believe that there is anything vulgar in sincere affection i shall be on my guard against this woman  having settled that matter for the present she resumed her examination of the apartment and was more and more attracted by it as she proceeded for thanks to her eminence as a local beauty she had not that fear of beautiful and rich things which renders abject people incapable of associating costliness with comfort had the counterpane of the bed been her own she would have unhesitatingly converted it into a balldress there were toilet appliances of which she had never felt the need and could only guess the use she looked with despair into the two large closets thinking how poor a show her three dresses her ulster and her few old jackets would make there there was also a dressingroom with a marble bath that made cleanliness a luxury instead of one of the sternest of the virtues as it seemed at home yet she remarked that though every object was more or less ornamental nothing had been placed in the rooms for the sake of ornament alone miss carew judged by her domestic arrangements was a utilitarian before everything there was a very handsome chimney piece but as there was nothing on the mantel board alice made a faint effort to believe that it was inferior in point of taste to that in her own bedroom which was covered with blue cloth surrounded by fringe and brass headed nails and laden with photographs in plush frames  the striking of the hour reminded her that she had forgotten to prepare for dinner khe hastily took off her hat washed her hands spent another minute among the mirrors and was summoning courage to ring the bell when a doubt occurred to her ought she to put on her gloves before going down or not this kept her in perplexity for many seconds at last she resolved to put her gloves in her pocket and be guided as to their further disposal by the example of her hostess then not daring to hesitate any longer she rang the bell and was presently joined by a french lady of polished mannersmiss carews maid who conducted her to the boudoir a hexagonal apartment that alice thought a sultana might have envied lydia was there reading alice noted with relief that she had not changed her dress and that she was ungloved  miss goff did not enjoy the dinner there was a butler who seemed to have nothing to do but stand at a buffet and watch her there was also a swift noiseless footman who presented himself at her elbow at intervals and compelled her to choose on the instant between unfamiliar things to eat and drink she envied these men their knowledge of society and shrank from their criticism once after taking a piece of asparagus in her hand she was deeply mortified at seeing her hostess consume the vegetable with the aid of a knife and fork but the footmans back was turned to her just then and the butler oppressed by the heat of the weather was in a state of abstraction bordering on slumber on the whole by dint of imitating miss oarew who did not plague her with any hostesslike vigilance she came off without discredit to her breeding  lydia on her part acknowledged no obligation to entertain her guest by chatting and enjoyed her thoughts and her dinner in silence alice began to be fascinated by her and to wonder what she was thinking about she fancied that the footman was not quite free from the same influence even the butler might have been meditating himself to sleep on the subject alice felt tempted to offer her a penny for her thoughts but she dared not be so familiar as yet and had the offer been made and accepted butler footman and guest would have been plunged into equal confusion by the explanation which would have run thus  i saw a vision of the hermes of praxiteles in a sylvan haunt today and i am thinking of that       chapter iii      next day alice accepted miss carews invitation lydia who seemed to regard all conclusions as foregone when she had once signified her approval of them took the acceptance as a matter of course alice thereupon thought fit to remind her that there were other persons to be considered so she said i should not have hesitated yesterday but for my mother it seems so heartless to leave her  you have a sister at home have you not  yes but she is not very strong and my mother requires a great deal of attention alice paused and added in a lower voice she has never recovered from the shock of my fathers death  your father is then not long dead said lydia in her usual tone  only two years said alice coldly i hardly know how to tell my mother that i am going to desert her  go and tell her today alice you need not be afraid of hurting her grief of two years standing is only a bad habit  alice started outraged her mothers grief was sacred to her and yet it was by her experience of her mother that she recognized the truth of lydias remark and felt that it was unanswerable she frowned but the frown was lost miss carew was not looking at her then she rose and went to the door where she stopped to say  you do not know our family circumstances i will go now and try to prevail on my mother to let me stay with you  please come back in good time for dinner said lydia unmoved i will introduce you to my cousin lucian webber i have just received a telegram from him he is coming down with lord worthington i do not know whether lord worthington will come to dinner or not he has an invalid friend at the warren and lucian does not make it clear whether he is coming to visit him or me however it is of no consequence lord worthington is only a young sportsman lucian is a clever man and will be an eminent one some day he is secretary to a cabinet minister and is very busy but we shall probably see him often while the whitsuntide holidays last excuse my keeping you waiting at the door to hear that long history adieu she waved her hand alice suddenly felt that it was possible to be very fond of miss carew  she spent an unhappy afternoon with her mother mrs goff had had the goodfortune to marry a man of whom she was afraid and who made himself very disagreeable whenever his house or his children were neglected in the least particular making a virtue of necessity she had come to be regarded in wiltstoken as a model wife and mother at last when a drag ran over mr goff and killed him she was left almost penniless with two daughters on her hands in this extremity she took refuge in grief and did nothing her daughters settled their fathers affairs as best they could moved her into a cheap house and procured a strange tenant for that in which they had lived during many years janet the elder sister a student by disposition employed herself as a teacher of the scientific fashions in modern female education rumors of which had already reached wiltstoken alice was unable to teach mathematics and moral science but she formed a dancingclass and gave lessons in singing and in a language which she believed to be current in france but which was not intelligible to natives of that country travelling through wiltstoken both sisters were devoted to one another and to their mother alice who had enjoyed the special affection of her selfindulgent father preserved some regard for his memory though she could not help wishing that his affection had been strong enough to induce him to save a provision for her she was ashamed too of the very recollection of his habit of getting drunk at races regattas and other national festivals by an accident at one of which he had met his death  alice went home from the castle expecting to find the household divided between joy at her goodfortune and grief at losing her for her views of human nature and parental feeling were as yet pure superstitions but mrs goff at once became envious of the luxury her daughter was about to enjoy and overwhelmed her with accusations of want of feeling eagerness to desert her mother and vain love of pleasure alice who loved mrs goff so well that she had often told her as many as five different lies in the course of one afternoon to spare her some unpleasant truth and would have scouted as infamous any suggestion that her parent was more selfish than saintly soon burst into tears declaring that she would not return to the castle and that nothing would have induced her to stay there the night before had she thought that her doing so could give pain at home this alarmed mrs goff who knew by experience that it was easier to drive alice upon rash resolves than to shake her in them afterwards fear of incurring blame in wiltstoken for wantonly opposing her daughters obvious interests and of losing her share of miss carews money and countenance got the better of her jealousy she lectured alice severely for her headstrong temper and commanded her on her duty not only to her mother but also and chiefly to her god to accept miss carews offer with thankfulness and to insist upon a definite salary as soon as she had by good behavior made her society indispensable at the castle alice dutiful as she was reduced mrs goff to entreaties and even to symptoms of an outburst of violent grief for the late mr goff before she consented to obey her she would wait she said until janet who was absent teaching came in and promised to forgive her for staying away the previous night mrs goff had falsely represented that janet had been deeply hurt and had lain awake weeping during the small hours of the morning the mother seeing nothing for it but either to get rid of alice before janets return or to be detected in a spiteful untruth had to pretend that janet was spending the evening with some friends and to urge the unkindness of leaving miss carew lonely at last alice washed away the traces of her tears and returned to the castle feeling very miserable and trying to comfort herself with the reflection that her sister had been spared the scene which had just passed  lucian webber had not arrived when she reached the castle miss carew glanced at her melancholy face as she entered but asked no questions presently however she put down her book considered for a moment and said  it is nearly three years since i have had a new dress alice looked up with interest now that i have you to help me to choose i think i will be extravagant enough to renew my entire wardrobe i wish you would take this opportunity to get some things for yourself you will find that my dressmaker madame smith is to be depended on for work though she is expensive and dishonest when we are tired of wiltstoken we will go to paris and be millinered there but in the meantime we can resort to madame smith  i cannot afford expensive dresses said alice  i should not ask you to get them if you could not afford them i warned you that i should give you expensive habits  alice hesitated she had a healthy inclination to take whatever she could get on all occasions and she had suffered too much from poverty not to be more thankful for her goodfortune than humiliated by miss carews bounty but the thought of being driven richly attired in one of the castle carriages and meeting janet trudging about her daily tasks in cheap black serge and mended gloves made alice feel that she deserved all her mothers reproaches however it was obvious that a refusal would be of no material benefit to janet so she said  really i could not think of imposing on your kindness in this wholesale fashion you are too good to me  i will write to madame smith this evening said lydia  alice was about to renew her protest more faintly when a servant entered and announced mr webber she stiffened herself to receive the visitor lydias manner did not alter in the least lucian whose demeanor resembled miss goffs rather than his cousins went through the ceremony of introduction with solemnity and was received with a dash of scorn for alice though secretly awestricken bore herself tyrannically towards men from habit  in reply to alice mr webber thought the day cooler than yesterday in reply to lydia he admitted that the resolution of which the leader of the opposition had given notice was tantamount to a vote of censure on the government he was confident that ministers would have a majority he had no news of any importance he had made the journey down with lord worthington who had come to wiltstoken to see the invalid at the warren he had promised to return with him in the seventhirty train  when they went down to dinner alice profiting by her experience of the day before faced the servants with composure and committed no solecisms unable to take part in the conversation as she knew little of literature and nothing of politics which were the staple of lucians discourse she sat silent and reconsidered an old opinion of hers that it was ridiculous and illbred in a lady to discuss anything that was in the newspapers she was impressed by lucians cautious and somewhat dogmatic style of conversation and concluded that he knew everything lydia seemed interested in his information but quite indifferent to his opinions  towards halfpast seven lydia proposed that they should walk to the railway station adding as a reason for going that she wished to make some bets with lord worthington lucian looked grave at this and alice to show that she shared his notions of propriety looked shocked neither demonstration had the slightest effect on lydia on their way to the station he remarked  worthington is afraid of you lydianeedlessly as it seems  why  because you are so learned and he so ignorant he has no culture save that of the turf but perhaps you have more sympathy with his tastes than he supposes  i like him because i have not read the books from which he has borrowed his opinions indeed from their freshness i should not be surprised to learn that he had them at first hand from living men or even from his own observation of life  i may explain to you miss goff said lucian that lord worthiugton is a young gentleman  whose calendar is the racing calendar interposed lydia and who interests himself in favorites and outsiders much as lucian does in primeministers and independent radicals would you like to go to ascot alice  alice answered as she felt lucian wished her to answer that she had never been to a race and that she had no desire to go to one  you will change your mind in time for next years meeting a race interests every one which is more than can be said for the opera or the academy  i have been at the academy said alice who had made a trip to london once  indeed said lydia were you in the national gallery  the national gallery i think not i forget  i know many persons who never miss an academy and who do not know where the national gallery is did you enjoy the pictures alice  oh very much indeed  you will find ascot far more amusing  let me warn you said lucian to alice that my cousins pet caprice is to affect a distaste for art to which she is passionately devoted and for literature in which she is profoundly read  cousin lucian said lydia should you ever be cut off from your politics and disappointed in your ambition you will have an opportunity of living upon art and literature then i shall respect your opinion of their satisfactoriness as a staff of life as yet you have only tried them as a sauce  discontented as usual said lucian  your one idea respecting me as usual replied lydia patiently as they entered the station  the train consisting of three carriages and a van was waiting at the platform the engine was humming subduedly and the driver and fireman were leaning out the latter a young man eagerly watching two gentlemen who were standing before the firstclass carriage and the driver sharing his curiosity in an elderly preoccupied manner one of the persons thus observed was a slight fairhaired man of about twentyfive in the afternoon costume of a metropolitan dandy lydia knew the other the moment she came upon the platform as the hermes of the day before modernized by a straw hat a canarycolored scarf and a suit of a minute blackandwhite chessboard pattern with a crimson silk handkerchief overflowing the breast pocket of the coat his hands were unencumbered by stick or umbrella he carried himself smartly balancing himself so accurately that he seemed to have no weight and his expression was selfsatisfied and goodhumored but lydia felt that there was a but somewherethat he must be something more than a handsome powerful and lighthearted young man  there is lord worthington she said indicating the slight gentleman surely that cannot be his invalid friend with him  that is the man that lives at the warren said alice i know his appearance  which is certainly not suggestive of a valetudinarian remarked lucian looking hard at the stranger  they had now come close to the two and could hear lord worthington as he prepared to enter the carriage saying take care of yourself like a good fellow wont you remember if it lasts a second over the fifteen minutes i shall drop five hundred pounds  hermes placed his arm round the shoulders of the young lord and gave him a playful roll then he said with good accent and pronunciation but with a certain rough quality of voice and louder than english gentlemen usually speak your money is as safe as the mint my boy  evidently alice thought the stranger was an intimate friend of lord worthington she resolved to be particular in her behavior before him if introduced  lord worthington said lydia  at the sound of her voice he climbed hastily down from the step of the carriage and said in some confusion how d do miss carew lovely country and lovely weathermust agree awfully well with you plenty of leisure for study i hope  thank you i never study now will you make a book for me at ascot  he laughed and shook his head i am ashamed of my low tastes he said but i havent the heap to distinguish myself in youreh  miss carew was saying in a low voice if your friend is my tenant introduce him to me  lord worthington hesitated looked at lucian seemed perplexed and amused at the name time and at last said  you really wish it  of course said lydia is there any reason  oh not the least in the world since you wish it he replied quickly his eyes twinkling mischievously as he turned to his companion who was standing at the carriage door admiring lydia and being himself admired by the stoker mr cashel byron miss carew  mr cashel byron raised his straw hat and reddened a little but on the whole bore himself like an eminent man who was not proud as however he seemed to have nothing to say for himself lord worthington hastened to avert silence by resuming the subject of ascot lydia listened to him and looked at her new acquaintance now that the constraint of society had banished his former expression of easy goodhumor there was something formidable in him that gave her an unaccountable thrill of pleasure the same impression of latent danger had occurred less agreeably to lucian who was affected much as he might have been by the proximity of a large dog of doubtful temper lydia thought that mr byron did not at first sight like her cousin for he was looking at him obliquely as though steadily measuring him  the group was broken up by the guard admonishing the gentlemen to take their seats farewells were exchanged and lord worthington cried take care of yourself to cashel byron who replied somewhat impatiently and with an apprehensive glance at miss carew all right all right never you fear sir then the train went off and he was left on the platform with the two ladies  we are returning to the park mr cashel byron said lydia  so am i said he perhaps here he broke down and looked at alice to avoid lydias eye then they went out together  when they had walked some distance in silence alice looking rigidly before her recollecting with suspicion that he had just addressed lord worthington as sir while lydia was admiring his light step and perfect balance which made him seem like a man of cork he said  i saw you in the park yesterday and i thought you were a ghost but my traimy man i meansaw you too i knew by that that you were genuine  strange said lydia i had the same fancy about you  what you had he exclaimed looking at her while thus unmindful of his steps he stumbled and recovered himself with a stifled oath then he became very red and remarked that it was a warm evening  miss goff whom he had addressed assented i hope she added that you are better  he looked puzzled concluding after consideration that she had referred to his stumble he said  thank you i didnt hurt myself  lord worthington has been telling us about you said lydia he recoiled evidently deeply mortified she hastened to add he mentioned that you had come down here to recruit your health that is all  cashels features relaxed into a curious smile but presently he became suspicious and said anxiously he didnt tell you anything else about me did he  alice stared at him superciliously lydia replied no nothing else  i thought you might have heard my name somewhere he persisted  perhaps i have but i cannot recall in what connection why do you know any friend of mine  oh no only lord worthington  i conclude then that you are celebrated and that i have the misfortune not to know it mr cashel byron is it so  not a bit of it he replied hastily theres no reason why you should ever have heard of me i am much obliged to you for your kind inquiries he continued turning to alice im quite well now thank you the country has set me right again  alice who was beginning to have her doubts of mr byron in spite of his familiarity with lord worthington smiled falsely and drew herself up a little he turned away from her hurt by her manner and so ill able to conceal his feelings that miss carew who was watching him set him down privately as the most inept dissimulator she had ever met he looked at lydia wistfully as if trying to read her thoughts which now seemed to be with the setting sun or in some equally beautiful and mysterious region but he could see that there was no reflection of miss goffs scorn in her face  and so you really took me for a ghost he said  yes i thought at first that you were a statue  a statue  you do not seem flattered by that  it is not flattering to be taken for a lump of stone he replied ruefully  lydia looked at him thoughtfully here was a man whom she had mistaken for the finest image of manly strength and beauty in the world and he was so devoid of artistic culture that he held a statue to be a distasteful lump of stone  i believe i was trespassing then she said but i did so unintentionally i had gone astray for i am comparatively a stranger here and cannot find my way about the park yet  it didnt matter a bit said cashel impetuously come as often as you want mellish fancies that if any one gets a glimpse of me he wont get any odds you see he would like people to think cashel checked himself and added in some confusion mellish is mad thats about where it is  alice glanced significantly at lydia she had already suggested that madness was the real reason of the seclusion of the tenants at the warren cashel saw the glance and intercepted it by turning to her and saying with an attempt at conversational ease  how do you young ladies amuse yourselves in the country do you play billiards ever  no said alice indignantly the question she thought implied that she was capable of spending her evenings on the first floor of a publichouse to her surprise lydia remarked  i playa little i do not care sufficiently for the game to make myself proficient you were equipped for lawntennis i think when i saw you yesterday miss goff is a celebrated lawntennis player she vanquished the australian champion last year  it seemed that byron after all was something of a courtier for he displayed great astonishment at this feat the australian champion he repeated and who may heoh you mean the lawntennis champion to be sure well miss goff i congratulate you it is not every amateur that can brag of having shown a professional to a back seat  alice outraged by the imputation of bragging and certain that slang was vulgar whatever billiards might be bore herself still more loftily and resolved to snub him explicitly if he addressed her again but he did not for they presently came to a narrow iron gate in the wall of the park at which lydia stopped  let me open it for you said cashel she gave him the key and he seized one of the bars of the gate with his left hand and stooped as though he wanted to look into the keyhole yet he opened it smartly enough  alice was about to pass in with a cool bow when she saw miss carew offer cashel her hand whatever lydia did was done so well that it seemed the right thing to do he took it timidly and gave it a little shake not daring to meet her eyes alice put out her hand stiffly cashel immediately stepped forward with his right foot and enveloped her fingers with the hardest clump of knuckles she had ever felt glancing down at this remarkable fist she saw that it was discolored almost to blackness then she went in through the gate followed by lydia who turned to close it behind her as she pushed cashel standing outside grasped a bar and pulled she at once relinquished to him the labor of shutting the gate and smiled her thanks as she turned away but in that moment he plucked up courage to look at her the sensation of being so looked at was quite novel to her and very curious she was even a little out of countenance but not so much so as cashel who nevertheless could not take his eyes away  do you think said alice as they crossed the orchard that that man is a gentleman  how can i possibly tell we hardly know him  but what do you think there is always a certain something about a gentleman that one recognizes by instinct  is there i have never observed it  have you not said alice surprised and beginning uneasily to fear that her superior perception of gentility was in some way the effect of her social inferiority to miss carew i thought one could always tell  perhaps so said lydia for my own part i have found the same varieties of address in every class some people enjoy a native distinction and grace of manner  that is what i mean said alice  but they are seldom ladies and gentlemen often actors gypsies and celtic or foreign peasants undoubtedly one can make a fair guess but not in the case of this mr cashel byron are you curious about him  i exclaimed alice superbly not in the least  i am he interests me i seldom see anything novel in humanity and he is a very singular man  i meant said alice crestfallen that i take no special interest in him  lydia not being curious as to the exact degree of alices interest merely nodded and continued he may as you suppose be a man of humble origin who has seen something of society or he may be a gentleman unaccustomed to society probably the latter i feel no conviction either way  but he speaks very roughly and his slang is disgusting his hands are hard and quite black did you not notice them  i noticed it all and i think that if he were a man of low condition he would be careful not to use slang selfmade persons are usually precise in their language they rarely violate the written laws of society besides his pronunciation of some words is so distinct that an idea crossed me once that he might be an actor but then it is not uniformly distinct i am sure that he has some object or occupation in life he has not the air of an idler yet i have thought of all the ordinary professions and he does not fit one of them this is perhaps what makes him interesting he is unaccountable  he must have some position he was very familiar with lord worthington  lord worthington is a sportsman and is familiar with all sorts of people  yes but surely he would not let a jockey or anybody of that class put his arm round his neck as we saw mr byron do  that is true said lydia thoughtfully still she added clearing her brow and laughing i am loath to believe that he is an invalid student  i will tell you what he is said alice suddenly he is companion and keeper to the man with whom he lives do you recollect his saying mellish is mad  that is possible said lydia at all events we have got a topic and that is an important home comfort in the country  just then they reached the castle lydia lingered for a moment on the terrace the gothic chimneys of the warren lodge stood up against the long crimson cloud into which the sun was sinking she smiled as if some quaint idea had occurred to her raised her eyes for a moment to the blackmarble egyptian gazing with unwavering eyes into the sky and followed alice indoors  later on when it was quite dark cashel sat in a spacious kitchen at the lodge thinking his companion who had laid his coat aside was at the fire smoking and watching a saucepan that simmered there he broke the silence by remarking after a glance at the clock time to go to roost  time to go to the devil said cashel i am going out  yes and get a chill not if i know it you dont  well go to bed yourself and then you wont know it i want to take a walk round the place  if you put your foot outside that door tonight lord worthington will lose his five hundred pounds you cant lick any one in fifteen minutes if you train on night air get licked yourself more likely  will you bet two to one that i dont stay out all night and knock the flying dutchman out of time in the first round afterwards eh  come said mellish coaxingly have some commonsense im advising you for your good  suppose i dont want to be advised for my good eh hand me over that lemon you neednt start a speech im not going to eat it  blest if he aint rubbing his ands with it exclaimed mellish after watching him for some moments why you bloomin fool lemon wont arden your ands aint i took enough trouble with them  i want to whiten them said cashel impatiently throwing the lemon under the grate but its no use i cant go about with my fists like a niggers ill go up to london tomorrow and buy a pair of gloves  what real gloves wearin gloves  you thundering old lunatic said cashel rising and putting on his hat is it likely that i want a pair of mufflers perhaps you think you could teach me something with them ha ha bythebyenow mind this mellishdont let it out down here that im a fighting man do you hear  me let it out cried mellish indignantly is it likely now i asts you cashel byron is it likely  likely or not dont do it said cashel you might get talking with some of the chaps about the castle stables they are generous with their liquor when they can get sporting news for it  mellish looked at him reproachfully and cashel turned towards the door this movement changed the trainers sense of injury into anxiety he renewed his remonstrances as to the folly of venturing into the night air and cited many examples of pugilists who had suffered defeat in consequence of neglecting the counsel of their trainers cashel expressed his disbelief in these anecdotes in brief and personal terms and at last mellish had to content himself with proposing to limit the duration of the walk to half an hour  perhaps i will come back in half an hour said cashel and perhaps i wont  well look here said mellish we wont quarrel about a minute or two but i feel the want of a walk myself and ill come with you  im dd if you shall said cashel here let me out and shut up im not going further than the park i have no intention of making a night of it in the village which is what you are afraid of i know you you old dodger if you dont get out of my way ill seat you on the fire  but duty cashel duty pleaded mellish persuasively every man oughter do his duty consider your duty to your backers  are you going to get out of my way or must i put you out of it said cashel reddening ominously  mellish went back to his chair bowed his head on his hands and wept id sooner be a dog nor a trainer he exclaimed oh the cusseduess of bein shut up for weeks with a fightin man for the fust two days theyre as sweet as treacle and then their con trairyness comes out their tempers is puffict ell  cashel additionally enraged by a sting of remorse went out and slammed the door he made straight towards the castle and watched its windows for nearly half an hour keeping in constant motion so as to avert a chill at last an exquisitely toned bell struck the hour from one of the minarets to cashel accustomed to the coarse jangling of ordinary english bells the sound seemed to belong to fairyland he went slowly back to the warren lodge and found his trainer standing at the open door smoking and anxiously awaiting his return cashel rebuffed certain conciliatory advances with a haughty reserve more dignified but much less acceptable to mr mellish than his former profane familiarity and went contemplatively to bed       chapter iv      one morning miss carew sat on the bank of a great pool in the park throwing pebbles two by two into the water and intently watching the intersection of the circles they made on its calm surface alice was seated on a campstool a little way off sketching the castle which appeared on an eminence to the southeast the woodland rose round them like the sides of an amphitheatre but the trees did not extend to the waters edge where there was an ample margin of bright greensward and a narrow belt of gravel from which lydia was picking her pebbles  presently hearing a footstep she looked back and saw cashel byron standing behind alice apparently much interested in her drawing he was dressed as she had last seen him except that he wore primrose gloves and an egyptian red scarf alice turned and surveyed him with haughty surprise but he made nothing of her looks and she after glancing at lydia to reassure herself that she was not alone bade him goodmorning and resumed her work  queer place he remarked after a pause alluding to the castle chinese looking isnt it  it is considered a very fine building said alice  oh hang what it is considered said cashel what is it that is the point to look to  it is a matter of taste said alice very coldly  mr cashel byron  cashel started and hastened to the bank how dye do miss carew he said i didnt see you until you called me she looked at him and he convicted of a foolish falsehood quailed there is a splendid view of the castle from here he continued to change the subject miss goff and i have just been talking about it  yes do you admire it  very much indeed it is a beautiful place every one must acknowledge that  it is considered kind to praise my house to me and to ridicule it to other people you do not say hang what it is considered now  cashel with an unaccustomed sense of getting the worst of an encounter almost lost heart to reply then he brightened and said i can tell you how that is as far as being a place to sketch or for another person to look at it is chinese enough but somehow your living in it makes a difference that is what i meant upon my soul it is  lydia smiled but he looking down at her did not see the smile because of her coronet of red hair which seemed to flame in the sunlight the obstruction was unsatisfactory to him he wanted to see her face he hesitated and then sat down on the ground beside her cautiously as if getting into a very hot bath  i hope you wont mind my sitting here he said timidly it seems rude to talk down at you from a height  she shook her head and threw two more stones into the pool he could think of nothing further to say and as she did not speak but gravely watched the circles in the water he began to stare at them too and they sat in silence for some minutes steadfastly regarding the waves she as if there were matter for infinite thought in them and he as though the spectacle wholly confounded him at last she said  have you ever realized what a vibration is  no said cashel after a blank look at her  i am glad to hear you make that admission science has reduced everything nowadays to vibration light sound sensationall the mysteries of nature are either vibrations or interference of vibrations there she said throwing another pair of pebbles in and pointing to the two sets of widening rings as they overlapped one another the twinkling of a star and the pulsation in a chord of music are that but i cannot picture the thing in my own mind i wonder whether the hundreds of writers of textbooks on physics who talk so glibly of vibrations realize them any better than i do  not a bit of it not one of them not half so well said cashel cheerfully replying to as much of her speech as he understood  perhaps the subject does not interest you she said turning to him  on the contrary i like it of all things said he boldly  i can hardly say so much for my own interest in it i am told that you are a student mr cashel byron what are your favorite studiesor rather since that is generally a hard question to answer what are your pursuits  alice listened  cashel looked doggedly at lydia and his color slowly deepened i am a professor he said  a professor of what i know i should ask of where but that would only elicit the name of a college which would convey no real information to me  i am a professor of science said cashel in a low voice looking down at his left fist which he was balancing in the air before him and stealthily hitting his bent knee as if it were another persons face  physical or moral science persisted lydia  physical science said cashel but theres more moral science in it than people think  yes said lydia seriously though i have no real knowledge of physics i can appreciate the truth of that perhaps all the science that is not at bottom physical science is only pretentious nescience i have read much of physics and have often been tempted to learn something of themto make the experiments with my own handsto furnish a laboratoryto wield the scalpel even for to master science thoroughly i believe one must take ones gloves off is that your opinion  cashel looked hard at her you never spoke a truer word he said but you can become a very respectable amateur by working with the gloves  i never should the many who believe they are the wiser for reading accounts of experiments deceive themselves it is as impossible to learn science from theory as to gain wisdom from proverbs ah it is so easy to follow a line of argument and so difficult to grasp the facts that underlie it our popular lecturers on physics present us with chains of deductions so highly polished that it is a luxury to let them slip from end to end through our fingers but they leave nothing behind but a vague memory of the sensation they afforded excuse me for talking figuratively i perceive that you affect the oppositea reaction on your part i suppose against tall talk and fine writing pray should i ever carry out my intention of setting to work in earnest at science will you give me some lessons  well said cashel with a covert grin i would rather you came to me than to another professor but i dont think it would suit you i should like to try my hand on your friend there shes stronger and straighter than nine out of ten men  you set a high value on physical qualifications then so do i  only from a practical point of view mind you said cashel earnestly it isnt right to be always looking at men and women as you would at horses if you want to back them in a race or in a fight thats one thing but if you want a friend or a sweetheart thats another  quite so said lydia smiling you do not wish to commit yourself to any warmer feeling towards miss goff than a critical appreciation of her form and condition  just that said cashel satisfied you understand me miss carew there are some people that you might talk to all day and theyd be no wiser at the end of it than they were at the beginning youre not one of that sort  i wonder do we ever succeed really in communicating our thoughts to one another a thought must take a new shape to fit itself into a strange mind you mr professor must have acquired special experience of the incommunicability of ideas in the course of your lectures and lessons  cashel looked uneasily at the water and said in a lower voice of course you may call me just whatever you like butif its all the same to youi wish you wouldnt call me professor  i have lived so much in countries where professors expect to be addressed by their titles on all occasions that i may claim to be excused for having offended on that point thank you for telling me but i am to blame for discussing science with you lord worthington told us that you had come down here expressly to escape from itto recruit yourself after an excess of work  it doesnt matter said cashel  i have not done harm enough to be greatly concerned but i will not offend again to change the subject let us look at miss goffs sketch  miss carew had hardly uttered this suggestion when cashel in a businesslike manner and without the slightest air of gallantry expertly lifted her and placed her on her feet this unexpected attention gave her a shock followed by a thrill that was not disagreeable she turned to him with a faint mantling on her cheeks he was looking with contracted brows at the sky as though occupied with some calculation  thank you she said but pray do not do that again it is a little humiliating to be lifted like a child you are very strong  there is not much strength needed to lift such a featherweight as you seven stone two i should judge you to be about but theres a great art in doing these things properly i have often had to carry off a man of fourteen stone resting him all the time as if he was in bed  ah said lydia i see you have had some hospital practice i have often admired the skill with which trained nurses handle their patients  cashel made no reply but with a sinister grin followed her to where alice sat  it is very foolish of me i know said alice presently but i never can draw when any one is looking at me  you fancy that everybody is thinking about how youre doing it said cashel encouragingly thats always the way with amateurs but the truth is that not a soul except yourself is a bit concerned about it excuse me he added taking up the drawing and proceeding to examine it leisurely  please give me my sketch mr byron she said her cheeks red with anger puzzled he turned to lydia for an explanation while alice seized the sketch and packed it in her portfolio  it is getting rather warm said lydia shall we return to the castle  i think we had better said alice trembling with resentment as she walked away quickly leaving lydia alone with cashel who presently exclaimed  what in thunder have i done  you have made an inconsiderate remark with unmistakable sincerity  i only tried to cheer her up she must have mistaken what i said  i think not do you believe that young ladies like to be told that there is no occasion for them to be ridiculously selfconscious  i say that ill take my oath i never said anything of the sort  you worded it differently but you assured her that she need not object to have her drawing overlooked as it is of no importance to any one  well if she takes offence at that she must be a born fool some people cant bear to be told anything but they soon get all that thinskinned nonsense knocked out of them  have you any sisters mr cashel byron  no why  or a mother  i have a mother but i havent seen her for years and i dont much care if i never see her it was through her that i came to be what i am  are you then dissatisfied with your profession  noi dont mean that i am always saying stupid things  yes that comes of your ignorance of a sex accustomed to have its silliness respected you will find it hard to keep on good terms with my friend without some further study of womanly ways  as to her i wont give in that im wrong unless i am wrong the truths the truth  not even to please miss goff  not even to please you youd only think the worse of me afterwards  quite true and quite right said lydia cordially goodbye mr cashel byron i must rejoin miss goff  i suppose you will take her part if she keeps a down on me for what i said to her  what is a down a grudge  yes something of that sort  colonial is it not pursued lydia with the air of a philologist  yes i believe i picked it up in the colonies then he added sullenly i suppose i shouldnt use slang in speaking to you i beg your pardon  i do not object to it on the contrary it interests me for example i have just learned from it that you have been in australia  so i have but are you out with me because i annoyed miss goff  by no means nevertheless i sympathize with her annoyance at the manner if not the matter of your rebuke  i cant for the life of me see what there was in what i said to raise such a fuss about i wish you would give me a nudge whenever you see me making a fool of myself i will shut up at once and ask no questions  so that it will be understood that my nudge means shut up mr cashel byron you are making a fool of yourself  just so you understand me i told you that before didnt i  i am afraid said lydia her face bright with laughter that i cannot take charge of your manners until we are a little better acquainted  he seemed disappointed then his face clouded and he began if you regard it as a liberty  of course i regard it as a liberty she said neatly interrupting him is not my own conduct a sufficient charge upon my attention why should i voluntarily assume that of a strong man and learned professor as well  by jingo exclaimed cashel with sudden excitement i dont care what you say to me you have a way of giving things a turn that makes it a pleasure to be shut up by you and if i were a gentleman as i ought to be instead of a poor devil of a professional pug i would he recollected himself and turned quite pale there was a pause  let me remind you said lydia composedly though she too had changed color at the beginning of his outburst that we are both wanted elsewhere at present i by miss goff and you by your servant who has been hovering about us and looking at you anxiously for some minutes  cashel turned fiercely and saw mellish standing a little way off sulkily watching him lydia took the opportunity and left the place as she retreated she could hear that they were at high words together but she could not distinguish what they were saying fortunately so for their language was villainous  she found alice in the library seated bolt upright in a chair that would have tempted a goodhumored person to recline lydia sat down in silence alice presently looking at her discovered that she was in a fit of noiseless laughter the effect in contrast to her habitual selfpossession was so strange that alice almost forgot to be offended  i am glad to see that it is not hard to amuse you she said  lydia waited to recover herself thoroughly and then replied i have not laughed so three times in my life now alice put aside your resentment of our neighbors impudence for the moment and tell me what you think of him  i have not thought about him at all i assure you said alice disdainfully  then think about him for a moment to oblige me and let me know the result  really you have had much more opportunity of judging than i i have hardly spoken to him  lydia rose patiently and went to the bookcase you have a cousin at one of the universities have you not she said seeking along the shelf for a volume  yes replied alice speaking very sweetly to atone for her want of amiability on the previous subject  then perhaps you know something of university slang  i never allow him to talk slang to me said alice quickly  you may dictate modes of expression to a single man perhaps but not to a whole university said lydia with a quiet scorn that brought unexpected tears to alices eyes do you know what a pug is  a pug said alice vacantly no i have heard of a bulldoga proctors bulldog but never a pug  i must try my slang dictionary said lydia taking down a book and opening it here it is puga fighting mans idea of the contracted word to be produced from pugilist what an extraordinary definition a fighting mans idea of a contraction why should a man have a special idea of a contraction when he is fighting or why should he think of such a thing at all under such circumstances perhaps fighting man is slang too no it is not given here either i mistook the word or it has some signification unknown to the compiler of my dictionary  it seems quite plain to me said alice pug means pugilist  but pugilism is boxing it is not a profession i suppose all men are more or less pugilists i want a sense of the word in which it denotes a calling or occupation of some kind i fancy it means a demonstrator of anatomy however it does not matter  where did you meet with it  mr byron used it just now  do you really like that man said alice returning to the subject more humbly than she had quitted it  so far i do not dislike him he puzzles me if the roughness of his manner is an affectation i have never seen one so successful before  perhaps he does not know any better his coarseness did not strike me as being affected at all  i should agree with you but for one or two remarks that fell from him they showed an insight into the real nature of scientific knowledge and an instinctive sense of the truths underlying words which i have never met with except in men of considerable culture and experience i suspect that his manner is deliberately assumed in protest against the selfish vanity which is the common source of social polish it is partly natural no doubt he seems too impatient to choose his words heedfully do you ever go to the theatre  no said alice taken aback by this apparent irrelevance my father disapproved of it but i was there once i saw the lady of lyons  there is a famous actress adelaide gisborne  it was she whom i saw as the lady of lyons she did it beautifully  did mr byron remind you of her  alice stared incredulously at lydia i do not think there can be two people in the world less like one another she said  nor do i said lydia meditatively but i think their dissimilarity owes its emphasis to some lurking likeness otherwise how could he have reminded me of her lydia as she spoke sat down with a troubled expression as if trying to unravel her thoughts and yet she added presently my theatrical associations are so complex that a long silence ensued during which alice conscious of some unusual stir in her patroness watched her furtively and wondered what would happen next  alice  yes  my mind is exercising itself in spite of me on small and impertinent mattersa sure symptom of failing mental health my presence here is only one of several attempts that i have made to live idly since my fathers death they have all failed work has become necessary to me i will go to london tomorrow  alice looked up in dismay for this seemed equivalent to a dismissal but her face expressed nothing but polite indifference  we shall have time to run through all the follies of the season before june when i hope to return here and set to work at a book i have planned i must collect the material for it in london if i leave town before the season is over and you are unwilling to come away with me i can easily find some one who will take care of you as long as you please to stay i wish it were june already  alice preferred lydias womanly impatience to her fatalistic calm it relieved her sense of inferiority which familiarity had increased rather than diminished yet she was beginning to persuade herself with some success that the propriety of lydias manners was at least questionable that morning miss carew had not scrupled to ask a man what his profession was and this at least alice congratulated herself on being too wellbred to do she had quite lost her awe of the servants and had begun to address them with an unconscious haughtiness and a conscious politeness that were making the word upstart common in the servants hall bashville the footman had risked his popularity there by opining that miss goff was a fine young woman  bashville was in his twentyfourth year and stood five feet ten in his stockings at the sign of the green man in the village he was known as a fluent orator and keen political debater in the stables he was deferred to as an authority on sporting affairs and an expert wrestler in the cornish fashion the women servants regarded him with undissembled admiration they vied with one another in inventing expressions of delight when he recited before them which as he had a good memory and was fond of poetry he often did they were proud to go out walking with him but his attentions never gave rise to jealousy for it was an open secret in the servants hall that he loved his mistress he had never said anything to that effect and no one dared allude to it in his presence much less rally him on his weakness but his passion was well known for all that and it seemed by no means so hopeless to the younger members of the domestic staff as it did to the cook the butler and bashville himself miss carew who knew the value of good servants appreciated her footmans smartness and paid him accordingly but she had no suspicion that she was waited on by a versatile young student of poetry and public affairs distinguished for his gallantry his personal prowess his eloquence and his influence on local politics  it was bashville who now entered the library with a salver which he proffered to alice saying the gentleman is waiting in the round drawingroom miss  alice took the gentlemans card and read mr wallace parker  oh she said with vexation glancing at bashville as if to divine his impression of the visitor my cousinthe one we were speaking of just nowhas come to see me  how fortunate said lydia he will tell me the meaning of pug ask him to lunch with us  you would not care for him said alice he is not much used to society i suppose i had better go and see him  miss carew did not reply being plainly at a loss to understand how there could be any doubt about the matter alice went to the round drawingroom where she found mr parker examining a trophy of indian armor and presenting a back view of a short gentleman in a spruce blue frockcoat a new hat and pair of gloves were also visible as he stood looking upward with his hands behind him when he turned to greet alice lie displayed a face expressive of resolute selfesteem with eyes whose watery brightness together with the bareness of his temples from which the hair was worn away suggested late hours and either very studious or very dissipated habits he advanced confidently pressed alices hand warmly for several seconds and placed a chair for her without noticing the marked coldness with which she received his attentions  i was surprised alice he said when he had seated himself opposite to her to learn from aunt emily that you had come to live here without consulting me i  consult you she said contemptuously interrupting him i never heard of such a thing why should i consult you as to my movements  well i should not have used the word consult particularly to such an independent little lady as sweet alice goff still i think you mightmerely as a matter of form you knowhave informed me of the step you were taking the relations that exist between us give me a right to your confidence  what relations pray  what relations he repeated with reproachful emphasis  yes what relations  he rose and addressed her with tender solemnity alice he began i have proposed to you at least six times  and have i accepted you once  hear me to the end alice i know that you have never explicitly accepted me but it has always been understood that my needy circumstances were the only obstacle to our happiness wedont interrupt me alice you little know whats coming that obstacle no longer exists i have been made second master at sunbury college with three hundred and fifty pounds a year a house coals and gas in the course of time i shall undoubtedly succeed to the head mastershipa splendid position worth eight hundred pounds a year you are now free from the troubles that have pressed so hard upon you since your fathers death and you can quit at oncenowinstantly your dependent position here  thank you i am very comfortable here i am staying on a visit with miss carew  silence ensued and he sat down slowly then she added i am exceedingly glad that you have got something good at last it must be a great relief to your poor mother  i fancied alicethough it may have been only fancyi fancied that your mother was colder than usual in her manner this morning i hope that the luxuries of this palatial mansion are powerless to corrupt your heart i cannot lead you to a castle and place crowds of liveried servants at your beck and call but i can make you mistress of an honorable english home independent of the bounty of strangers you can never be more than a lady alice  it is very good of you to lecture me i am sure  you might be serious with me he said rising in illhumor and walking a little way down the room  i think the offer of a mans hand ought to be received with respect  oh i did not quite understand i thought we agreed that you are not to make me that offer every time we meet  it was equally understood that the subject was only deferred until i should be in a position to resume it without binding you to a long engagement that time has come now and i expect a favorable answer at last i am entitled to one considering how patiently i have waited for it  for my part wallace i must say i do not think it wise for you to think of marrying with only three hundred and fifty pounds a year  with a house remember that and coals and gas you are becoming very prudent now that you live with miss whatshername here i fear you no longer love me alice  i never said i loved you at any time  pshaw you never said so perhaps but you always gave me to understand that  i did nothing of the sort wallace and i wont have you say so  in short he retorted bitterly you think you will pick up some swell here who will be a better bargain than i am  wallace how dare you  you hurt my feelings alice and i speak out i know how to behave myself quite as well as those who have the entree here but when my entire happiness is at stake i do not stand on punctilio therefore i insist on a straightforward answer to my fair honorable proposal  wallace said alice with dignity i will not be forced into giving an answer against my will i regard you as a cousin  i do not wish to be regarded as a cousin have i ever regarded you as a cousin  and do you suppose wallace that i should permit you to call me by my christian name and be as familiar as we have always been together if you were not my cousin if so you must have a very strange opinion of me  i did not think that luxury could so corrupt  you said that before said alice pettishly do not keep repeating the same thing over and over you know it is one of your bad habits will you stay to lunch miss carew told me to ask you  indeed miss carew is very kind please inform her that i am deeply honored and that i feel quite disturbed at being unable to accept her patronage  alice poised her head disdainfully no doubt it amuses you to make yourself ridiculous she said but i must say i do not see any occasion for it  i am sorry that my behavior is not sufficiently good for you you never found any cause to complain of it when our surroundings were less aristocratic i am quite ashamed of taking so much of your valuable time goodmorning  goodmorning but i do not see why you are in such a rage  i am not in a rage i am only grieved to find that you are corrupted by luxury i thought your principles were higher goodmorning miss goff i shall not have the pleasure of seeing you again in this very choice mansion  are you really going wallace said alice rising  yes why should i stay  she rang the bell greatly disconcerting him for he had expected her to detain him and make advances for a reconciliation before they could exchange more words bashville entered  goodbye said alice politely  goodbye he replied through his teeth he walked loftily out passing bashville with marked scorn  he had left the house and was descending the terrace steps when he was overtaken by the footman who said civilly  beg your pardon sir youve forgotten this i think and he handed him a walkingstick  parkers first idea was that his stick had attracted the mans attention by the poor figure it made in the castle hall and that bashville was requesting him with covert superciliousness to remove his property on second thoughts his selfesteem rejected this suspicion as too humiliating but he resolved to show bashville that he had a gentleman to deal with so he took the stick and instead of thanking bashville handed him five shillings  bashville smiled and shook his head oh no sir he said thank you all the same those are not my views  the more fool you said parker pocketing the coins and turning away  bashvilles countenance changed come come sir he said following parker to the foot of the stops fair words deserve fair words i am no more a fool than you are a gentleman should know his place as well as a servant  oh go to the devil muttered parker turning very red and hurrying away  if you werent my mistresss guest said bashville looking menacingly after him id send you to bed for a week for sending me to the devil       chapter v      miss carew remorselessly carried out her intention of going to london where she took a house in regents park to the disappointment of alice who had hoped to live in mayfair or at least in south kensington but lydia set great store by the high northerly ground and open air of the park and alice found almost perfect happiness in driving through london in a fine carriage and fine clothes she liked that better than concerts of classical music which she did not particularly relish or even than the opera to which they went often the theatres pleased her more though the amusements there were tamer than she had expected society was delightful to her because it was real london society she acquired a mania for dancing went out every night and seemed to herself far more distinguished and attractive than she had ever been in wiltstoken where she had nevertheless held a sufficiently favorable opinion of her own manners and person  lydia did not share all these dissipations she easily procured invitations and chaperones for alice who wondered why so intelligent a woman would take the trouble to sit out a stupid concert and then go home just as the real pleasure of the evening was beginning  one saturday morning at breakfast lydia said  your late hours begin to interfere with the freshness of your complexion alice i am getting a little fatigued myself with literary work i will go to the crystal palace today and wander about the gardens for a while there is to be a concert in the afternoon for the benefit of madame szczymplica whose playing you do not admire will you come with me  of course said alice resolutely dutiful  of choice not of course said lydia are you engaged for tomorrow evening  sunday oh no besides i consider all my engagements subject to your convenience  there was a pause long enough for this assurance to fall perfectly flat alice bit her lip then lydia said do you know mrs hoskyn  mrs hoskyn who gives sunday evenings shall we go there said alice eagerly people often ask me whether i have been at one of them but i dont know herthough i have seen her is she nice  she is a young woman who has read a great deal of art criticism and been deeply impressed by it she has made her house famous by bringing there all the clever people she meets and making them so comfortable that they take care to come again but she has not fortunately for her allowed her craze for art to get the better of her commonsense she married a prosperous man of business who probably never read anything but a newspaper since he left school and there is probably not a happier pair in england  i presume she had sense enough to know that she could not afford to choose said alice complacently she is very ugly  do you think so she has many admirers and was i am told engaged to mr herbert the artist before she met mr hoskyn we shall meet mr herbert there tomorrow and a number of celebrated persons besideshis wife madame szczymplica the pianiste owen jack the composer hawkshaw the poet conolly the inventor and others the occasion will be a special one as herr abendgasse a remarkable german socialist and art critic is to deliver a lecture on the true in art be careful in speaking of him in society to refer to him as a sociologist and not as a socialist are you particularly anxious to hear him lecture  no doubt it will be very interesting said alice i should not like to miss the opportunity of going to mrs hoskyns people so often ask me whether i have been there and whether i know this that and the other celebrated person that i feel quite embarrassed by my rustic ignorance  because pursued lydia i had intended not to go until after the lecture herr abendgasse is enthusiastic and eloquent but not original and as i have imbibed all his ideas direct from their inventors i do not feel called upon to listen to his exposition of them so that unless you are specially interested  not at all if he is a socialist i should much rather not listen to him particularly on sunday evening  so it was arranged that they should go to mrs hoskyns after the lecture meanwhile they went to sydenham where alice went through the crystal palace with provincial curiosity and lydia answered her questions encyclopedically in the afternoon there was a concert at which a band played several long pieces of music which lydia seemed to enjoy though she found fault with the performers alice able to detect neither the faults in the execution nor the beauty of the music did as she saw the others dopretended to be pleased and applauded decorously madame szczymplica whom she expected to meet at mrs hoskyns appeared and played a fantasia for pianoforte and orchestra by the famous jack another of mrs hoskyns circle there was in the programme an analysis of this composition from which alice learned that by attentively listening to the adagio she could hear the angels singing therein she listened as attentively as she could but heard no angels and was astonished when at the conclusion of the fantasia the audience applauded madame szczymplica as if she had made them hear the music of the spheres even lydia seemed moved and said  strange that she is only a woman like the rest of us with just the same narrow bounds to her existence and just the same prosaic caresthat she will go by train to victoria and from thence home in a common vehicle instead of embarking in a great shell and being drawn by swans to some enchanted island her playing reminds me of myself as i was when i believed in fairyland and indeed knew little about any other land  they say said alice that her husband is very jealous and that she leads him a terrible life  they say anything that brings gifted people to the level of their own experience doubtless they are right i have not met mr herbert but i have seen his pictures which suggest that he reads everything and sees nothing for they all represent scenes described in some poem if one could only find an educated man who had never read a book what a delightful companion he would be  when the concert was over they did not return directly to town as lydia wished to walk awhile in the gardens in consequence when they left sydenham they got into a waterloo train and so had to change at clapham junction it was a fine summer evening and alice though she thought that it became ladies to hide themselves from the public in waitingrooms at railway stations did not attempt to dissuade lydia from walking to and fro at an unfrequented end of the platform which terminated in a bank covered with flowers  to my mind said lydia clapham junction is one of the prettiest places about london  indeed said alice a little maliciously i thought that all artistic people looked on junctions and railway lines as blots on the landscape  some of them do said lydia but they are not the artists of our generation and those who take up their cry are no better than parrots if every holiday recollection of my youth every escape from town to country be associated with the railway i must feel towards it otherwise than did my father upon whose middle age it came as a monstrous iron innovation the locomotive is one of the wonders of modern childhood children crowd upon a bridge to see the train pass beneath little boys strut along the streets puffing and whistling in imitation of the engine all that romance silly as it looks becomes sacred in afterlife besides when it is not underground in a foul london tunnel a train is a beautiful thing its pure white fleece of steam harmonizes with every variety of landscape and its sound have you ever stood on a seacoast skirted by a railway and listened as the train came into hearing in the far distance at first it can hardly be distinguished from the noise of the sea then you recognize it by its vibration one moment smothered in a deep cutting and the next sent echoing from some hillside sometimes it runs smoothly for many minutes and then breaks suddenly into a rhythmic clatter always changing in distance and intensity when it comes near you should get into a tunnel and stand there while it passes i did that once and it was like the last page of an overture by beethoventhunderingly impetuous i cannot conceive how any person can hope to disparage a train by comparing it with a stagecoach and i know something of stagecoachesor at least of diligences their effect on the men employed about them ought to decide the superiority of steam without further argument i have never observed an enginedriver who did not seem an exceptionally intelligent mechanic while the very writers and artists who have preserved the memory of the coaching days for us do not appear to have taken coachmen seriously or to have regarded them as responsible and civilized men abuse of the railway from a pastoral point of view is obsolete there are millions of grown persons in england to whom the far sound of the train is as pleasantly suggestive as the piping of a blackbird againis not that lord worthington getting out of the train yes that one at the third platform from this heshe stopped  alice looked but could see neither lord worthington nor the cause of a subtle but perceptible change in lydia who said quickly  he is probably coming to our train come to the waitingroom she walked swiftly along the platform as she spoke alice hurried after her and they had but just got into the room the door of which was close to the staircase which gave access to the platform when a coarse din of mens voices showed that a noisy party were ascending the steps presently a man emerged reeling and at once began to execute a drunken dance and to sing as well as his condition and musical faculty allowed lydia stood near the window of the room and watched in silence alice following her example recognized the drunken dancer as mellish he was followed by three men gayly attired and highly elated but comparatively sober after them came cashel byron showily dressed in a velveteen coat and tightlyfitting fawncolored pantaloons that displayed the muscles of his legs he also seemed quite sober but he was dishevelled and his left eye blinked frequently the adjacent brow and cheek being much yellower than his natural complexion which appeared to advantage on the right side of his face walking steadily to mellish who was now asking each of the bystanders in turn to come and drink at his expense he seized him by the collar and sternly bade him cease making a fool of himself mellish tried to embrace him  my own boy he exclaimed affectionately hes my little nonpareil cashel byron again the world at catch weight bob mellishs money  you sot said cashel rolling him about until he was giddy as well as drunk and then forcing him to sit down on a bench one would think you never saw a mill or won a bet in your life before  steady byron said one of the others heres his lordship lord worthington was coming up the stairs apparently the most excited of the party  fine man he cried patting cashel on the shoulder splendid man you have won a monkey for me today and you shall have your share of it old boy  i trained him said mellish staggering forward again i trained him you know me my lord you know bob mellish a word with your lordship in cconfidence you ask who knows how to make the beef go and the muscle come you aski ask your lordships pardn whatll your lordship take  take care for heavens sake exclaimed lord worthington clutching at him as he reeled backward towards the line dont you see the train  i know said mellish gravely i am all right no man more so i am bob mellish you ask  here come out of this said one of the party a powerful man with a scarred face and crushed nose grasping mellish and thrusting him into the train yll ave to clap a beefsteak on that ogle of yours where you napped the dutchmans auctioneer byron its got more yellow paint on it than yll like to show in church tomorrow  at this they all gave a roar of laughter and entered a thirdclass carriage lydia and alice had but just time to take their places in the train before it started  eeally i must say said alice that if those were mr cashel byrons and lord worthingtons associates their tastes are very peculiar  yes said lydia almost grimly i am a fair linguist but i did not understand a single sentence of their conversation though i heard it all distinctly  they were not gentlemen said alice you say that no one can tell by a persons appearance whether he is a gentleman or not but surely you cannot think that those men are lord worthingtons equals  i do not said lydia they are ruffians and cashel byron is the most unmistakable ruffian of them all  alice awestruck did not venture to speak again until they left the train at victoria there was a crowd outside the carriage in which cashel had travelled they hastened past but lydia asked a guard whether anything was the matter he replied that a drunken man alighting from the train had fallen down upon the rails and that had the carriage been in motion he would have been killed lydia thanked her informant and as she turned from him found bashville standing before her touching his hat she had given him no instructions to attend however she accepted his presence as a matter of course and inquired whether the carriage was there  no madam replied bashville the coachman had no orders  quite right a hansom if you please when he was gone she said to alice did you tell bashville to meet us  oh dear no said alice i should not think of doing such a thing  strange however he knows his duties better than i do so i have no doubt that he has acted properly he has been waiting all the afternoon i suppose poor fellow  he has nothing else to do said alice carelessly here he is he has picked out a capital horse for us too  meanwhile mellish had been dragged from beneath the train and seated on the knee of one of his companions he was in a stupor and had a large lump on his brow his eye was almost closed the man with the crushed nose now showed himself an expert surgeon while cashel supported the patient on the knee of another man and the rest of the party kept off the crowd by mingled persuasion and violence he produced a lancet and summarily reduced the swelling by lancing it he then dressed the puncture neatly with appliances for that purpose which he carried about him and shouted in mellishs ear to rouse him but the trainer only groaned and let his head drop inert on his breast more shouting was resorted to but in vain cashel impatiently expressed an opinion that mellish was shamming and declared that he would not stand there to be fooled with all the evening  if he was my pal stead o yours said the man with the broken nose id wake him up fast enough  ill save you the trouble said cashel coolly stooping and seizing between his teeth the cartilage of the trainers ear  thats the way to do it said the other approvingly as mellish screamed and started to his feet now then up with you  he took mellishs right arm cashel took the left and they brought him away between them without paying the least heed to his tears his protestations that he was hurt his plea that he was an old man or his bitter demand as to where cashel would have been at that moment without his care  lord worthington had taken advantage of this accident to slip away from his travelling companions and drive alone to his lodgings in jermyn street he was still greatly excited and when his valet an old retainer with whom he was on familiar terms brought him a letter that had arrived during his absence he asked him four times whether any one had called and four times interrupted him by scraps of information about the splendid day he had had and the luck he was in  i bet five hundred even that it would be over in a quarter of an hour and then i bet byron two hundred and fifty to one that it wouldnt thats the way to doit eh bedford catch cashel letting two hundred and fifty slip through his fingers by george though hes an artful card at the end of fourteen minutes i thought my five hundred was corpsed the dutchman was full of fight and cashel suddenly turned weak and tried to back out of the rally you should have seen the gleam in the dutchmans eye when he rushed in after him he made cocksure of finishing him straight off  indeed my lord dear me  i should think so i was taken in by it myself it was only done to draw the poor devil by george bedford you should have seen the way cashel put in his right but you couldnt have seen it it was too quick the dutchman was asleep on the grass before he knew hed been hit byron had collected fifteen pounds for him before he came to his jaw must feel devilish queer after it by jove bedford cashel is a perfect wonder id back him for every cent i possess against any man alive he makes you feel proud of being an englishman  bedford looked on with submissive wonder as his master transfigured with enthusiasm went hastily to and fro through the room occasionally clinching his fist and smiting an imaginary dutchman the valet at last ventured to remind him that he had forgotten the letter  oh hang the letter said lord worthington its mrs hoskyns writingan invitation or some such rot here lets see it  campden hill road saturday  my dear lord worthingtoni have not forgotten my promise to obtain for you a near view of the famous mrs herbertmadame simplicita as you call her she will be with us tomorrow evening and we shall be very happy to see you then if you care to come at nine oclock herr abendgasse a celebrated german art critic and a great friend of mine will read us a paper on the true in art but i will not pay you the compliment of pretending to believe that that interests you so you may come at ten or halfpast by which hour all the serious business of the evening will be over  well there is nothing like cheek said lord worthington breaking off in his perusal these women think that because i enjoy life in a rational way i dont know the back of a picture from the front or the inside of a book from the cover i shall go at nine sharp  if any of your acquaintances take an interest in art i will gladly make them welcome could you not bring me a celebrity or two i am very anxious to have as good an audience as possible for herr abendgasse however as it is he shall have no reason to complain as i flatter myself that i have already secured a very distinguished assembly still if you can add a second illustrious name to my list by all means do so  very good mrs hoskyn said lord worthington looking cunningly at the bewildered bedford you shall have a celebritya real onenone of your mouldy old germansif i can only get him to come if any of her people dont like him they can tell him so eh bedford       chapter vi      next evening lydia and alice reached mrs hoskyns house in campden hill road a few minutes before ten oclock they found lord worthington in the front garden smoking and chatting with mr hoskyn he threw away his cigar and returned to the house with the two ladies who observed that he was somewhat flushed with wine they went into a parlor to take off their wraps leaving him at the foot of the stairs presently they heard some one come down and address him excitedly thus  worthington worthington he has begun making a speech before the whole room he got up the moment old abendgasse sat down why the deuce did you give him that glass of champagne  shshsh you dont say so come with me and let us try to get him away quietly  did you hear that said alice something must have happened  i hope so said lydia ordinarily the fault in these receptions is that nothing happens do not announce us if you please she added to the servant as they ascended the stairs since we have come late let us spare the feelings of herr abendgasse by going in as quietly as possible  they had no difficulty in entering unnoticed for mrs hoskyn considered obscurity beautiful and her rooms were but dimly lighted by two curious lanterns of pink glass within which were vaporous flames in the middle of the larger apartment was a small table covered with garnetcolored plush with a readingdesk upon it and two candles in silver candlesticks the light of which being brighter than the lanterns cast strong double shadows from a group of standing figures about the table the surrounding space was crowded with chairs occupied chiefly by ladies behind them along the wall stood a row of men among whom was lucian webber all were staring at cashel byron who was making a speech to some bearded and spectacled gentlemen at the table lydia who had never before seen him either in evening dress or quite at his ease was astonished at his bearing his eyes were sparkling his confidence overbore the company and his rough voice created the silence it broke he was in high goodhumor and marked his periods by the swing of his extended left arm while he held his right hand close to his body and occasionally pointed his remarks by slyly wagging his forefinger  executive power he was saying as lydia entered thats a very good expression gentlemen and one that i can tell you a lot about we have been told that if we want to civilize our neighbors we must do it mainly by the example of our own lives by each becoming a living illustration of the highest culture we know but what i ask is how is anybody to know that youre an illustration of culture you cant go about like a sandwich man with a label on your back to tell all the fine notions you have in your head and you may be sure no person will consider your mere appearance preferable to his own you want an executive power thats what you want suppose you walked along the street and saw a man beating a woman and setting a bad example to the roughs well you would be bound to set a good example to them and if youre men youd like to save the woman but you couldnt do it by merely living for that would be setting the bad example of passing on and leaving the poor creature to be beaten what is it that you need to know then in order to act up to your fine ideas why you want to know how to hit him when to hit him and where to hit him and then you want the nerve to go in and do it thats executive power and thats whats wanted worse than sitting down and thinking how good you are which is what this gentlemans teaching comes to after all dont you see you want executive power to set an example if you leave all that to the roughs its their example that will spread and not yours and look at the politics of it weve heard a good deal about the french tonight well theyve got executive power they know how to make a barricade and how to fight behind it when theyve made it whats the result why the french if they only knew what they wanted could have it tomorrow for the askingmores the pity that they dont know in this country we can do nothing and if the lords and the landlords or any other collection of nobs were to drive us into the sea what could we do but go theres a gentleman laughing at me for saying that but i ask him what would he do if the police or the soldiers came this evening and told him to turn out of his comfortable house into the thames tell em he wouldnt vote for their employers at the next election perhaps or if that didnt stop them tell em that hed ask his friends to do the same thats a pretty executive power no gentlemen dont let yourself be deceived by people that have staked their money against you the first thing to learn is how to fight theres no use in buying books and pictures unless you know how to keep them and your own head as well if that gentleman that laughed know how to fight and his neighbors all knew how to fight too he wouldnt need to fear police nor soldiers nor russians nor prussians nor any of the millions of men that may be let loose on him any day of the week safe though he thinks himself but says you lets have a division of labor lets not fight for ourselves but pay other men to fight for us that shows how some people when they get hold of an idea will work it to that foolish length that its wearisome to listen to them fighting is the power of selfpreservation another man cant do it for you you might as well divide the labor of eating your dinner and pay one fellow to take the beef another the beer and a third the potatoes but let us put it for the sake of argument that you do pay others to fight for you suppose some one else pays them higher and they fight a cross or turn openly against you youd have only yourself to blame for giving the executive power to money and so long as the executive power is money the poor will be kept out of their corner and fouled against the ropes whereas by what i understand the german professor wants them to have their rights therefore i say that a mans first duty is to learn to fight if he cant do that he cant set an example he cant stand up for his own rights or his neighbors he cant keep himself in bodily health and if he sees the weak illused by the strong the most he can do is to sneak away and tell the nearest policeman who most likely wont turn up until the worst of the mischief is done coming to this ladys drawingroom and making an illustration of himself wont make him feel like a man after that let me be understood though gentlemen i dont intend that you should take everything i say too exactlytoo literally as it were if you see a man beating a woman i think you should interfere on principle but dont expect to be thanked by her for it and keep your eye on her dont let her get behind you as for him just give him a good one and go away never stay to get yourself into a street fight for its low and generally turns out badly for all parties however thats only a bit of practical advice it doesnt alter the great principle that you should get an executive power when you get that youll have courage in you and whats more your courage will be of some use to you for though you may have courage by nature still if you havent executive power as well your courage will only lead you to stand up to be beaten by men that have both courage and executive power and what good does that do you people say that youre a game fellow but they wont find the stakes for you unless you can win them youd far better put your game in your pocket and throw up the sponge while you can see to do it  now on this subject of game ive something to say that will ease the professors mind on a point that he seemed anxious about i am no musician but ill just show you how a man that understands one art understands every art i made out from the gentlemans remarks that there is a man in the musical line named wagner who is what you might call a game sort of composer and that the musical fancy though they cant deny that his tunes are firstrate and that so to speak he wins his fights yet they try to make out that he wins them in an outlandish way and that he has no real science now i tell the gentleman not to mind such talk as i have just shown you his game wouldnt be any use to him without science he might have beaten a few secondraters with a rush while he was young but he wouldnt have lasted out as he has done unless he was clever as well you will find that those that run him down are either jealous or they are old stagers that are not used to his style and think that anything new must be bad just wait a bit and take my word for it theyll turn right round and swear that his style isnt new at all and that he stole it from some one they saw when they were ten years old history shows us that that is the way of such fellows in all ages as the gentleman said and he gave you beethoven as an example but an example like that dont go home to you because there isnt one man in a million that ever heard of beethoven take a man that everybody has heard ofjack randall the very same things were said of him after that you neednt go to musicians for an example the truth is that there are people in the world with that degree of envy and malice in them that they cant bear to allow a good man his merits and when they have to admit that he can do one thing they try to make out that theres something else he cant do come ill put it to you short and businesslike this german gentleman who knows all about music tells you that many pretend that this wagner has game but no science well i though i know nothing about music will bet you twentyfive pounds that theres others that allow him to be full of science but say that he has no game and that all he does comes from his head and not from his heart i will ill bet twentyfive pounds on it and let the gentleman of the house be stakeholder and the german gentleman referee eh well im glad to see that there are no takers  now well go to another little point that the gentleman forgot he recommended you to learnto make yourselves better and wiser from day to day but he didnt tell you why it is that you wont learn in spite of his advice i suppose that being a foreigner he was afraid of hurting your feelings by talking too freely to you but youre not so thinskinned as to take offence at a little plainspeaking ill be bound so i tell you straight out that the reason you wont learn is not that you dont want to be clever or that you are lazier than many that have learned a great deal but just because youd like people to think that you know everything alreadybecause youre ashamed to be seen going to school and you calculate that if you only hold your tongue and look wise youll get through life without your ignorance being found out but wheres the good of lies and pretence what does it matter if you get laughed at by a cheeky brat or two for your awkward beginnings whats the use of always thinking of how youre looking when your sense might tell you that other people are thinking about their own looks and not about yours a big boy doesnt look well on a lower form certainly but when he works his way up hell be glad he began i speak to you more particularly because youre londoners and londoners beat all creation for thinking about themselves however i dont go with the gentleman in everything he said all this struggling and striving to make the world better is a great mistake not because it isnt a good thing to improve the world if you know how to do it but because striving and struggling is the worst way you could set about doing anything it gives a man a bad style and weakens him it shows that he dont believe in himself much when i heard the professor striving and struggling so earnestly to set you to work reforming this that and the other i said to myself hes got himself to persuade as well as his audience that isnt the language of conviction whose  really sir said lucian webber who had made his way to the table i think as you have now addressed us at considerable length and as there are other persons present whose opinions probably excite as much curiosity as yours he was interrupted by a hear hear followed by no no and go on uttered in more subdued tones than are customary at public meetings but with more animation than is usually displayed in drawingrooms cashel who had been for a moment somewhat put out turned to lucian and said in a tone intended to repress but at the same time humor his impatience dont you be in a hurry sir you shall have your turn presently perhaps i may tell you something you dont know before i stop then he turned again to the company and resumed  we were talking about effort when this young gentleman took it upon himself to break the ring now nothing can be what you might call artistically done if its done with an effort if a thing cant be done light and easy steady and certain let it not be done at all sounds strange doesnt it but ill tell you a stranger thing the more effort you make the less effect you produce a wouldbe artist is no artist at all i see that in my own profession never mind what that profession is just at present as the ladies might think the worse of me for it but in all professions any work that shows signs of labor straining yearningas the german gentleman saidor effort of any kind is work beyond the mans strength that does it and therefore not well done perhaps its beyond his natural strength but it is more likely that he was badly taught many teachers set their pupils on to strain and stretch so that they get used up body and mind in a few months depend upon it the same thing is true in other arts i once taught a fiddler that used to get a hundred guineas for playing two or three tunes and he told me that it was just the same thing with the fiddlethat when you laid a tight hold on your fiddlestick or even set your teeth hard together you could do nothing but rasp like the fellows that play in bands for a few shillings a night  how much more of this nonsense must we endure said lucian audibly as cashel stopped for breath cashel turned and looked at him  by jove whispered lord worthington to his companion that fellow had better be careful i wish he would hold his tongue  you think its nonsense do you said cashel after a pause then he raised one of the candles and illuminated a picture that hung on the wall look at that picture he said you see that fellow in armorst george and the dragon or whatever he may be hes jumped down from his horse to fight the other fellowthat one with his head in a big helmet whose horse has tumbled the lady in the gallery is half crazy with anxiety for st george and well she may be theres a posture for a man to fight in his weight isnt resting on his legs one touch of a childs finger would upset him look at his neck craned out in front of him and his face as flat as a full moon towards his man as if he was inviting him to shut up both his eyes with one blow you can all see that hes as weak and nervous as a cat and that he doesnt know how to fight and why does he give you that idea just because hes all strain and stretch because he isnt at his ease because he carries the weight of his body as foolishly as one of the ladies here would carry a hod of bricks because he isnt safe steady and light on his pins as he would be if he could forget himself for a minute and leave his body to find its proper balance of its own accord if the painter of that picture had known his business he would never have sent his man up to the scratch in such a figure and condition as that but you can see with one eye that he didnt understandi wont say the principles of fighting but the universal principles that ive told you of that ease and strength effort and weakness go together now added cashel again addressing lucian do you still think that notion of mine nonsense and he smacked his lips with satisfaction for his criticism of the picture had produced a marked sensation and he did not know that this was due to the fact that the painter mr adrian herbert was present  lucian tried to ignore the question but he found it impossible to ignore the questioner since you have set the example of expressing opinions without regard to considerations of common courtesy he said shortly i may say that your theory if it can be called one is manifestly absurd  cashel apparently unruffled but with more deliberation of manner than before looked about him as if in search of a fresh illustration his glance finally rested on the lecturers seat a capacious crimson damask armchair that stood unoccupied at some distance behind lucian  i see youre no judge of a picture said he goodhumoredly putting down the candle and stepping in front of lucian who regarded him haughtily and did not budge but just look at it in this way suppose you wanted to hit me the most punishing blow you possibly could what would you do why according to your own notion youd make a great effort the more effort the more force youd say to yourself ill smash him even if i burst myself in doing it and what would happen then youd only cut me and make me angry besides exhausting all your strength at one gasp whereas if you took it easylike this here he made a light step forward and placed his open palm gently against the breast of lncian who instantly reeled back as if the pistonrod of a steamengine had touched him and dropped into the chair  there exclaimed cashel standing aside and pointing to him its like pocketing a billiardball  a chatter of surprise amusement and remonstrance spread through the rooms and the company crowded towards the table lucian rose white with rage and for a moment entirely lost his selfcontrol fortunately the effect was to paralyze him he neither moved nor spoke and only betrayed his condition by his pallor and the hatred in his expression presently he felt a touch on his arm and heard his name pronounced by lydia her voice calmed him he tried to look at her but his vision was disturbed he saw double the lights seemed to dunce before his eyes and lord worthingtons voice saying to cashel rather too practical old fellow seemed to come from a remote corner of the room and yet to be whispered into his ear he was moving irresolutely in search of lydia when his senses and his resentment were restored by a clap on the shoulder  you wouldnt have believed that now would you said cashel dont look startled youve no bones broken you had your little joke with me in your own way and i had mine in my own way thats only  he stopped his brave bearing vanished he became limp and shamefaced lucian without a word withdrew with lydia to the adjoining apartment and left him staring after her with wistful eyes and slackened jaw  in the meantime mrs hoskyn an earnestlooking young woman with striking dark features and gold spectacles was looking for lord worthington who betrayed a consciousness of guilt by attempting to avoid her but she cut off his retreat and confronted him with a steadfast gaze that compelled him to stand and answer for himself  who is that gentleman whom you introduced to me i do not recollect his name  i am really awfully sorry mrs hoskyn it was too bad of byron but webber was excessively nasty  mrs hoskyn additionally annoyed by apologies which she had not invited and which put her in the ignominious position of a complainant replied coldly mr byron thank you i had forgotten and was turning away when lydia came up to introduce alice and to explain why she had entered unannounced lord worthington then returned to the subject of cashel hoping to improve his credit by claiming lydias acquaintance with him  did you hear our friend byrons speech miss carew very characteristic i thought  very said lydia i hope mrs hoskyns guests are all familiar with his style otherwise they must find him a little startling  yes said mrs hoskyn beginning to wonder whether cashel could be some wellknown eccentric genius he is very odd i hope mr webber is not offended  he is the less pleased as he was in the wrong said lydia intolerant refusal to listen to an opponent is a species of violence that has no business in such a representative nineteenthcentury drawingroom as yours mrs hoskyn there was a fitness in rebuking it by skilled physical violence consider the prodigious tact of it too one gentleman knocks another halfway across a crowded room and yet no one is scandalized  you see mrs hoskyn the general verdict is served him right said lord worthington  with a rider to the effect that both gentlemen displayed complete indifference to the comfort of their hostess said lydia however men so rarely sacrifice their manners to their minds that it would be a pity to blame them you do not encourage conventionality mrs hoskyn  i encourage good manners though certainly not conventional manners  and you think there is a difference  i feel that there is a difference said mrs hoskyn with dignity  so do i said lydia but one can hardly call others to account for ones own subjective ideas  lydia went away to another part of the room without waiting for a reply meanwhile cashel stood friendless in the middle of the room stared at by most of his neighbors and spoken to by none women looked at him coldly lest it should be suspected that they were admiring him and men regarded him stiffly according to the national custom since his recognition of lydia his selfconfidence had given place to a misgiving that he had been making a fool of himself he began to feel lonely and abashed and but for his professional habit of maintaining a cheerful countenance under adverse circumstances he would have hid himself in the darkest corner of the room he was getting sullen and seeking consolation in thoughts of how terribly he could handle all these distantlymannered blackcoated gentlemen if he chose when lord worthington came up to him  i had no idea you were such an orator byron he said you can go into the church when you cut the other trade eh  i wasnt brought up to the other trade said cashel and i know how to talk to ladies and gentlemen as well as to what youd suppose to be my own sort dont you be anxious about me my lord i know how to make myself at home  of course of course said lord worthington soothingly every one can see by your manners that you are a gentleman they recognize that even in the ring otherwisei know you will excuse my saying soi darent have brought you here  cashel shook his head but was pleased he thought he hated flattery had lord worthington told him that he was the best boxer in englandwhich he probably washe would have despised him but he wished to believe the false compliment to his manners and was therefore perfectly convinced of its sincerity lord worthington perceived this and retired pleased with his own tact in search of mrs hoskyn to claim her promise of an introduction to madame szczymplica which mrs hoskyn had by way of punishing him for cashels misdemeanor privately determined not to redeem  cashel began to think he had better go lydia was surrounded by men who were speaking to her in german he felt his own inability to talk learnedly even in english and he had besides a conviction that she was angry with him for upsetting her cousin who was gravely conversing with miss goff suddenly a horrible noise caused a general start and pause mr jack the eminent composer had opened the pianoforte and was illustrating some points in a musical composition under discussion by making discordant sounds with his voice accompanied by a few chords cashel laughed aloud in derision as he made his way towards the door through the crowd which was now pressing round the pianoforte at which madame szczymplica had just come to the assistance of jack near the door and in a corner remote from the instrument he came upon lydia and a middleaged gentleman evidently neither a professor nor an artist  abngas is a very clever man the gentleman was saying i am sorry i didnt hear the lecture but i leave all that to mary she receives the people who enjoy high art upstairs and i take the sensible men down to the garden or the smokingroom according to the weather  what do the sensible women do said lydia  they come late said mr hoskyn and then laughed at his repartee until he became aware of the vicinity of cashel whose health he immediately inquired after shaking his hand warmly and receiving a numbing grip in return as soon as he saw that lydia and cashel were acquainted he slipped away and left them to entertain one another  i wonder how he knows me said cashel heartened by her gracious reception of a nervous bow i never saw him before in my life  he does not know you said lydia with some sternness he is your host and therefore concludes that he ought to know you  oh that was it was it he paused at a loss for conversation she did not help him at last he added i havent seen you this long time miss carew  it is not very long since i saw you mr cashel byron i saw you yesterday at some distance from london  oh lord exclaimed cashel dont say that youre joking aint you  no joking in that sense does not amuse me  cashel looked at her in consternation you dont mean to say that you went to see aawherewhen did you see me you might tell me  certainly it was at clapham junction at a quarterpast six  was any one with me  your friend mr mellish lord worthington and some other persons  yes lord worthington was there but where were you  in a waitingroom close to you  i never saw you said cashel growing red as he recalled the scene we must have looked very queer i had had an accident to my eye and mellish was not sober did you think i was in bad company  that was not my business mr cashel byron  no said cashel with sudden bitterness what did you care what company i kept youre mad with me because i made your cousin look like a fool i suppose thats whats the matter  lydia looked around to see that no one was within earshot and speaking in a low tone to remind him that they were not alone said there is nothing the matter except that you are a grownup boy rather than a man i am not mad with you because of your attack upon my cousin but he is very much annoyed and so is mrs hoskyn whose guest you were bound to respect  i knew youd be down on me i wouldnt have said a word if id known that you were here said cashel dejectedly lie down and be walked over thats what you think im fit for another man would have twisted his head off  is it possible that you do not know that gentlemen never twist one anothers heads off in society no matter how great may be the provocation  i know nothing said cashel with plaintive sullenness everything i do is wrong there will that satisfy you  lydia looked up at him in doubt then with steady patience she added will you answer me a question on your honor  he hesitated fearing that she was going to ask what he was  the question is this she said observing the hesitation are you a simpleton or a man of science pretending to be a simpleton for the sake of mocking me and my friends  i am not mocking you honor bright all that about science was only a jokeat least its not what you call science im a real simpleton in drawingroom affairs though im clever enough in my own line  then try to believe that i take no pleasure in making you confess yourself in the wrong and that you cannot have a lower opinion of me than the contrary belief implies  thats just where youre mistaken said cashel obstinately i havent got a low opinion of you at all theres such a thing as being too clever  you may not know that it is a low opinion nevertheless it is so  well have it your own way im wrong again and youre right  so far from being gratified by that i had rather that we were both in the right and agreed can you understand that  i cant say i do but i give in to it what more need you care for  i had rather you understood let me try to explain you think that i like to be cleverer than other people you are mistaken i should like them all to know whatever i know  cashel laughed cunningly and shook his head dont you make any mistake about that he said you dont want anybody to be quite as clever as yourself it isnt in human nature that you should youd like people to be just clever enough to show you offto be worth beating but you wouldnt like them to be able to beat you just clever enough to know how much cleverer you are thats about the mark eh  lydia made no further effort to enlighten him she looked at him thoughtfully and said slowly i begin to hold the clew to your idiosyncrasy you have attached yourself to the modern doctrine of a struggle for existence and look on life as a perpetual combat  a fight just so what is life but a fight the curs forfeit or get beaten the rogues sell the fight and lose the confidence of their backers the game ones and the clever ones win the stakes and have to hand over the lions share of them to the loafers and luck plays the devil with them all in turn thats not the way they describe life in books but thats what it is  oddly put but perhaps true still is there any need of a struggle is not the world large enough for us all to live peacefully in  you may think so because you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth but if you hadnt to fight for that silver spoon some one else had and no doubt he thought it hard that it should be taken away from him and given to you i was a snob myself once and thought the world was made for me to enjoy myself and order about the poor fellows whose bread i was eating but i was left one day where i couldnt grab any more of their bread and had to make some for myselfay and some extra for loafers that had the power to make me pay for what they didnt own that took the conceit out of me fast enough but what do you know about such things  more than you think perhaps these are dangerous ideas to take with you into english society  hmf growled cashel theyd be more dangerous if i could give every man that is robbed of half what he earns twelve lessonsin science  so you can publish your lessons twelve lectures on political economy by cashel byron i will help you to publish them if you wish  bless your innocence said cashel the sort of political economy i teach cant be learned from a book  you have become an enigma again but yours is not the creed of a simpleton you are playing with merevealing your wisdom from beneath a veil of infantile guilelessness i have no more to say  may i be shot if i understand you i never pretended to be guileless come is it because i raised a laugh against your cousin that youre so spiteful  lydia looked earnestly and doubtfully at him and he instinctively put his head back as if it were in danger you do not understand then she said i will test the genuineness of your stupidity by an appeal to your obedience  stupidity go on  but will you obey me if i lay a command upon you  i will go through fire and water for you  lydia blushed faintly and paused to wonder at the novel sensation before she resumed you had better not apologize to my cousin partly because you would only make matters worse chiefly because he does not deserve it but you must make this speech to mrs hoskyn when you are going i am very sorry i forgot myself  sounds like shakespeare doesnt it observed cashel  ah the test has found you out you are only acting after all but that does not alter my opinion that you should apologize  all right i dont know what you mean by testing and acting and i only hope you know yourself but no matter ill apologize a man like me can afford to ill apologize to your cousin too if you like  i do not like but what has that to do with it i suggest these things as you must be aware for your own sake and not for mine  as for my own i dont care twopence i do it all for you i dont even ask whether there is anything between you and him  would you like to know said lydia deliberately after a pause of astonishment  do you mean to say youll tell me he exclaimed if you do ill say youre as good as gold  certainly i will tell you there is an old friendship and cousinship between us but we are not engaged nor at all likely to be i tell you so because if i avoided the question you would draw the opposite and false conclusion  i am glad of it said cashel unexpectedly becoming very gloomy he isnt man enough for you but hes your equal damn him  he is my cousin and i believe my sincere friend therefore please do not damn him  i know i shouldnt have said that but i am only damning my own luck  which will not improve it in the least  i know that you neednt have said it i wouldnt have said a thing like that to you stupid as i am  evidently you suppose me to have meant more than i really did however that does not matter you are still an enigma to me had we not better try to hear a little of madame szczymplicas performance  im a pretty plain enigma i should think said cashel mournfully i would rather have you than any other woman in the world but youre too rich and grand for me if i cant have the satisfaction of marrying you i may as well have the satisfaction of saying id like to  hardly a fair way of approaching the subject said lydia composedly but with a play of color again in her cheeks allow me to forbid it unconditionally i must be plain with you mr cashel byron i do not know what you are or who you are and i believe you have tried to mystify me on both points  and you never shall find out either the one or the other if i can help it put in cashel so that were in a preciously bad way of coming to a good understanding  true assented lydia i do not make secrets i do not keep them and i do not respect them your humor clashes with my principle  you call it a humor said cashel angrily perhaps you think i am a duke in disguise if so you may think better of it if you had a secret the discovery of which would cause you to be kicked out of decent society you would keep it pretty tight and that through no fault of your own mind you but through downright cowardice and prejudice in other people  there are at least some fears and prejudices common in society that i do not share said lydia after a moments reflection should i ever find out your secret do not too hastily conclude that you have forfeited my consideration  you are just the last person on earth by whom i want to be found out but youll find out fast enough pshaw cried cashel with a laugh im as well known as trafalgar square but i cant bring myself to tell you and i hate secrets as much as you do so lets drop it and talk about something else  we have talked long enough the music is over and the people will return to this room presently perhaps to ask me who and what is the stranger who made them such a remarkable speech  just a word promise me that you wont ask any of them that  promise you no i cannot promise that  oh lord said cashel with a groan  i have told you that i do not respect secrets for the present i will not ask but i may change my mind meanwhile we must not hold long conversations i even hope that we shall not meet there is only one thing that i am too rich and grand for that one thingmystification adieu  before he could reply she was away from him in the midst of a number of gentlemen and in conversation with one of them cashel seemed overwhelmed but in an instant he recovered himself and stepped jauntily before mrs hoskyn who had just come into his neighborhood  im going maam he said thank you for a pleasant eveningim very sorry i forgot myself goodnight  mrs hoskyn naturally frank felt some vague response within herself to this address but though not usually at a loss for words in social emergencies she only looked at him blushed slightly and offered her hand he took it as if it were a tiny babys hand and he afraid of hurting it gave it a little pinch and turned to go mr adrian herbert the painter was directly in his way with his back towards him  if you please sir said cashel taking him gently by the ribs and moving him aside the artist turned indignantly but cashel was passing the doorway on the stairs he met lucian and alice and stopped a moment to take leave of them  goodnight miss goff he said its a pleasure to see the country roses in your cheeks he lowered his voice as he added to lucian dont you worry yourself over that little trick i showed you if any of your friends chafe you about it tell them that it was cashel byron did it and ask them whether they think they could have helped themselves any better than you could dont ever let a person come within distance of yon while youre standing in that silly way on both your heels why if a man isnt properly planted on his pins a broomhandle falling against him will upset him thats the way of it goodnight  lucian returned the salutation mastered by a certain latent dangerousness in cashel suggestive that he might resent a snub by throwing the offender over the balustrade as for alice she had entertained a superstitious dread of him ever since lydia had pronounced him a ruffian both felt relieved when the house door closing shut them out of his reach       chapter vii      society was much occupied during alices first season in london with the upshot of an historical event of a common kind england a few years before had stolen a kingdom from a considerable people in africa and seized the person of its king the conquest proved useless troublesome and expensive and after repeated attempts to settle the country on impracticable plans suggested to the colonial office by a popular historian who had made a trip to africa and by generals who were tired of the primitive remedy of killing the natives it appeared that the best course was to release the captive king and get rid of the unprofitable booty by restoring it to him in order however that the impression made on him by englands shortsighted disregard of her neighbors landmark abroad might be counteracted by a glimpse of the vastness of her armaments and wealth at home it was thought advisable to take him first to london and show him the wonders of the town but when the king arrived his freedom from english prepossessions made it difficult to amuse or even to impress him a stranger to the idea that a private man could own a portion of the earth and make others pay him for permission to live on it he was unable to understand why such a prodigiously wealthy nation should be composed partly of poor and uncomfortable persons toiling incessantly to create riches and partly of a class that confiscated and dissipated the wealth thus produced without seeming to be at all happier than the unfortunate laborers at whose expense they existed he was seized with strange fears first for his health for it seemed to him that the air of london filthy with smoke engendered puniness and dishonesty in those who breathed it and eventually for his life when he learned that kings in europe were sometimes shot at by passersby there being hardly a monarch there who had not been so imperilled more than once that the queen of england though accounted the safest of all was accustomed to this variety of pistol practice and that the autocrat of an empire huge beyond all other european countries whose father had been torn asunder in the streets of his capital lived surrounded by soldiers who shot down all strangers that approached him even at his own summons and was an object of compassion to the humblest of his servants under these circumstances the african king was with difficulty induced to stir out of doors and he only visited woolwich arsenalthe destructive resources of which were expected to influence his future behavior in a manner favorable to english supremacyunder compulsion at last the colonial office which had charge of him was at its wits end to devise entertainments to keep him in goodhumor until the appointed time for his departure  on the tuesday following mrs hoskyns reception lucian webber called at his cousins house in regents park and said in the course of a conversation with the two ladies there  the colonial office has had an idea the king it appears is something of an athlete and is curious to witness what londoners can do in that way so a grand assaultatarms is to be held for him  what is an assaultatarms said lydia i have never been at one and the name suggests nothing but an affray with bayonets  it is an exhibition of swordsmanship military drill gymnastics and so forth  i will go to that said lydia will you come alice  is it usual for ladies to go to such exhibitions said alice cautiously  on this occasion ladies will go for the sake of seeing the king said lucian the olympian gymnastic society which has undertaken the direction of the part of the assault that is to show off the prowess of our civilians expects what they call a flowershow audience  will you come lucian  if i can be spared yes if not i will ask worthington to go with you he understands such matters better than i  then let us have him by all means said lydia  i cannot see why you are so fond of lord worthington said alice his manners are good but there is nothing in him besides he is so young i cannot endure his conversation he has begun to talk about goodwood already  he will grow out of his excessive addiction to sport said lucian  indeed said lydia and what will he grow into  possibly into a more reasonable man said lucian gravely  i hope so said lydia but i prefer a man who is interested in sport to a gentleman who is interested in nothing  much might indubitably be said from that point of view but it is not necessary that lord worthington should waste his energy on horseracing i presume you do not think political life for which his position peculiarly fits him unworthy his attention  party tactics are both exciting and amusing no doubt but are they better than horseracing jockeys and horsebreakers at least know their business our legislators do not is it pleasant to sit on a bencheven though it be the treasury benchand listen to either absolute nonsense or childish disputes about conclusions that were foregone in the minds of all sensible men a hundred years ago  you do not understand the duties of a government lydia you never approach the subject without confirming my opinion that women are constitutionally incapable of comprehending it  it is natural for you to think so lucian the house of commons is to you the goal of existence to me it is only an assemblage of illinformed gentlemen who have botched every business they have ever undertaken from the first committee of supply down to the last land act and who arrogantly assert that i am not good enough to sit with them  lydia said lucian annoyed you know that i respect women in their own sphere  then give them another sphere and perhaps they will earn your respect in that also i am sorry to say that men in their sphere have not won my respect enough of that for the present i have to make some domestic arrangements which are of more immediate importance than the conversion of a good politician into a bad philosopher excuse me for five minutes  she left the room lucian sat down and gave his attention to alice who had still enough of her old nervousness to make her straighten her shoulders and look stately but he did not object to this a little stiffness of manner gratified his taste  i hope he said that my cousin has not succeeded in inducing you to adopt her peculiar views  no said alice of course her case is quite exceptionalshe is so wonderfully accomplished in general i do not think women should have views there are certain convictions which every lady holds for instance we know that roman catholicism is wrong but that can hardly be called a view indeed it would be wicked to call it so as it is one of the highest truths what i mean is that women should not be political agitators  i understand and quite agree with you lydia is as you say an exceptional case she has lived much abroad and her father was a very singular man even the clearest heads when removed from the direct influence of english life and thought contract extraordinary prejudices her father at one time actually attempted to leave a large farm to the government in trust for the people but fortunately he found that it was impossible no such demise was known to the english law or practicable by it he subsequently admitted the folly of this by securing lydias rights as his successor as stringently as he could it is almost a pity that such strength of mind and extent of knowledge should be fortified by the dangerous independence which great wealth confers advantages like these bring with them certain duties to the class that has produced themduties to which lydia is not merely indifferent but absolutely hostile  i never meddle with her ideas onon these subjects i am too ignorant to understand them but miss carews generosity to me has been unparalleled and she does not seem to know that she is generous i owe more to her than i ever can repay at least alice added to herself i am not ungrateful  miss carew now reappeared dressed in a long gray coat and plain beaver hat and carrying a roll of writing materials  i am going to the british museum to read said she  to walkalone said lucian looking at her costume  yes prevent me from walking and you deprive me of my health prevent me from going alone where i please and when i please and you deprive me of my libertytear up magna charta in effect but i do not insist upon being alone in this instance if you can return to your office by way of regents park and gower street without losing too much time i shall be glad of your company  lucian decorously suppressed his eagerness to comply by looking at his watch and pretending to consider his engagements in conclusion he said that he should be happy to accompany her  it was a fine summer afternoon and there were many people in the park lucian was soon incommoded by the attention his cousin attracted in spite of the black beaver her hair shone like fire in the sun women stared at her with unsympathetic curiosity and turned as they passed to examine her attire men resorted to various subterfuges to get a satisfactory look without rudely betraying their intention a few stupid youths gaped and a few impudent ones smiled lucian would gladly have kicked them all without distinction he at last suggested that they should leave the path and make a short cut across the greensward as they emerged from the shade of the trees he had a vague impression that the fineness of the weather and the beauty of the park made the occasion romantic and that the words by which he hoped to make the relation between him and his cousin dearer and closer would be well spoken there but he immediately began to talk in spite of himself about the cost of maintaining the public parks of the particulars of which he happened to have some official knowledge lydia readily interested by facts of any sort thought the subject not a bad one for a casual afternoon conversation and pursued it until they left the turf and got into the euston road where the bustle of traffic silenced them for a while when they escaped from the din into the respectable quietude of gower street he suddenly said  it is one of the evils of great wealth in the hands of a woman that she can hardly feel sure his ideas fled suddenly he stopped but he kept his countenance so well that he had the air of having made a finished speech and being perfectly satisfied with it  do you mean that she can never feel sure of the justice of her title to her riches that used to trouble me but it no longer does so  nonsense said lucian i alluded to the disinterestedness of your friends  that does not trouble me either absolutely disinterested friends i do not seek as i should only find them among idiots or somnambulists as to those whose interests are base they do not know how to conceal their motives from me for the rest i am not so unreasonable as to object to a fair account being taken of my wealth in estimating the value of my friendship  do you not believe in the existence of persons who would like you just as well if you were poor  such persons would merely to bring me nearer to themselves wish me to become poor for which i should not thank them i set great store by the esteem my riches command lucian it is the only setoff i have against the envy they inspire  then you would refuse to believe in the disinterestedness of any man whowho  who wanted to marry me on the contrary i should be the last person to believe that a man could prefer my money to myself if he wore independent and in a fair way to keep his place in the world without my help i should despise him if he hesitated to approach me for fear of misconstruction i do not think a man is ever thoroughly honest until he is superior to that fear but if he had no profession no money and no aim except to live at my expense then i should regard him as an adventurer and treat him as oneunless i fell in love with him  unless you fell in love with him  thatassuming that such things really happenwould make a difference in my feeling but none in my conduct i would not marry an adventurer under any circumstances i could cure myself of a misdirected passion but not of a bad husband  lucian said nothing he walked on with long irregular steps lowering at the pavement as if it were a difficult problem and occasionally thrusting at it with his stick at last he looked up and said  would you mind prolonging your walk a little by going round bedford square with me i have something particular to say  she turned and complied without a word and they had traversed one side of the square before he spoke again in these terms  on second thoughts lydia this is neither the proper time nor place for an important communication excuse me for having taken you out of your way for nothing  i do not like this lucian important communicationsin this casecorrupt good manners if your intended speech is a sensible one the present is as good a time and bedford square as good a place as you are likely to find for it if it is otherwise confess that you have decided to leave it unsaid but do not postpone it reticence is always an erroreven on the treasury bench it is doubly erroneous in dealing with me for i have a constitutional antipathy to it  yes he said hurriedly but give me one momentuntil the policeman has passed  the policeman went leisurely by striking the flags with his heels and slapping his palm with a white glove  the fact is lydia thati feel great difficulty  what is the matter said lydia after waiting in vain for further particulars you have broken down twice in a speech there was a pause then she looked at him quickly and added incredulously are you going to get married is that the secret that ties your practised tongue  not unless you take part in the ceremony  very gallant and in a vein of humor that is new in my experience of you but what have you to tell me lucian frankly your hesitation is becoming ridiculous  you have certainly not made matters easier for me lydia perhaps you have a womanly intuition of my purpose and are intentionally discouraging me  not the least i am not good at speculations of that sort on my word if you do not confess quickly i will hurry away to the museum  i cannot find a suitable form of expression said lucian in painful perplexity i am sure you will not attribute any sordid motive to mywell to my addresses though the term seems absurd i am too well aware that there is little from the usual point of view to tempt you to unite yourself to me still  a rapid change in lydias face showed him that he had said enough i had not thought of this she said after a silence that seemed long to him our observations are so meaningless until we are given the thread to string them on you must think better of this lucian the relation that at present exists between us is the very best that our different characters will admit of why do you desire to alter it  because i would make it closer and more permanent i do not wish to alter it otherwise  you would run some risk of simply destroying it by the method you propose said lydia with composure we could not cooperate there are differences of opinion between us amounting to differences of principle  surely you are not serious your political opinions or notions are not represented by any party in england and therefore they are practically ineffective and could not clash with mine and such differences are not personal matters  such a party might be formed a week after our marriagewill i think be formed a long time before our deaths in that case i fear that our difference of opinion would become a very personal matter  he began to walk more quickly as he replied it is too absurd to set up what you call your opinions as a serious barrier between us you have no opinions lydia the impracticable crotchets you are fond of airing are not recognized in england as sane political convictions  lydia did not retort she waited a minute in pensive silence and then said  why do you not marry alice goff  oh hang alice goff  it is so easy to come at the man beneath the veneer by expertly chipping at his feelings said lydia laughing but i was serious lucian alice is energetic ambitious and stubbornly upright in questions of principle i believe she would assist you steadily at every step of your career besides she has physical robustness our studentstock needs an infusion of that  many thanks for the suggestion but i do not happen to want to marry miss goff  i invite you to consider it yon have not had time yet to form any new plans  new plans then you absolutely refuse mewithout a moments consideration  absolutely lucian does not your instinct warn you that it would be a mistake for you to marry me  no i cannot say that it does  then trust to mine which gives forth no uncertain note on this question as your favorite newspapers are fond of saying  it is a question of feeling he said in a constrained voice  is it she replied with interest you have surprised me somewhat lucian i have never observed any of the extravagances of a lover in your conduct  and you have surprised me very unpleasantly lydia i do not think now that i ever had much hope of success but i thought at least that my disillusion would be gently accomplished  what have i been harsh  i do not complain  i was unlucky lucian not malicious besides the artifices by which friends endeavor to spare one anothers feelings are pretty disloyalties i am frank with you would you have me otherwise  of course not i have no right to be offended  not the least now add to that formal admission a sincere assurance that you are not offended  i assure you i am not said lucian with melancholy resignation  they had by this time reached charlotte street and lydia tacitly concluded the conference by turning towards the museum and beginning to talk upon indifferent subjects at the corner of russell street he got into a cab and drove away dejectedly acknowledging a smile and wave of the hand with which lydia tried to console him she then went to the national library where she forgot lucian the effect of the shock of his proposal was in store for her but as yet she did not feel it and she worked steadily until the library was closed and she had to leave as she had been sitting for some hours and it was still light she did not take a cab and did not even walk straight home she had heard of a bookseller in soho who had for sale a certain scarce volume which she wanted and it occurred to her that the present was a good opportunity to go in search of him now there was hardly a capital in western europe that she did not know better than london she had an impression that soho was a region of quiet streets and squares like bloomsbury her mistake soon became apparent but she felt no uneasiness in the narrow thoroughfares for she was free from the common prejudice of her class that poor people are necessarily ferocious though she often wondered why they were not so she got as far as great pulteney street in safety but in leaving it she took a wrong turning and lost herself in a labyrinth of courts where a few workmen a great many workmens wives and mothers and innumerable workmens children were passing the summer evening at gossip and play she explained her predicament to one of the women who sent a little boy wilh her to guide her business being over for the day the street to which the boy led her was almost deserted the only shop that seemed to be thriving was a publichouse outside which a few roughs were tossing for pence  lydias guide having pointed out her way to her prepared to return to his playmates she thanked him and gave him the smallest coin in her purse which happened to be a shilling he in a transport at possessing what was to him a fortune uttered a piercing yell and darted off to show the coin to a covey of small ragamuffins who had just raced into view round the corner at which the publichouse stood in his haste he dashed against one of the group outside a powerfully built young man who turned and cursed him the boy retorted passionately and then overcome by pain began to cry when lydia came up the child stood whimpering directly in her path and she pitying him patted him on the head and reminded him of all the money he had to spend he seemed comforted and scraped his eyes with his knuckles in silence but the man who having received a sharp kick on the ankle was stung by lydias injustice in according to the aggressor the sympathy due to himself walked threateningly up to her and demanded with a startling oath whether he had offered to do anything to the boy and as he refrained from applying any epithet to her he honestly believed that in deference to lydias sex and personal charms he had expressed himself with studied moderation she not appreciating his forbearance recoiled and stepped into the roadway in order to pass him indignant at this attempt to ignore him he again placed himself in her path and was repeating his question with increased sternness when a jerk in the pit of his stomach caused him a severe internal qualm besides disturbing his equilibrium so rudely that he narrowly escaped a fall against the curbstone when he recovered himself he saw before him a showily dressed young man who accosted him thus  is that the way to talk to a lady eh isnt the street wide enough for two wheres your manners  and who are you and where are you shoving your elbow to said the man with a surpassing imprecation  come come said cashel byron admonitorily youd better keep your mouth clean if you wish to keep your teeth inside it never you mind who i am  lydia foreseeing an altercation and alarmed by the threatening aspect of the man attempted to hurry away and send a policeman to cashels assistance but on turning she discovered that a crowd had already gathered and that she was in the novel position of a spectator in the inner ring at what promised to be a street fight her attention was recalled to the disputants by a violent demonstration on the part of her late assailant cashel seemed alarmed for he hastily retreated a step without regard to the toes of those behind him and exclaimed waving the other off with his open hand  now you just let me alone i dont want to have anything to say to you go away from me i tell you  you dont want to have nothink to say to me oh and for why because you aint man enough thats why wot do you mean by coming and shoving your elbow into a mans breadbasket for and then wanting to sneak off did you think id a bin frightened of your velvet coat  very well said cashel pacifically well say that im not man enough for you so thats settled are you satisfied  but the other greatly emboldened declared with many oaths that he would have cashels heart out and also that of lydia to whom he alluded in coarse terms the crowd cheered and called upon him to go it cashel then said sullenly  very well but dont you try to make out afterwards that i forced a quarrel on you and now he added with a grim change of tone that made lydia shudder and shifted her fears to the account of his antagonist ill make you wish youd bit your tongue out before you said what you did a moment ago so take care of yourself  oh ill take care of myself said the man defiantly put up your hands  cashel surveyed his antagonists attitude with unmistakable disparagement you will know when my hands are up by the feel of the pavement he said at last better keep your coat on youll fall softer  the rough expressed his repudiation of this counsel by beginning to strip energetically a thrill of delight passed through the crowd those who had bad places pressed forward and those who formed the inner ring pressed back to make room for the combatants lydia who occupied a coveted position close to cashel hoped to be hustled out of the throng for she was beginning to feel faint and ill but a handsome butcher who had made his way to her side gallantly swore that she should not be deprived of her place in the front row and bade her not be frightened assuring her that he would protect her and that the fight would be well worth seeing as he spoke the mass of faces before lydia seemed to give a sudden lurch to save herself from falling she slipped her arm through the butchers and he much gratified tucked her close to him and held her up effectually his support was welcome because it was needed  meanwhile cashel stood motionless watching with unrelenting contempt the movements of his adversary who rolled up his discolored shirtsleeves amid encouraging cries of go it teddy give it im ted and other more precise suggestions but teddys spirit was chilled be advanced with a presentiment that he was courting destruction he dared not rush on his foe whose eye seemed to discern his impotence when at last he ventured to strike the blow fell short as cashel evidently knew it would for he did not stir there was a laugh and a murmur of impatience in the crowd  are you waiting for the copper to come and separate you shouted the butcher come out of your corner and get to work cant you  this reminder that the police might balk him of his prey seemed to move cashel he took a step forward the excitement of the crowd rose to a climax and a little man near lydia cut a frenzied caper and screamed go it cashel byron  at these words teddy was terrorstricken he made no attempt to disguise his condition it aint fair he exclaimed retreating as far as the crowd would permit him i give in cut it master youre too clever for me but his comrades with a pitiless jeer pushed him towards cashel who advanced remorselessly teddy dropped on both knees wot can a man say more than that hes had enough he pleaded be a englishman master and dont hit a man when hes down  down said cashel how long will you stay down if i choose to have you up and suiting the action to the word he seized teddy with his left hand lifted him to his feet threw him into a helpless position across his knee and poised his right fist like a hammer over his upturned face now he said youre not down what have you to say for yourself before i knock your face down your throat  dont do it govnor gasped teddy i didnt mean no harm how was i to know that the young lady was a pal o yourn here he struggled a little and his face assumed a darker hue let go master he cried almost inarticulately youre chchoking me  pray let him go said lydia disengaging herself from the butcher and catching cashels arm  cashel with a start relaxed his grasp and teddy rolled on the ground he went away thrusting his hands iuto his sleeves and outfacing his disgrace by a callous grin cashel without speaking offered lydia his arm and she seeing that her best course was to get away from that place with as few words as possible accepted it and then turned and thanked the butcher who blushed and became speechless the little man whose exclamation had interrupted the combat now waved his hat and cried  the british lion forever three cheers for cashel byron  cashel turned upon him curtly and said dont you make so free with other peoples names or perhaps you may get into trouble yourself  the little man retreated hastily hut the crowd responded with three cheers as cashel with lydia on his arm withdrew through a lane of disreputablelooking girls roughs of teddys class whiteaproned shopmen who had left their counters to see the fight and a few pale clerks who looked with awe at the prizefighter and with wonder at the refined appearance of his companion the two were followed by a double file of boys who with their eyes fixed earnestly on cashel walked on the footways while he conducted lydia down the middle of the narrow street not one of them turned a somersault or uttered a shout intent on their hero they pattered along coming into collision with every object that lay in their path at last cashel stopped they instantly stopped too he took some bronze coin from his pocket rattled it in his hand and addressed them  boys dead silence do you know what i have to do to keep up my strength the hitherto steadfast eyes wandered uneasily i have to eat a little boy for supper every night the last thing before to bed now i havent quite made up my mind which of you would be the most to my taste but if one of you comes a step further ill eat him so away with you and he jerked the coin to a considerable distance there was a yell and a scramble and cashel and lydia pursued their way unattended  lydia had taken advantage of the dispersion of the boys to detach herself from cashels arm she now said speaking to him for the first time since she had interceded for teddy  i am sorry to have given you so much trouble mr cashel byron thank you for interfering to protect me but i was in no real danger i would gladly have borne with a few rough words for the sake of avoiding a disturbance  there cried cashel i knew it youd a deal rather i had minded my own business and not interfered youre sorry for the poor fellow i treated so badly aint you now thats a woman all over  i have not said one of these things  well i dont see what else you mean its no pleasure to me to fight chance men in the streets for nothing i dont get my living that way and now that i have done it for your sake you as good as tell me i ought to have kept myself quiet  perhaps i am wrong i hardly understand what passed you seemed to drop from the clouds  aha you were glad when you found me at your elbow in spite of your talk come now werent you glad to see me  i wasvery glad indeed but by what magic did you so suddenly subdue that man and was it necessary to sully your hands by throttling him  it was a satisfaction to me and it served him right  surely a very poor satisfaction did you notice that some one in the crowd called out your name and that it seemed to frighten the man terribly  indeed odd wasnt it but you were saying that you thought i dropped from the sky why i had been following you for five minutes before what do you think of that if i may take the liberty of asking how did you come to be walking round soho at such an hour with a little ragged boy  lydia explained when she finished it was nearly dark and they had reached oxford street where like lucian in regents park that afternoon she became conscious that her companion was an object of curiosity to many of the young men who were lounging in that thoroughfare  alice will think that i am lost she said making a signal to a cabman goodbye and many thanks i am always at home on fridays and shall be very happy to see you  she handed him a card he took it read it looked at the back to see if there was anything written there and then said dubiously  i suppose there will be a lot of people  yes you will meet plenty of people  hm i wish youd let me see you home now i wont ask to go any further than the gate  lydia laughed you should be very welcome she said but i am quite safe thank you i need not trouble you  but suppose the cabman bullies you for double fare persisted cashel i have business up in finchley and your place is right in any way there upon my soul i have he added suspecting that she doubted him i go every tuesday evening to the st johns wood cestus club  i am hungry and in a hurry to got home said lydia i must be gone and live or stay and die come if you will but in any case let us go at once  she got into the cab and cashel followed making some remark which she did not quite catch about its being too dark for any one to recognize him they spoke little during the drive which was soon over bashville was standing at the open door as they came to the house when cashel got out the footman looked at him with interest and some surprise but when lydia alighted he was so startled that he stood openmouthed although he was trained to simulate insensibility to everything except his own business and to do that as automatically as possible cashel bade lydia goodbye and shook hands with her as she went into the house she asked bashville whether miss goff was within to her surprise he paid no attention to her but stared after the retreating cab she repeated the question  madam he said recovering himself with a start she has asked for you four times  lydia relieved of a disagreeable suspicion that her usually faultless footman must be drunk thanked him and went upstairs       chapter viii      one morning a handsome young man elegantly dressed presented himself at downing street and asked to see mr lucian webber he declined to send in a card and desired to be announced simply as bashville lucian ordered him to be admitted at once and when he entered nodded amiably to him and invited him to sit down  i thank you sir said bashville seating himself it struck lucian then from a certain strungup resolution in his visitors manner that he had come on some business of his own and not as he had taken for granted with a message from his mistress  i have come sir on my own responsibility this morning i hope yon will excuse the liberty  certainly if i can do anything for you bashville dont be afraid to ask but be as brief as you can i am so busy that every second i give you will probably be subtracted from my nights rest will ten minutes be enough  more than enough sir thank you i only wish to ask one question i own that i am stepping out of my place to ask it but ill risk all that does miss carew know what the mr cashel byron is that she receives every friday with her other friends  no doubt she does said lucian at once becoming cold in his manner and looking severely at bashville what business is that of yours  do you know what he is sir said bashville returning lucians gaze steadily  lucian changed countenance and replaced a pen that had slipped from a rack on his desk he is not an acquaintance of mine he said i only know him as a friend of lord worthingtons  sir said bashville with sudden vehemence he is no more to lord worthington than the racehorse his lordship bets on i might as well set up to be a friend of his lordship because i after a manner of speaking know him byron is in the ring sir a common prizefighter  lucian recalling what had passed at mrs hoskyns and lord worthingtons sporting habits believed the assertion at once but he made a faint effort to resist conviction are you sure of this bashville he said do you know that your statement is a very serious one  there is no doubt at all about it sir go to any sporting publichouse in london and ask who is the bestknown fighting man of the day and theyll tell you cashel byron i know all about him sir perhaps you have heard tell of ned skene who was champion belike when you were at school  i believe i have heard the name  just so sir ned skene picked up this cashel byron in the streets of melbourne where he was a common sailorboy and trained him for the ring you may have seen his name in the papers sir the sporting ones are full of him and he was mentioned in the times a month ago  i never read articles on such subjects i have hardly time to glance through the ones that concern me  thats the way it is with everybody sir miss carew never thinks of reading the sporting intelligence in the papers and so he passes himself off on her for her equal hes well known for his wish to be thought a gentleman sir i assure you  i have noticed his manner as being odd certainly  odd sir why a child might see through him for he has not the sense to keep his own secret last friday he was in the library and he got looking at the new biographical dictionary that miss carew contributed the article on spinoza to and what do you think he said sir this is a blessed book he says heres ten pages about napoleon bonaparte and not one about jack randall as if one fighting man wasnt as good as another i knew by the way the mistress took up that saying and drew him out so to speak on the subject that she didnt know who she had in her house and then i determined to tell you sir i hope you wont think that i come here behind his back out of malice against him all i want is fair play if i passed myself off on miss carew as a gentleman i should deserve to be exposed as a cheat and when he tries to take advantages that dont belong to him i think i have a right to expose him  quite right quite right said lucian who cared nothing for bashvilles motives i suppose this byron is a dangerous man to have any personal unpleasantness with  he knows his business sir i am a better judge of wrestling than half of these london professionals but i never saw the man that could put a hug on him simple as he is sir he has a genius for fighting and has beaten men of all sizes weights and colors theres a new man from the black country named paradise who says hell beat him but i wont believe it till i see it  well said lucian rising i am much indebted to you bashville for your information and i will take care to let miss carew know how you have  begging your pardon sir said bashville but if you please no i did not come to recommend myself at the cost of another man and perhaps miss carew might not think it any great recommendation neither lucian looked quickly at him and seemed about to speak but checked himself bashville continued if he denies it you may call me as a witness and i will tell him to his face that he liesand so i would if he were twice as dangerous but except in that way i would ask you sir as a favor not to mention my name to miss carew  as you please said lucian taking out his purse perhaps you are right however you shall not have your trouble for nothing  i couldnt really sir said bashville retreating a step you will agree with me im sure that this is not a thing that a man should take payment for it is a personal matter between me and byron sir  lucian displeased that a servant should have any personal feelings on any subject much more one that concerned his mistress put back his purse without comment and said will miss carew be at home this afternoon between three and four  i have not heard of any arrangement to the contrary sir i will telegraph to you if she goes outif you wish  it does not matter thank you goodmorning  goodmorning sir said bashville respectfully as he withdrew outside the door his manner changed he put on a pair of primrose gloves took up a silvermounted walkingstick that he had left in the corridor and walked from downing street into whitehall a party of visitors from the country who were standing there examining the buildings guessed that he was a junior lord of the treasury  he waited in vain that afternoon for lucian to appear at the house in regents park there were no callers and he wore away the time by endeavoring with the aid of a library that miss carew had placed at the disposal of her domestics to unravel the philosophy of spinoza at the end of an hour feeling satisfied that he had mastered that authors views he proceeded to vary the monotony of the long summers day by polishing lydias plate  meanwhile lucian was considering how he could best make lydia not only repudiate cashels acquaintance but feel thoroughly ashamed of herself for having encouraged him and wholesomely mistrustful of her own judgment for the future his parliamentary experience had taught him to provide himself with a few wellarranged relevant facts before attempting to influence the opinions of others on any subject he knew no more of prizefighting than that it was a brutal and illegal practice akin to cockfighting and like it generally supposed to be obsolete knowing how prone lydia was to suspect any received opinion of being a prejudice he felt that he must inform himself more particularly to lord worthingtons astonishment he not only asked him to dinner next evening but listened with interest while he descanted to his hearts content on his favorite topic of the ring  as the days passed bashville became nervous and sometimes wondered whether lydia had met her cousin and heard from him of the interview at downing street he fancied that her manner towards him was changed and he was once or twice on the point of asking the most sympathetic of the housemaids whether she had noticed it on wednesday his suspense ended lucian came and had a long conversation with lydia in the library bashville was too honorable to listen at the door but he felt a strong temptation to do so and almost hoped that the sympathetic housemaid might prove less scrupulous but miss carews influence extended farther than her bodily presence and lucians revelation was made in complete privacy  when he entered the library he looked so serious that she asked him whether he had neuralgia from which he occasionally suffered he replied with some indignation that he had not and that he had a communication of importance to make to her  what another  yes another he said with a sour smile but this time it does not concern myself may i warn you as to the character of one of your guests without overstepping my privilege  certainly but perhaps you mean vernet if so i am perfectly aware that he is an exiled communard  i do not mean monsieur vernet you understand i hope that i do not approve of him nor of your strange fancy for nihilists fenians and other doubtful persons but i think that even you might draw the line at a prizefighter  lydia lost color and said almost inaudibly cashel byron  then you knew exclaimed lucian scandalized  lydia waited a moment to recover settled herself quietly in her chair and replied calmly i know what you tell menothing more and now will you explain to me exactly what a prizefighter is  he is simply what his name indicates he is a man who fights for prizes  so does the captain of a manofwar and yet society does not place them in the same classat least i do not think so  as if there could be any doubt that society does not there is no analogy whatever between the two cases let me endeavor to open your eyes a little if that be possible which i am sometimes tempted to doubt a prizefighter is usually a man of naturally ferocious disposition who has acquired some reputation among his associates as a bully and who by constantly quarrelling has acquired some practice in fighting on the strength of this reputation he can generally find some gambler willing to stake a sum of money that he will vanquish a pugilist of established fame in single combat bets are made between the admirers of the two men a prize is subscribed for each party contributing a share the combatants are trained as racehorses gamecocks or their like are trained they meet and beat each other as savagely as they can until one or the other is too much injured to continue the combat this takes place in the midst of a mob of such persons as enjoy spectacles of the kind that is to say the vilest blackguards whom a large city can afford to leave at large and many whom it cannot as the prizemoney contributed by each side often amounts to upwards of a thousand pounds and as a successful pugilist commands far higher terms for giving tuition in boxing than a tutor at one of the universities does for coaching you will see that such a man while his youth and luck last may have plenty of money and may even by aping the manners of the gentlemen whom he teaches deceive careless peopleespecially those who admire eccentricityas to his character and position  what is his true position i mean before he becomes a prizefighter  well he may be a handicraftsman of some kind a journeyman butcher skinner tailor or baker possibly a soldier sailor policeman gentlemans servant or what not but he is generally a common laborer the waterside is prolific of such heroes  do they never come from a higher rank  never even from the better classes in their own brokendown gentlemen are not likely to succeed at work that needs the strength and endurance of a bull and the cruelty of a butcher  and the end of a prizefighter what is that like  he soon has to give up his trade for if he be repeatedly beaten no one will either bet on him or subscribe to provide him with a stake if he is invariably successful those if any who dare fight him find themselves in a like predicament in either case his occupation is gone if he has saved money he opens a sporting publichouse where he sells spirits of the worst description to his old rivals and their associates and eventually drinks himself to death or bankruptcy if however he has been improvident or unfortunate he begs from his former patrons and gives lessons finally when the patrons are tired of him and the pupils fail he relapses into the laboring class with a ruined constitution a disfigured face a brutalized nature and a tarnished reputation  lydia remained silent so long after this that lucians expression of magisterial severity first deepened then wavered and finally gave way to a sense of injury for she seemed to have forgotten him he was about to protest against this treatment when she looked at him again and said  why did lord worthington introduce a man of this class to me  because you asked him to do so probably he thought that if you chose to make such a request without previous inquiry you should not blame him if you found yourself saddled with an undesirable acquaintance recollect that you asked for the introduction on the platform at wiltstoken in the presence of the man himself such a ruffian would be capable of making a disturbance for much less offence than an explanation and refusal would have given him  lucian said lydia in a tone of gentle admonition i asked to be introduced to my tenant for whose respectability you had vouched by letting the warren lodge to him lucian reddened how does lord worthington explain mr byrons appearance at mrs hoskyns  it was a stupid joke mrs hoskyn had worried worthington to bring some celebrity to her house and in revenge he took his pugilistic protege  hm  i do not defend worthington but discretion is hardly to be expected from him  he has discretion enough to understand a case of this kind thoroughly but let that pass i have been thinking upon what you tell me about these singular people whose existence i hardly knew of before now lucian in the course of my reading i have come upon denunciations of every race and pursuit under the sun very respectable and wellinformed men have held that jews irishmen christians atheists lawyers doctors politicians actors artists flesheaters and spiritdrinkers are all of necessity degraded beings such statements can be easily proved by taking a black sheep from each flock and holding him up as the type it is more reasonable to argue a mans character from the nature of his profession and yet even that is very unsafe war is a cruel business but soldiers are not necessarily bloodthirsty and inhuman men i am not quite satisfied that a prizefighter is a violent and dangerous man because he follows a violent and dangerous professioni suppose they call it a profession  lucian was about to speak but she interrupted him by continuing  and yet that is not what concerns me at present have you found out anything about mr byron personally is he an ordinary representative of his class  no i should rather thinkand hopethat he is a very extraordinary representative of it i have traced his history back to his boyhood when he was a cabinboy having apparently failed to recommend himself to his employers in that capacity he became errandboy to a sort of maitre darmes at melbourne here he discovered where his genius lay and he presently appeared in the ring with an unfortunate young man named ducket whose jaw he fractured this laid the foundation of his fame he fought several battles with unvarying success but at last he allowed his valor to get the better of his discretion so far as to kill an englishman who contended with him with desperate obstinacy for two hours i am informed that the particular blow by which he felled the poor wretch for the last time is known in pugilistic circles as cashels killer and that he has attempted to repeat it in all his subsequent encounters without however achieving the same fatal result the failure has doubtless been a severe disappointment to him he fled from australia and reappeared in america where he resumed his victorious career distinguishing himself specially by throwing a gigantic opponent in some dreadful fashion that these men have and laming him for life he then  thank you lucian said lydia rather faintly that is quite enough are you sure that it is all true  my authority is lord worthington and a number of newspaper reports which he showed me byron himself will probably be proud to give you the fullest confirmation of the record i should add in justice to him that he is looked upon as a modelto pugilistsof temperance and general good conduct  do you remember my remarking a few days ago on another subject how meaningless our observations are until we are given the right thread to string them on  yes said webber disconcerted by the allusion  my acquaintance with this man is a case in point he has obtruded his horrible profession upon me every time we have met i have actually seen him publicly cheered as a pugilisthero and yet being off the track and ignorant of the very existence of such a calling i have looked on and seen nothing  lydia then narrated her adventure in soho and listened with the perfect patience of indifference to his censure of her imprudence in going there alone  and now lydia he added may i ask what you intend to do in this matter  what would you have me do  drop his acquaintance at once forbid him your house in the most explicit terms  a pleasant task said lydia ironically but i will do itnot so much perhaps because he is a prizefighter as because he is an impostor now go to the writingtable and draft me a proper letter to send him  lucians face elongated i think he said you can do that better for yourself it is a delicate sort of thing  yes it is not so easy as you implied a moment ago otherwise i should not require your assistance as it is she pointed again to the table  lucian was not ready with an excuse he sat down reluctantly and after some consideration indited the following  miss carew presents her compliments to mr cashel byron and begs to inform him that she will not be at home during the remainder of the season as heretofore she therefore regrets that she cannot have the pleasure of receiving him on friday afternoon  i think you will find that sufficient said lucian  probably said lydia smiling as she read it but what shall i do if he takes offence calls here breaks the windows and beats bashville were i in his place that is what such a letter would provoke me to do  he dare not give any trouble but i will warn the police if you feel anxious  by no means we must not show ourselves inferior to him in courage which is i suppose his cardinal virtue  if you write the note now i will post it for you  no thank you i will send it with my other letters  lucian would rather have waited but she would not write while he was there so he left satisfied on the whole with the success of his mission when he was gone she took a pen endorsed his draft neatly placed it in a drawer and wrote to cashel thus  dear mr cashel byroni have just discovered your secret i am sorry but you must not come again farewell yours faithfully  lydia carew  lydia kept this note by her until next morning when she read it through carefully she then sent bashville to the post with it       chapter ix      cashels pupils frequently requested him to hit them hardnot to play with themto accustom them to regular right down severe hitting and no nonsense he only pretended to comply for he knew that a black eye or loosened tooth would be immoderately boasted of if received in combat with a famous pugilist and that the sufferers friends would make private notes to avoid so rough a professor but when miss carews note reached him he made an exception to his practice in this respect a young guardsman whose lesson began shortly after the post arrived remarked that cashel was unusually distraught he therefore exhorted his instructor to wake up and pitch into him in earnest immediately he received a blow in the epigastrium that stretched him almost insensible on the floor rising with his complexion considerably whitened he recollected an appointment which would prevent him from finishing his lesson and withdrew declaring in a somewhat shaky voice that that was the sort of bout he really enjoyed  cashel did not at first make any profitable use of the leisure thus earned he walked to and fro cursing and occasionally stopping to read the letter his restlessness only increased his agitation the arrival of a frenchman whom he employed to give lessons in fencing made the place unendurable to him he changed his attire went out called a cab and bade the driver with an oath drive to lydias house as fast as the horse could go the man made all the haste he could and was presently told impatiently that there was no hurry accustomed to this sort of inconsistency he was not surprised when as they approached the house he was told not to stop but to drive slowly past then in obedience to further instructions he turned and repassed the door as he did so a lady appeared for an instant at a window immediately his fare with a groan of mingled rage and fear sprang from the moving vehicle rushed up the steps of the mansion and rang the bell violently bashville faultlessly dressed and impassibly mannered opened the door in reply to cashels halfinarticulate inquiry he said  miss carew is not at home  you lie said cashel his eyes suddenly dilating i saw her  bashville reddened but replied coolly miss carew cannot see you today  go and ask her returned cashel sternly advancing  bashville with compressed lips seized the door to shut him out but cashel forced it back against him sent him reeling some paces by its impact went in and shut the door behind him he had to turn from bashville for a moment to do this and before he could face him again he was clutched tripped and flung down upon the tessellated pavement of the hall  when cashel gave him the lie and pushed the door against him the excitement he had been suppressing since his visit to lucian exploded he had thrown cashel in cornish fashion and now desperately awaited the upshot  cashel got up so rapidly that he seemed to rebound from the flags bashville involuntarily cowering before his onslaught just escaped his right fist and felt as though his heart had been drawn with it as it whizzed past his ear he turned and fled frantically upstairs mistaking for the clatter of pursuit the noise with which cashel overbalanced by his ineffectual blow stumbled against the banisters  lydia was in her boudoir with alice when bashville darted in and locked the door alice rose and screamed lydia though startled and that less by the unusual action than by the change in a familiar face which she had never seen influenced by emotion before sat still and quietly asked what was the matter bashville checked himself for a moment then he spoke unintelligibly and went to the window which he opened lydia divined that he was about to call for help to the street  bashville she said authoritatively be silent and close the window i will go downstairs myself  bashville then ran to prevent her from unlocking the door but she paid no attention to him he did not dare to oppose her forcibly he was beginning to recover from his panic and to feel the first stings of shame for having yielded to it  madam he said byron is below and he insists on seeing you hes dangerous and hes too strong for me i have done my beston my honor i have let me call the police stop he added as she opened the door if either of us goes it must be me  i will see him in the library said lydia composedly tell him so and let him wait there for meif you can approach him without running any risk  oh pray let him call the police urged alice dont attempt to go to that man  nonsense said lydia goodhumoredly i am not in the least afraid we must not fail in courage when we have a prizefighter to deal with  bashville white and preventing with difficulty his knees from knocking together went downstairs and found cashel leaning upon the balustrade panting and looking perplexedly about him as he wiped his dabbled brow bashville approached him with the firmness of a martyr halted on the third stair and said  miss carew will see you in the library come this way please  cashels lips moved but no sound came from them he followed bashville in silence when they entered the library lydia was already there bashville withdrew without a word then cashel sat down and to her consternation bent his head on his hand and yielded to an hysterical convulsion before she could resolve how to act he looked up at her with his face distorted and discolored and tried to speak  pray be calm said lydia i am told that you wish to speak to me  i dont wish to speak to you ever again said cashel hoarsely you told your servant to throw me down the steps thats enough for me  lydia caught from him the tendency to sob which he was struggling with but she repressed it and answered firmly if my servant has been guilty of the least incivility to you mr cashel byron he has exceeded his orders  it doesnt matter said cashel he may thank his luck that he has his head on if i had planted on him that timebut he doesnt matter hold on a biti cant talki shall get my second wind presently and then cashel stopped a moment to pant and then asked why are you going to give me up  lydia ranged her wits in battle array and replied  do you remember our conversation at mrs hoskyns  yes  you admitted then that if the nature of your occupation became known to me our acquaintance should cease that has now come to pass  that was all very fine talk to excuse my not telling you but i find like many another man when put to the proof that i didnt mean it who told you i was a fighting man  i had rather not tell you that  aha said cashel with a triumph that was half choked by the remnant of his hysteria who is trying to make a secret now i should like to know  i do so in this instance because i am afraid to expose a friend to your resentment  and why hes a man of course else you wouldnt be afraid you think that id go straight off and murder him perhaps he told you that it would come quite natural to a man like mea ruffian like meto smash him up that comes of being a coward people run my profession down not because there is a bad one or two in ittheres plenty of bad bishops if you come to thatbut because theyre afraid of us you may make yourself easy about your friend i am accustomed to get well paid for the beatings i give and your own commonsense ought to tell you that any one who is used to being paid for a job is just the last person in the world to do it for nothing  i find the contrary to be the case with firstrate artists said lydia  thank you retorted cashel sarcastically i ought to make you a bow for that im glad you acknowledge that it is an art  but said lydia seriously it seems to me that it is an art wholly antisocial and retrograde and i fear that you have forced this interview on me to no purpose  i dont know whether its antisocial or not but i think it hard that i should be put out of decent society when fellows that do far worse than i are let in who did i see here last friday the most honored of your guests why that frenchman with the gold spectacles what do you think i was told when i asked what his little game was baking dogs in ovens to see how long a dog could live red hot id like to catch him doing it to a dog of mine ay and sticking a rat full of nails to see how much pain a rat could stand why its just sickening do you think id have shaken hands with that chap if he hadnt been a guest of yours id have given him a notion of how much pain a frenchman can stand without any nails in him and hes to be received and made much of while i am kicked out look at your relation the general what is he but a fighting man i should like to know isnt it his pride and boast that as long as he is paid so much a day hell ask no questions whether a war is fair or unfair but just walk out and put thousands of men in the best way to kill and be killedkeeping well behind them himself all the time mind you last year he was up to his chin in the blood of a lot of poor blacks that were no more a match for his armed men than a featherweight would be for me bad as i am i wouldnt attack a featherweight or stand by and see another heavy man do it plenty of your friends go pigeonshooting to hurlingham theres a humane and manly way of spending a saturday afternoon lord worthington that comes to see you when he likes though hes too much of a man or too little of a shot to kill pigeons thinks nothing of foxhunting do you think foxes like to be hunted or that the people that hunt them have such fine feelings that they can afford to call prizefighters names look at the men that get killed or lamed every year at steeplechasing foxhunting cricket and football dozens of them look at the thousands killed in battle did you ever hear of any one being killed in the ring why from first to last during the whole century that prizefighting has been going on theres not been six fatal accidents at really respectable fights its safer than dancing many a woman has danced her skirt into the fire and been burned i once fought a man who had spoiled his constitution with bad living and he exhausted himself so by going on and on long after he was beaten that he died of it and nearly finished me too if youd heard the fuss that even the oldest fighting men made over it youd have thought that a baby had died from falling out of its cradle a good milling does a man more good than harm and if all thesedogbakers and soldiers and pigeonshooters and foxhunters and the rest of themare made welcome here why am i shut out like a brute beast  truly i do not know said lydia puzzled unless it be that your colleagues have failed to recommend themselves to society by their extraprofessional conduct as the others have  i grant you that fighting men arnt gentlemen as a rule no more were painters or poets once upon a time but what i want to know is this supposing a fighting man has as good manners as your friends and is as well born why shouldnt he mix with them and be considered their equal  the distinction seems arbitrary i confess but perhaps the true remedy would be to exclude the vivisectors and soldiers instead of admitting the prizefighters mr cashel byron added lydia changing her manner i cannot discuss this with you society has a prejudice against you i share it and i cannot overcome it can you find no nobler occupation than these fierce and horrible encounters by which you condescend to gain a living  no said cashel flatly i cant thats just where it is  lydia looked grave and said nothing  you dont see it said cashel well ill just tell you all about myself and then leave you to judge may i sit down while i talk he had risen in the course of his remarks on lydias scientific and military acquaintances  she pointed to a chair near her something in the action brought color to his cheeks  i believe i was the most unfortunate devil of a boy that ever walked he began when he was seated my mother wasand isan actress and a tiptop crack in her profession one of the first things i remember is sitting on the floor in the corner of a room where there was a big glass and she flaring away before it attitudinizing and spouting shakespeare like mad i was afraid of her because she was very particular about my manners and appearance and would never let me go near a theatre i know very little about either my people or hers for she boxed my ears one day for asking who my father was and i took good care not to ask her again she was quite young when i was a child at first i thought her a sort of angeli should have been fond of her i think if she had let me but she didnt somehow and i had to keep my affection for the servants i had plenty of variety in that way for she gave her whole establishment the sack about once every two months except a maid who used to bully her and gave me nearly all the nursing i ever got i believe it was my crying about some housemaid or other who went away that first set her abusing me for having low tastesa sort of thing that used to cut me to the heart and which she kept up till the very day i left her for good we were a precious pair i sulky and obstinate she changeable and hottempered she used to begin breakfast sometimes by knocking me to the other side of the room with a slap and finish it by calling me her darling boy and promising me all manner of toys and things i soon gave up trying to please her or like her and became as disagreeable a young imp as youd ask to see my only thought was to get all i could out of her when she was in a goodhumor and to be sullen and stubborn when she was in a tantrum one day a boy in the street threw some mud at me and i ran in crying and complained to her she told me i was a little coward i havent forgiven her for that yetperhaps because it was one of the few true things she ever said to me i was in a state of perpetual aggravation and i often wonder that i wasnt soured for life at that time at last i got to be such a little fiend that when she hit me i used to guard off her blows and look so wicked that i think she got afraid of me then she put me to school telling me that i had no heart and telling the master that i was an ungovernable young brute so i like a little fool cried at leaving her and she like a big one cried back again over mejust after telling the master what a bad one i was mind youand off she went leaving her darling boy and blessed child howling at his good luck in getting rid of her  i was a nice boy to let loose in a school i could speak as well as an actor as far as pronunciation goes but i could hardly read words of one syllabile and as to writing i couldnt make pothooks and hangers respectably to this day i can no more spell than old ned skene can what was a worse sort of ignorance was that i had no idea of fair play i thought that all servants would be afraid of me and that all grownup people would tyrannize over me i was afraid of everybody afraid that my cowardice would be found out and as angry and cruel in my illtempers as cowards always are now youll hardly believe this but what saved me from going to the bad altogether was my finding out that i was a good one to fight the bigger boys were given to fighting and used to have mills every saturday afternoon with seconds bottleholders and everything complete except the ropes and stakes we little chaps used to imitate them among ourselves as best we could at first when they made me fight i shut my eyes and cried but for all that i managed to catch the other fellow tight round the waist and throw him after that it became a regular joke to make me fight for i always cried but the end of it was that i learned to keep my eyes open and hit straight i had no trouble about fighting then somehow i could tell by instinct when the other fellow was going to hit me and i always hit him first its the same with me now in the ring i know what a man is going to do before he rightly knows himself the power that this gave me civilized me it made me cock of the school and i had to act accordingly i had enough goodnature left to keep me from being a bully and as cock i couldnt be mean or childish there would be nothing like fighting for licking boys into shape if every one could be cock but every one cant so i suppose it does more harm than good  i should have enjoyed school well enough if i had worked at my books but i wouldnt study and the masters were all down on me as an idlerthough i shouldnt have been like that if they had known how to teachi have learned since what teaching is as to the holidays they were the worst part of the year to me when i was left at school i was savage at not being let go home and when i went home my mother did nothing but find fault with my schoolboy manners i was getting too big to be cuddled as her darling boy you understand in fact her treatment of me was just the old game with the affectionate part left out it wasnt pleasant after being cock of the school to be made feel like a goodfornothing little brat tied to her apronstrings when she saw that i was learning nothing she sent me to another school at a place in the north called panley i stayed there until i was seventeen and then she came one day and we had a row as usual she said she wouldnt let me leave school until i was nineteen and so i settled that question by running away the same night i got to liverpool where i hid in a ship bound for australia when i was starved out they treated me better than i expected and i worked hard enough to earn my passage and my victuals but when i wad left ashore in melbourne i was in a pretty pickle i knew nobody and i had no money everything that a man could live by was owned by some one or other i walked through the town looking for a place where they might want a boy to run errands or to clean windows but somehow i hadnt the cheek to go into the shops and ask two or three times when i was on the point of trying i caught sight of some cad of a shopman and made up my mind that i wouldnt be ordered about by him and that since i had the whole town to choose from i might as well go on to the next place at last quite late in the afternoon i saw an advertisement stuck up on a gymnasium and while i was reading it i got talking to old ned skene the owner who was smoking at the door he took a fancy to me and offered to have me there as a sort of ladofallwork i was only too glad to get the chance and i closed with him at once as time went on i became so clever with the gloves that ned matched me against a lightweight named ducket and bet a lot of money that i would win well i couldnt disappoint him after his being so kind to memrs skene had made as much of me as if i was her own son what could i do but take my bread as it came to me i was fit for nothing else even if i had been able to write a good hand and keep accounts i couldnt have brought myself to think that quilldriving and counting other peoples money was a fit employment for a man its not what a man would like to do that he must do in this world its what he can do and the only mortal thing i could do properly was to fight there was plenty of money and plenty of honor and glory among my acquaintances to be got by fighting so i challenged ducket and knocked him all to pieces in about ten minutes i half killed him because i didnt know my own strength and was afraid of him i have been at the same work ever since i was training for a fight when i was down at wiltstoken and mellish was my trainer it came off the day you saw me at clapham that was how i came to have a black eye wiltstoken did for me with all my nerve and science im no better than a baby at heart and ever since i found out that my mother wasnt an angel i have always had a notion that a real angel would turn up some day you see i never cared much for women bad as my mother was as far as being what you might call a parent went she had something in her looks and manners that gave me a better idea of what a nice woman was like than i had of most things and the girls i met in australia and america seemed very small potatoes to me in comparison with her besides of course they were not ladies i was fond of mrs skene because she was good to me and i made myself agreeable for her sake to the girls that came to see her but in reality i couldnt stand them mrs skene said that they were all setting their caps at mewomen are death on a crack fighterbut the more they tried it on the less i liked them it was no go i could get on with the men well enough no matter how common they were but the snobbishness of my breed came out with regard to the women when i saw you that day at wiltstoken walk out of the trees and stand looking so quietly at me and mellish and then go back out of sight without a word im blessed if i didnt think you were the angel come at last then i met you at the railway station and walked with you you put the angel out of my head quick enough for an angel after all is only a shadowy childish notioni believe its all gammon about there being any in heavenbut you gave me a better idea than mamma of what a woman should be and you came up to that idea and went beyond it i have been in love with you ever since and if i cant have you i dont care what becomes of me i know i am a bad lot and have always been one but when i saw you taking pleasure in the society of fellows just as bad as myself i didnt see why i should keep away when i was dying to come i am no worse than the dogbaker any how and hang it miss lydia i dont want to brag but i never fought a cross or struck a foul blow in my life and i have never been beaten though im only a middleweight and have stood up with the best fourteenstone men in the colonies the states or in england  cashel ceased as he sat eying her wistfully lydia who had been perfectly still said musingly  strange that i should be so much more prejudiced than i knew what will you think of me when i tell you that your profession does not seem half so shocking now that i know you to be the son of an artist and not a journeyman butcher or a laborer as my cousin told me  what exclaimed cashel that lanternjawed fellow told you i was a butcher  i did not mean to betray him but as i have already said i am bad at keeping secrets mr lucian webber is my cousin and friend and has done me many services may i rest assured that he has nothing to fear from you  he has no right to tell lies about me he is sweet on you too i twigged that at wiltstoken i have a good mind to let him know whether i am a butcher or not  he did not say so what he told me of you as far as it went is exactly confirmed by what you have said yourself but i happened to ask him to what class men of your calling usually belonged and he said that they were laborers butchers and so forth do you resent that  i see plainly enough that you wont let me resent it i should like to know what else he said of me but he was right enough about the butchers there are all sorts of blackguards in the ring theres no use in denying it since its been made illegal decent men wont go into it but all the same its not the fighting men but the betting men that bring discredit on it i wish your cousin had held his confounded tongue  i wish you had forestalled him by telling me the truth  i wish i had now but whats the use of wishing i didnt dare run the chance of losing you see how soon you forbade me the house when you did find out  it made little difference said lydia gravely  you were always friendly to me said cashel plaintively  more so than you were to me you should not have deceived me and now i think we had better part i am glad to know your history and i admit that when you embraced your profession you made perhaps the best choice that society offered you i do not blame you  but you give me the sack is that it  what do you propose mr cashel byron is it to visit my house in the intervals of battering and maiming butchers and laborers  no its not retorted cashel youre very aggravating i wont stay much longer in the ring now because my luck is too good to last i shall have to retire soon luck or no luck because no one can match me even now theres nobody except bill paradise that pretends to be able for me and ill settle him in september if he really means business after that ill retire i expect to be worth ten thousand pounds then ten thousand pounds im told is the same as five hundred a year well i suppose judging from the style you keep here that youre worth as much more besides your place in the country so if you will marry me we shall have a thousand a year between us i dont know much of money matters but at any rate we can live like fightingcocks on that much thats a straight and businesslike proposal isnt it  and if i refuse said lydia with some sternness  then you may have the ten thousand pounds to do what you like with said cashel despairingly it wont matter what becomes of me i wont go to the devil for you or any woman if i can help it and ibut wheres the good of saying if you refuse i know i dont express myself properly im a bad hand at sentimentality but if i had as much gab as a poet i couldnt be any fonder of you or think more highly of you  but you are mistaken as to the amount of my income  that doesnt matter a bit if you have more why the more the merrier if you have less or if you have to give up all your property when youre married i will soon make another ten thousand to supply the loss only give me one good word and by george ill fight the seven champions of christendom one down and tother come on for five thousand a side each hang the money  i am richer than you suppose said lydia unmoved i cannot tell you exactly how much i possess but my income is about forty thousand pounds  forty thousand pounds ejaculated cashel  holy moses i didnt think the queen had so much as that  he paused a moment and became very red then in a voice broken by mortification he said i see i have been making a fool of myself and took his hat and turned to go  it does not follow that you should go at once without a word said lydia betraying nervousness for the first time during the interview  oh thats all rot said cashel i may be a fool while my eyes are shut but im sensible enough when theyre open i have no business here i wish to the lord i had stayed in australia  perhaps it would have been better said lydia troubled but since we have met it is useless to deplore it andlet me remind you of one thing you have pointed out to me that i have made friends of men whose pursuits are no better than yours i do not wholly admit that but there is one respect in which they are on the same footing as you they are all as far as worldly gear is concerned much poorer than i many of them i fear are much poorer than you are  cashel looked up quickly with returning hope but it lasted only a moment he shook his head dejectedly  i am at least grateful to you she continued because you have sought me for my own sake knowing nothing of my wealth  i should think not groaned cashel your wealth may be a very fine thing for the other fellows and im glad you have it for your own sake but its a settler for me its knocked me out of time so it has i shant come up again and the sooner the sponge is chucked up in my corner the better so goodbye  goodbye said lydia almost as pale as he had now become since you will have it so  since the devil will have it so said cashel ruefully its no use wishing to have it any other way the luck is against me i hope miss carew that youll excuse me for making such an ass of myself its all my blessed innocence i never was taught any better  i have no quarrel with you except on the old score of hiding the truth from me and that i forgive youas far as the evil of it affects me as for your declaration of attachment to me personally i have received many similar ones that have flattered me less but there are certain scruples between us you will not court a woman a hundredfold richer than yourself and i will not entertain a prizefighter my wealth frightens every man who is not a knave and your profession frightens every woman who is not a fury  then youjust tell me this said cashel eagerly suppose i were a rich swell and were not a  no said lydia peremptorily interrupting him i will suppose nothing but what is  cashel relapsed into melancholy if you only hadnt been kind to me he said i think the reason i love you so much is that youre the only person that is not afraid of me other people are civil because they darent be otherwise to the cock of the ring its a lonely thing to be a champion you knew nothing about that and you knew i was afraid of you and yet you were as good as gold  it is also a lonely thing to be a very rich woman people are afraid of my wealth and of what they call my learning we two have at least one experience in common now do me a great favor by going we have nothing further to say  ill go in two seconds but i dont believe much in your being lonely thats only fancy  perhaps so most feelings of this kind are only fancies  there was a pause then cashel said  i dont feel half so downhearted as i did a minute ago are you sure that youre not angry with me  quite sure pray let me say goodbye  and may i never see you again never at allworld without end amen  never as the famous prizefighter but if a day should come when mr cashel byron will be something better worthy of his birth and nature i will not forget an old friend are you satisfied now  cashels face began to glow and the roots of his hair to tingle one thing more he said if you meet me by chance in the street before that will you give me a look i dont ask for a regular bow but just a look to keep me going  i have no intention of cutting you said lydia gravely but do not place yourself purposely in my way  honor bright i wont ill content myself with walking through that street in soho occasionally now im off i know youre in a hurry to be rid of me so goodbstop a bit though perhaps when that time you spoke of comes you will be married  it is possible but i am not likely to marry how many more things have you to say that you have no right to say  not one said cashel with a laugh that rang through the house i never was happier in my life though im crying inside all the time ill have a try for you yet goodbye no he added turning from her proffered hand i darent touch it i should eat you afterwards and he ran out of the room  in the hall was bashville pale and determined waiting there to rush to the assistance of his mistress at her first summons he had a poker concealed at hand having just heard a great laugh and seeing cashel come downstairs in high spirits he stood stock still and did not know what to think  well old chap said cashel boisterously slapping him on the shoulder so youre alive yet is there any one in the diningroom  no said bashville  theres a thick carpet there to fall soft on said cashel pulling bashville into the room come along now show me that little trick of yours again come dont be afraid down with me take care you dont knock my head against the fireirons  but  but be hanged you were spry enough at it before come  bashville after a moments hesitation seized cashel who immediately became grave and attentive and remained imperturbably so while nashville expertly threw him he sat for a moment thinking on the hearthrug before he rose i see he said then getting up now do it again  but it makes such a row remonstrated bashville  only once more therell be no row this time  well you are an original sort of cove said bashville complying but instead of throwing his man he found himself wedged into a collar formed by cashels arms the least constriction of which would have strangled him cashel again roared with laughter as he released him  thats the way aint it he said you cant catch an old fox twice in the same trap do you know any more falls  i do said bashville but i really cant show them to you here i shall get into trouble on account of the noise  you can come down to me whenever you have an evening out said cashel handing him a card to that address and show me what you know and ill see what i can do with you theres the making of a man in you  youre very kind said bashville pocketing the card with a grin  and now let me give you a word of advice that will be of use to you as long as you live said cashel impressively you did a very silly thing today you threw a man downa fightingmanand then stood looking at him like a fool waiting for him to get up and kill you if ever you do that again fall on him as heavily as you can the instant hes off his legs drop your shoulder well into him and if he pulls you over make play with the back of your head if hes altogether too big for you put your knee on his throat as if by accident but on no account stand and do nothing its flying in the face of providence  cashel emphasized these counsels by taps of his forefinger on one of bashvilles buttons in conclusion he nodded opened the housedoor and walked away in buoyant spirits  lydia standing year the library window saw him pass and observed how his light alert step and a certain gamesome assurance of manner marked him off from a genteelly promenading middleaged gentleman a trudging workman and a vigorously striding youth who were also passing by the iron railings through which she saw him reminded her of the admirable and dangerous creatures which were passing and repassing behind iron bars in the park yonder but she exulted in her quiet manner in the thought that dangerous as he was she had no fear of him when his cabman had found him and driven him off she went to her desk opened a private drawer in it took out her falhers last letter and sat for some time looking at it without unfolding it  it would be a strange thing father she said as if he were actually there to hear her if your paragon should turn aside from her friends the artists philosophers and statesmen to give herself to an illiterate prizefighter i felt a pang of absolute despair when he replied to my forty thousand pounds a year with an unanswerable goodbye  she locked up her father as it were in the drawer again and rang the bell bashville appeared somewhat perturbed  if mr byron calls again admit him if i am at home  yes madam  thank you  begging your pardon madam but may i ask has any complaint been made of me  none bashville was reluctantly withdrawing when she added mr byron gave me to understand that you tried to prevent his entrance by force you exposed yourself to needless risk by doing so and you may make a rule in future that when people are importunate and will not go away when asked they had better come in until you get special instructions from me i am not finding fault on the contrary i approve of your determination to carry out your orders but under exceptional circumstances you may use your own discretion  he shoved the door into my face and i acted on the impulse of the moment madam i hope you will forgive the liberty i took in locking the door of the boudoir he is older and heavier than i am madam and he has the advantage of being a professional else i should have stood my ground  i am quite satisfied said lydia a little coldly as she left the room  how long you have been cried alice almost in hysterics as lydia entered is he gone what were those dreadful noises is anything the matter  dancing and late hours are the matter said lydia coolly the season is proving too much for you alice  it is not the season it is the man said alice with a sob  indeed i have been in conversation with the man for more than half an hour and bashville has been in actual combat with him yet we are not in hysterics you have been sitting here at your ease have yon not  i am not in hysterics said alice indignantly  so much the better said lydia gravely placing her hand on the forehead of alice who subsided with a sniff       chapter x      mrs byron under her stage name of adelaide gisborne was now for the second time in her career much talked of in london where she had boon for many years almost forgotten the metropolitan managers of her own generation had found that her success in new parts was very uncertain that she was more capricious than the most petted favorites of the public and that her invariable reply to a business proposal was that she detested the stage and was resolved never to set foot upon it again so they had managed to do without her for so long that the younger london playgoers knew her by reputation only as an oldfashioned actress who wandered through the provinces palming herself off on the ignorant inhabitants as a great artist and boring them with performances of the plays of shakespeare it suited mrs byron well to travel with the nucleus of a dramatic company from town to town staying a fortnight in each and repeating half a dozen characters in which she was very effective and which she knew so well that she never thought about them except when as indeed often happened she had nothing else to think about most of the provincial populations received her annual visits with enthusiasm among them she found herself more excitingly applauded before the curtain her authority more despotic behind it her expenses smaller and her gains greater than in london for which she accordingly cared as little as london cared for her as she grew older she made more money and spent less when she complained to cashel of the cost of his education she was rich since he had relieved her of that cost she had visited america egypt india and the colonies and had grown constantly richer from this great tour she had returned to england on the day when cashel added the laurels of the flying dutchman to his trophies and the next sundays paper had its sporting column full of the prowess of cashel byron and its theatrical column full of the genius of adelaide gisborne but she never read sporting columns nor he theatrical ones  the managers who had formerly avoided mrs byron were by this time dead bankrupt or engaged in less hazardous pursuits one of their successors had lately restored shakespeare to popularity as signally as cashel had restored the prize ring he was anxious to produce the play of king john being desirous of appearing as faulconbridge a part for which he was physically unfitted though he had no suspicion of his unfitness he was awake to the fact that the favorite london actresses though admirable in modern comedy were not mistresses of what he called after sir walter scott the big bow wow style required for the part of lady constance in shakespeares history he knew that he could find in the provinces many veteran players who knew every gesture and inflection of voice associated by tradition with the part but he was afraid that they would remind londoners of richardsons show and get faulconbridge laughed at then he thought of adelaide gisborne for some hours after the idea came to him he was gnawed at by the fear that her performance would throw his into the shade but his confidence in his own popularity helped his love of good acting to prevail and he made the newly returned actress a tempting offer instigating some journalist friends of his at the same time to lament over the decay of the grand school of acting and to invent or republish anecdotes of mrs siddons  this time mrs byron said nothing about detesting the stage she had really detested it once but by the time she was rich enough to give up the theatre she had worn that feeling out and had formed a habit of acting which was as irksome to shake off as any other habit she also found a certain satisfaction in making money with ease and certainty and she made so much that at last she began to trifle with plans of retirement of playing in paris of taking a theatre in london and other whims the chief public glory of her youth had been a sudden triumph in london on the occasion of her first appearance on any stage and she now felt a mind to repeat this and crown her career where it had begun so she accepted the managers offer and even went the length of reading the play of king john in order to ascertain what it was all about  the work of advertisement followed her assent portraits of adelaide gisborne were displayed throughout the town paragraphs in the papers mentioned large sums as the cost of mounting the historical masterpiece of the national bard all the available seats in the theatreexcept some six or seven hundred in the pit and gallerywere said to be already disposed of for the first month of the expected run of the performance the prime minister promised to be present on the opening night absolute archaeologic accuracy was promised old paintings were compared to ascertain the dresses of the period a scene into which the artist had incautiously painted a pointed arch was condemned as an anachronism many noblemen gave the actormanager access to their collections of armor and weapons in order that his accoutrement should exactly counterfeit that of a norman baron nothing remained doubtful except the quality of the acting  it happened that one of the most curious documents of the period in question was a scrap of vellum containing a fragment of a chronicle of prince arthur with an illuminated portrait of his mother it had been purchased for a trifling sum by the late mr carew and was now in the possession of lydia to whom the actormanager applied for leave to inspect it leave being readily given he visited the house in regents park which he declared to be an inexhaustible storehouse of treasure he deeply regretted he said that he could not show the portrait to miss gisborne lydia replied that if miss gisborne would come and look at it she should be very welcome two days later at noon mrs byron arrived and found lydia alone alice having contrived to be out as she felt that it was better not to meet an actressone could never tell what they might have been  the years that had elapsed since mrs byrons visit to dr moncrief had left no perceptible trace on her indeed she looked younger now than on that occasion because she had been at the trouble of putting on an artificial complexion her careless refinement of manner was so different from the studied dignity and anxious courtesy of the actormanager that lydia could hardly think of them as belonging to the same profession her voice was not her stage voice it gave a subtle charm to her most commonplace remarks and it was as different as possible from cashels rough tones yet lydia was convinced by the first note of it that she was cashels mother besides their eyes were so like that they might have made an exchange without altering their appearance  mrs byron coming to the point without delay at once asked to see the drawing lydia brought her to the library were several portfolios were ready for inspection the precious fragment of vellum was uppermost  very interesting indeed said mrs byron throwing it aside after one glance at it and turning over some later prints while lydia amused looked on in silence ah she said presently here is something that will suit me exactly i shall not trouble to go through the rest of your collection thank you they must do that robe for me in violet silk what is your opinion of it miss carew i have noticed from one or two trifles that your taste is exquisite  for what character do you intend the dress  constance in king john  but silk was not made in western europe until three hundred years after constances death and that drawing is a sketch of marie de medicis by rubens  never mind said mrs byron smoothly what does a dress three hundred years out of date matter when the woman inside it is seven hundred years out what can be a greater anachronism than the death of prince arthur three months hence on the stage of the panopticon theatre i am an artist giving life to a character in romance i suppose certainly not a grownup child playing at being somebody out of mrs markhams history of england i wear whatever becomes me i cannot act when i feel dowdy  but what will the manager say  i doubt if he will say anything he will hardly venture to press on me anything copied from that old parchment as he will wear a suit of armor obviously made the other day in birmingham why mrs byron shrugged her shoulders and did not take sufficient interest in the managers opinion to finish her sentence  after all shakespeare concerned himself very little about such matters said lydia conversationally  no doubt i seldom read him  is this part of lady constance a favorite one of yours  troublesome my dear said mrs byron absently the men look ridiculous in it and it does not draw  no doubt said lydia watching her face but i spoke rather of your personal feeling towards the character do you for instance like portraying maternal tenderness on the stage  maternal tenderness said mrs byron with sudden nobleness is far too sacred a thing to be mimicked have you any children  no said lydia demurely i am not married  of course not you should get married maternity is a liberal education in itself  do you think that it suits every woman  undoubtedly without exception only think dear miss carew of the infinite patieuce with which you must tend a child of the necessity of seeing with its little eyes and with your own wise ones at the same time of bearing without reproach the stabs it innocently inflicts of forgiving its hundred little selfishnesses of living in continual fear of wounding its exquisite sensitiveness or rousing its bitter resentment of injustice and caprice think of how you must watch yourself check yourself exercise and develop everything in you that can help to attract and retain the most jealous love in the world believe me it is a priceless trial to be a mother it is a royal compensation for having been born a woman  nevertheless said lydia i wish i had been born a man since you seem to have thought deeply into these problems i will venture to ask you a question do you not think that the acquirement of an art demanding years of careful selfstudy and trainingsuch as yours for exampleis also of great educational value almost a sufficient discipline to make one a good mother  nonsense said mrs byron decidedly people come into the world readymade i went on the stage when i was eighteen and succeeded at once had i known anything of the world or been four years older i should have been weak awkward timid and flat it would have taken me twelve years to crawl to the front but i was young passionate beautiful and indeed terrible for i had run away from home two years before and been cruelly deceived i learned the business of the stage as easily and thoughtlessly as a child learns a prayer the rest came to me by nature i have seen others spend years in struggling with bad voices uncouth figures and diffidence besides a dozen defects that existed only in their imaginations their struggles may have educated them but had they possessed sufficient genius they would have had neither struggle nor education perhaps that is why geniuses are such erratic people and mediocrities so respectable i grant you that i was very limited when i first came out i was absolutely incapable of comedy but i never took any trouble about it and by and by when i began to mature a little and to see the absurdity of most of the things i had been making a fuss about comedy came to me unsought as romantic tragedy had come before i suppose it would have come just the same if i had been laboring to acquire it except that i would have attributed its arrival to my own exertions most of the laborious people think they have made themselves what they aremuch as if a child should think it had made itself grow  you are the first artist i ever met said lydia who did not claim art as the most laborious of all avocations they all deny the existence of genius and attribute everything to work  of course one picks up a great deal from experience and there is plenty of work on the stage but it in my genius which enables me to pick up things and to work on the stage instead of in a kitchen or laundry  you must be very fond of your profession  i do not mind it now i have shrunk to fit it i began because i couldnt help myself and i go on because being an old woman i have nothing else to do bless me how i hated it after the first month i must retire soon now people are growing weary of me  i doubt that i am bound to assume that you are an old woman since you say so but you must be aware flattery apart that you hardly seem to have reached your prime yet  i might be your mother my dear i might be a grand mother perhaps i am there was a plaintive tone in the last sentence and lydia seized the opportunity  you spoke of maternity then from experience miss gisborne  i have one sona son who was sent to me in my eighteenth year  i hope he inherits his mothers genius and personal grace  i am sure i dont know said mrs byron pensively he was a perfect devil i fear i shock you miss carew but really i did everything for him that the most devoted mother could do and yet he ran away from me without making a sign of farewell little wretch  boys do cruel things sometimes in a spirit of adventure said lydia watching her visitors face narrowly  it was not that it was his temper which was ungovernable he was sulky and vindictive it is quite impossible to love a sulky child i kept him constantly near me when he was a tiny creature and when he got too big for that i spent oceans of money on his education all in vain he never showed any feeling towards me except a sense of injury that no kindness could remove and he had nothing to complain of never was there a worse son  lydia remained silent and grave mrs byron looked rather beside her than at her suddenly she added  my poor darling cashel lydia suppressed a start what a shame to talk of you so you see i love him in spite of his wickedness mrs byron took out her handkerchief and lydia for a moment was alarmed by the prospect of tears but miss gisborne only blew her nose with perfect composure and rose to take her leave lydia who apart from her interest in cashels mother was attracted and amused by the woman herself induced her to stay for luncheon and presently discovered from her conversation that she had read much romance of the werther sort in her youth and had since then employed her leisure in reading every book that came in her way without regard to its quality her acquirements were so odd and her character so unreasonable that lydia whose knowledge was unusually well organized and who was eminently reasonable concluded that she was a woman of genius for lydia knew the vanity of her own attainments and believed herself to be merely a patient and welltaught plodder mrs byron happening to be pleased with the house the luncheon and lydias intelligent listening her unaccountable natural charm became so intensified by her goodhumor that lydia became conscious of it and began to wonder what its force might have been if some influencethat of a lover for instancehad ever made mrs byron ecstatically happy she surprised herself at last in the act of speculating whether she could ever make cashel love her as his father must for a time at least have loved her visitor  when lydia was alone she considered whether she was justified in keeping mrs byron apart from her son it seemed plain that at present cashel was a disgrace to his mother and had better remain hidden from her but if he should for any reason abandon his ruffianly pursuits as she had urged him to do then she could bring about a meeting between them and the truants mother might take better care of him in the future besides making him pecuniarily independent of prizefighting this led lydia to ask what new profession cashel could adopt and what likelihood there was of his getting on with his mother any better than formerly no satisfactory answer was forthcoming so she went back to the likelihood of his reforming himself for her sake on this theme her imagination carried her so far from all reasonable probability that she was shaking her head at her own folly when bashville appeared and announced lord worthington who came into the room with alice lydia had not seen him since her discovery of the true position of the tenant he had introduced to her and he was consequently a little afraid to meet her to cover his embarrassment he began to talk quickly on a number of commonplace topics but when some time had elapsed he began to show signs of fresh uneasiness he looked at his watch and said  i dont wish to hurry you ladies but this affair commences at three  what affair said lydia who had been privately wondering why he had come  the assaultatarms king whatshisnames affair webber told me he had arranged that you should come with me  oh you have come to take us there i had forgotten did i promise to go  webber said so he was to have taken you himself but failing that he promised to do a good thing for me and put me in his place he said you particularly wanted to go hang him  lydia then rose promptly and sent for her carriage there is no hurry bhe said we can drive to st jamess hall in twelve minutes  hut we have to go to islington to the agricultural hall there will be cavalry charges and all sorts of fun  bless me said lydia will there be any boxing  yes said lord worthington reddening but unabashed lots of it it will be by gentlemen though except perhaps one bout to show the old king our professional form  then excuse me while i go for my hat said lydia leaving the room alice had gone some time before to make a complete change in her dress as the occasion was one for display of that kind  you look awfully fetching miss goff lord worthington said as he followed them to the carriage alice did not deign to reply but tossed her head superbly and secretly considered whether people would on comparison think her overdressed or lydia underdressed lord worthington thought they both looked their best and reflected for several seconds on the different styles of different women and how what would suit one would not do at all for another it seemed to him that miss carews presence made him philosophical  the agricultural hall struck alice at first sight as an immense barn round which heaps of old packingcases had been built into racecourse stands scantily decorated with red cloth and a few flags she was conducted to a front seat in one of these balconies which overhung the tanstrewn arena just below her were the palisades ornamented at intervals with evergreens in tubs and pressed against from without by a crowd who had paid a shilling apiece for the privilege of admission she remarked that it was little to the credit of the management that these people should be placed so close beneath her that she could hear their conversation but as lydia did not seem to share her disgust she turned her attention to the fashionable part of the audience on the opposite side of the arena the balconies seemed like beds of flowers in bloom blacknesses formed here and there by the hats and coats of gentlemen representing the interspaces of clay in the midst of the flowers was a gaudy dais on which a powerfullybuilt black gentleman sat in a raised chair his majestic impassivity contrasting with the overt astonishment with which a row of savagely ugly attendant chiefs grinned and gaped on either side of him  what a pity we are not nearer the king said alice i can hardly see the dear old fellow  you will find these the best seats for seeing the assault it will be all right said lord worthington  lydias attention was caught by something guilty in his manner following a furtive glance of his she saw in the arena not far from her an enclosure about twenty feet square made with ropes and stakes it was unoccupied and there were a few chairs a basin and a sponge near it  what is that she asked  that oh thats the ring  it is not a ring it is square  they call it the ring they have succeeded in squaring the circle  here there was a piercing buglecall and a troop of cavalry trotted into the arena lydia found it pleasant enough to sit lazily admiring the horses and men and comparing the members of the olympian club who appeared when the soldiers retired to the marble gods of athens and to the bacchus or david of michael angelo they fell short of the greek statues in refinement and of the italian in impressiveness as they vaulted over a wooden horse and swung upon horizontal bars each cheapening the exploits of his forerunner by outdoing them lord worthington who soon grew tired of this whispered that when all that rubbish was over a fellow would cut a sheep in two with a sword after which there would be some boxing  do you mean to say said lydia indignantly that they are going to turn a sheep loose and hunt it on horseback with swords  lord worthington laughed and said yes but it presently appeared that by a sheep was meant a lean carcass of mutton a stalwart sergeant cut it in half as a climax to slicing lemons bars of lead and silk handkerchiefs and the audience accustomed to see much more disgusting sights in butchers shops liberally applauded him  two gentlemen of the olympian club now entered the enclosure which lord worthington called the ring after shaking hands with one another as well as their huge padded gloves permitted they hugged themselves with their right arms as if there were some danger of their stomachs falling out if not held tightly in and danced round one another throwing out and retracting their left fists like pawing horses they were both as lydia learned from the announcement of their names and achievements by the master of the ceremonies amateur champions she thought their pawing and dancing ridiculous and when they occasionally rushed together and scuffled she could distinguish nothing of the leading off stopping ducking countering guarding and getting away to which lord worthington enthusiastically invited her attention and which elicited alternate jeers and applause from the shilling audience below she laughed outright when at the expiration of three minutes the two dropped supine into chairs at opposite corners of the ring as if they had sustained excessive fatigue at the end of a minute some one hoarsely cried time and they rose and repeated their previous performance for three minutes more another minute of rest followed and then the dancing and pawing proceeded for four minutes after which the champions again shook hands and left the arena  and is that all said lydia  thats all said lord worthington its the most innocent thing in the world and the prettiest  it does not strike me as being pretty said lydia but it seems as innocent as inanity can make it her mind misgave her that she had ignorantly and unjustly reproached cashel byron with ferocity merely because he practised this harmless exercise  the show progressed through several phases of skilled violence besides single combats between men armed in various fashions there were tilts tentpeggings drilling and singlestick practice by squads of british tars who were loudly cheered and more boxing and vaulting by members of the club lydias attention soon began to wander from the arena looking down at the crowd outside the palisades she saw a small man whom she vaguely remembered though his face was turned from her in conversation with him was a powerful man dressed in a yellow tweed suit and green scarf he had a coarse strong voice and his companion a shrill mean one so that their remarks could be heard by an attentive listener above the confused noise of the crowd  do you admire that man said lord worthington following lydias gaze  no is he anybody in particular  he was a great man oncein the days of the giants he was champion of england he has a special interest for us as the preceptor of a mutual friend of ours  please name him said lydia intending that the mutual friend should be named  ned skene said lord worthington taking her to mean the man below he has done so well in the colonies that he has indulged himself and his family with a trip to england his arrival made quite a sensation in this country last week he had a crowded benefit at which he sparred with our mutual friend and knocked him about like a baby our mutual behaved very well on the occasion in letting himself be knocked about you see he could have killed old skene if he had tried in earnest  is that skene said lydia looking at him with an earnest interest that astonished lord worthington ah now i recognize the man with him he is one of my tenants at the warren lodgei believe i am indebted to you for the introduction  mellish the trainer said lord worthington looking a little foolish so it is what a lovely bay that lancer hasthe second from the far end  but lydia would not look at the lancers horse paradise she heard skene exclaim just then with scornful incredulity aint it likely it occurred to her that if he was alluding to his own chance of arriving there it was not likely  less likely things have happened said mellish i wont say that cashel byron is getting stale but i will say that his luck is too good to last and i know for a fact that hes gone quite melancholy of late  melancholy be blowed said skene what should he go melancholy for  oh i know said mellish reticently  you know a lot retorted skene with contempt i spose you mean the young oman hes always talking to my missis about  i mean a young woman that he aint likely to get one of the biggest swells in englanda little un with a face like the inside of a oystershell that he met down at wiltstoken where i trained him to fight the flying dutchman he went right off his training after he met herwouldnt do anything i told him i made so cocksure that hed be licked that i hedged every penny i had laid on him except twenty pound that i got a flat to bet agin him down at the fight after i had changed my mind curse that woman i lost a hundred pound by her  and served you right too you old stupid you was wrong then and youre wrong now with your blessed paradise  paradise has never been licked yet  no more has my boy  well well see  well see i tell you ive seed for myself ive seed billy paradise spar and it aint fighting its ruffianing thats what it is ruffianing why my old missis has more science  mebbe she has said mellish but look at the men hes licked that were chock full of science shepstone clever as he is only won a fight from him by claiming a foul because billy lost his temper and spiked him thats the worst of billy he cant keep his feelings in but no finelady sparrer can stand afore that ugly rush of his do you think hell care for cashels showy long shots not he hell just take em on that mahogany nut of his and give him back one o them smashers that he settled poor dick weeks with  ill lay you any money he dont if he does ill go back into the ring myself and bust his head off for it here skene very angry applied several epithets to paradise and became so excited that mellish had to soothe him by partially retracting his forebodings and asking how cashel had been of late  hes not been taking care of himself as he oughter said skene gloomily hes showing the london fashions to the missis and fannytheyre here in the threeandsixpenny seats among the swells theatres every night and walks every day to see the queen drive through the park or the like my fan likes to have him with her on account of his being such a gentleman she dont hardly think her own father not good enough to walk down piccadilly with wants me to put on a black coat and make a parson of myself the missis just idolizes him she thinks the boy far too good for the young oman you was speaking of and tells him that shes only letting on not to care for him to raise her price just as i used to pretend to be getting beat to set the flats betting agin me the women always made a pet of him in melbourne it was not what i liked for dinner it was always what the boy ud like and when it ud please him to have it im blest if i usent to have to put him up to ask for a thing when i wanted it myself and you tell me that thats the lad thats going to let billy paradise lick him i spose walker  lydia with mrs byrons charm fresh upon her wondered what manner of woman this mrs skene could be who had supplanted her in the affections of her son and yet was no more than a prizefighters old missis evidently she was not one to turn a young man from a career in the ring again the theme of cashels occupation and the chances of his quitting it ran away with lydias attention she sat with her eyes fixed on the arena without seeing the soldiers swordsmen or athletes who were busy there her mind wandered further and further from the place and the chattering of the people resolved itself into a distant hum and was forgotten  suddenly she saw a dreadfullooking man coming towards her across the arena his face had the surface and color of blue granite his protruding jaws and retreating forehead were like those of an orangoutang she started from her reverie with a shiver and recovering her hearing as well as her vision of external things became conscious of an attempt to applaud this apparition by a few persons below the man grinned ferociously placed one hand on a stake of the ring and vaulted over the ropes lydia now remarked that excepting his hideous head and enormous hands and feet he was a wellmade man with loins and shoulders that shone in the light and gave him an air of great strength and activity  aint he a picture she heard mellish exclaim ecstatically theres condition for you  ah said skene disparagingly but aint he the gentleman just look at him its like the prince of wales walking down pall mall  lydia hearing this looked again and saw cashel byron exactly as she had seen him for the first time in the elm vista at wiltstoken approaching the ring with the indifferent air of a man going through some tedious public ceremony  a god coming down to compete with a gladiator whispered lord worthington eagerly isnt it miss carew apollo and the satyr you must admit that our mutual friend is a splendidlooking fellow if he could go into society like that by jove the women  hush said lydia as if his words were intolerable  cashel did not vault over the ropes he stepped through them languidly and rejecting the proffered assistance of a couple of officious friends drew on a boxingglove fastidiously like an exquisite preparing for a fashionable promenade having thus muffled his left hand so as to make it useless for the same service to his right he dipped his fingers into the other glove gripped it between his teeth and dragged it on with the action of a tiger tearing its prey lydia shuddered again  bob mellish said skene ill lay you twenty to one he stops that rush that you think so much of come twenty to one  mellish shook his head then the master of the ceremonies pointing to the men in succession shouted paradise a professor cashel byron a professor time  cashel now looked at paradise of whose existence he had not before seemed to be aware the two men advanced towards the centre of the ring shook hands at armslength cast off each others grasp suddenly fell back a step and began to move warily round one another from left to right like a pair of panthers  i think they might learn manners from the gentlemen and shake hands cordially said alice trying to appear unconcerned but oppressed by a vague dread of cashel  thats the traditional manner said lord worthington it is done that way to prevent one from holding the other pulling him over and hitting him with the disengaged hand before he could get loose  what abominable treachery exclaimed lydia  its never done you know said lord worthington apologetically only it might be  lydia turned away from him and gave all her attention to the boxers of the two paradise shocked her least he was evidently nervous and conscious of a screwedup condition as to his courage but his sly grin implied a wild sort of goodhumor and seemed to promise the spectators that he would show them some fun presently cashel watched his movements with a relentless vigilance and a sidelong glance in which to lydias apprehension there was something infernal  suddenly the eyes of paradise lit up he lowered his head made a rush balked himself purposely and darted at cashel there was a sound like the pop of a champagnecork after which cashel was seen undisturbed in the middle of the ring and paradise flung against the ropes and trying to grin at his discomfiture showed his white teeth through a mask of blood  beautiful cried skene with emotion beautiful there aint but me and my boy in the world can give the upper cut like that i wish i could see my old mississ face now this is nuts to her  let us go away said alice  that was a very different blow to any that the gentlemen gave said lydia without heeding her to lord worthington the man is bleeding horribly  its only his nose said lord worthington hes used to it  meanwhile cashel had followed paradise to the ropes  now he has him chuckled skene my boys got him agin the ropes and he means to keep him there let him rush now if he can see what it is to have a good judgment  mellish shook his head again despondently the remaining minutes of the round were unhappy ones for paradise he struck viciously at his opponents ribs but cashel stepped back just out of his reach and then returned with extraordinary swiftness and dealt him blows from which with the ropes behind him he had no room to retreat and which he was too slow to stop or avoid his attempts to reach his enemys face were greatly to the disadvantage of his own for cashels blows were never so tremendous as when he turned his head deftly out of harms way and met his advancing foe with a counter hit he showed no chivalry and no mercy and revelled in the hardness of his hitting his gloves either resounding on paradises face or seeming to go almost through his body there was little semblance to a contest to lydia there was nothing discernible but a cruel assault by an irresistible athlete on a helpless victim the better sort among the spectators were disgusted by the sight for as paradise bled profusely and as his blood besmeared the gloves and the gloves besmeared the heads and bodies of both combatants they were soon stained with it from their waists upward the managers held a whispered consultation as to whether the sparring exhibition had not better be stopped but they decided to let it proceed on seeing the african king who had watched the whole entertainment up to the present without displaying the least interest now raise his hands and clap them with delight  billy dont look half pleased with hisself observed mellish as the two boxers sat down he looks just like he did when he spiked shepstone  what does spiking mean said lydia  treading on a mans foot with spiked boots replied lord worthington dont be alarmed they have no spikes in their shoes today it is not my fault that they do such things miss carew really you make me feel quite criminal when you look at me in that way  time was now called and the pugilists who had by dint of sponging been made somewhat cleaner rose with mechanical promptitude at the sound cashel had hardly advanced two steps when though his adversary seemed far out of his reach he struck him on the forehead with such force as to stagger him and then jumped back laughing paradise rushed forward but cashel eluded him and fled round the ring looking back derisively over his shoulder paradise now dropped all pretence of goodhumor with an expression of reckless ferocity he dashed at cashel endured a startling blow without flinching and engaged him at close quarters for a moment the falling of their blows reminded lydia of the rush of raindrops against a pane in a sudden gust of wind the next moment cashel was away and paradise whose blood was again flowing was trying to repeat his manoeuvre to be met this time by a blow that brought him upon one knee he had scarcely risen when cashel sprang at him dealt him four blows with dazzling rapidity drove him once more against the ropes but this time instead of keeping him there ran away in the manner of a child at play paradise with foam as well as blood at his lips uttered a howl and tore off his gloves there was a shout of protest from the audience and cashel warned by it tried to get off his gloves in turn but paradise was upon him before he could accomplish this and the two men laid hold of one another amid a great clamor lord worthington and others rising and excitedly shouting against the rules no wrestling followed by a roar of indignation as paradise was seen to seize cashels shoulder in his teeth as they struggled for the throw lydia for the first time in her life screamed then she saw cashel his face fully as fierce as paradises get his arm about his neck lift him as a coalheaver lifts a sack and fling him over his back heels over head to the ground where he instantly dropped on him with his utmost weight and impetus the two were at once separated by a crowd of managers umpires policemen and others who had rushed towards the ring when paradise had taken off his gloves a distracting wrangle followed skene had climbed over the palisade and was hurling oaths threats and epithets at paradise who unable to stand without assistance was trying to lift his leaden eyelids and realize what had happened to him a dozen others were trying to bring him to his senses remonstrating with him on his conduct or trying to pacify skene cashel on the other side raged at the managers who were reminding him that the rules of glovefighting did not allow wrestling and throwing  rules be dd lydia heard him shouting he bit me and ill throw him to then everybody spoke at once and she could only conjecture where he would throw him to he seemed to have no selfcontrol paradise when he came to himself behaved better lord worthington descended into the ring and tried to calm the hubbub but cashel shook his hand fiercely from his arm menaced a manager who attempted to call him sternly to order frantically pounded his wounded shoulder with his clenched fist and so outswore and outwrangled them all that even skene began to urge that there had been enough fuss made then lord worthington whispered a word more and cashel suddenly subsided pale and ashamed and sat down on a chair in his corner as if to hide himself five minutes afterwards he stepped out from the crowd with paradise and shook hands with him amid much cheering cashel was the humbler of the two he did not raise his eyes to the balcony once and he seemed in a hurry to retire but he was intercepted by an officer in uniform accompanied by a black chief who came to conduct him to the dais and present him to the african king an honor which he was not permitted to decline  the king informed him through an interpreter that he had been unspeakably gratified by what he had just witnessed expressed great surprise that cashel notwithstanding his prowess was neither in the army nor in parliament and finally offered to provide him with three handsome wives if he would come out to africa in his suite cashel was much embarrassed but he came off with credit thanks to the interpreter who was accustomed to invent appropriate speeches for the king on public occasions and was kind enough to invent equally appropriate ones for cashel on this  meanwhile lord worthington had returned to his place it is all settled now he said to lydia byron shut up when i told him his aristocratic friends were looking at him and paradise has been so bullied that he is crying in a corner downstairs he has apologized but he still maintains that he can beat our mutual friend without the gloves and his backers apparently think so too for it is understood that they are to fight in the autumn for a thousand a side  to fight then he has no intention of giving up his profession  no said lord worthington astonished why on earth should he give it up paradises money is as good as in his pocket you have seen what he can do  i have seen enough alice i am ready to go as soon as you are  early in the following week miss carew returned to wiltstoken miss goff remained in london to finish the season in charge of a friendly lady who having married off all her own daughters was willing to set to work again to marry alice sooner than remain idle       chapter xi      alice was more at her ease during the remnant of the london season though she had been proud of her connection with lydia she had always felt eclipsed in her presence and now that lydia was gone the pride remained and the sense of inferiority was forgotten her freedom emboldened and improved her she even began to consider her own judgment a safer guide in the affairs of every day than the example of her patroness had she not been right in declaring cashel byron an ignorant and common man when lydia in spite of her warning had actually invited him to visit them and now all the newspapers were confirming the opinion she had been trying to impress on lydia for months past on the evening of the assaultatarms the newsmen had shouted through the streets disgraceful scene between two pugilists at islington in the presence of the african king next day the principal journals commented on the recent attempt to revive the brutal pastime of prizefighting accused the authorities of conniving at it and called on them to put it down at once with a strong hand unless said a clerical organ this plaguespot be rooted out from our midst it will no longer be possible for our missionaries to pretend that england is the fount of the gospel of peace alice collected these papers and forwarded them to wiltstoken  on this subject one person at least shared her bias whenever she met lucian webber they talked about cashel invariably coming to the conclusion that though the oddity of his behavior had gratified lydias unfortunate taste for eccentricity she had never regarded him with serious interest and would not now under any circumstances renew her intercourse with him lucian found little solace in these conversations and generally suffered from a vague sense of meanness after them yet next time they met he would drift into discussing cashel over again and he always rewarded alice for the admirable propriety of her views by dancing at least three times with her when dancing was the business of the evening the dancing was still less congenial than the conversation lucian who had at all times too much of the solemnity of manner for which frenchmen reproach englishmen danced stiffly and unskilfully alice whose muscular power and energy were superior to anything of the kind that mr mellish could artificially produce longed for swift motion and violent exercise and even with an expert partner could hardly tame herself to the quietude of dancing as practised in london when waltzing with lucian she felt as though she were carrying a stick round the room in the awkward fashion in which punch carries his baton in spite of her impression that he was a man of unusually correct morals and great political importance and greatly to be considered in private life because he was miss carews cousin it was hard to spend quarterhours with him that some of the best dancers in london asked for  she began to tire of the subject of cashel and lydia she began to tire of lucians rigidity she began to tire exceedingly of the vigilance she had to maintain constantly over her own manners and principles somehow this vigilance defeated itself for she one evening overheard a lady of rank speak of her as a stuckup country girl the remark gave her acute pain for a week afterwards she did not utter a word or make a movement in society without first considering whether it could by any malicious observer be considered rustic or stuckup but the more she strove to attain perfect propriety of demeanor the more odious did she seem to herself and she inferred to others she longed for lydias secret of always doing the right thing at the right moment even when defying precedent sometimes she blamed the dulness of the people she met for her shortcomings it was impossible not to be stiff with them when she chatted with an entertaining man who made her laugh and forget herself for a while she was conscious afterwards of having been at her best with him but she saw others who in stupid society were pleasantly at their ease she began to fear at last that she was naturally disqualified by her comparatively humble birth from acquiring the wellbred air for which she envied those among whom she moved  one day she conceived a doubt whether lucian was so safe an authority and example in matters of personal deportment as she had hitherto unthinkingly believed he could not dance his conversation was priggish it was impossible to feel at ease when speaking to him was it courageous to stand in awe of his opinion was it courageous to stand in awe of anybody alice closed her lips proudly and began to be defiant then a reminiscence which had never before failed to rouse indignation in her made her laugh she recalled the scandalous spectacle of lucians formal perpendicularity overbalanced and doubled up into mrs hoskyns gilded armchair in illustration of the prizefighters theory of effort defeating itself after all what was that caressing touch of cashels hand in comparison with the tremendous rataplan he had beaten on the ribs of paradise could it be true that effort defeated itselfin personal behavior for instance a ray of the truth that underlay cashels grotesque experiment was flickering in her mind as she asked herself that question she thought a good deal about it and one afternoon when she looked in at four athomes in succession she studied the behavior of the other guests from a new point of view comparing the most mannered with the best mannered and her recent self with both the result half convinced her that she had been occupied during her first london season in displaying at great pains a very unripe selfconsciousnessor as she phrased it in making an insufferable fool of herself  shortly afterwards she met lucian at a cinderella or dancingparty concluding at midnight he came at eleven and as usual gravely asked whether he might have the pleasure of dancing with her this form of address he never varied to his surprise she made some difficulty about granting the favor and eventually offered him the second extra he bowed before he could resume a vertical position a young man came up remarked that he thought this was his turn and bore alice away lucian smiled indulgently thinking that though alices manners were wonderfully good considering her antecedents yet she occasionally betrayed a lower tone than that which he sought to exemplify in his own person  i wish you would learn to reverse said alice unexpectedly to him when they had gone round the room twice to the strains of the second extra  i do reverse he said taken aback and a little indignant  everybody doesthat way  this silenced him for a moment then he said slowly perhaps i am rather out of practice i am not sure that reversing is quite desirable many people consider it bad form  when they stoppedalice was always willing to rest during a waltz with lucianhe asked her whether she had heard from lydia  you always ask me that she replied lydia never writes except when she has something particular to say and then only a few lines  precisely but she might have had something particular to say since we last met  she hasnt had said alice provoked by an almost arch smile from him  she will be glad to hear that i have at last succeeded in recovering possession of the warren lodge from its undesirable tenants  i thought they went long ago said alice indifferently  the men have not been there for a month or more the difficulty was to get them to remove their property however we are rid of them now the only relic of their occupation is a bible with half the pages torn out and the rest scrawled with records of bets recipes for sudorific and other medicines and a mass of unintelligible memoranda one inscription in faded ink runs to robert mellish from his affectionate mother with her sincere hope that he may ever walk in the ways of this book i am afraid that hope was not fulfilled  how wicked of him to tear a bible said alice seriously then she laughed and added i know i shouldnt but i cant help it  the incident strikes me rather as being pathetic said lucian who liked to show that he was not deficient in sensibility one can picture the innocent faith of the poor woman in her boys future and so forth  inscriptions in books are like inscriptions on tombstones said alice disparagingly they dont mean much  i am glad that these men have no further excuse for going to wiltstoken it was certainly most unfortunate that lydia should have made the acquaintance of one of them  so you have said at least fifty times replied alice deliberately i believe you are jealous of that poor boxer  lucian became quite red alice trembled at her own audacity but kept a bold front  reallyits too absurd he said betraying his confusion by assuming a carelessness quite foreign to his normal manner in what way could i possibly be jealous miss goff  that is best known to yourself  lucian now saw plainly that there was a change in alice and that he had lost ground with her the smarting of his wounded vanity suddenly obliterated his impression that she was in the main a wellconducted and meritorious young woman but in its place came another impression that she was a spoiled beauty and as he was by no means fondest of the women whose behavior accorded best with his notions of propriety he found without at once acknowledging to himself that the change was not in all respects a change for the worse nevertheless he could not forgive her last remark though he took care not to let her see how it stung him  i am afraid i should cut a poor figure in an encounter with my rival he said smiling  call him out and shoot him said alice vivaciously very likely he does not know how to use a pistol  he smiled again but had alice known how seriously he entertained her suggestion for some moments before dismissing it as impracticable she would not have offered it putting a bullet into cashel struck him rather as a luxury which he could not afford than as a crime meanwhile alice being now quite satisfied that this mr webber on whom she had wasted so much undeserved awe might be treated as inconsiderately as she used to treat her beaux at wiltstoken proceeded to amuse herself by torturing him a little  it is odd she said reflectively that a common man like that should be able to make himself so very attractive to lydia it was not because he was such a fine man for she does not care in the least about that i dont think she would give a second look at the handsomest man in london she is so purely intellectual and yet she used to delight in talking to him  oh that is a mistake lydia has a certain manner which leads people to believe that she is deeply interested in the person she happens to be speaking to but it is only mannerit means nothing  i know that manner of hers perfectly well but this was something quite different  lucian shook his head reproachfully i cannot jest on so serious a matter he said resolving to make the attempt to reestablish his dignity with alice i think miss groff that you perhaps hardly know how absurd your supposition is there are not many men of distinction in europe with whom my cousin is not personally acquainted a very young girl who had seen little of the world might possibly be deceived by the exterior of such a man as byron a woman accustomed to associate with writers thinkers artists statesmen and diplomatists could make no such mistake no doubt the mans vulgarity and uncouth address amused her for a moment but  but why did she ask him to come to her friday afternoons  a mere civility which she extended to him because he assisted her in some difficulty she got into in the streets  she might as well have asked a policeman to come to see her i dont believe that was it  lucian at that moment hated alice i am sorry you think such a thing possible he said shall we resume our waltz  alice was not yet able to bear an implication that she did not understand society sufficiently to appreciate the distance between lydia and cashel  of course i know it is impossible she said in her old manner i did not mean it  lucian found some difficulty in gathering from this what she did mean and they presently took refuge in waltzing subsequently alice fearing that her new lights had led her too far drew back a little led the conversation to political matters and expressed her amazement at the extent and variety of the work he performed in downing street he accepted her compliments with perfect seriousness and she felt satisfied that she had on the whole raised herself in his esteem by her proceedings during the evening but she was mistaken she knew nothing of politics or official work and he knew the worthlessness of her pretended admiration of his share in them although he felt that it was right that she should revere his powers from the depths of her ignorance what stuck like a burr in his mind was that she thought him small enough to be jealous of the poor boxer and found his dancing awkward  after that dance alice thought much about lucian and also about the way in which society regulated marriages before miss carew sent for her she had often sighed because all the nice men she knew of moved in circles into which an obscure governess had no chance of admission she had received welcome attentions from them occasionally at subscription balls but for sustained intimacy and proposals of marriage she had been dependent on the native youth of wiltstoken whom she looked upon as louts or prigs and among whom wallace parker had shone preeminent as a university man scholar and gentleman and now that she was a privileged beauty in society which would hardly tolerate wallace parker she found that the nice men were younger sons poor and extravagant far superior to lucian webber as partners for a waltz but not to be thought of as partners in domestic economy alice had experienced the troubles of poverty and had never met with excellence in men except in poems which she had long ago been taught to separate from the possibilities of actual life she had therefore no conception of any degree of merit in a husband being sufficient to compensate for slender means of subsistence she was not baseminded nothing could have induced her to marry a man however rich whom she thought wicked she wanted money but she wanted more than money and here it was that she found supply failing to answer the demand for not only were all the handsome gallant wellbred men getting deeply into debt by living beyond smaller incomes than that with which wallace parker had tempted her but many of those who had inherited both riches and rank were as inferior to him both in appearance and address as they were in scholarship no man possessing both wealth and amiability had yet shown the least disposition to fall in love with her  one bright forenoon in july alice attended by a groom went to the park on horseback the row looked its best the freshness of morning was upon horses and riders there were not yet any jaded people lolling supine in carriages nor discontented spectators sitting in chairs to envy them alice who was a better horsewoman than might have been expected from the little practice she had had appeared to advantage in the saddle she had just indulged in a brisk canter from the corner to the serpentine when she saw a large white horse approaching with wallace parker on its back  ah he exclaimed expertly wheeling his steed and taking off his hat at the same time with an intentional display of gallantry and horsemanship how are you alice  goodness cried alice forgetting her manners in her astonishment what brings you here and where on earth did you get that horse  i presume alice said parker satisfied with the impression he had made that i am here for much the same reason as you areto enjoy the morning in proper style as for rozinante i borrowed him is that chestnut yours excuse the rudeness of the question  no said alice coloring a little this seems such an unlikely place to meet you  oh no i always take a turn in the season but certainly it would have been a very unlikely place for us to meet a year ago  so far alice felt she was getting the worst of the conversation she changed the subject have you been to wiltstoken since i last saw you  yes i go there once every week at least  every week janet never told me  parker implied by a cunning air that he thought he knew the reason of that but he said nothing alice piqued would not condescend to make inquiries so he said presently  how is miss thingumbob  i do not know any one of that name  you know very well whom i mean your aristocratic patron miss carew  alice flushed you are very impertinent wallace she said grasping her ridingwhip how dare you call miss carew my patron  wallace suddenly became solemn i did not know that you objected to be reminded of all you owe her he said janet never speaks ungratefully of her though she has done nothing for janet  i have not spoken ungratefully protested alice almost in tears i feel sure that you are never tired of speaking ill of me to them at home  that shows how little you understand my real character i always make excuses for you  excuses for what what have i done what do you mean  oh i dont mean anything if you dont i thought from your beginning to defend yourself that you felt yourself to be in the wrong  i did not defend myself and i wont have you say so wallace  always your obedient humble servant he replied with complacent irony  she pretended not to hear him and whipped up her horse to a smart trot the white steed being no trotter parker followed at a lumbering canter alice possessed by a shamefaced fear that he was making her ridiculous soon checked her speed and the white horse subsided to a walk marking its paces by deliberate bobs of its unfashionably long mane and tail  i have something to tell you said parker at last  alice did not deign to reply  i think it better to let you know at once he continued the fact is i intend to marry janet  janet wont said alice promptly retorting first and then reflecting on the intelligence which surprised her more than it pleased her  parker smiled conceitedly and said i dont think she will raise any difficulty if you give her to understand that it is all over between us  that what is all over  well if you prefer it that there never has been anything between us janet believes that we were engaged so did a good many other people until you went into high life  i cannot help what people thought  and they all know that i at least was ready to perform my part of the engagement honorably  wallace she said with a sudden change of tone i think we had better separate it is not right for me to be riding about the park with you when i have nobody belonging to me here except a manservant  just as you please he said coolly halting may i assure janet that you wish her to marry me  most certainly not i do not wish anyone to marry you much less my own sister i am far inferior to janet and she deserves a much better husband than i do  i quite agree with you though i dont quite see what that has to do with it as far as i understand you you will neither marry me yourselfmind i am quite willing to fulfil my engagement stillnor let any one else have me is that so  you may tell janet said alice vigorously her face glowing that if weyou and iwere condemned to live forever on a desert islno i will write to her that will be the best way goodmorning  parker hitherto imperturbable now showed signs of alarm i beg alice he said that you will say nothing unfair to her of me you cannot with truth say anything bad of me  do you really care for janet said alice wavering  of course he replied indignantly janet is a very superior girl  i have always said so said alice rather angry because some one else had forestalled her with the meritorious admission i will tell her the simple truththat there has never been anything between us except what is between all cousins and that there never could have been anything more on my part i must go now i dont know what that man must think of me already  i should be sorry to lower you in his esteem said parker maliciously goodbye alice uttering the last words in a careless tone he again pulled up the white horses head raised his hat and sped away it was not true that he was in the habit of riding in the park every season he had learned from janet that alice was accustomed to ride there in the forenoon and he had hired the white horse in order to meet her on equal terms feeling that a gentleman on horseback in the road by the serpentine could be at no social disadvantage with any lady however exalted her associates  as for alice she went home with his reminder that miss carew was her patron rankling in her the necessity for securing an independent position seemed to press imminently upon her and as the sole way of achieving this was by marriage she felt for the time willing to marry any man without regard to his person age or disposition if only he could give her a place equal to that of miss carew in the world of which she had lately acquired the manners and customs       chapter xii      when the autumn set in alice was in scotland learning to shoot and lydia was at wiltstoken preparing her fathers letters and memoirs for publication she did not write at the castle all the rooms in which were either domed vaulted gilded galleried threesided sixsided anything except foursided or in some way suggestive of the arabian nights entertainments and out of keeping with the associations of her fathers life in her search for a congruous room to work in the idea of causing a pavilion to be erected in the elm vista occurred to her but she had no mind to be disturbed just then by the presence of a troop of stonemasons slaters and carpenters nor any time to lose in waiting for the end of their operations so she had the warren lodge cleansed and lime washed and the kitchen transformed into a comfortable library where as she sat facing the door at her writingtable in the centre of the room she could see the elm vista through one window and through another a tract of wood and meadow land intersected by the highroad and by a canal beyond which the prospect ended in a distant green slope used as a sheep run the other apartments were used by a couple of maidservants who kept the place well swept and dusted prepared miss carews lunch answered her bell and went on her errands to the castle and failing any of these employments sat outside in the sun reading novels when lydia had worked in this retreat daily for two months her mind became so full of the old life with her father that the interruptions of the servants often recalled her to the present with a shock on the twelfth of august she was bewildered for a moment when phoebe one of the maids entered and said  if you please miss bashville is wishful to know can he speak to you a moment  permission being given bashville entered since his wrestle with cashel he had never quite recovered his former imperturbability his manner and speech were as smooth and respectful as before but his countenance was no longer steadfast he was on bad terms with the butler because he had been reproved by him for blushing on this occasion he came to beg leave to absent himself during the afternoon he seldom asked favors of this kind and was of course never refused  the road is quite thronged today she observed as he thanked her do you know why  no madam said bashville and blushed  people begin to shoot on the twelfth she said but i suppose it cannot have anything to do with that is there a race or a fair or any such thing in the neighborhood  not that i am aware of madam  lydia dipped her pen in the ink and thought no more of the subject bashville returned to the castle attired himself like a country gentleman of sporting tastes and went out to enjoy his holiday  the forenoon passed away peacefully there was no sound in the warren lodge except the scratching of lydias pen the ticking of her favorite skeleton clock an occasional clatter of crockery from the kitchen and the voices of the birds and maids without the hour for lunch approached and lydia became a little restless she interrupted her work to look at the clock and brushed a speck of dust from its dial with the feather of her quill then she looked absently through the window along the elm vista where she had once seen as she had thought a sylvan god this time she saw a less romantic objecta policeman she looked again incredulously there he was still a blackbearded helmeted man making a dark blot in the green perspective and surveying the landscape cautiously lydia rang the bell and bade phoebe ask the man what he wanted  the girl soon returned out of breath with the news that there were a dozen more constables hiding in the road and that the one she had spoken to had given no account of himself but had asked her how many gates there were to the park whether they were always locked and whether she had seen many people about she felt sure that a murder had been committed somewhere lydia shrugged her shoulders and ordered luncheon during which phoebe gazed eagerly through the window and left her mistress to wait on herself  phoebe said lydia when the dishes were removed you may go to the gate lodge and ask them there what the policemen want but do not go any further stay has ellen gone to the castle with the things  phoebe reluctantly admitted that ellen had  well you need not wait for her to return but come back as quickly as you can in case i should want anybody  directly miss said phoebe vanishing  lydia left alone resumed her work leisurely occasionally pausing to gaze at the distant woodland and note with transient curiosity a flock of sheep on the slope or a flight of birds above the treetops something more startling occurred presently a man apparently halfnaked and carrying a black object under his arm darted through a remote glade with the swiftness of a stag and disappeared lydia concluded that he had been disturbed while bathing in the canal and had taken flight with his wardrobe under his arm she laughed at the idea turned to her manuscript again and wrote on suddenly there was a rustle and a swift footstep without then the latch was violently jerked up and cashel byron rushed in as far as the threshold where he stood stupefied at the presence of lydia and the change in the appearance of the room  he was himself remarkably changed he was dressed in a peajacket which evidently did not belong to him for it hardly reached his middle and the sleeves were so short that his forearms were half bare showing that he wore nothing beneath this borrowed garment below it he had on white kneebreeches with green stains of bruised grass on them the breeches were made with a broad ilap in front under which and passing round his waist was a scarf of crimson silk from his knees to his socks the edges of which had fallen over his laced boots his legs were visible naked and muscular on his face was a mask of sweat dust and blood partly rubbed away in places by a sponge the borders of its passage marked by black streaks underneath his left eye was a mound of bluish flesh nearly as large as a walnut the jaw below it and the opposite cheek were severely bruised and his lip was cut through at one corner he had no hat his closecropped hair was disordered and his ears were as though they had been rubbed with coarse sandpaper  lydia looked at him for some seconds and he at her speechless then she tried to speak failed and sunk into her chair  i didnt know there was any one here he said in a hoarse panting whisper the police are after me i have fought for an hour and run over a mile and im dead beati can go no farther let me hide in the back room and tell them you havent seen any one will you  what have you done she said conquering her weakness with an effort and standing up  nothing he replied groaning occasionally as he recovered breath business thats all  why are the police pursuing you why are you in such a dreadful condition  cashel seemed alarmed at this there was a mirror in the lid of a papercase on the table lie took it up and looked at himself anxiously but was at once relieved by what he saw im all right he said im not marked that mousehe pointed gayly to the lump under his eyewill run away tomorrow i am pretty tidy considering but its bellows to mend with me at present whoosh my heart is as big as a bullocks after that run  you ask me to shelter you said lydia sternly what have you done have you committed murder  no exclaimed cashel trying to open his eyes widely in his astonishment but only succeeding with one as the other was gradually closing i tell you i have been fighting and its illegal you dont want to see me in prison do you confound him he added reverting to her question with sudden wrath a steamhammer wouldnt kill him you might as well hit a sack of nails and all my money my time my training and my days trouble gone for nothing its enough to make a man cry  go said lydia with uncontrollable disgust and do not let me see which way you go how dare you come to me  the spongemarks on cashels face grew whiter and he began to pant heavily again very well he said ill go there isnt a boy in your stables that would give me up like that  as he spoke he opened the door but he involuntarily shut it again immediately lydia looked through the window and saw a crowd of men police and others hurrying along the elm vista cashel cast a glance round half piteous half desperate like a hunted animal lydia could not resist it quick she cried opening one of the inner doors go in there and keep quietif you can and as he sulkily hesitated a moment she stamped vehemently he slunk in submissively she shut the door and resumed her place at the writingtable her heart beating with a kind of excitement she had not felt since in her early childhood she had kept guilty secrets from her nurse  there was a tramping without and a sound of voices then two peremptory raps at the door  come in said lydia more composedly than she was aware of the permission was not waited for before she ceased speaking a policeman opened the door and looked quickly round the room he seemed rather taken aback by what he saw and finally touched his helmet to signify respect for lydia he was about to speak when phoebe flushed with running pushed past him put her hand on the door and pertly asked what he wanted  come away from the door phoebe said lydia wait here with me until i give you leave to go she added as the girl moved towards the inner door now she said turning courteously to the policeman what is the matter  i ask your pardon mum said the constable agreeably did you happen to see any one pass hereabouts lately  do you mean a man only partly dressed and carrying a black coat said lydia  thats him miss said the policeman greatly interested which way did he go  i will show you where i saw him said lydia quietly rising and going with the man to the door outside which she found a crowd of rustics and five policemen having in custody two men one of whom was mellish without a coat and the other a hooknosed man whose like lydia had seen often on racecourses she pointed out the glade across which she had seen cashel run and felt as if the guilt of the deception she was practising was wrenching some fibre in her heart from its natural order but she spoke with apparent selfpossession and no shade of suspicion fell on the minds of the police  several peasants now came forward each professing to know exactly whither cashel had been making when he crossed the glade while they were disputing many persons resembling the hooknosed captive in general appearance sneaked into the crowd and regarded the police with furtive hostility soon after a second detachment of police came up with another prisoner and another crowd among whom was bashville  better go in mum said the policeman who had spoken to lydia first we must keep together being so few and he aint fit for you to look at  but lydia had looked already and had guessed that the last prisoner was paradise although his countenance was damaged beyond recognition his costume was like that of cashel except that he was girt with a blue handkerchief with white spots and his shoulders were wrapped in a blanket through one of the folds of which his naked ribs could be seen tinged with every hue that a bad bruise can assume a shocking spectacle appeared where his face had formerly been a crease and a hole in the midst of a cluster of lumps of raw flesh indicated the presence of an eye and a mouth the rest of his features were indiscernible he could still see a little for he moved his puffed and lacerated hand to arrange his blanket and demanded hoarsely and with greatly impeded articulation whether the lady would stand a dram to a poor fighting man wot had done his best for his backers on this some one produced a flask and mellish volunteered provided he were released for a moment to get the contents down paradises throat as soon as the brandy had passed his swollen lips he made a few preliminary sounds and then shouted  he sent for the coppers because he couldnt stand another round i am ready to go on  the policemen bade him hold his tongue closed round him and hid him from lydia who without showing the mingled pity and loathing with which his condition inspired her told them to bring him to the castle and have him attended to there she added that the whole party could obtain refreshment at the same time the sergeant who was very tired and thirsty wavered in his resolution to continue the pursuit lydia as usual treated the matter as settled  bashville she said will you please show them the way and see that they are satisfied  some thief has stole my coat said mellish sullenly to bashville if youll lend me one governor and these blessed policemen will be so kind as not to tear it off my back ill send it down to you in a day or two im a respectable man and have been her ladyships tenant here  your pal wants it worse than you said the sergeant if there was an old coachmans cape or anything to put over him i would see it returned safe i dont want to bring him round the country in a blanket like a wild injin  i have a cloak inside said bashville ill get it for you and before lydia could devise a pretext for stopping him he went out and she heard him reentering the lodge by the back door it seemed to her that a silence fell on the crowd as if her deceit were already discovered then mellish who had been waiting for an opportunity to protest against the last remark of the policeman said angrily  who are you calling my pal i hope i may be struck dead for a liar if ever i set my eyes on him in my life before  lydia looked at him as a martyr might look at a wretch to whom she was to be chained he was doing as she had donelying then bashville having passed through the other rooms came into the library by the inner door with an old livery cloak on his arm  put that on him he said and come along to the castle with me you can see the roads for five miles round from the south tower and recognize every man on them through the big telescope by your leave madam i think phoebe had better come with us to help  certainly said lydia looking steadfastly at him  ill get clothes at the castle for the man that wants them he added trying to return her gaze but failing with a blush now boys come along  i thank your ladyship said the sergeant we have had a hard morning of it and we can do no more at present than drink your health he touched his helmet again and lydia bowed to him keep close together men he shouted as the crowd moved off with bashville  ah sneered mellish keep close together like the geese do things has come to a pretty pass when an englishman is run in for stopping when he sees a crowd  all right said the sergeant i have got that bundle of colored handkerchiefs you were selling and ill find the other man before youre a day older its a pity seeing how youve behaved so well and havent resisted us that you wont drop a hint of where those ropes and stakes are hid i might have a good word at the sessions for any one who would put me in the way of finding them  ropes and stakes fiddlesticks and grandmothers there werent no ropes and stakes it was only a turnupthat is if there was any fighting at all i didnt see none but i spose you did but then youre clever and im not  by this time the last straggler of the party had disappeared from lydia who had watched their retreat from the door of the warren lodge when she turned to go in she saw cashel cautiously entering from the room in which he had lain concealed his excitement had passed off he looked cold and anxious as if a reaction were setting in  are they all gone he said that servant of yours is a good sort he has promised to bring me some clothes as for you youre better thanwhats the matter where are you going to  lydia had put on her hat and was swiftly wrapping herself in a shawl wreaths of rosy color were chasing each other through her cheeks and her eyes and nostrils usually so tranquil were dilated  wont you speak to me he said irresolutely  just this she replied with passion let me never see you again the very foundations of my life are loosened i have told a lie i have made my servantan honorable manan accomplice in a lie we are worse than you for even your wildbeasts handiwork is a less evil than the bringing of a falsehood into the world this is what has come to me out of our acquaintance i have given you a hidingplace keep it i will never enter it again  cashel appalled shrank back with an expression such as a child wears when in trying to steal sweetmeats from a high shelf it pulls the whole cupboard down about its ears he neither spoke nor stirred as she left the lodge  finding herself presently at the castle she went to her boudoir where she found her maid the french lady from whose indignant description of the proceedings below she gathered that the policemen were being regaled with bread and cheese and beer and that the attendance of a surgeon had been dispensed with paradises wounds having been dressed skilfully by mellish lydia bade her send bashville to the warren lodge to see that there were no strangers loitering about it and ordered that none of the female servants should return there until he came back then she sat down and tried not to think but she could not help thinking so she submitted and tried to think the late catastrophe out an idea that she had disjointed the whole framework of things by creating a false belief filled her imagination the one conviction that she had brought out of her reading observing reflecting and living was that the concealment of a truth with its resultant false beliefs must produce mischief even though the beginning of that mischief might be as inconceivable as the end she made no distinction between the subtlest philosophical misconception and the vulgarest lie the evil of cashels capture was measurable the evil of a lie beyond all measure she felt none the less assured of that evil because she could not foresee one bad consequence likely to ensue from what she had done her misgivings pressed heavily upon her for her father a determined sceptic had taught her his own views and she was therefore destitute of the consolations which religion has for the wrongdoer it was plainly her duty to send for the policeman and clear up the deception she had practised on him but this she could not do her will in spite of her reason acted in the opposite direction and in this paralysis of her moral power she saw the evil of the lie beginning she had given it birth and nature would not permit her to strangle the monster  at last her maid returned and informed her that the canaille had gone away when she was again alone she rose and walked slowly to and fro through the room forgetting the lapse of time in the restless activity of her mind until she was again interrupted this time by bashville  well  he was daunted by her tone for he had never before heard her speak haughtily to a servant he did not understand that he had changed subjectively and was now her accomplice  hes given himself up  what do you mean she said with sudden dismay  byron madam i brought some clothes to the lodge for him but when i got there he was gone i went round to the gates in search of him and found him in the hands of the police they told me hed just given himself up he wouldnt give any account of himself and he lookedwell sullen and beaten down like  what will they do with him she asked turning quite pale  a man got six weeks hard labor last month for the same offence most probably thats what hell get and very little for whats hes done as youd say if you saw him doing it madam  then said lydia sternly it was to see thisshe shrank from naming itthis fight that you asked my permission to go out  yes madam it was said bashville with some bitterness i recognized lord worthington and plenty more noblemen and gentlemen there  lydia was about to reply sharply but she checked herself and her usual tranquil manner came back as she said that is no reason why you should have been there  bashvilles color began to waver and his voice to need increased control its in human nature to go to such a thing once he said but once is enough at least for me youll excuse my mentioning it madam but what with lord worthington and the rest of byrons backers screaming oaths and abuse at the other man and the opposite party doing the same to byronwell i may not be a gentleman but i hope i can conduct myself like a man even when im losing money  then do not go to such an exhibition again bashville i must not dictate to you what your amusements shall be but i do not think you are likely to benefit yourself by copying lord worthingtons tastes  i copy no lords tastes said bashville reddening you hid the man that was fighting miss carew why do you look down on the man that was only a bystander  lydias color rose too her first impulse was to treat this outburst as rebellion against her authority and crush it but her sense of justice withheld her  would you have had me betray a fugitive who took refuge in my house bashville you did not betray him  no said bashville his expression subdued to one of rueful pride when i am beaten by a better man i have courage enough to get out of his way and take no mean advantage of him  lydia not understanding looked inquiringly at him he made a gesture as if throwing something from him and continued recklessly  but one way im as good as he and better a footman is held more respectable than a prizefighter hes told you that hes in love with you and if it is to be my last word ill tell you that the ribbon round your neck is more to me than your whole body and soul is to him or his like when he took an unfair advantage of me and pretended to be a gentleman i told mr lucian of him and showed him up for what he was but when i found him today hiding in the pantry at the lodge i took no advantage of him though i knew well that if hed been no more to you than any other man of his sort youd never have hid him you know best why he gave himself up to the police after your seeing his days work but i will leave him to his luck he is the best man let the best man win i am sorry added bashville recovering his ordinary suave manner with an effort to inconvenience you by a short notice but i should take it as a particular favor if i might go this evening  you had better said lydia rising quite calmly and keeping resolutely away from her the strange emotional result of being astonished outraged and loved at one unlookedfor stroke it is not advisable that you should stay after what you have just  i knew that when i said it interposed bashville hastily and doggedly  in going away you will be taking precisely the course that would be adopted by any gentleman who had spoken to the same effect i am not offended by your declaration i recognize your right to make it if you need my testimony to further your future arrangements i shall be happy to say that i believe you to be a man of honor  bashville bowed and said in a low voice very nervously that he had no intention of going into service again but that he should always be proud of her good opinion  you are fitted for better things she said if you embark in any enterprise requiring larger means than you possess i will be your security i thank you for your invariable courtesy to me in the discharge of your duties goodbye  she bowed to him and left the room bashville awestruck returned her salutation as best he could and stood motionless after she disappeared his mind advancing on tiptoe to grasp what had just passed his chief sensation was one of relief he no longer dared to fancy himself in love with such a woman her sudden consideration for him as a suitor overwhelmed him with a sense of his unfitness for such a part he saw himself as a very young very humble and very ignorant man whose head had been turned by a pleasant place and a kind mistress wakened from his dream he stole away to pack his trunk and to consider how best to account to his fellowservants for his departure       chapter xiii      lydia resumed her work next day with shaken nerves and a longing for society many enthusiastic young ladies of her acquaintance would have brought her kisses and devotion by the next mail in response to a telegram and many more practical people would have taken considerable pains to make themselves agreeable to her for the sake of spending the autumn at wiltstoken castle but she knew that they would only cause her to regret her former solitude she shrank from the people who attached themselves to her strength and riches even when they had not calculated her gain and were conscious only of admiration and gratitude alice as a companion had proved a failure she was too young and too much occupied with the propriety of her own behavior to be anything more to lydia than an occasional tax upon her patience lydia to her own surprise thought several times of miss gisborne and felt tempted to invite her but was restrained by mistrust of the impulse to communicate with cashels mother and reluctance to trace it to its source eventually she resolved to conquer her loneliness and apply herself with increased diligence to the memoir of her father to restore her nerves she walked for an hour every day in the neighborhood and drove out in a pony carriage in the evening bashvilles duties were now fulfilled by the butler and phoebe lydia being determined to admit no more young footmen to her service  one afternoon returning from one of her daily walks she found a stranger on the castle terrace in conversation with the butler as it was warm autumn weather lydia was surprised to see a woman wearing a black silk mantle trimmed with fur and heavily decorated with spurious jet beads however as the female inhabitants of wiltstoken always approached miss carew in their best raiment without regard to hours or seasons she concluded that she was about to be asked for a subscription to a school treat a temperance festival or perhaps a testimonial to one of the wiltstoken curates  when she came nearer she saw that the stranger was an elderly ladyor possibly not a ladywith crimped hair and ringlets hanging at each ear in a fashion then long obsolete  here is miss carew said the butler shortly as if the old lady had tried his temper you had better talk to her yourself  at this she seemed fluttered and made a solemn courtesy lydia noticing the courtesy and the curls guessed that her visitor kept a dancing academy yet a certain contradictory hardihood in her frame and bearing suggested that perhaps she kept a tavern however as her face was on the whole an anxious and a good face and as her attitude towards the lady of the castle was one of embarrassed humility lydia acknowledged her salutation kindly and waited for her to speak  i hope you wont consider it a liberty said the stranger tremulously im mrs skene  lydia became ominously grave and mrs skene reddened a little then she continued as if repeating a carefully prepared and rehearsed speech it would be esteemed a favor if i might have the honor of a few words in private with your ladyship  lydia looked and felt somewhat stern but it was not in her nature to rebuff any one without strong provocation she invited her visitor to enter and led the way to the circular drawingroom the strange decorations of which exactly accorded with mrs skenes ideas of aristocratic splendor as a professor of deportment and etiquette the exchampions wife was nervous under the observation of such an expert as lydia but she got safely seated without having made a mistake to reproach herself with for although entering a room seems a simple matter to many persons it was to mrs skene an operation governed by the strict laws of the art she professed and one so elaborate that few of her pupils mastered it satisfactorily with less than a months practice mrs skene soon dismissed it from her mind she was too old to dwell upon such vanities when real anxieties were pressing upon her  oh miss she began appealingly the boy  lydia knew at once who was meant but she repeated as if at a loss the boy and immediately accused herself of insincerity  our boy maam cashel  mrs skene said lydia reproachfully  mrs skene understood all that lydias tone implied i know maam she pleaded i know well but what could i do but come to you whatever you said to him it has gone to his heart and hes dying  pardon me said lydia promptly men do not die of such things and mr cashel byron is not so deficient either in robustness of body or hardness of heart as to be an exception to that rule  yes miss said mrs skene sadly you are thinking of the profession you cant believe he has any feelings because he fights ah miss if you only knew them as i do more tenderhearted men dont breathe cashel is like a young child his feelings are that easily touched and i have known stronger than he to die of broken hearts only because they were unlucky in their calling just think what a highspirited young man must feel when a lady calls him a wild beast that was a cruel word miss it was indeed  lydia was so disconcerted by this attack that she had to pause awhile before replying then she said are you aware mrs skene that my knowledge of mr byron is very slightthat i have not seen him ten times in my life perhaps you do not know the circumstances in which i last saw him i was greatly shocked by the injuries he had inflicted on another man and i believe i spoke of them as the work of a wild beast for your sake i am sorry i said so for he has told me that he regards you as his mother and  oh no far from it miss i ask your pardon a thousand times for taking the word out of your mouth but me and ned is no more to him than your housekeeper or governess might be to you thats what im afraid you dont understand miss hes no relation of ours i do assure you that hes a gentleman born and bred and when we go back to melbourne next christmas it will be just the same as if he had never known us  i hope he will not be so ungrateful as to forget you he has told me his history  thats more than he ever told me miss so you may judge how much he thinks of you  a pause followed this mrs skene felt that the first exchange was over and that she had got the better in it  mrs skene said lydia then penetratingly when you came to pay me this visit what object did you propose to yourself what do you expect me to do  well maam said mrs skene troubled the poor lad has had crosses lately there was the disappointment about youthe first one i meanthat had been preying on his mind for a long time then there was that exhibition spar at the agricultural hall when paradise acted so dishonorable cashel heard that you were looking on and then he read the shameful way the newspapers wrote of him and he thought youd believe it all i couldnt get that thought out of his head i said to him over and over again  excuse me said lydia interrupting we had better be frank with one another it is useless to assume that he mistook my feeling on that subject i was shocked by the severity with which he treated his opponent  but bless you thats his business said mrs skone opening her eyes widely i put it to you miss she continued as if mildly reprobating some want of principle on lydias part whether an honest man shouldnt fulfil his engagements i assure you that the pay a respectable professional usually gets for a spar like that is half a guinea and that was all paradise got but cashel stood on his reputation and wouldnt take less than ten guineas and he got it too now many another in his position would have gone into the ring and fooled away the time pretending to box and just swindling those that paid him but cashel is as honest and highminded as a king you saw for yourself the trouble he took he couldnt have spared himself less if he had been fighting for a thousand a side and the belt instead of for a paltry ten guineas surely you dont think the worse of him for his honesty miss  i confess said lydia laughing in spite of herself that your view of the transaction did not occur to me  of course not maam no more it wouldnt to any one without they were accustomed to know the right and wrong of the profession well as i was saying miss that was a fresh disappointment to him it worrited him more than you can imagine then came a deal of bother about the match with paradise first paradise could only get five hundred pounds and the boy wouldnt agree for less than a thousand i think its on your account that hes been so particular about the money of late for he was never covetous before then mellish was bent on its coming off down hereabouts and the poor lad was so mortal afraid of its getting to your ears that he wouldnt consent until they persuaded him you would be in foreign parts in august glad i was when the articles were signed at last before he was worrited into his grave all the time he was training he was longing for a sight of you but he went through with it as steady and faithful as a man could and he trained beautiful i saw him on the morning of the fight and he was like a shining angel it would have done a ladys heart good to look at him ned went about like a madman offering twenty to one on him if he had lost we should have been ruined at this moment and then to think of the police coming just as he was finishing paradise i cried like a child when i heard of it i dont think there was ever anything so cruel and he could have finished him quarter of an hour sooner only he held back to make the market for ned here mrs skene overcome blew her nose before proceeding then on the top of that came what passed betwixt you and him and made him give himself up to the police lord worthington bailed him out but what with the disgrace and the disappointment and his time and money thrown away and the sting of your words all coming together he was quite brokenhearted and now he mopes and frets and neither me nor ned nor fan can get any good of him they tell me that he wont be sent to prison but if he ishere mrs skene broke down and began to cryit will be the death of him and god forgive those that have brought it about  sorrow always softened lydia but tears hardened her again she had no patience with them  and the other man she said have you heard anything of him i suppose he is in some hospital  in hospital repeated mrs skene checking her tears in alarm who  paradise replied lydia pronouncing the name reluctantly  he in hospital why bless your innocence miss i saw him yesterday looking as well as such an ugly brute could looknot a mark on him and he bragging what he would have done to cashel if the police hadnt come up hes a nasty low fighting man so he is and im only sorry that our boy demeaned himself to strip with the like of him i hear that cashel made a perfect picture of him and that you saw him i suppose you were frightened maam and very naturally too not being used to such sights i have had my ned brought home to me in that state that i have poured brandy into his eye thinking it was his mouth and even cashel careful as he is has been nearly blind for three days it is not to be expected that they could have all the money for nothing dont let it prey on your mind miss if you marriedi am only supposing it said mrs skene in soothing parenthesis as she saw lydia shrink from the wordif you were married to a great surgeon as you might be without derogation to your high rank youd be ready to faint if you saw him cut off a leg or an arm as he would have to do every day for his livelihood but youd be proud of his cleverness in being able to do it thats how i feel with regard to ned i tell you the truth maam i shouldnt like to see him in the ring no more than the lady of an officer in the guards would like to see her husband in the field of battle running his sword into the poor blacks or into the french but as its his profession and people think so highly of him for it i make up my mind to it and now i take quite an interest in it particularly as it does nobody any harm not that i would have you think that ned ever took the arm or leg off a man lord forbidor cashel either oh maam i thank you kindly and im sorry you should have given yourself the trouble this referred to the entry of a servant with tea  still said lydia when they were at leisure to resume the conversation i do not quite understand why you have come to me personally you are quite welcome but in what way did you expect to relieve mr byrons mind by visiting me did he ask you to come  hed have died first i came down of my own accord knowing what was the matter with him  and what then  mrs skene looked around to satisfy herself that they were alone then she leaned towards lydia and said in an emphatic whisper  why wont you marry him miss  because i dont choose mrs skene said lydia with perfect goodhumor  but consider a little miss where will you ever get such another chance only think what a man he is champion of the world and a gentleman as well the two things have never happened before and never will again i have known lots of champions but they were not fit company for the like of you ned was champion when i married him and my family thought that i lowered myself in doing it although i was only a professional dancer on the stage the men in the ring are common men mostly and so though they are the best men in the kingdom ladies are cut off from their society but it has been your good luck to take the fancy of one thats a gentleman what more could a lady desire where will you find his equal in health strength good looks or good manners as to his character i can tell you about that in melbourne as you may suppose all the girls and women were breaking their hearts for his sake i declare to you that i used to have two or three of them in every evening merely to look at him and he poor innocent lad taking no more notice of them than if they were cabbages he used to be glad to get away from them by going into the saloon and boxing with the gentlemen and then they used to peep at him through the door they never got a wink from him you were the first miss carew and believe me you will be the last if there had ever been another he couldnt have kept it from me because his disposition is as open as a childs and his honesty is beyond everything you can imagine i have known him to be offered eight hundred pounds to lose a fight that he could only get two hundred by winning not to mention his chance of getting nothing at all if he lost honestly you knowfor i see you know the world maamhow few men would be proof against such a temptation there are men high up in their professionso high that youd as soon suspect the queen on her throne of selling her countrys battles as themthat fight cross on the sly when its made worth their while my ned is no low prizefighter as is well known but when he let himself be beat by that little killarney primrose and went out and bought a horse and trap next day what could i think there maam i tell you that of my own husband and i tell you that cashel never was beaten although times out of mind it would have paid him better to lose than to win along of those wicked betting men not an angry word have i ever had from him nor the sign of liquor have i ever seen on him except once on neds birthday and then nothing but fun came out of him in his cups when the truth comes out of all men oh do just think how happy you ought to be miss if you would only bring yourself to look at it in the proper light a gentleman born and bred champion of the world sober honest spotless as the unborn babe able to take his own part and yours in any society and mad in love with you he thinks you an angel from heaven and so i am sure you are miss in your heart i do assure you that my fan gets quite put out because she thinks he draws comparisons to her disadvantage i dont think you can be so hard to please as to refuse him miss  lydia leaned back in her chair and looked at mrs skene with a curious expression which soon brightened into an irrepressible smile mrs skene smiled very slightly in complaisance but conveyed by her serious brow that what she had said was no laughing matter  i must take some time to consider all that you have so eloquently urged said lydia i am in earnest mrs skene you have produced a great effect upon me now let us talk of something else for the present your daughter is quite well i hope  thank you kindly maam she enjoys her health  and you also  i am as well as can be expected said mrs skene too fond of commiseration to admit that she was perfectly well  you must have a rare sense of security said lydia watching her being happily married to so celebrated aa professor of boxing as mr skene is it not pleasant to have a powerful protector  ah miss you little know exclaimed mrs skene falling into the trap baited by her own grievances and losing sight of cashels interests the fear of his getting into trouble is never off my mind ned is quietness itself until he has a drop of drink in him and then he is like the restready to fight the first that provokes him and if the police get hold of him he has no chance theres no justice for a fighting man just let it be said that hes a professional and thats enough for the magistrate away with him to prison and goodby to his pupils and his respectability at once thats what i live in terror of and as to being protected id let myself be robbed fifty times over sooner than say a word to him that might bring on a quarrel many a time when we were driving home of a night have i overpaid the cabman on the sly afraid he would grumble and provoke ned its the drink that does it all gentlemen are proud to be seen speaking with him in public and they come up one after another asking what hell have until the next thing he knows is that hes in bed with his boots on his wrist sprained and maybe his eye black trying to remember what he was doing the night before what i suffered the first three years of our marriage none can tell then he took the pledge and ever since that hes been very goodi havent seen him what you could fairly call drunk not more than three times a year it was the blessing of god and a beating he got from a milkman in westminster that made him ashamed of himself i kept him to it and made him emigrate out of the way of his old friends since that there has been a blessing on him and weve prospered  is cashel quarrelsome  at the tone of this question mrs skene suddenly realized the untimeliness of her complaints no no she protested he never drinks and as to fighting if you can believe such a thing miss i dont think he has had a casual turnup three times in his lifenot oftener at any rate all he wants is to be married and then hell be steady to his grave but if hes left adrift now lord knows what will become of him hell mope firsthes moping at presentthen hell drink then hell lose his pupils get out of condition be beaten andone word from you miss would save him if i might just tell him  nothing said lydia absolutely nothing the only assurance i can give you is that you have softened the hard opinion that i had formed of some of his actions but that i should marry mr cashel byron is simply the most improbable thing in the world all questions of personal inclination apart the mere improbability is enough in itself to appal an ordinary woman  mrs skene did not quite understand this but she understood sufficiently for her purpose she rose to go shaking her head despondently and saying i see how it is maam you think him beneath you your relations wouldnt like it  there is no doubt that my relatives would be greatly shocked and i am bound to take that into account forwhat it is worth  we should never trouble you said mrs skene lingering england will see the last of us in a month of two  that will make no difference to me except that i shall regret not being able to have a pleasant chat with you occasionally this was not true but lydia fancied she was beginning to take a hardened delight in lying  mrs skene was not to be consoled by compliments she again shook her head it is very kind of you to give me good words miss she said but if i might have one for the boy you could say what you liked to me  lydia considered far before she replied at last she said i am sorry i spoke harshly to him since driven as he was by circumstances i cannot see how he could have acted otherwise than he did and i overlooked the economic conditions of his profession in short i am not used to fisticuffs and what i saw shocked me so much that i was unreasonable but continued lydia checking mrs skenes rising hope with a warning finger how if you tell him this will you make him understand that i say so as an act of justice and not in the least as a proffer of affection  a crumb of comfort will satisfy him miss ill just tell him that ive seen you and that you meant nothing by what you said the other day and  mrs skene said lydia interrupting her softly tell him nothing at all as yet i have made up my mind at last if he does not hear from me within a fortnight you may tell him what you please can you wait so long  of course whatever you wish maam but mellishs benefit is to be tomorrow night and  what have i to do with mellish or his benefit  mrs skene abashed murmured apologetically that she was only wishful that the boy should do himself credit  if he is to benefit mellish by beating somebody he will not be behindhand remember you are not to mention me for a fortnight is that a bargain  whatever you wish maam repeated mrs skene hardly satisfied but lydia gave her no further comfort so she begged to take her leave expressing a hope that things would turn out to the advantage of all parties then lydia insisted on her partaking of some solid refreshment and afterwards drove her to the railway station in the ponycarriage just before they parted lydia suddenly recurring to their former subject said  does mr byron ever think  think said mrs skene emphatically never there isnt a more cheerful lad in existence miss  then mrs skene was carried away to london wondering whether it could be quite right for a young lady to live in a gorgeous castle without any elder of her own sex and to speak freely and civilly to her inferiors when she got home she said nothing of her excursion to mr skene in whose disposition valor so entirely took the place of discretion that he had never been known to keep a secret except as to the whereabouts of a projected fight but she sat up late with her daughter fanny tantalizing her by accounts of the splendor of the castle and consoling her by describing miss carew as a slight creature with red hair and no figure fanny having jet black hair fine arms and being one of cashels most proficient pupils  all the same fan added mrs skene as she took her candlestick at two in the morning if it comes off cashel will never be master in his own house  i can see that very plain said fanny but if respectable professional people are not good enough for him he will have only himself to thank if he gets himself looked down upon by emptyheaded swells  meanwhile lydia on her return to the castle after a long drive round the country had attempted to overcome an attack of restlessness by setting to work on the biography of her father with a view to preparing a chapter on his taste in literature she had lately been examining his favorite books for marked passages she now resumed this search not setting methodically to work but standing perched on the library ladder taking down volume after volume and occasionally dipping into the contents for a few pages or so at this desultory work the time passed as imperceptibly as the shadows lengthened the last book she examined was a volume of poems there were no marks in it but it opened at a page which had evidently lain open often before the first words lydia saw were these  what would i give for a heart of flesh to warm me through instead of this heart of stone icecold whatever i do hard and cold and small of all hearts the worst of all  lydia hastily stepped down from the ladder and recoiled until she reached a chair where she sat and read and reread these lines the failing light roused her to action she replaced the book on the shelf and said as she went to the writingtable if such a doubt as that haunted my father it will haunt me unless i settle what is to be my hearts business now and forever if it be possible for a child of mine to escape this curse of autovivisection it must inherit its immunity from its father and not from mefrom the man of emotion who never thinks and not from the woman of introspection who cannot help thinking be it so       chapter xiv      before many days had elapsed a letter came for cashel as he sat taking tea with the skene family when he saw the handwriting a deep red color mounted to his temples  oh lor said miss skene who sat next him lets read it  go to the dickens cried cashel hastily baffling her as she snatched at it  dont worrit him fan said mrs skene tenderly  not for the world poor dear said miss skene putting her hand affectionately on his shoulder let me just peep at the nameto see who its from do cashel dear  its from nobody said cashel here get out if you dont let me alone ill make it warm for you the next time you come to me for a lesson  very likely said fanny contemptuously who had the best of it today i should like to know  gev him a hot un on the chin with her right as ever i see observed skene with hoarse mirth  cashel went away from the table out of fannys reach and read the letter which ran thus  regents park dear mr cashel byroni am desirous that you should meet a lady friend of mine she will be here at three oclock tomorrow afternoon you would oblige me greatly by calling on me at that hour  yours faithfully  lydia carew  there was a long pause during which there was no sound in the room except the ticking of the clock and the munching of shrimps by the exchampion  good news i hope cashel said mrs skene at last tremulously  blow me if i understand it said cashel can you make it out and he handed the letter to his adopted mother skene ceased eating to see his wife read a feat which was to him one of the wonders of science  i think the lady she mentions must be herself said mrs skene after some consideration  no said cashel shaking his head she always says what she means  ah said skene cunningly but she cant write it though thats the worst of writing no one cant never tell exactly what it means i never signed articles yet that there werent some misunderstanding about and articles is the best writing that can be had anywhere  youd better go and see what it means said mrs skene  right said skene go and have it out with her my boy  it is short and not particularly sweet said fanny she might have had the civility to put her crest at the top  what would you give to be her said cashel derisively catching the letter as she tossed it disdainfully to him  if i was id respect myself more than to throw myself at your head  hush fanny said mrs skene youre too sharp ned you oughtnt to encourage her by laughing  next day cashel rose early went for a walk paid extra attention to his diet took some exercise with the gloves had a bath and a rub down and presented himself at regents park at three oclock in excellent condition expecting to see bashville he was surprised when the door was opened by a female servant  miss carew at home  yes sir said the girl falling in love with him at first sight mr byron sir  thats me said cashel i say is there any one with her  only a lady sir  oh dn well it cant be helped never say die  the girl led him then to a door opened it and when he entered shut it softly without announcing him the room in which he found himself was a long one lighted from the roof the walls were hung with pictures at the far end with their backs towards him were two ladies lydia and a woman whose noble carriage and elegant form would have raised hopes of beauty in a man less preoccupied than cashel but he after advancing some distance with his eyes on lydia suddenly changed countenance stopped and was actually turning to fly when the ladies hearing his light step faced about and rooted him to the spot as lydia offered him her hand her companion who had surveyed the visitor first with indifference and then with incredulous surprise exclaimed with a burst of delighted recognition like a child finding a longlost plaything my darling boy and going to cashel with the grace of a swan she clasped him in her arms in acknowledgment of which he thrust his red discomfited face over her shoulder winked at lydia with his tongue in his cheek and said  this is what you may call the voice of nature and no mistake  what a splendid creature you are said mrs byron holding him a little way from her the better to admire him do you know how handsome you are you wretch  how dye do miss carew said cashel breaking loose and turning to lydia never mind her its only my mother at least he added as if correcting himself shes my mamma  and where have you come from where have you been do you know that i have not seen you for seven years you unnatural boy think of his being my son miss carew give me another kiss my own she continued grasping his arm affectionately  what a muscular creature you are  kiss away as much as you like said cashel struggling with the old schoolboy sullenness as it returned oppressively upon him i suppose youre well you look right enough  yes she said mockingly beginning to despise him for his inability to act up to her in this thrilling scene i am right enough your language is as refined as ever and why do you get your hair cropped close like that you must let it grow and  now look here said cashel stopping her hand neatly as she raised it to rearrange his locks you just drop it or ill walk out at that door and you wont see me again for another seven years you can either take me as you find me or let me alone absalom and dan mendoza came to grief through wearing their hair long and i am going to wear mine short  mrs byron became a shade colder indeed she said just the same still cashel  just the same both one and other of us he replied before you spoke six words i felt as if wed parted only yesterday  i am rather taken aback by the success of my experiment interposed lydia i invited you purposely to meet one another the resemblance between you led me to suspect the truth and my suspicion was confirmed by the account mr byron gave me of his adventures  mrs byrons vanity was touched is he like me she said scanning his features he without heeding her said to lydia with undisguised mortification  and was that why you sent for me  are you disappointed said lydia  he is not in the least glad to see me said mrs byron plaintively he has no heart  now shell go on for the next hour said cashel looking to lydia obviously because he found it much pleasanter than looking at his mother however if you dont care i dont so fire away mamma  and you think we are really like one another said mrs byron not heeding him yes i think we are there is a certainare you married cashel with sudden mistrust  ha ha ha shouted cashel no but i hope to be some day he added venturing to glance again at lydia who was however attentively observing mrs byron  well tell me everything about yourself what are you now i do hope cashel that you have not gone upon the stage  the stage said cashel contemptuously do i look like it  you certainly do not said mrs byron whimsicallyalthough you have a certain odious professional air too what did you do when you ran away so scandalously from that stupid school in the north how do you earn your living or do you earn it  i suppose i do unless i am fed by ravens as elijah was what do you think i was best fitted for by my education and bringing up sweep a crossing perhaps when i ran away from panley i went to sea  a sailor of all things you dont look like one and pray what rank have you attained in your profession  the front rank the top of the tree said cashel shortly  mr byron is not at present following the profession of a sailor nor has he done so for many years said lydia  cashel looked at her half in appeal half in remonstrance  something very different indeed pursued lydia with quiet obstinacy and something very startling  cant you shut up exclaimed cashel i should have expected more sense from you whats the use of setting her on to make a fuss and put me in a rage ill go away if you dont stop  what is the matter said mrs byron have you been doing anything disgraceful cashel  there she goes i told you so i keep a gymnasium thats all theres nothing disgraceful in that i hope  a gymnasium repeated mrs byron with imperious disgust what nonsense you must give up everything of that kind cashel it is very silly and very low you were too ridiculously proud of course to come to me for the means of keeping yourself in a proper position i suppose i shall have to provide you with  if i ever take a penny from you may i cashel caught lydias anxious look and checked himself he paused and got away a step a cunning smile flickering on his lips no he said its just playing into your hands to lose temper with you you think you know me and you want to force the fighting well well see make me angry now if you can  there is not the slightest reason for anger said mrs byron angry herself your temper seems to have become ungovernableor rather to have remained so for it was never remarkable for sweetness  no retorted cashel jeering goodhumoredly not the slightest occasion to lose my temper not when i am told that i am silly and low why i think you must fancy that youre talking to your little cashel that blessed child you were so fond of but youre not youre talkingnow for a screech miss carewto the champion of australia the united states and england holder of three silver belts and one gold one which you can have to wear in king john if you think itll become you professor of boxing to the nobility and gentry of st jamess and common prizefighter to the whole globe without reference to weight or color for not less than five hundred pounds a side thats cashel byron  mrs byron recoiled astounded after a pause she said oh cashel how could you then approaching him again do you mean to say that you go out and fight those great rough savages  yes i do  and that you beat them  yes ask miss carew how billy paradise looked after standing before me for an hour  you wonderful boy what an occupation and you have done all this in your own name  of course i have i am not ashamed of it i often wondered whether you had seen my name in the papers  i never read the papers but you must have heard of my return to england why did you not come to see me  i wasnt quite certain that you would like it said cashel uneasily avoiding her eye hullo he exclaimed as he attempted to refresh himself by another look at lydia shes given us the slip  she is quite right to leave us alone together under the circumstances and now tell me why my precious boy should doubt that his own mother wished to see him  i dont know why he should said cashel with melancholy submission to her affection but he did  how insensible you are did you not know that you were always my cherished darlingmy only son  cashel who was now sitting beside her on an ottoman groaned and moved restlessly but said nothing  are you glad to see me  yes said cashel dismally i suppose i am iby jingo he cried with sudden animation perhaps you can give me a lift here i never thought of that i say mamma i am in great trouble at present and i think you can help me if you will  mrs byron looked at him satirically but she said soothingly of course i will help youas far as i am ablemy precious one all i possess is yours  cashel ground his feet on the floor impatiently and then sprang up after an interval during which he seemed to be swallowing some indignant protest he said  you may put your mind at rest once and for all on the subject of money i dont want anything of that sort  i am glad you are so independent cashel  so am i  do pray be more amiable  i am amiable enough he cried desperately only you wont listen  my treasure said mrs byron remorsefully what is the matter  well said cashel somewhat mollified it is this i want to marry miss carew thats all  you marry miss carew mrs byrons tenderness had vanished and her tone was shrewd and contemptuous do you know you silly boy that  i know all about it said cashel determinedlywhat she is and what i am and the rest of it and i want to marry her and whats more i will marry her if i have to break the neck of every swell in london first so you can either help me or not as you please but if you wont never call me your precious boy any more now  mrs byron abdicated her dominion there and then forever she sat with quite a mild expression for some time in silence then she said  after all i do not see why you should not it would be a very good match for you  yes but a deuced bad one for her  really i do not see that cashel when your uncle dies i suppose you will succeed to the dorsetshire property  i the heir to a property are you in earnest  of course dont you know who your people are  how could i you never told me do you mean to say that i have an uncle  old bingley byron certainly  well i am blowed butbuti meansupposing he is my uncle am i his lawful heir  yes walford byron the only other brother of your father died years ago while you were at moncriefs and he had no sons bingley is a bachelor  but said cashel cautiously wont there be some bother about myat least  my dearest child what are you thinking or talking about nothing can be clearer than your title  well said cashel blushing a lot of people used to make out that you werent married at all  what exclaimed mrs byron indignantly oh they dare not say so impossible why did you not tell me at once  i didnt think about it said cashel hastily excusing himself i was too young to care it doesnt matter now my father is dead isnt he  he died when you were a baby you have often made me angry with you poor little innocent by reminding me of him do not talk of him to me  not if you dont wish just one thing though mamma was he a gentleman  of course what a question  then i am as good as any of the swells that think themselves her equals she has a cousin in the government office a fellow who gives out that he is the home secretary and most likely sits in a big chair in a hall and cheeks the public am i as good as he is  you are perfectly well connected by your mothers side cashel the byrons are only commoners but even they are one of the oldest county families in england  cashel began to show signs of excitement how much a year are they worth he demanded  i do not know how much they are worth now your father was always in difficulties and so was his father but bingley is a miser five thousand a year perhaps  thats an independence thats enough she said she couldnt expect a man to be so thunderingly rich as she is  indeed then you have discussed the question with her  cashel was about to speak when a servant entered to say that miss carew was in the library and begged that they would come to her as soon as they were quite disengaged when the maid withdrew he said eagerly  i wish youd go home mamma and let me catch her in the library by herself tell me where you live and ill come in the evening and tell you all about it that is if you have no objection  what objection could i possibly have dearest one are you sure that you are not spoiling your chance by too much haste she has no occasion to hurry cashel and she knows it  i am dead certain that now is my time or never i always know by instinct when to go in and finish heres your mantle  in such a hurry to get rid of your poor old mother cashel  oh bother youre not old you wont mind my wanting you to go for this once will you  she smiled affectionately put on her mantle and turned her cheek towards him to be kissed the unaccustomed gesture alarmed him he retreated a step and involuntary assumed an attitude of selfdefence as if the problem before him were a pugilistic one recovering himself immediately he kissed her and impatiently accompanied her to the house door which he closed softly behind her leaving her to walk in search of her carriage alone then he stole upstairs to the library where he found lydia reading  shes gone he said  lydia put down her book looked up at him saw what was coming looked down again to hide a spasm of terror and said with a steady severity that cost her a great effort i hope you have not quarrelled  lord bless you no we kissed one another like turtledoves at odd moments she wheedles me into feeling fond of her in spite of myself she went away because i asked her to  and why do you ask my guests to go away  because i wanted to be alone with you dont look as if you didnt understand shes told me a whole heap of things about myself that alter our affairs completely my birth is all right im heir to a county family that came over with the conqueror and i shall have a decent income i can afford to give away weight to old webber now  well said lydia sternly  well said cashel unabashed the only use of all that to me is that i may marry if i like no more fighting or teaching now  and when you are married will you be as tender to your wife as you are to your mother  cashels elation vanished i knew youd think that he said i am always the same with her i cant help it she makes me look like a fool or like a brute have i ever been so with you  yes said lydia except she added that you have never shown absolute dislike to me  ah except thats a very big except but i dont dislike her blood is thicker than water and i have a softness for her only i wont put up with her nonsense but its different with you i dont know how to say it im not good at sentimentnot that theres any sentiment about it at least i dont mean that butyoure fond of me in a sort of way aint you  yes im fond of you in a sort of way  well then he said uneasily wont you marry me im not such a fool as you think and youll like me better after a while  lydia became very pale have you considered she said that henceforth you will be an idle man and that i shall always be a busy woman preoccupied with the work that may seem very dull to you  i wont be idle theres lots of things i can do besides boxing well get on together never fear people that are fond of one another never have any difficulty and people that hate each other never have any comfort ill be on the lookout to make you happy you neednt fear my interrupting your latin and greek i wont expect you to give up your whole life to me why should i theres reason in everything so long as you are mine and nobody elses ill be content and ill be yours and nobody elses whats the use of supposing half a dozen accidents that may never happen lets sign reasonable articles and then take our chance you have too much goodnature ever to be nasty  it would be a hard bargain she said doubtfully for you would have to give up your occupation and i should give up nothing but my unfruitful liberty  i will swear never to fight again and you neednt swear anything if that is not an easy bargain i dont know what is  easy for me yes but for you  never mind me you do whatever you like and ill do whatever you like you have a conscience so i know that whatever you like will be the best thing i have the most science but you have the most sense come  lydia looked around as if for a means of escape cashel waited anxiously there was a long pause  it cant be he said pathetically that you are afraid of me because i was a prizefighter  afraid of you no i am afraid of myself afraid of the future afraid for you but my mind is already made up on this subject when i brought about this meeting between you and your mother i determined to marry you if you asked me again  she stood up quietly and waited the rough hardihood of the ring fell from him like a garment he blushed deeply and did not know what to do nor did she but without willing it she came a step closer to him and turned up her face towards his he nearly blind with confusion put his arms about her and kissed her suddenly she broke loose from his arms seized the lapels of his coat tightly in her hands and leaned back until she nearly hung from him with all her weight  cashel she said we are the silliest lovers in the world i believewe know nothing about it are you really fond of me  she recovered herself immediately and made no further demonstration of the kind he remained shy and was so evidently anxious to go that she presently asked him to leave her for a while though she was surprised to feel a faint pang of disappointment when he consented  on leaving the house he hurried to the address which his mother had given him a prodigious building in westminster divided into residential flats to the seventh floor of which he ascended in a lift as he stepped from it he saw lucian webber walking away from him along a corridor obeying a sudden impulse he followed and overtook him just as he was entering a room lucian finding that some one was resisting his attempt to close the door looked out recognized cashel turned white and hastily retreated into the apartment where getting behind a writingtable he snatched a revolver from a drawer cashel recoiled amazed and frightened with his right arm up as if to ward off a blow  hullo he cried drop that dd thing will you if you dont ill shout for help  if you approach me i will fire said lucian excitedly i will teach you that your obsolete brutality is powerless against the weapons science has put into the hands of civilized men leave my apartments i am not afraid of you but i do not choose to be disturbed by your presence  confound your cheek said cashel indignantly is that the way you receive a man who comes to make a friendly call on you  friendly now doubtless when you see that i am well protected  cashel gave a long whistle oh he said you thought i came to pitch into you ha ha and you call that scienceto draw a pistol on a man but you darent fire it and well you know it youd better put it up or you may let it off without intending to i never feel comfortable when i see a fool meddling with firearms i came to tell you that im going to be married to your cousin aint you glad  lucians face changed he believed but he said obstinately i dont credit that statement it is a lie  this outraged cashel i tell you again he said in a menacing tone that your cousin is engaged to me now call me a liar and hit me in the face if you dare look here he added taking a leather case from his pocket and extracting from it a bank note ill give you that twentypound note if you will hit me one blow  lucian sick with fury and half paralyzed by a sensation which he would not acknowledge as fear forced himself to come forward cashel thrust out his jaw invitingly and said with a sinister grin put it in straight governor twenty pounds remember  at that moment lucian would have given all his political and social chances for the courage and skill of a prizefighter he could see only one way to escape the torment of cashels jeering and the self reproach of a coward he desperately clenched his fist and struck out the blow wasted itself on space and he stumbled forward against his adversary who laughed uproariously grasped his hand clapped him on the back and exclaimed  well done my boy i thought you were going to be mean but youve been game and youre welcome to the stakes ill tell lydia that you have fought me for twenty pounds and won on your merits aint you proud of yourself for having had a go at the champion  sir began lucian but nothing coherent followed  you just sit down for a quarter of an hour and dont drink anything and youll be all right when you recover youll be glad you showed pluck so goodnight for the presenti know how you feel and ill be off be sure not to try to settle yourself with wine itll only make you worse tata  as cashel withdrew lucian collapsed into a chair shaken by the revival of passions and jealousies which he had thought as completely outgrown as the schoolboy jackets in which he had formerly experienced them he tried to think of some justification of his angersome better reason for it than the vulgar taunt of a bully he told himself presently that the idea of lydia marrying such a man had maddened him to strike as cashel had predicted he was beginning to plume himself on his pluck this vein of reflection warring with his inner knowledge that he had been driven by fear and hatred into a paroxysm of wrath against a man to whom he should have set an example of dignified selfcontrol produced an exhausting whirl in his thoughts which were at once quickened and confused by the nervous shock of bodily violence to which he was quite unused unable to sit still he rose put on his hat went out and drove to the house in regents park  lydia was in her boudoir occupied with a book when he entered he was not an acute observer he could see no change in her she was as calm as ever her eyes were not even fully open and the touch of her hand subdued him as it had always done though he had never entertained any hope of possessing her since the day when she had refused him in bedford square a sense of intolerable loss came upon him as he saw her for the first time pledged to anotherand such another  lydia he said trying to speak vehemently but failing to shake off the conventional address of which he had made a second nature i have heard something that has filled me with inexpressible dismay is it true  the news has travelled fast she said yes it is true she spoke composedly and so kindly that he choked in trying to reply  then lydia you are the chief actor in a greater tragedy than i have ever witnessed on the stage  it is strange is it not she said smiling at his effort to be impressive  strange it is calamitous i trust i may be allowed to say so and you sit there reading as calmly as though nothing had happened  she handed him the book without a word  ivanhoe he said a novel  yes do you remember once before you knew me very well telling me that scotts novels were the only ones that you liked to see in the hands of ladies  no doubt i did but i cannot talk of literature just  i am not leading you away from what you want to talk about i was about to tell you that i came upon ivanhoe by chance half an hour ago when i was searchingi confess itfor something very romantic to read ivanhoe was a prizefighterthe first half of the book is a description of a prizefight i was wondering whether some romancer of the twentyfourth century will hunt out the exploits of my husband and present him to the world as a sort of english nineteenthcentury cyd with all the glory of antiquity upon his deeds  lucian made a gesture of impatience i have never been able to understand he said how it is that a woman of your ability can habitually dwell on perverse and absurd ideas oh lydia is this to be the end of all your great gifts and attainments forgive me if i touch a painful chord but this marriage seems to me so unnatural that i must speak out your father made you one of the richest and besteducated women in the world would he approve of what you are about to do  it almost seems to me that he educated me expressly to some such end whom would you have me marry  doubtless few men are worthy of you lydia but this man least of all could you not marry a gentleman if he were even an artist a poet or a man of genius of any kind i could bear to think of it for indeed i am not influenced by class prejudice in the matter but ai will try to say nothing that you must not in justice admit to be too obvious to be ignoreda man of the lower orders pursuing a calling which even the lower orders despise illiterate rough awaiting at this moment a disgraceful sentence at the hands of the law is it possible that you have considered all these things  not very deeply they are not of a kind to concern me much i can console you as to one of them i have always recognized him as a gentleman in your sense of the word he proves to be soone of considerable position in fact as to his approaching trial i have spoken with lord worthington about it and also with the lawyers who have charge of the case and they say positively that owing to certain proofs not being in the hands of the police a defence can be set up that will save him from imprisonment  there is no such defence possible said lucian angrily  perhaps not as far as i understand it it is rather an aggravation of the offence than an excuse for it but if they imprison him it will make no difference he can console himself by the certainty that i will marry him at once when he is released  lucians face lengthened he abandoned the argument and said blankly i cannot suppose that you would allow yourself to be deceived if he is a gentleman of position that of course alters the case completely  very little indeed from my point of view hardly at all and now worldly cousin lucian i have satisfied you that i am not going to connect you by marriage with a butcher bricklayer or other member of the trades from which cashels profession as you warned me is usually recruited stop a moment i am going to do justice to you you want to say that my unworldly friend lucian is far more deeply concerned at seeing the phoenix of modern culture throw herself away on a man unworthy of her  that is what i mean to say except that you put it too modestly it is a case of the phoenix not only of modern culture but of natural endowment and of every happy accident of the highest civilization throwing herself away on a man specially incapacitated by his tastes and pursuits from comprehending her or entering the circle in which she moves  listen to me patiently lucian and i will try to explain the mystery to you leaving the rest of the world to misunderstand me as it pleases first you will grant me that even a phoenix must marry some one in order that she may hand on her torch to her children her best course would be to marry another phoenix but as shepoor girlcannot appreciate even her own phoenixity much less that of another she must perforce be content with a mere mortal who is the mortal to be not her cousin lucian for rising young politicians must have helpful wives with feminine politics and powers of visiting and entertaining a description inapplicable to the phoenix not as you just now suggested a man of letters the phoenix has had her share of playing helpmeet to a man of letters and does not care to repeat that experience she is sick to death of the morbid introspection and womanish selfconsciousness of poets novelists and their like as to artists all the good ones are married and ever since the rest have been able to read in hundreds of books that they are the most gifted and godlike of men they are become almost as intolerable as their literary flatterers no lucian the phoenix has paid her debt to literature and art by the toil of her childhood she will use and enjoy both of them in future as best she can but she will never again drudge in their laboratories you say that she might at least have married a gentleman but the gentlemen she knows are either amateurs of the arts having the egotism of professional artists without their ability or they are men of pleasure which means that they are dancers tennisplayers butchers and gamblers i leave the nonentities out of the question now in the eyes of a phoenix a prizefighter is a hero in comparison with a wretch who sets a leash of greyhounds upon a hare imagine now this poor phoenix meeting with a man who had never been guilty of selfanalysis in his lifewho complained when he was annoyed and exulted when he was glad like a child and unlike a modern manwho was honest and brave strong and beautiful you open your eyes lucian you do not do justice to cashels good looks he is twentyfive and yet there is not a line in his face it is neither thoughtful nor poetic nor wearied nor doubting nor old nor selfconscious as so many of his contemporaries faces areas mine perhaps is the face of a pagan god assured of eternal youth and absolutely disqualified from comprehending faust do you understand a word of what i am saying lucian  i must confess that i do not either you have lost your reason or i have i wish you had never taking to reading faust  it is my fault i began an explanation and rambled off womanlike into praise of my lover however i will not attempt to complete my argument for if you do not understand me from what i have already said the further you follow the wider you will wander the truth in short is this i practically believe in the doctrine of heredity and as my body is frail and my brain morbidly active i think my impulse towards a man strong in body and untroubled in mind a trustworthy one you can understand that it is a plain proposition in eugenics but if i tell you that i have chosen this common pugilist because after seeing half the culture of europe i despaired of finding a better man you will only tell me again that i have lost my reason  i know that you will do whatever you have made up your mind to do said lucian desolately  and you will make the best of it will you not  the best or the worst of it does not rest with me i can only accept it as inevitable  not at all you can make the worst of it by behaving distantly to cashel or the best of it by being friendly with him  lucian reddened and hesitated she looked at him mutely encouraging him to be generous  i had better tell you he said i have seen him sincesince lydia nodded i mistook his object in coming into my room as he did unannounced in fact he almost forced his way in some words arose between us at last he taunted me beyond endurance and offered mecharacteristicallytwenty pounds to strike him and i am sorry to say that i did so  you did so and what followed  i should say rather that i meant to strike him for he avoided me or else i missed my aim he only gave the money and went away evidently with a high opinion of me he left me with a very low one of myself  what he did not retaliate exclaimed lydia recovering her color which had fled and you struck him she added  he did not replied lucian passing by the reproach probably he despised me too much  that is not fair lucian he behaved very wellfor a prizefighter surely you do not grudge him his superiority in the very art you condemn him for professing  i was wrong lydia but i grudged him you i know i have acted hastily and i will apologize to him i wish matters had fallen out otherwise  they could not have done so and i believe you will yet acknowledge that they have arranged themselves very well and now that the phoenix is disposed of i want to read you a letter i have received from alice goff which throws quite a new light on her character i have not seen her since june and she seems to have gained three years mental growth in the interim listen to this for example  and so the conversation turned upon alice  when lucian returned to his chambers he wrote the following note which he posted to cashel byron before going to bed  dear siri beg to enclose you a banknote which you left here this evening i feel bound to express my regret for what passed on that occasion and to assure you that it proceeded from a misapprehension of your purpose in calling on me the nervous disorder into which the severe mental application and late hours of the past session have thrown me must be my excuse i hope to have the pleasure of meeting you again soon and offering you personally my congratulations on your approaching marriage i am dear sir yours truly lucian webber       chapter xv      in the following month cashel byron william paradise and robert mellish appeared in the dock together the first two for having been principals in a prizefight and mellish for having acted as bottle holder to paradise these offences were verbosely described in a long indictment which had originally included the fourth man who had been captured but against whom the grand jury had refused to find a true bill the prisoners pleaded not guilty  the defence was that the fight the occurrence of which was admitted was not a prizefight but the outcome of an enmity which had subsisted between the two men since one of them at a public exhibition at islington had attacked and bitten the other in support of this it was shown that byron had occupied a house at wiltstoken and had lived there with mellish who had invited paradise to spend a holiday with him in the country this accounted for the presence of the three men at wiltstoken on the day in question words had arisen between byron and paradise on the subject of the islington affair and they had at last agreed to settle the dispute in the old english fashion they had adjourned to a field and fought fairly and determinedly until interrupted by the police who were misled by appearances into the belief that the affair was a prizefight  prizefighting was a brutal pastime cashel byrons counsel said but a fair standup fight between two unarmed men though doubtless technically a breach of the peace had never been severely dealt with by a british jury or a british judge and the case would be amply met by binding over the prisoners who were now on the best of terms with one another to keep the peace for a reasonable period the sole evidence against this view of the case he argued was police evidence and the police were naturally reluctant to admit that they had found a mares nest in proof that the fight had been premeditated and was a prizefight they alleged that it had taken place within an enclosure formed with ropes and stakes but where were those ropes and stakes they were not forthcoming and he counsel submitted that the reason was not as had been suggested because they had been spirited away for that was plainly impossible but because they had existed only in the excited imagination of the posse of constables who had arrested the prisoners  again it had been urged that the prisoners were in fighting costume but crossexamination had elicited that fighting costume meant practically no costume at all the men had simply stripped in order that their movements might be unembarrassed it had been proved that paradise had beenwell in the traditional costume of paradise roars of laughter until the police borrowed a blanket to put upon him  that the constables had been guilty of gross exaggeration was shown by their evidence as to the desperate injuries the combatants had inflicted upon one another of paradise in particular it had been alleged that his features were obliterated the jury had before them in the dock the man whose features had been obliterated only a few weeks previously if that were true where had the prisoner obtained the unblemished lineaments which he was now full of health and goodhumor presenting to them renewed laughter paradise grinning in confusion it was said that these terrible injuries the traces of which had disappeared so miraculously were inflicted by the prisoner byron a young gentleman tenderly nurtured and visibly inferior in strength and hardihood to his herculean opponent doubtless byron had been emboldened by his skill in mimic combat to try conclusions under the very different conditions of real fighting with a man whose massive shoulders and determined cast of features ought to have convinced him that such an enterprise was nothing short of desperate fortunately the police had interfered before he had suffered severely for his rashness yet it had been alleged that he had actually worsted paradise in the encounterobliterated his features that was a fair sample of the police evidence which was throughout consistently incredible and at variance with the dictates of commonsense  attention was then drawn to the honorable manner in which byron had come forward and given himself up to the police the moment he became aware that they were in search of him paradise would beyond a doubt have adopted the same course had he not been arrested at once and that too without the least effort at resistance on his part that was hardly the line of conduct that would have suggested itself to two lawless prizefighters  an attempt had been made to prejudice the prisoner byron by the statement that he was a notorious professional bruiser but no proof of that was forthcoming and if the fact were really notorious there could be no difficulty in proving it such notoriety as mr byron enjoyed was due as appeared from the evidence of lord worthington and others to his approaching marriage to a lady of distinction was it credible that a highly connected gentleman in this enviable position would engage in a prizefight risking disgrace and personal disfigurement for a sum of money that could be no object to him or for a glory that would appear to all his friends as little better than infamy  the whole of the evidence as to the character of the prisoners went to show that they were men of unimpeachable integrity and respectability an impression unfavorable to paradise might have been created by the fact that he was a professional pugilist and a man of hasty temper but it had also transpired that he had on several occasions rendered assistance to the police thereby employing his skill and strength in the interests of law and order as to his temper it accounted for the quarrel which the policeknowing his professionhad mistaken for a prizefight  mellish was a trainer of athletes and hence the witnesses to his character were chiefly persons connected with sport but they were not the less worthy of credence on that account  in fine the charge would have been hard to believe even if supported by the strongest evidence but when there was no evidencewhen the police had failed to produce any of the accessories of a prizefightwhen there were no ropes nor postsno written articlesno stakes nor stakeholdersno seconds except the unfortunate man mellish whose mouth was closed by a law which in defiance of the obvious interests of justice forbade a prisoner to speak and clear himselfnothing in fact but the fancies of constables who had under crossexamination not only contradicted one another but shown the most complete ignorance a highly creditable ignorance of the nature and conditions of a prizefight then counsel would venture to say confidently that the theory of the prosecution ingenious as it was and ably as it had been put forward was absolutely and utterly untenable  this and much more argument of equal value was delivered with relish by a comparatively young barrister whose spirits rose as he felt the truth change and fade while he rearranged its attendant circumstances cashel listened for some time anxiously he flushed and looked moody when his marriage was alluded to but when the whole defence was unrolled he was awestruck and stared at his advocate as if he half feared that the earth would gape and swallow such a reckless perverter of patent facts even the judge in the city and was eventually invited to represent a dorsetshire constituency in parliament in the radical interest he was returned by a large majority and having a loud voice and an easy manner he soon acquired some reputation both in and out of the house of commons by the popularity of his own views and the extent of his wifes information which he retailed at second hand he made his maiden speech in the house unabashed the first night he sat there indeed he was afraid of nothing except burglars big dogs doctors dentists and streetcrossings whenever any accident occurred through any of these he preserved the newspaper in which it was reported read it to lydia very seriously and repeated his favorite assertion that the only place in which a man was safe was the ring as he objected to most field sports on the ground of inhumanity she fearing that he would suffer in health and appearance from want of systematic exercise suggested that he should resume the practice of boxing with gloves but he was lazy in this matter and had a prejudice that boxing did not become a married man his career as a pugilist was closed by his marriage  his admiration for his wife survived the ardor of his first love for her and she employed all her forethought not to disappoint his reliance on her judgment she led a busy life and wrote some learned monographs as well as a work in which she denounced education as practised in the universities and public schools her children inherited her acuteness and refinement with their fathers robustness and aversion to study they were precocious and impudent had no respect for cashel and showed any they had for their mother principally by running to her when they were in difficulties she never punished nor scolded them but she contrived to make their misdeeds recoil naturally upon them so inevitably that they soon acquired a lively moral sense which restrained them much more effectually than the usual methods of securing order in the nursery cashel treated them kindly for the purpose of conciliating them and when lydia spoke of them to him in private he seldom said more than that the imps were too sharp for him or that he was blest if he didnt believe that they were born older than their father lydia often thought so too but the care of this troublesome family had one advantage for her it left her little time to think about herself or about the fact that when the illusion of her love passed away cashel fell in her estimation but the children were a success and she soon came to regard him as one of them when she had leisure to consider the matter at all which seldom occurred it seemed to her that on the whole she had chosen wisely  alice goff when she heard of lydias projected marriage saw that she must return to wiltstoken and forget her brief social splendor as soon as possible she therefore thanked miss carew for her bounty and begged to relinquish her post of companion lydia assented but managed to delay this sacrifice to a sense of duty and necessity until a day early in winter when lucian gave way to a hankering after smiled once or twice and when he did so the jurymen grinned but recovered their solemnity suddenly when the bench recollected itself and became grave again every one in court knew that the police were rightthat there had been a prizefightthat the betting on it had been recorded in all the sporting papers for weeks beforehandthat cashel was the most terrible fighting man of the day and that paradise had not dared to propose a renewal of the interrupted contest and they listened with admiration and delight while the advocate proved that these things were incredible and nonsensical  it remained for the judge to sweep away the defence or to favor the prisoners by countenancing it fortunately for them he was an old man and could recall not without regret a time when the memory of cribb and molyneux was yet green he began his summingup by telling the jury that the police had failed to prove that the fight was a prizefight after that the public by indulging in roars of laughter whenever they could find a pretext for doing so without being turned out of court showed that they had ceased to regard the trial seriously  finally the jury acquitted mellish and found cashel and paradise guilty of a common assault they were sentenced to two days imprisonment and bound over to keep the peace for twelve months in sureties of one hundred and fifty pounds each the sureties were forthcoming and as the imprisonment was supposed to date from the beginning of the sessions the prisoners were at once released       chapter xvi      miss carew averse to the anomalous relations of courtship made as little delay as possible in getting married cashels luck was not changed by the event bingley byron died three weeks after the ceremony which was civic and private and cashel had to claim possession of the property in dorsetshire in spite of his expressed wish that the lawyers would take themselves and the property to the devil and allow him to enjoy his honeymoon in peace the transfer was not however accomplished at once owing to his mothers capricious reluctance to give the necessary information without reserve and to the laws delay his first child was born some time before his succession was fully established and the doors of his ancestral hall opened to him the conclusion of the business was a great relief to his attorneys who had been unable to shake his conviction that the case was clear enough but that the referee had been squared by this he meant that the lord chancellor had been bribed to keep him out of his property  his marriage proved an unusually happy one to make up for the loss of his occupation he farmed and lost six thousand pounds by it tried gardening with better success began to meddle in commercial enterprises and became director of several trading companies in the city and was eventually invited to represent a dorsetshire constituency in parliament in the radical interest he was returned by a large majority and having a loud voice and an easy manner he soon acquired some reputation both in and out of the house of commons by the popularity of his own views and the extent of

and begged to relinquish her post of companion lydia assented but managed to delay this sacrifice to a sense of duty and necessity until a day early in winter when lucian gave way to a hankering after domestic joys that possessed him and allowed his cousin to persuade him to offer his hand to alice she indignantly refusednot that she had any reason to complain of him but because the prospect of returning to wiltstoken made her feel ill used and she could not help revenging her soreness upon the first person whom she could find a pretext for attacking he lukewarm before now became eager and she was induced to relent without much difficulty lucian was supposed to have made a brilliant match and as it proved he made a fortunate one she kept his house entertained his guests and took charge of his social connections so ably that in course of time her invitations came to be coveted by people who were desirous of moving in good society she was even better looking as a matron than she had been as a girl and her authority in matters of etiquette inspired nervous novices with all the terrors she had herself felt when she first visited wiltstoken castle she invited her brotherinlaw and his wife to dinner twice a yearat midsummer and easter but she never admitted that either wallace parker or cashel byron were gentlemen although she invited the latter freely notwithstanding the frankness with which he spoke to strangers after dinner of his former exploits without deference to their professions or prejudices her respect for lydia remained so great that she never complained to her of cashel save on one occasion when he had shown a bishop whose house had been recently broken into and robbed how to break a burglars back in the act of grappling with him  the skenes returned to australia and went their way there as mrs byron did in england in the paths they had pursued for years before cashel spoke always of mrs skene as mother and of mrs byron as mamma  william paradise though admired by the fair sex for his strength courage and fame was not like cashel and skene wise or fortunate enough to get a good wife he drank so exceedingly that he had but few sober intervals after his escape from the law he claimed the title of champion of england on cashels retirement from the ring and challenged the world the world responded in the persons of sundry young laboring men with a thirst for glory and a taste for fighting paradise fought and prevailed twice then he drank while in training and was beaten but by this time the ring had again fallen into the disrepute from which cashels unusual combination of pugilistic genius with honesty had temporarily raised it and the law again seizing paradise as he was borne vanquished from the field atoned for its former leniency by incarcerating him for six months the abstinence thus enforced restored him to health and vigor and he achieved another victory before he succeeded in drinking himself into his former state this was his last triumph with his natural ruffianism complicated by drunkenness he went rapidly down the hill into the valley of humiliation after becoming noted for his readiness to sell the victories he could no longer win he only appeared in the ring to test the capabilities of untried youths who beat him to their hearts content he became a potman and was immediately discharged as an inebriate he had sunk into beggary when hearing in his misery that his former antagonist was contesting a parliamentary election he applied to him for alms cashel at the time was in dorsetshire but lydia relieved the destitute wretch whose condition was now far worse than it had been at their last meeting at his next application which followed soon he was confronted by cashel who bullied him fiercely threatened to break every bone in his skin if he ever again dared to present himself before lydia flung him five shillings and bade him be gone for cashel retained for paradise that contemptuous and ruthless hatred in which a duly qualified professor holds a quack paradise bought a few penceworth of food which he could hardly eat and spent the rest in brandy which he drank as fast as his stomach would endure it shortly afterwards a few sporting papers reported his death which they attributed to consumption brought on by the terrible injuries sustained by him in his celebrated fight with cashel byron
