  work work all the day      i have got no time to play  this little rhyme paddy the beaver made up as he toiled at building the dam which was to make the pond he so much desired deep in the green forest of course it wasnt quite true that about working all night and all day nobody could do that you know and keep it up everybody has to rest and sleep yes and everybody has to play a little to be at their best so it wasnt quite true that paddy worked all day after working all night but it was true that paddy had no time to play he had too much to do he had had his playtime during the long summer and now he had to get ready for the long cold winter  now of all the little workers in the green forest on the green meadows and in the smiling pool none can compare with paddy the beaver not even his cousin jerry muskrat happy jack squirrel and striped chipmunk store up food for the long cold months when rough brother north wind and jack frost rule and jerry muskrat builds a fine house wherein to keep warm and comfortable but all this is as nothing to the work of paddy the beaver  as i said before paddy had had a long playtime through the summer he had wandered up and down the laughing brook he had followed it way up to the place where it started and all the time he had been studying and studying to make sure that he wanted to stay in the green forest in the first place he had to be sure that there was plenty of the kind of food that he likes then he had to be equally sure that he could make a pond near where this particular food grew last of all he had to satisfy himself that if he did make a pond and build a home he would be reasonably safe in it and all these things he had done in his playtime now he was ready to go to work and when paddy begins work he sticks to it until it is finished he says that is the only way to succeed and you know and i know that he is right  now paddy the beaver can see at night just as reddy fox and peter rabbit and bobby coon can and he likes the night best because he feels safest then but he can see in the daytime too and when he feels that he is perfectly safe and no one is watching he works then too of course the first thing to do was to build a dam across the laughing brook to make the pond he so much needed he chose a low open place deep in the green forest around the edge of which grew many young aspen trees the bark of which is his favorite food through the middle of this open place flowed the laughing brook at the lower edge was just the place for a dam it would not have to be very long and when it was finished and the water was stopped in the laughing brook it would just have to flow over the low open place and make a pond there paddys eyes twinkled when he first saw it it was right then that he made up his mind to stay in the green forest  so now that he was ready to begin his dam he went up the laughing brook to a place where alders and willows grew and there he began work that work was the cutting of a great number of trees by means of his big front teeth which were given him for just this purpose and as he worked paddy was happy for one can never be truly happy who does no work    chapter ii  paddy plans a pond  paddy the beaver was busy cutting down trees for the dam he had planned to build up in the woods of the north from which he had come to the green forest he had learned all about treecutting and dambuilding and canaldigging and housebuilding paddys father and mother had been very wise in the beaver world and paddy had been quick to learn so now he knew just what to do and the best way of doing it you know a great many people waste time and labor doing things the wrong way so that they have to be done over again they forget to be sure they are right and so they go ahead until they find they are wrong and all their work goes for nothing  but paddy the beaver isnt this kind paddy would never have leaped into the spring with the steep sides without looking as grandfather frog did so now he carefully picked out the trees to cut he could not afford to waste time cutting down a tree that wasnt going to be just what he wanted when it was down when he was sure that the tree was right he looked up at the top to find out whether when he had cut it it would fall clear of other trees he had learned to do that when he was quite young and heedless he remembered just how he had felt when after working hard oh so hard to cut a big tree he had warned all his friends to get out of the way so that they would not be hurt when it fell and then it hadnt fallen at all because the top had caught in another tree he was so mortified that he didnt get over it for a long time  so now he made sure that a tree was going to fall clear and just where he wanted it then he sat up on his hind legs and with his great broad tail for a brace began to make the chips fly you know paddy has the most wonderful teeth for cutting they are long and broad and sharp he would begin by making a deep bite and then another just a little way below then he would pry out the little piece of wood between when he had cut very deep on one side so that the tree would fall that way he would work around to the other side just as soon as the tree began to lean and he was sure that it was going to fall he would scamper away so as to be out of danger he loved to see those tall trees lean forward slowly then faster and faster till they struck the ground with a crash  just as soon as they were down he would trim off the branches until the trees where just long poles this was easy work for he could take off a goodsized branch with one bite on many he left their bushy tops when he had trimmed them to suit him and had cut them into the right lengths he would tug and pull them down to the place where he meant to build his dam  there he placed the poles side by side not across the laughing brook like a bridge but with the big ends pointing up the laughing brook which was quite broad but shallow right there to keep them from floating away he rolled stones and piled mud on the bushy ends clear across on both sides he laid those poles until the water began to rise then he dragged more poles and piled them on top of these and wedged short sticks crosswise between them  and all the time the laughing brook was having harder and harder work to run its merry laugh grew less merry and finally almost stopped because you see the water could not get through between all those poles and sticks fast enough it was just about that time that the little people of the smiling pool decided that it was time to see just what paddy was doing and they started up the laughing brook leaving only grandfather frog and the tadpoles in the smiling pool which for a little while would smile no more    chapter iii  paddy has many visitors  paddy the beaver knew perfectly well that he would have visitors just as soon as he began to build his dam he expected a lot of them you see he knew that none of them ever had seen a beaver at work unless perhaps it was prickly porky the porcupine who also had come down from the north so as he worked he kept his ears open and he smiled to himself as he heard a little rustle here and then a little rustle there he knew just what those little rustles meant each one meant another visitor yes sir each rustle meant another visitor and yet not one had shown himself  paddy chuckled seems to me that you are dreadfully afraid to show yourselves said he in a loud voice just as if he were talking to nobody in particular everything was still there wasnt so much as a rustle after paddy spoke he chuckled again he could just feel ever so many eyes watching him though he didnt see a single pair and he knew that the reason his visitors were hiding so carefully was because they were afraid of him you see paddy was much bigger than most of the little meadow and forest people and they didnt know what kind of a temper he might have it is always safest to be very distrustful of strangers that is one of the very first things taught all little meadow and forest children  of course paddy knew all about this he had been brought up that way be sure and then youll never be sorry had been one of his mothers favorite sayings and he had always remembered it indeed it had saved him a great deal of trouble so now he was perfectly willing to go right on working and let his hidden visitors watch him until they were sure that he meant them no harm you see he himself felt quite sure that none of them was big enough to do him any harm little joe otter was the only one he had any doubts about and he felt quite sure that little joe wouldnt try to pick a quarrel so he kept right on cutting trees trimming off the branches and hauling the trunks down to the dam he was building some of them he floated down the laughing brook this was easier  now when the little people of the smiling pool who were the first to find out that paddy the beaver had come to the green forest had started up the laughing brook to see what he was doing they had told the merry little breezes where they were going the merry little breezes had been greatly excited they couldnt understand how a stranger could have been living in the green forest without their knowledge you see they quite forgot that they very seldom wandered to the deepest part of the green forest of course they started at once as fast as they could go to tell all the other little people who live on or around the green meadows all but old man coyote for some reason they thought it best not to tell him they were a little doubtful about old man coyote he was so big and strong and so sly and smart that all his neighbors were afraid of him perhaps the merry little breezes had this fact in mind and knew that none would dare go to call on the stranger if they knew that old man coyote was going too anyway they simply passed the time of day with old mr coyote and hurried on to tell everyone else and the very last one they met was sammy jay    chapter iv  sammy jay speaks his mind  when sammy jay reached the place deep in the green forest where paddy the beaver was so hard at work he didnt hide as had the little fourfooted people you see of course he had no reason to hide because he felt perfectly safe paddy had just cut a big tree and it fell with a crash as sammy came hurrying up sammy was so surprised that for a minute he couldnt find his tongue he had not supposed that anybody but farmer brown or farmer browns boy could cut down so large a tree as that and it quite took his breath away but he got it again in a minute he was boiling with anger anyway to think that he should have been the last to learn that paddy had come down from the north to make his home in the green forest and here was a chance to speak his mind  thief thief thief he screamed in his harshest voice  paddy the beaver looked up with a twinkle in his eyes hello mr jay i see you havent any better manners than your cousin who lives up where i come from said he  thief thief thief screamed sammy hopping up and down he was so angry  meaning yourself i suppose said paddy i never did see an honest jay and i dont suppose i ever will  ha ha ha laughed peter rabbit who had quite forgotten that he was hiding  oh how do you do mr rabbit im very glad you have called on me this morning said paddy just as if he hadnt known all the time just where peter was mr jay seems to have gotten out of the wrong side of his bed this morning  peter laughed again he always does said he if he didnt he wouldnt be happy you wouldnt think it to look at him but he is happy right now he doesnt know it but he is he always is  happy when he can show what a bad temper he has  sammy jay glared down at peter then he glared at paddy and all the time he still shrieked thief as hard as ever he could paddy kept right on working paying no attention to sammy this made sammy more angry than ever he kept coming nearer and nearer until at last he was in the very tree that paddy happened to be cutting paddys eyes twinkled  im no thief he exclaimed suddenly  you are you are thief thief shrieked sammy youre steeling our trees  theyre not your trees retorted paddy they belong to the green forest and the green forest belongs to all who love it and we all have a perfect right to take what we need from it i need these trees and ive just as much right to take them as you have to take the fat acorns that drop in the fall  no such thing screamed sammy you know he cant talk without screaming and the more excited he gets the louder he screams no such thing acorns are food they are meant to eat i have to have them to live but you are cutting down whole trees you are spoiling the green forest you dont belong here nobody invited you and nobody wants you youre a thief  then up spoke jerry muskrat who you know is cousin to paddy the beaver  dont you mind him said he pointing at sammy jay nobody does hes the greatest troublemaker in the green forest or on the green meadows he would steal from his own relatives dont mind what he says cousin paddy  now all this time paddy had been working away just as if no one was around just as jerry stopped speaking paddy thumped the ground with his tail which is his way of warning people to watch out and suddenly scurried away as fast as he could run sammy jay was so surprised that he couldnt find his tongue for a minute and he didnt notice anything peculiar about that tree then suddenly he felt himself falling with a frightened scream he spread his wings to fly but branches of the tree swept him down with them right into the laughing brook you see while sammy had been speaking his mind paddy the beaver had cut down the very tree in which he was sitting  sammy wasnt hurt but he was wet and muddy and terribly frightenedthe most miserablelooking jay that ever was seen it was too much for all the little people who were hiding they just had to laugh then they all came out to pay their respects to paddy the beaver    chapter v  paddy keeps his promise  paddy the beaver kept right on working just as if he hadnt any visitors you see it is a big undertaking to build a dam and when that was done there was a house to build and a supply of food for the winter to cut and store oh paddy the beaver had no time for idle gossip you may be sure so he kept right on building his dam it didnt look much like a dam at first and some of paddys visitors turned up their noses when they first saw it they had heard stories of what a wonderful dambuilder paddy was and they had expected to see something like the smooth grasscovered bank with which farmer brown kept the big river from running back on his low lands instead all they saw was a great pile of poles and sticks which looked like anything but a dam  pooh exclaimed billy mink i guess we neednt worry about the laughing brook and the smiling pool if that is the best paddy can do why the water of the laughing brook will work through that in no time  of course paddy heard him but he said nothing just kept right on working  just look at the way he has laid those sticks continued billy mink seems as if anyone would know enough to lay them across the laughing brook instead of just the other way i could build a better dam than that  paddy said nothing he just kept right on working  yes sir billy boasted i could build a better dam than that why that pile of sticks will never stop the water  is something the matter with your eyesight billy mink inquired jerry muskrat  of course not retorted billy indignantly why  oh nothing much only you dont seem to notice that already the laughing brook is over its banks above paddys dam replied jerry who had been studying the dam with a great deal of interest  billy looked a wee bit foolish for sure enough there was a little pool just above the dam and it was growing bigger  sammy was terribly put out to think that anything should be going on that he didnt know about first you know he is very fond of prying into the affairs of other people and he loves dearly to boast that there is nothing going on in the green forest or on the green meadows that he doesnt know about so now his pride was hurt and he was in a terrible rage as he started after the merry little breezes for the place deep in the green forest where they said paddy the beaver was at work he didnt believe a word of it but he would see for himself  paddy still kept at work saying nothing he was digging in front of the dam now and the mud and grass he dug up he stuffed in between the ends of the sticks and patted them down with his hands he did this all along the front of the dam and on top of it too wherever he thought it was needed of course this made it harder for the water to work through and the little pond above the dam began to grow faster it wasnt a great while before it was nearly to the top of the dam which at first was very low then paddy brought more sticks this was easier now because he could float them down from where he was cutting he would put them in place on the top of the dam then hurry for more wherever it was needed he would put in mud he even rolled a few stones in to help hold the mass  so the dam grew and grew and so did the pond above the dam of course it took a good many days to build so big a dam and a lot of hard work every morning the little people of the green forest and the green meadow would visit it and every morning they would find that it had grown a great deal in the night for that is when paddy likes best to work  by this time the laughing brook had stopped laughing and down in the smiling pool there was hardly water enough for the minnows to feel safe a minute billy mink had stopped making fun of the dam and all the little people who live in the laughing brook and smiling pool were terribly worried  to be sure paddy had warned them of what he was going to do and had promised that as soon as his pond was big enough the water would once more run in the laughing brook they tried to believe him but they couldnt help having just a wee bit of fear that he might not be wholly honest you see they didnt know him for he was a stranger jerry muskrat was the only one who seemed absolutely sure that everything would be all right perhaps that was because paddy is his cousin and jerry couldnt help feeling proud of such a big cousin and one who was so smart  so day by day the dam grew and pond grew and one morning grandfather frog down in what had once been the smiling pool heard a sound that made his heart jump for joy it was a murmur that kept growing and growing until at last it was the merry laugh of the laughing brook then he knew that paddy had kept his word and water would once more fill the smiling pool    chapter vi  farmer browns boy grows curious  now it happened that the very day before paddy the beaver decided that his pond was big enough and so allowed the water to run in the laughing brook once more farmer browns boy took it into his head to go fishing in the smiling pool just as usual he went whistling down across the green meadows somehow when he goes fishing he always feels like whistling grandfather frog heard him coming and dived into the little bit of water remaining in the smiling pool and stirred up the mud at the bottom so that farmer browns boy shouldnt see him  nearer and nearer drew the whistle suddenly it stopped right short off farmer browns boy had come in sight of the smiling pool or rather it was what used to be the smiling pool now there wasnt any smiling pool for the very little pool left was too small and sickly looking to smile there were great banks of mud out of which grew the bulrushes the lily pads were forlornly stretched out toward the tiny pool of water remaining where the banks were steep and high the holes that jerry muskrat and billy mink knew so well were plain to see over at one side stood jerry muskrats house wholly out of water  somehow it seemed to farmer browns boy that he must be dreaming he never never had seen anything like this before not even in the very driest weather of the hottest part of the summer he looked this way and looked that way the green meadows looked just as usual the green forest looked just as usual the laughing brookha what was the matter with the laughing brook he couldnt hear it and that you know was very unusual he dropped his rod and ran over to the laughing brook there wasnt any brook no sir there wasnt any brook just pools of water with the tiniest of streams trickling between big stones over which he had always seen the water running in the prettiest of little white falls were bare and dry in the little pools frightened minnows were darting about  farmer browns boy scratched his head in a puzzled way i dont understand it said he i dont understand it at all something must have gone wrong with the springs that supply the water for the laughing brook they must have failed yes sir that is just what must have happened but i never heard of such a thing happening before and i really dont see how it could happen he stared up into the green forest just as if he thought he could see those springs of course he didnt think anything of the kind he was just turning it all over in his mind i know what ill do ill go up to those springs this afternoon and find out what the trouble is he said out loud they are way over almost on the other side of the green forest and the easiest way to get there will be to start from home and cut across the old pasture up to the edge of the mountain behind the green forest if i try to follow up the laughing brook now it will take too long because it winds and twists so besides it is too hard work  with that farmer browns boy went back and picked up his rod then he started for home across the green meadows and for once he wasnt whistling you see he was too busy thinking in fact he was so busy thinking that he didnt see jimmy skunk until he almost stepped on him and then he gave a frightened jump and ran for without a gun he was just as much afraid of jimmy as jimmy was of him when he did have a gun  jimmy just grinned and went on about his business it always tickles jimmy to see people run away from him especially people so much bigger than himself they look so silly  i should think that they would have learned by this time that if they dont bother me i wont bother them he muttered as he rolled over a stone to look for fat beetles somehow folks never seem to understand me    chapter vii  farmer browns boy gets another surprise  across the old pasture to the foot of the mountain back of the green forest tramped farmer browns boy ahead of him trotted bowser the hound sniffing and snuffing for the tracks of reddy or granny fox of course he didnt find them for reddy and granny hadnt been up in the old pasture for a long time but he did find old jed thumper the big gray rabbit who had made things so uncomfortable for peter rabbit once upon a time and gave old jed such a fright that he didnt look where he was going and almost ran headfirst into farmer browns boy  hi there you old cottontail yelled farmer browns boy and this frightened off jed still more so that he actually ran right past his own castle of bullbriars without seeing it  farmer browns boy kept on his way laughing at the fright of old jed thumper presently he reached the springs from which came the water that made the very beginning of the laughing brook he expected to find them dry for way down on the green meadows the smiling pool was nearly dry and the laughing brook was nearly dry and he had supposed that of course the reason was that the springs where the laughing brook started were no longer bubbling  but they were the clear cold water came bubbling up out of the ground just as it always had and ran off down into the green forest in a little stream that would grow and grow as it ran and became the laughing brook farmer browns boy took off his ragged old straw hat and scowled down at the bubbling water just as if it had no business to be bubbling there  of course he didnt think just that the fact is he didnt know just what he did think here were the springs bubbling away just as they always had there was the little stream starting off down into the green forest with a gurgle that by and by would become a laugh just as it always had and yet down on the green meadows on the other side of the green forest there was no longer a laughing brook or a smiling pool he felt as if he ought to pinch himself to make sure that he was awake and not dreaming  i dont know what it means said he talking out loud no sir i dont know what it means at all but im going to find out theres a cause for everything in this world and when a fellow doesnt know a thing it is his business to find out all about it im going to find out what has happened to the laughing brook if it takes me a year  with that he started to follow the little stream which ran gurgling down into the green forest he had followed that little stream more than once and now he found it just as he remembered it the farther it ran the larger it grew until at last it became the laughing brook merrily tumbling over rocks and making deep pools in which the trout loved to hide at last he came to the edge of a little open hollow in the very heart of the green forest he knew what splendid deep holes there were in the laughing brook here and how the big trout loved to lie in them because they were deep and cool he was thinking of these trout now and wishing that he had brought along his fishing rod he pushed his way through a thicket of alders and thenfarmer browns boy stopped suddenly and fairly gasped he had to stop because there right in front of him was a pond  he rubbed his eyes and looked again then he stooped down and put his hand in the water to see if it was real there was no doubt about it it was real watera real pond where there never had been a pond before it was very still there in the heart of the green forest it was always very still there but it seemed stiller than usual as he tramped around the edge of this strange pond he felt as if it were all a dream he wondered if pretty soon he wouldnt wake up and find it all untrue but he didnt so he kept on tramping until presently he came to a dama splendid dam of logs and sticks and mud over the top of it the water was running and down in the green forest below he could hear the laughing brook just beginning to laugh once more farmer browns boy sat down with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands he was almost too much surprised to even think    chapter  viii  peter rabbit gets a ducking  farmer browns boy sat with his chin in his hands staring at the new pond in the green forest and at the dam which had made it that dam puzzled him who could have built it what did they build it for why hadnt he heard them chopping he looked carelessly at the stump of one of the trees and then a still more puzzled look made deep furrows between his eyes it looked yes it looked very much as if teeth and not an axe had cut down that tree farmer browns boy stared  and stared his mouth gaping wide open he looked so funny that peter rabbit who was hiding under an old pile of brush close by nearly laughed right out  but peter didnt laugh no sir peter didnt laugh for just that very minute something happened sniff sniff that was right behind him at the very edge of the old brushpile and every hair on peter stood on end with fright  bow wow wow it seemed to peter that the great voice was right in his very ears it frightened him so that he just had to jump he didnt have time to think and so he jumped right out from under the pile of brush and of course right into plain sight and the very instant he jumped there came another great roar behind him of course it was from bowser the hound you see bowser had been following the trail of his master but as he always stops to sniff at everything he passes he had been some distance behind when he came to the pile of brush under which peter was hiding he had sniffed at that and of course he had smelled peter right away  now when peter jumped out so suddenly he had landed right at one end of the dam the second roar of bowsers great voice frightened him still more and  he jumped right up on the dam there was nothing for him to do now but go across and it wasnt the best of going no indeed it wasnt the best of going you see it was mostly a tangle of sticks happy jack squirrel or chatterer the red squirrel or striped chipmunk would have skipped across it without the least trouble but peter rabbit has no sharp little claws with which to cling to logs and sticks and right away he was in a peck of trouble he slipped down between the sticks scrambled out slipped again and then trying to make a long jump he lost his balance andtumbled heels over head into the water  poor peter rabbit he gave himself up for lost this time he could swim but at best he is a poor swimmer and doesnt like the water he couldnt dive and keep out of sight like jerry muskrat or billy mink all he could do was to paddle as fast as his legs would go the water had gone up his nose and down his throat so that he choked and all the time he felt sure that bowser the hound would plunge in after him and catch him and if he shouldnt why farmer browns boy would simply wait for him to come ashore and then catch him  but farmer browns boy didnt do anything of the kind no sir he didnt instead he shouted to bowser and called him away bowser didnt want to come but he long ago learned to obey and very slowly he walked over to where his master was sitting  you know it wouldnt be fair old fellow to try to catch peter now it wouldnt be fair at all and we never want to do anything unfair do we said he perhaps bowser didnt agree but he wagged his tail as if he did and sat down beside his master to watch peter swim  it seemed to peter as if he never never would reach the shore though really it was only a very little distance that he had to swim when he did scramble out he was a sorrylooking rabbit he didnt waste any time but started for home as fast as he could go lippertylippertylip and farmer browns boy and bowser the hound just laughed and didnt try to catch him at all  well i never exclaimed sammy jay who had seen it all from the top of a pine tree well i never i guess farmer browns boy isnt so bad after all    chapter ix  paddy plans a house  paddy the beaver sat on his dam and  his eyes shone with happiness as he looked out over the shining water of the pond he had made all around the edge of it grew the tall trees of the green forest it was very beautiful and very still and very lonesome that is it would have seemed lonesome to almost anyone but paddy the beaver but paddy never is lonesome you see he finds company in the trees and flowers and all the little plants  it was still very very still over on one side was a beautiful rosy glow in the water it was the reflection from jolly round red mr sun paddy couldnt see him because of the tall trees but he knew exactly what mr sun was doing he was going to bed behind the purple hills pretty soon the little stars would come out and twinkle down at him he loves the little stars and always watches for the first one  yes paddy the beaver was very happy he would have been perfectly happy except for one thing farmer browns boy had found his dam and pond that very afternoon and paddy wasnt quite sure what farmer browns boy might do he had kept himself snugly hidden while farmer browns boy was there and he felt quite sure that farmer browns boy didnt know who had built the dam but for this reason he might he just might try to find out all about it and that would mean that paddy would always have to be on the watch  but whats the use of worrying over troubles that havent come yet and may never come time enough to worry when they do come said paddy to himself which shows that paddy has a great deal of wisdom in his little brown head the thing for me to do now is to get ready for winter and that means a great deal of work he continued let me see ive got to build a house a big stout warm house where i will be warm and safe when my pond is frozen over and ive got to lay in a supply of food enough to last me until gentle sister south wind comes to prepare the way for lovely mistress spring my my i cant afford to be sitting here dreaming when there is so much to be done  with that paddy slipped into the water and swam all around his new pond to make sure of just the best place to build his house now placing ones house in just the right place is a very important matter some people are dreadfully careless about this jimmy skunk for instance often makes the mistake of digging his house you know jimmy makes his house underground right where everyone who happens along that way will see it perhaps that is because jimmy is so independent that he doesnt care who knows where he lives  but paddy the beaver never is careless he always chooses just the very best place he makes sure that it is best before he begins so now although he was quite positive just where his house should be he swam around the pond to make doubly sure then when he was quite satisfied he swam over to the place he had chosen it was where the water was quite deep  there mustnt be the least chance that the ice will ever get thick enough too close up my doorway said he and im sure it never will here i must make the foundations strong and the walls thick i must have plenty of mud to plaster with and inside up above the water i must have the snuggest warmest room where i can sleep in comfort this is the place to build it and it is high time i was at work  with that paddy swam over to the place where he had cut the trees for his dam and his heart was light for he had long ago learned that the surest way to be happy is to be busy    chapter x  paddy starts his house  jerry muskrat was very much interested when he found that paddy the beaver who you know is his cousin was building a house jerry is a housebuilder himself and down deep in his heart he very much doubted if paddy could build as good a house as he could his house was down in the smiling pool and jerry thought it a very wonderful house indeed and was very proud of it it was built of mud and sod and little alder and willow twigs and bulrushes jerry had spent one winter in it and he had decided to spend another there after he had fixed it up a little so as long as he didnt have to build a brandnew house he could afford the time to watch his cousin paddy perhaps he hoped that paddy would ask his advice  but paddy did nothing of the kind he had seen jerry muskrats house and he had smiled but he  had taken great pains not to let jerry see that smile he wouldnt have hurt jerrys feelings for the world he is too polite and goodnatured to do anything like that so jerry sat on the end of an old log and watched paddy work the first thing to build was the foundation this was of mud and grass with sticks worked into it to hold it together paddy dug the mud from the bottom of his new pond and because the pond was new there was a great deal of grassy sod there which was just what paddy needed it was very convenient  jerry watched a little while and then because jerry is a worker himself he just had to get busy and help rather timidly he told his big cousin that he would like to have a share in building the new house  all right replied paddy that will be fine you can bring mud while i am getting the sticks and grass  so jerry dived down to the bottom of the pond and dug up mud and piled it on the foundation and was happy the little stars looked down and twinkled merrily as they watched the two workers so the foundation grew and grew down under the water jerry was very much surprised at the size of it it was ever and ever so much bigger than the foundation for his own house you see he had forgotten how much bigger paddy is  each night jerry and paddy worked resting during the daytime occasionally bobby coon or reddy fox or unc billy possum or jimmy skunk would come to the edge of the pond to see what was going on peter rabbit came every night but they couldnt see much because you know paddy and jerry were working under water  but at last peter was rewarded there just above the water was a splendid platform of mud and grass and sticks a great many sticks were carefully laid as soon as the platform was above the water for paddy was very particular about this you see it was to be the floor for the splendid room he was planning to build when it suited him he began to pile mud in the very middle  jerry puzzled and puzzled over this where was paddys room going to be if he piled up the mud that way but he didnt like to ask questions so he kept right on helping paddy would dive down to the bottom and then come up with double handfuls of mud which he held against his chest he would scramble out onto the platform and waddle over to the pile in the middle where he would put the mud and pat it down then back to the bottom for more  and so the mud pile grew and grew until it was quite two feet high  now said paddy ill build the walls and i guess you cant help me much with those im going to begin them tomorrow night perhaps you will like to see me do it cousin jerry  i certainly will replied jerry still puzzling over that pile of mud in the middle    chapter xi  peter rabbit and jerry muskrat are puzzled  jerry muskrat was more and more sure that his big cousin paddy the beaver didnt know quite so much as he might about housebuilding jerry would have liked to offer some suggestions but he didnt quite dare you see he was very anxious not to displease his big cousin but he felt that he simply had got to speak his mind to someone so he swam across to where he had seen peter rabbit almost every night since paddy began to build sure enough peter was there sitting up very straight and staring with big round eyes at the platform of mud and sticks out in the water where paddy the beaver was at work  well peter what do you think of it asked jerry  what is it asked peter innocently is it another dam  jerry threw back his head and laughed and laughed  peter looked at him suspiciously i dont see anything to laugh at said he  why its a house you stupid its paddys new house replied jerry wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes  im not stupid retorted peter how was i to know that that pile of mud and sticks is meant for a house it certainly doesnt look it where is the door  to tell you the truth i dont think it is much of a house myself replied jerry it has got a door all right in fact it has got three you cant see them because they are under water and there is a passage from each right up through that platform of mud and sticks which is the foundation of the house it really is a very fine foundation peter it really is but what i cant understand is what paddy is thinking of by building that great pile of mud right in the middle when he gets his walls built where will his bedroom be there wont be any room at all it wont be a house at alljust a big useless pile of sticks and mud  peter scratched his head and then pulled his whiskers thoughtfully as he gazed out at the pile in the water where paddy the beaver was at work  it does look foolish thats a fact said he why dont you point out to him the mistake he is making jerry you have built such a splendid house yourself that you ought to be able to help paddy and show him his mistakes  jerry had smiled a very selfsatisfied smile when peter mentioned his fine house but he shook his head at the suggestion that he should give paddy advice  ii dont just like to he confessed you know he might not like it andand it doesnt seem as if it would be quite polite  peter sniffed that wouldnt trouble me any if he were my cousin said he  jerry shook his head no i dont believe it would he replied but it does trouble me andandwell i think ill wait awhile  now all this time paddy had been hard at work he was bringing the longest branches which he had cut from the trees out of which he had built his dam and a lot of slender willow and alder poles he pushed these ahead of him as he swam when he reached the foundation of his house he would lean them against the pile of mud in the middle with their big ends resting on the foundation  so he worked all the way around until by and by the mud pile in the middle couldnt be seen it was completely covered with sticks and they were cunningly fastened together at the tops    chapter  xii  jerry muskrat learns something       if you think you know it all      you are riding for a fall      use your ears and use your eyes      but hold your tongue and youll be wise  jerry muskrat will tell you that is as true as true can be jerry knows he found it out for himself now he is very careful what he says about other people or what they are doing but he wasnt so careful when his cousin paddy the beaver was building his house no sir jerry wasnt so careful then he though he knew more about building a house than paddy did he was sure of it when he watched paddy heap up a great pile of mud right in the middle where his room ought to be and then build a wall of sticks around it he said as much to peter rabbit  now it is never safe to say anything to peter rabbit that you dont care to have others know peter has a great deal of respect for jerry muskrats opinion on housebuilding you see he very much admires jerrys snug house in the smiling pool it really is a very fine house and jerry may be excused for being proud of it but that doesnt excuse jerry for thinking that he knows all there is to know about housebuilding of course peter told everyone he met that paddy the beaver was making a foolish mistake in building his house and that jerry muskrat who ought to know said so  so whenever they got the chance the little people of the green forest and green meadows would steal up to the shore of paddys new pond and chuckle as they looked out at the great pile of sticks and mud which paddy had built for a house but in which he had forgotten to make a room at least they supposed that he had forgotten this very important thing he must have for there wasnt any room it was a great joke they laughed a lot about it and they lost a great deal of the respect for paddy which they had had since he built his wonderful dam  jerry and peter sat in the moonlight talking it over paddy had stopped bringing sticks for his wall he had dived down out of sight and he was gone a long time suddenly jerry noticed that the water had grown very very muddy all around paddys new house he wrinkled his brows trying to think what paddy could be doing presently paddy came up for air then he went down again and the water grew muddier than ever this went on for a long time every little while paddy would come up for air and a few minutes of rest then down he would go and the water would grow muddier and muddier  at last jerry could stand it no longer he just had to see what was going on he slipped into the water and swam over to where the water was muddiest just as he got there up came paddy  hello cousin jerry said he i was just going to invite you over to see what you think of my house inside just follow me  paddy dived and jerry dived after him he followed paddy in at one of the three doorways under water and up a smooth hall right into the biggest nicest bedroom jerry had ever seen in all his life he just gasped in sheer surprise he couldnt do anything else he couldnt find his tongue to say a word here he was in this splendid great room up above the water and he had been so sure that there wasnt any room at all he just didnt know what to make of it  paddys eyes twinkled well said he what do you think of it  iithink it is splendid just perfectly splendid but i dont understand it at all cousin paddy iiwhere is that great pile of mud i helped you build in the middle jerry looked as foolish as he felt when he asked this  why ive dug it all away thats what made the water so muddy replied paddy  but what did you build it for in the first place jerry asked  because i had to have something solid to rest my sticks against while i was building my walls of course replied paddy when i got the tops fastened together for a roof they didnt need a support any longer and then i dug it away to make this room i couldnt have built such a big room any other way i see you dont know very much about housebuilding cousin jerry  iim afraid i dont confessed jerry sadly    chapter xiii  the queer storehouse  everybody knew that paddy the beaver was laying up a supply of food for the winter and everybody thought it was queer food that is everybody but prickly porky the porcupine thought so prickly porky likes the same kind of food but he never lays up a supply he just goes out and gets it when he wants it winter or summer what kind of food was it why bark to be sure yes sir it was just barkthe bark of certain kinds of trees  now prickly porky can climb the trees and eat the bark right there but paddy the beaver cannot climb and if he would just eat the bark that he can reach from the ground it would take such a lot of trees to keep him filled up that he would soon spoil the green forest you know when the bark is taken off a tree all the way around the tree dies that is because all the things that a tree draws out of the ground to make it grow and keep it alive are carried up from the roots in the sap and the sap cannot go up the tree trunks and into the branches when the bark is taken off because it is up the inside of the bark that it travels so when the bark is taken from a tree all the way around the trunk the tree just starves to death  now paddy the beaver loves the green forest as dearly as you and i do and perhaps even a little more dearly you see it is his home besides paddy never is wasteful so he cuts down a tree so that he can get all the bark instead of killing a whole lot of trees for a very little bark as he might do if he were lazy there isnt a lazy bone in himnot one the bark he likes best is from the aspen when he cannot get that he will eat the bark from the poplar the alder the willow and even the birch but he likes the aspen so much better that he will work very hard to get it perhaps it tastes better because he does have to work so hard for it  there were some aspen trees growing right on the edge of the pond paddy had made in the green forest these he cut just as he had cut the trees for his dam as soon as a tree was down he would cut it into short lengths and with these swim out to where the water was deep close to his new house he took them one by one and carried the first ones to the bottom where he pushed them into the mud just enough to hold them then as fast as he brought more he piled them on the first ones and so the pile grew and grew  jerry muskrat peter rabbit bobby coon and the other little people of the green forest watched him with the greatest interest and curiosity they couldnt quite make out what he was doing it was almost as if he were building the foundation for another house  whats he doing jerry demanded peter when he could keep still no longer  i dont exactly know replied jerry he said that he was going to lay in a supply of food for the winter just as i told you and i suppose that is what he is doing but i dont quite understand what he is taking it all out into the pond for i believe ill go ask him  do and then come tell us begged peter who was growing so curious that he couldnt sit still  so jerry swam out to where paddy was so busy is this your food supply cousin paddy he asked  yes replied paddy crawling up on the side of his house to rest yes this is my food supply isnt it splendid  i guess it is replied jerry trying to be polite though i like lily roots and clams better but what are you going to do with it where is your storehouse  this pond is my storehouse replied paddy i will make a great pile right here close to my house and the water will keep it nice and fresh all winter when the pond is frozen over all i will have to do is to slip out of one of my doorways down there on the bottom swim over here and get a stick and fill my stomach isnt it handy     chapter xiv  a footprint in the mud  very early one morning paddy the beaver heard sammy jay making a terrible fuss over in the aspen trees on the edge of the pond paddy had made in the green forest paddy couldnt see because he was inside his house and it has no window but he could hear he wrinkled up his brows thoughtfully  seems to me that sammy is very much excited this morning said he a way he has because he is so much alone when he screams like that sammy is usually trying to do two things at oncemake trouble for somebody and keep somebody else out of trouble and when you come to think of it thats rather a funny way of doing it shows that he isnt all bad and at the same time he is a long way from being all good now i should say from the sounds that sammy has discovered reddy fox trying to steal up on someone over where my aspen trees are growing reddy is afraid of me but i suspect that he knows that peter rabbit has been hanging around here a lot lately watching me work and he thinks perhaps he can  watch peter i shall have to whisper in one of peters long ears and tell him to watch out  after a while he heard sammy jays voice growing fainter and fainter in the green forest finally he couldnt hear it at all whoever was here has gone away and sammy has followed just to torment them thought paddy he was very busy making a bed he is very particular about his bed is paddy the beaver he makes it of fine splinters of wood which he splits off with those wonderful great cutting teeth of his this makes the driest kind of a bed it requires a great deal of patience and work but patience is one of the first things a little beaver learns and honest work well done is one of the greatest pleasures in the world as paddy long ago found out for himself so he kept at work on his bed for some time after all was still outside  at last paddy decided that he would go over to his aspen trees and look them over to decide which ones he would cut the next night he slid down one of his long halls out the doorway at the bottom on the pond and then swam up to the surface where he floated for a few minutes with just his head out of water and all the time his eyes and nose and ears were busy looking smelling and listening for any sign of danger everything was still sure that he was quite safe paddy swam across to the place where the aspen trees grew and waddled out on the shore  paddy looked this way and looked that way he looked up in the treetops and he looked off up the hill but most of all he looked at the ground yes sir paddy just studied the ground you see he hadnt forgotten the fuss sammy jay had been making there and he was trying to find out what it was all about at first he didnt see anything unusual but by and by he happened to notice a little wet place and right in the middle of it was something that made paddys eyes open wide it was a footprint someone had carelessly stepped in the mud  ha exclaimed paddy and the hair on his back lifted ever so little and for a minute he had a prickly feeling all over the footprint was very much like that of reddy fox only it was larger  ha said paddy again that certainly is the foot print of old man coyote i see i have got to watch out more sharply than i had thought for all right mr coyote now that i know you are about youll have to be smarter than i think you are to catch me you certainly will be back here tonight looking for me so i think ill do my cutting right now in the daytime    chapter xv  sammy jay makes paddy a call  paddy the beaver was hard at work he had just cut down a good sized aspen tree and now he was gnawing it into short lengths to put in his food pile in the pond as he worked paddy was doing a lot of thinking about the footprint of old man coyote in a little patch of mud for he knew that meant that old man coyote had discovered his pond and would be hanging around hoping to catch paddy off his guard paddy knew it just as well as if old man coyote had told him so that was why he was at work cutting his food supply in the daytime usually he works at night and he knew that old man coyote knew it  hell try to catch me then thought paddy so ill do my working on land now and fool him  the tree he was cutting began to sway and crack paddy cut out one more big chip then hurried away to a safe place while the tree fell with a crash  thief thief thief screamed a voice just back of paddy  hello sammy jay i see you dont feel any better than usual this morning said paddy dont you want to sit up in this tree while i cut it down  sammy grew black in the face with anger for he knew that paddy was laughing at him you remember how only a few days before he had been so intent on calling paddy bad names that he actually hadnt noticed that paddy was cutting the very tree in which he was sitting and so when it fell he had had a terrible fright  you think you are very smart mr beaver but youll think differently one of these fine days screamed sammy if you knew what i know you wouldnt be so well satisfied with yourself  what do you know asked paddy pretending to be very much alarmed  im not going to tell you what i know retorted sammy jay youll find out soon enough and when you do find out youll never steal another tree from our green forest somebody is going to catch you and it isnt farmer browns boy either  paddy pretended to be terribly frightened oh who is it please tell me mr jay he begged  now to be called mr jay made sammy feel very important nearly everybody else called him sammy he swelled himself out trying to look as important as he felt and his eyes snapped with pleasure he was actually making paddy the beaver afraid at least he thought he was  no sir i wont tell you he replied i wouldnt be you for a great deal though somebody who is smarter than you are is going to catch you and when he gets through with you there wont be anything left but a few bones no sir nothing but a few bones  oh mr jay this is terrible news whatever am i to do cried paddy all the time keeping on at work cutting another tree  theres nothing you can do replied sammy grinning wickedly at paddys fright theres nothing you can do unless you go right straight back to the north where you came from you think you are very smart but  sammy didnt finish crack over fell the tree paddy had been cutting and the top of it fell straight into the alder in which sammy was sitting oh oh help shrieked sammy spreading his wings and flying away just in time  paddy sat down and laughed until his sides ached come make me another call someday sammy he said and when you do please bring some real news i know all about old man coyote you can tell him for me that when he is planning to catch people he should be careful not to leave footprints to give himself away  sammy didnt reply he just sneaked off through the green forest looking quite as foolish as he felt    chapter xvi  old man coyote is very crafty       coyote has a crafty brain      his wits are sharp his ends to gain  there is nothing in the world more true than that old man coyote has the craftiest brain of all the little people of the green forest or the green meadows sharp as are the wits of old granny fox they are not quite so sharp as the wits of old man coyote if you want to fool him you will have to get up very early in the morning and then it is more than likely that you will be the one fooled not he there is very little going on around him that he doesnt know about but once in a while something escapes him the coming of paddy the beaver to the green forest was one of these things he didnt know a thing about paddy until paddy had finished his dam and his house and was cutting his supply of food for the winter  you see it was this way when the merry little breezes of old mother west wind first heard what was going on in the green forest and hurried around over the green meadows and through the green forest to spread the news as is their way they took the greatest pains not to even hint it to old man coyote because they were afraid that he would make trouble and perhaps drive paddy away the place that paddy had chosen to build his dam was so deep in the green forest that old man coyote seldom went that way so it was that he knew nothing about paddy and paddy knew nothing about him for some time  but after awhile old man coyote noticed that the little people of the green meadows were not about as much as usual they seemed to have a secret of some kind he mentioned the matter to his friend digger the badger  digger had been so intent on his own affairs that he hadnt noticed anything unusual but when old man coyote mentioned the matter he remembered that blacky the crow headed straight for the green forest every morning several times he had seen sammy jay flying in the same direction as if in a great hurry to get somewhere  old man coyote grinned thats all i need to know friend digger said he when blacky the crow and sammy jay visit a place more than once something interesting is going on there i think ill take a stroll up through the green forest and have a look around  with that off old man coyote started but he was too sly and crafty to go straight to the green forest he pretended to hunt around over the green meadows just as he usually did all the time working nearer and nearer to the green forest when he reached the edge of it he slipped in among the trees and when he felt that no one was likely to see him he began to run this way and that way with his nose to the ground  ha he exclaimed presently reddy fox has been this way lately  pretty soon he found another trail so said he peter rabbit has been over here a good deal of late and his trail goes in the same direction as that of reddy fox i guess all i have to do now is to follow peters trail and it will lead me to what i want to find out  so old man coyote followed peters trail and he presently came to the pond of paddy the beaver ha said he as he looked out and saw paddys new  house so there is a newcomer to the green forest i have always heard that beaver is very good eating my stomach begins to feel empty this very minute his mouth began to water and a fierce hungry look shone in his eyes  it was just then that sammy jay saw him and began to scream at the top of his lungs so that paddy the beaver over in his house heard him old man coyote knew that it was of no use to stay longer with sammy jay about so he took a hasty look at the pond and found where paddy came ashore to cut his food then shaking his fist at sammy jay he started straight back for the green meadows ill just pay a visit here in the night said he and give mr beaver a surprise while he is at work  but with all his craft old man coyote didnt notice that he left a footprint in the mud    chapter xvii  old man coyote is disappointed  old man coyote lay stretched out in his favorite napping place on the green meadows he was thinking of what he had found out up in the green forest that morningthat paddy the beaver was living there old man coyotes thoughts seemed very pleasant to himself though really they were very dreadful thoughts you see he was thinking how easy it was going to be to catch paddy the beaver and what a splendid meal he would make he licked his chops at the thought  he doesnt know i know hes here thought old man coyote in fact i dont believe heaven knows that i am anywhere around of course he wont be watching for me he cuts  his trees at night so all i will have to do is to hide right close by where he is at work and hell walk right into my mouth sammy jay knows i was up there this morning but sammy sleeps at night so he will not give the alarm my my how good that beaver will taste he licked his chops once more then yawned and closed his eyes for a nap  old man coyote waited until jolly round red mr sun had gone to bed behind the purple hills and the black shadows had crept out across the green meadows then keeping in the blackest of them and looking very much like a shadow of himself he slipped into the green forest it was dark in there and he made straight for paddys new pond trotting along swiftly without making a sound when he was near the aspen trees which he knew paddy was planning to cut he crept forward very slowly and carefully everything was still as still could be  good thought old man coyote i am here first and now all i need do is to hide and wait for paddy to come ashore  so he stretched himself flat behind some brush close beside the little path paddy had made up from the edge of the water and waited it was very still so still that it seemed almost as if he could hear his heart beat he could see the little stars twinkling in the sky and their own reflections twinkling back at them from the water of paddys pond old man coyote waited and waited he is very patient when there is something to gain by it for such a splendid dinner as paddy the beaver would make he felt that he could well afford to be patient so he waited and waited and everything was as still as if no living thing but the trees where there even the trees seemed to be asleep  at last after a long long time he heard just the faintest splash he pricked up his ears and peeped out on the pond with the hungriest look in his yellow eyes there was a little line of silver coming straight toward him he knew that it was made by paddy the beaver swimming nearer and nearer it drew old man coyote chuckled way down deep inside without making a sound he could see paddys head now and paddy was coming straight in as if he hadnt a fear in the world  almost to the edge of the pond swam paddy then he stopped in a few minutes he began to swim again but this time it was back in the direction of his house and he seemed to be carrying something it was one of the little food logs he had cut that day and he was taking it out to his storehouse then back he came for another and so he kept on never once coming ashore old man coyote waited until paddy had carried the last log to his storehouse and then with a loud whack on the water with his broad tail had dived and disappeared in his house  then old man coyote arose and started elsewhere to look for his dinner and in his heart was bitter disappointment     chapter xviii  old man coyote tries another plan  for three nights old man coyote had stolen up through the green forest with the coming of the black shadows and had hidden among the aspen trees where paddy the beaver cut his food and for three nights paddy had failed to come ashore each night he had seemed to have enough food logs in the water to keep him busy without cutting more old man coyote lay there and the hungry look in his eyes changed to one of doubt and then to suspicion could it be that paddy the beaver was smarter than he thought it began to look very much as if paddy knew perfectly well that he was hiding there each night yes sir thats the way it looked for three nights paddy hadnt cut a single tree and yet each night he had plenty of food logs ready to take to his storehouse in the pond  that means that he comes ashore in the daytime and cuts his trees thought old man coyote as tired and with black anger in his heart he trotted home the third night he couldnt have found out about me himself he isnt smart enough it must be that someone has told him and nobody knows that i have been over there but sammy jay it must be he who has been the tattletale i think ill visit paddy by daylight tomorrow and then well see  now the trouble with some smart people is that they are never able to believe that others may be as smart as they old man coyote didnt know that the first time he had visited paddys pond he had left behind him a footprint in a little patch of soft mud if he had known it he wouldnt have believed that paddy would be smart enough to guess what that footprint meant so old man coyote laid all the blame at the door of sammy jay and that very morning when sammy came flying over the green meadows old man coyote accused him of being a tattletale and threatened the most dreadful things to sammy if ever he caught him  now sammy had flown down to the green meadows to tell old man coyote how paddy was doing all his work on land in the daytime but when old man coyote began to call him a tattletale and accuse him of having warned paddy and to threaten dreadful things he straightway forgot all his anger at paddy and turned it all on old man coyote he called him everything he could think of and this was a great deal for sammy has a wicked tongue when he hadnt any breath left he flew over to the green forest and there he hid where he could watch all that was going on  that afternoon old man coyote tried his new plan he slipped into the green forest looking this way and that way to be sure that no one saw him then very very softly he crept up through the green forest toward the pond of paddy the beaver as he drew near he heard a crash and it make him smile he knew what it meant it meant that paddy was at work cutting down trees with his stomach almost on the ground he crept forward little by little little by little taking the greatest care not to rustle so much as a leaf presently he reached a place where he could see the aspen trees and there sure enough was paddy sitting up on his hind legs and hard at work cutting another tree  old man coyote lay down for a few minutes to watch then he wriggled a little nearer slowly and carefully he drew his legs under him and made ready for a rush paddy the beaver was his at last at just that very minute a harsh scream rang out right over his head  thief thief thief  it was sammy jay who had followed him all the way paddy the beaver didnt stop to even look around he knew what that meant and he scrambled down his little path to the water as he never had scrambled before and as he dived with a great splash old man coyote landed with a great jump on the very edge of the pond    chapter xix  paddy and sammy jay become friends  paddy the beaver floated in his pond and grinned in the most provoking way at old man coyote who had so nearly caught him old man coyote fairly danced with anger on the bank he had felt so sure of paddy that time that it was hard work to believe that paddy had really gotten away from him he bared his long cruel teeth and he looked very fierce and ugly  come on in the waters fine called paddy  now of course this wasnt a nice thing for paddy to do for it only made old man coyote all the angrier you see paddy knew perfectly well that he was absolutely safe and he just couldnt resist the temptation to say some unkind things he had had to be on the watch for days lest he should be caught and so he hadnt been able to work quite so well as he could have done with nothing to fear and he still had a lot of preparations to make for winter so he told old man coyote just what he thought of him and that he wasnt as smart as he thought he was or he never would have left a foot print in the mud to give him away  when sammy jay who was listening and chuckling as he listened heard that he flew down where he would be just out of reach of old man coyote and then he just turned that tongue of his loose and you know that some people say that sammys tongue is hung in the middle and wags at both ends of course this isnt really so but when he gets to abusing people it seems as if it must be true he called old man coyote every bad name he could think of he called him a sneak a thief a coward a bully and a lot of other things  you said i had warned paddy that you were trying to catch him and that was why you failed to find him at work at night and all the time you had warned him yourself screamed sammy i used to think that you were smart but i know better now paddy is twice as smart as you are       mr coyote is every so sly       mr coyote is clever and spry       if you believe all you hear        mr coyote is naught of the kind       mr coyote is stupid and blind       he cant catch a flea on his ear  paddy the beaver laughed till the tears came at sammys foolish verse but it made old man coyote angrier than ever he was angry with paddy for escaping from him and he was angry with sammy terribly angry and the worst of it was he couldnt catch either one for one was at home in the water and the other was at home in the air and he couldnt follow in either place finally he saw it was of no use to stay there to be laughed at so muttering and grumbling he started for the green meadows  as soon as he was out of sight paddy turned to sammy jay  mr jay said he knowing how it pleased sammy to be called mister mr jay you have done me a mighty good turn today and i am not going to forget it you can call me what you please and scream at me all you please but you wont get any satisfaction out of it because i simply wont get angry i will say to myself mr jay saved my life the other day and then i wont mind your tongue  now this made sammy feel very proud and very happy you know it is very seldom that he hears anything nice said of him he flew down on the stump of one of the trees paddy had cut lets be friends said he  with all my heart replied paddy    chapter xx  sammy jay offers to help paddy  paddy sat looking thoughtfully at the aspen trees he would have to cut to complete his store of food for the winter all those near the edge of his pond had been cut the others were scattered about some little distance away i dont know said paddy out loud i dont know  what dont you know asked sammy jay who now that he and paddy had become friends was very much interested in what paddy was doing  why replied paddy i dont know just how i am going to get those trees now that old man coyote is watching for me it isnt safe for me to go very far from my pond i suppose i could dig a canal up to some of the nearest trees and then float them down to the pond but it is hard to work and keep watch for enemies at the same time i guess ill have to be content with some of these alders growing close to the water but he bark of aspens is so much better that ii wish i could get them  whats a canal asked sammy abruptly  a canal why a canal is a kind of ditch in which water can run replied paddy  sammy nodded ive seen farmer brown dig one over on the green meadows but it looked like a great deal of work i didnt suppose that anyone else could do it do you really mean that you can dig a canal paddy  of course i mean it replied paddy in a surprised tone of voice i have helped dig lots of canals you ought to see some of them back where i came from  id like to replied sammy i think it is perfectly wonderful i dont see how you do it  its easy enough when you know how replied paddy if i dared to id show you  sammy had a sudden idea it almost made him gasp i tell you what you work and ill keep watch he cried you know my eyes are very sharp  will you cried paddy eagerly that would be perfectly splendid you have the sharpest eyes of anyone whom i know and i would feel perfectly safe with you on watch but i dont want to put you to all to that trouble mr jay  of course i will replied sammy and it wont be any trouble at all ill just love to do it you see it made sammy feel very proud to have paddy say that he had such sharp eyes when will you begin  right away if you will just take a look around and see that it is perfectly safe for me to come out on land  sammy didnt wait to hear more he spread his beautiful blue wings and started off over the green forest straight for the green meadows paddy watched him go with a puzzled and disappointed air thats funny thought he i thought he really meant it and now off he goes without even saying goodby  in a little while back came sammy all out of breath its all right he panted you can go to work just as soon as you please  paddy looked more puzzled than ever how do you know he asked i havent seen you looking around  i did better than that replied sammy if old man coyote had been hiding somewhere in the green forest it might have taken me some time to find him but he isnt you see i flew straight over to his home in the green meadows to see if he is there and he is hes taking a sun bath and looking as cross as two sticks i dont think hell be back here this morning but ill keep a sharp watch while you work  paddy made sammy a low bow you certainly are smart mr jay said he i wouldnt have thought of going over to old man coyotes home to see if he was there ill feel perfectly safe with you on guard now ill get to work    chapter xxi   paddy and sammy jay work together  jerry muskrat had been home at the smiling pool for several days but he couldnt stay there long oh my no he just had to get back to see what his big cousin paddy the beaver was doing so as soon as he was sure that everything was all right at the smiling pool he hurried back up the laughing brook to paddys pond deep in the green forest as soon as he was in sight of it he looked eagerly for paddy at first he didnt see him then he stopped and gazed over at the place where paddy had been cutting aspen trees for food something was going on there something queer he couldnt make it out  jus then sammy jay came flying over  whats paddy doing jerry asked  sammy jay dropped down to the top of an alder tree and fluffed out all his feathers in a very important way oh said he paddy and i are building something  you paddy and you ha ha paddy and you building something jerry laughed  yes me snapped sammy angrily thats what i said paddy and i are building something  jerry had begun to swim across the pond by this time and sammy was flying across why dont you tell the truth sammy and say that paddy is building something and you are making him all the trouble you can called jerry  sammys eyes snapped angrily and he darted down at jerrys little brown head it isnt true he shrieked you ask paddy if im not helping  jerry ducked under water to escape sammys sharp bill when he came up again sammy was over in the little grove of aspen trees where paddy was at work then jerry discovered something what was it why a little waterpath led right up to the aspen trees and there at the end of the little waterpath was paddy the beaver hard at work he was digging and piling the earth on one side very neatly in fact he was making the waterpath longer jerry swam right up the little waterpath to where paddy was working good morning cousin paddy said he what are you doing  oh replied paddy sammy jay and i are building a canal  sammy jay looked down at jerry in triumph and jerry looked at paddy as if he thought that he was joking  sammy jay whats sammy jay got to do about it demanded jerry  a whole lot replied paddy you see he keeps watch while i work if he didnt i couldnt work and there wouldnt be any canal old man coyote has been trying to catch me and i wouldnt dare work on shore if it wasnt that i am sure that the sharpest eyes in the green forest are watching for danger  sammy jay looked very much pleased indeed and very proud  so you see it takes both of us to make this canal i dig while sammy watches so we are building it together concluded paddy with a twinkle in his eyes  i see said jerry slowly then he turned to sammy jay i beg your pardon sammy said he i do indeed  thats all right replied sammy airily what do you think of our canal  i think it is wonderful replied jerry  and indeed it was a very fine canal straight wide and deep enough for paddy to swim in and float his logs out to the pond yes indeed it was a very fine canal    chapter xxii  paddy finishes his harvest       sharp his tongue and sharp his eyes       sammy guards against surprise       if twere not for sammy jay       i could do no work today  when sammy overheard paddy the beaver say that to jerry muskrat it made him swell up all over with pure pride you see sammy is so used to hearing bad things about himself that to hear something nice like that pleased him immensely he straightway forgot all the mean things he had said to paddy when he first saw himhow he had called him a thief because he had cut the aspen trees he needed he forgot all this he forgot how paddy had made him the laughingstock of the green forest and the green meadows by cutting down the very tree in which he had been sitting he forgot everything but that paddy had trusted him to keep watch and now was saying nice things about him he made up his mind that he would deserve all the nice things that paddy could say and he thought that paddy was the finest fellow in the world  jerry muskrat looked doubtful he didnt trust sammy and he took care not to go far from the water when he heard that old man coyote had been hanging around but paddy worked away just as if he hadnt a fear in the world  the way to make people want to be trusted is to trust them said he to himself if i show sammy jay that i dont really trust him he will think it is of no use to try and will give it up but if i do trust him and he knows that i do hell be the best watchman in the green forest  and this shows that paddy the beaver has a great deal of wisdom for it was just as he thought sammy was on hand bright and early every morning he made sure that old man coyote was nowhere in the green forest and then he settled himself comfortably in the top of a tall pine tree where he could see all that was going on while paddy the beaver worked  paddy had finished his canal and a beautiful canal it was leading straight from his pond up to the aspen trees as soon as he had finished it he began to cut the trees as soon as one was down he would cut it into short lengths and roll them into the canal then he would float them out to his pond and over to his storehouse he took the larger branches on which there was sweet tender bark in the same way for paddy is never wasteful  after a while he went over to his storehouse which you know was nothing but a great pile of aspen logs and branches in his pond close by his house he studied it very carefully then he swam back and climbed up on the bank of his canal  mr jay said he i think our work is about finished  what cried sammy arent you going to cut the rest of those aspen trees  no replied paddy enough is always enough and ive got enough to last me all winter i want those trees for next year now i am fixed for the winter i think ill take it easy for a while  sammy looked disappointed you see he had just begun to learn that the greatest pleasure in the world comes from doing things for other people for the first time since he could remember someone wanted him around land it gave him such a good feeling down deep inside perhaps it was because he remembered that good feeling that the next spring he was so willing and anxious to help poor mrs quack what he did for her and all about her terrible adventures i will tell you in the next book
