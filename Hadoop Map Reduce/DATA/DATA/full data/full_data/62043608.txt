62043608	jack tier  or  the florida reef  by the author of the pilot red rover two admirals wing and wing miles wallingford etc       preface      this work has already appeared in grahams magazine under the title of rose budd the change of name is solely the act of the author and arises from a conviction that the appellation given in this publication is more appropriate than the one laid aside the necessity of writing to a name instead of getting it from the incidents of the book itself has been the cause of this departure from the ordinary rules  when this book was commenced it was generally supposed that the mexican war would end after a few months of hostilities such was never the opinion of the writer he has ever looked forward to a protracted struggle and now that congress has begun to interfere sees as little probability of its termination as on the day it commenced whence honourable gentlemen have derived their notions of the constitution when they advance the doctrine that congress is an american aulic council empowered to encumber the movements of armies and as old blucher expressed it in reference to the diplomacy of europe to spoil with the pen the work achieved by the sword it is difficult to say more than this that they do not get them from the constitution itself it has generally been supposed that the present executive was created in order to avoid the very evils of a distracted and divided council which this new construction has a direct tendency to revive but a presidential election has ever proved and probably will ever prove stronger than any written fundamental law  we have had occasion to refer often to mexico in these pages it has been our aim to do so in a kind spirit for while we have never doubted that the factions which have possessed themselves of the government in that country have done us great wrong wrong that would have justified a much earlier appeal to arms we have always regarded the class of mexicans who alone can properly be termed the people as mild amiable and disposed to be on friendly terms with us providence however directs all to the completion of its own wise ends if the crust which has so long encircled that nation enclosing it in bigotry and ignorance shall now be irretrievably broken letting in light even mexico herself may have cause hereafter to rejoice in her present disasters it was in this way that italy has been in a manner regenerated the conquests of the french carrying in their train the means and agencies which have at length aroused that glorious portion of the earth to some of its ancient spirit mexico in certain senses is the italy of this continent and war however ruthless and much to be deplored may yet confer on her the inestimable blessings of real liberty and a religion released from feux dartifice as well as all other artifices  a word on the facts of our legend the attentive observer of men and things has many occasions to note the manner in which ordinary lookers on deceive themselves as well as others the species of treason portrayed in these pages is no uncommon occurrence and it will often be found that the traitor is the loudest in his protestations of patriotism it is a pretty safe rule to suspect the man of hypocrisy who makes a parade of his religion and the partisan of corruption and selfishness who is clamorous about the rights of the people captain spike was altogether above the first vice though fairly on level as respects the second with divers patriots who live by their deity       chapter i  pros   why thats my spirit but was not this nigh shore  ariel   close by my master  pros   but are they ariel safe  ariel   not a hair perished  tempest     dye here there mr mulford called out capt stephen spike of the halfrigged brigantine swash or molly swash as was her registered name to his matewe shall be dropping out as soon as the tide makes and i intend to get through the gate at least on the next flood waiting for a wind in port is lubberly seamanship for he that wants one should go outside and look for it  this call was uttered from a wharf of the renowned city of manhattan to one who was in the trunkcabin of a clipperlooking craft of the name mentioned and on the deck of which not a soul was visible nor was the wharf though one of those wooden piers that line the arm of the sea that is called the east river such a spot as ordinarily presents itself to the mind of the reader or listener when an allusion is made to a wharf of that town which it is the fashion of the times to call the commercial emporium of americaas if there might very well be an emporium of any other character the wharf in question had not a single vessel of any sort lying at or indeed very near it with the exception of the molly swash as it actually stood on the eastern side of the town it is scarcely necessary to say that such a wharf could only be found high up and at a considerable distance from the usual haunts of commerce the brig lay more than a mile above the hook corlaers of course is meantnot sandy hook and quite near to the old alms housefar above the shipyards in fact it was a solitary place for a vessel in the midst of a crowd the grum topchain voice of captain spike had nothing there to mingle with or interrupt its harsh tones and it instantly brought on deck harry mulford the mate in question apparently eager to receive his orders  did you hail captain spike called out the mate a tight wellgrown straightbuilt handsome sailorlad of two or threeandtwentyone full of health strength and manliness  hail if you call straining a mans throat until hes hoarse hailing i believe i did i flatter myself there is not a man north of hatteras that can make himself heard further in gale of wind than a certain gentleman who is to be found within a foot of the spot where i stand yet sir ive been hailing the swash these five minutes and thankful am i to find some one at last who is on board to answer me  what are your orders capt spike  to see all clear for a start as soon as the flood makes i shall go through the gate on the next young flood and i hope youll have all the hands aboard in time i see two or three of them up at that dutch beerhouse this moment and can tellem in plain language if they come here with their beer aboard them theyll have to go ashore again  you have an uncommonly sober crew capt spike answered the young man with great calmness during the whole time i have been with them i have not seen a man among them the least in the wind  well i hope it will turn out that ive an uncommonly sober mate in the bargain drunkenness i abominate mr mulford and i can tell you short metre that i will not stand it  may i inquire if you ever saw me the least in the world under the influence of liquor capt spike demanded the mate rather than asked with a very fixed meaning in his manner  i keep no logbook of trifles mr mulford and cannot say no man is the worse for bowsing out his jib when off duty though a drunkards a thing i despise well wellremember sir that the molly swash casts off on the young flood and that rose budd and the good lady her aunt take passage in her this vyge  is it possible that you have persuaded them into that at last exclaimed the handsome mate  persuaded it takes no great persuasion sir to get the ladies to try their luck in that brig lady washington herself if she was alive and disposed to a seavyge might be glad of the chance weve a ladies cabin you know and its suitable that it should have some one to occupy it old mrs budd is a sensible woman and takes time by the forelock rose is ailinpulmonary they call it i believe and her aunt wishes to try the sea for her constitution  rose budd has no more of a pulmonary constitution than i have myself interrupted the mate  well thats as people fancy you must know mr mulford theyve got all sorts of diseases nowadays and all sorts of cures forem one sort of a cure for consumption is what they tarm the hyderally  i think you must mean hydropathy sir  well its something of the sort no matter whatbut cold water is at the bottom of it and they do say its a good remedy now roses aunt thinks if cold water is what is wanted there is no place where it can be so plenty as out on the ocean seaair is good too and by taking a vyge her niece will get both requisites together and cheap  does rose budd think herself consumptive capt spike asked mulford with interest  not sheyou know it will never do to alarm a pulmonary so mrs budd has held her tongue carefully on the subject before the young woman rose fancies that her aunt is out of sorts and that the vyge is tried on her accountbut the aunt the cunning thing knows all about it  mulford almost nauseated the expression of his commanders countenance while spike uttered the last words at no time was that countenance very inviting the features being coarse and vulgar while the color of the entire face was of an ambiguous red in which liquor and the seasons would seem to be blended in very equal quantities such a countenance lighted up by a gleam of successful management not to say with hopes and wishes that it will hardly do to dwell on could not but be revolting to a youth of harry mulfords generous feelings and most of all to one who entertained the sentiments which he was quite conscious of entertaining for rose budd the young man made no reply but turned his face toward the water in order to conceal the expression of disgust that he was sensible must be strongly depicted on it  the river as the wellknown arm of the sea in which the swash was lying is erroneously termed was just at that moment unusually clear of craft and not a sail larger than that of a boat was to be seen between the end of blackwells island and corlaers hook a distance of about a league this stagnation in the movement of the port at that particular point was owing to the state of wind and tide of the first there was little more than a southerly air while the last was about twothirds ebb nearly everything that was expected on that tide coastwise and by the way of the sound had already arrived and nothing could go eastward with that light breeze and under canvas until the flood made of course it was different with the steamers who were paddling about like so many ducks steering in all directions though mostly crossing and recrossing at the ferries just as mulford turned away from his commander however a large vessel of that class shoved her bows into the view doubling the hook and going eastward the first glance at this vessel sufficed to drive even rose budd momentarily out of the minds of both master and mate and to give a new current to their thoughts spike had been on the point of walking up the wharf but he now so far changed his purpose as actually to jump on board of the brig and spring up alongside of his mate on the taffrail in order to get a better look at the steamer mulford who loathed so much in his commander was actually glad of this spikes rare merit as a seaman forming a sort of attraction that held him as it might be against his own will bound to his service  what will they do next harry exclaimed the master his manner and voice actually humanized in air and sound at least by this unexpected view of something new in his callingwhat will they do next  i see no wheels sir nor any movement in the water astern as if she were a propeller returned the young man  shes an outoftheway sort of a hussy shes a manofwar tooone of uncle sams new efforts  that can hardly be sir uncle sam has but three steamers of any size or force now the missouri is burned and yonder is one of them lying at the navy yard while another is or was lately laid up at boston the third is in the gulf this must be an entirely new vessel if she belong to uncle sam  new shes as new as a governor and they tell me theyve got so now that they choose five or six of them up at albany every fall that craft is seagoing mr mulford as any one can tell at a glance shes none of your passengerhoys  thats plain enough sirand shes armed perhaps shes english and theyve brought her here into this open spot to try some new machinery ay ay shes about to set her ensign to the navy men at the yard and we shall see to whom she belongs  a long low expressive whistle from spike succeeded this remark the colours of the steamer going up to the end of a gaff on the sternmost of her schoonerrigged masts just as mulford ceased speaking there was just air enough aided by the steamers motion to open the bunting and let the spectators see the design there were the stars and stripes as usual but the last ran perpendicularly instead of in a horizontal direction  revenue by george exclaimed the master as soon as his breath was exhausted in the whistle who would have believed they could screw themselves up to doing such a thing in that bloody service  i now remember to have heard that uncle sam was building some large steamers for the revenue service and if i mistake not with some new invention to get along with that is neither wheel nor propeller this must be one of these new craft brought out here into open water just to try her sir  youre right sir youre right as to the natur of the beast you see her buntin and no honest man can want more if theres anything i do hate it is that flag with its unnatral stripes up and down instead of running in the true old way i have heard a lawyer say that the revenue flag of this country is onconstitutional and that a vessel carrying it on the high seas might be sent in for piracy  although harry mulford was neither puffendorf nor grotius he had too much common sense and too little prejudice in favour of even his own vocation to swallow such a theory had fifty cherry street lawyers sworn to its justice a smile crossed his fine firmlooking mouth and something very like a reflection of that smile if smiles can be reflected in ones own countenance gleamed in his fine large dark eye  it would be somewhat singular capt spike he said if a vessel belonging to any nation should be seized as a pirate the fact that she is national in character would clear her  then let her carry a national flag and be dd to her answered spike fiercely i can show you law for what i say mr mulford the american flag has its stripes fore and aft by law and this chap carries his stripes parpendiclar if i commanded a cruiser and fell in with one of these up and down gentry blast me if i wouldnt just send him into port and try the question in the old almshouse  mulford probably did not think it worth while to argue the point any further understanding the dogmatism and stolidity of his commander too well to deem it necessary he preferred to turn to the consideration of the qualities of the steamer in sight a subject on which as seamen they might better sympathize  thats a drolllooking revenue cutter after all capt spike he saida craft better fitted to go in a fleet as a lookout vessel than to chase a smuggler inshore  and no goer in the bargain i do not see how she gets along for she keeps all snug under water but unless she can travel faster than she does just now the molly swash would soon lend her the mother careys chickens of her own wake to amuse her  she has the tide against her just here sir no doubt she would do better in still water  spike muttered something between his teeth and jumped down on deck seemingly dismissing the subject of the revenue entirely from his mind his old coarse authoritative manner returned and he again spoke to his mate about rose budd her aunt the ladies cabin the young flood and casting off as soon as the last made mulford listened respectfully though with a manifest distaste for the instructions he was receiving he knew his man and a feeling of dark distrust came over him as he listened to his orders concerning the famous accommodations he intended to give to rose budd and that capital old lady her aunt his opinion of the immense deal of good seaair and a vyge would do rose and how comfortable they both would be on board the molly swash  i honour and respect mrs budd as my captains lady you see mr mulford and intend to treat her accordinly she knows itand rose knows itand they both declare theyd rather sail with me since sail they must than with any other shipmaster out of america  you sailed once with capt budd yourself i think i have heard you say sir  the old fellow brought me up i was with him from my tenth to my twentieth year and then broke adrift to see fashions we all do that you know mr mulford when we are young and ambitious and my turn came as well as anothers  capt budd must have been a good deal older than his wife sir if you sailed with him when a boy mulford observed a little drily  yes i own to fortyeight though no one would think me more than five or sixandthirty to look at me there was a great difference between old dick budd and his wife as you say he being about fifty when he married and she less than twenty fifty is a good age for matrimony in a man mulford as is twenty in a young woman  rose budd is not yet nineteen i have heard her say returned the mate with emphasis  youngish i will own but thats a fault a liberalminded man can overlook every day too will lessen it well look to the cabins and see all clear for a start josh will be down presently with a cartload of stores and youll take em aboard without delay  as spike uttered this order his foot was on the planksheer of the bulwarks in the act of passing to the wharf again on reaching the shore he turned and looked intently at the revenue steamer and his lips moved as if he were secretly uttering maledictions on her we say maledictions as the expression of his fierce illfavoured countenance too plainly showed that they could not be blessings as for mulford there was still something on his mind and he followed to the gangway ladder and ascended it waiting for a moment when the mind of his commander might be less occupied to speak the opportunity soon occurred spike having satisfied himself with the second look at the steamer  i hope you dont mean to sail again without a second mate capt spike he said  i do though i can tell you i hate dickiesthey are always in the way and the captain has to keep just as much of a watch with one as without one  that will depend on his quality you and i have both been dickies in our time sir and my time was not long ago  ayayi know all about itbut you didnt stick to it long enough to get spoiled i would have no man aboard the swash who made more than two vyges as second officer as i want no spies aboard my craft ill try it once more without a dicky  saying this in a sufficiently positive manner capt stephen spike rolled up the wharf much as a ship goes off before the wind now inclining to the right and then again to the left the gait of the man would have proclaimed him a seadog to any one acquainted with that animal as far as he could be seen the short squab figure the arms bent nearly at right angles at the elbow and working like two fins with each roll of the body the stumpy solid legs with the feet looking in the line of his course and kept wide apart would all have contributed to the making up of such an opinion accustomed as he was to this beautiful sight harry mulford kept his eyes riveted on the retiring person of his commander until it disappeared behind a pile of lumber waddling always in the direction of the more thickly peopled parts of the town then he turned and gazed at the steamer which by this time had fairly passed the brig and seemed to be actually bound through the gate that steamer was certainly a noblelooking craft but our young man fancied she struggled along through the water heavily she might be quick at need but she did not promise as much by her present rate of moving still she was a noblelooking craft and as mulford descended to the deck again he almost regretted he did not belong to her or at least to anything but the molly swash  two hours produced a sensible change in and around that brigantine her people had all come back to duty and what was very remarkable among seafaring folk sober to a man but as has been said spike was a temperance man as respects all under his orders at least if not strictly so in practice himself the crew of the swash was large for a halfrigged brig of only two hundred tons but as her spars were very square and all her gear as well as her mould seemed constructed for speed it was probable more hands than common were necessary to work her with facility and expedition after all there were not many persons to be enumerated among the people of the molly swash as they called themselves not more than a dozen including those aft as well as those forward a peculiar feature of this crew however was the circumstance that they were all middleaged men with the exception of the mate and all thoroughbred seadogs even josh the cabinboy as he was called was an old wrinkled grayheaded negro of near sixty if the crew wanted a little in the elasticity of youth it possessed the steadiness and experience of their time of life every man appearing to know exactly what to do and when to do it this indeed composed their great merit an advantage that spike well knew how to appreciate  the stores had been brought alongside of the brig in a cart and were already showed in their places josh had brushed and swept until the ladies cabin could be made no neater this ladies cabin was a small apartment beneath a trunk which was ingeniously enough separated from the main cabin by pantries and double doors the arrangement was unusual and spike had several times hinted that there was a history connected with that cabin though what the history was mulford never could induce him to relate the latter knew that the brig had been used for a forced trade on the spanish main and had heard something of her deeds in bringing off specie and proscribed persons at different epochs in the revolutions of that part of the world and he had always understood that her present commander and owner had sailed in her as mate for many years before he had risen to his present station now all was regular in the way of records bills of sale and other documents stephen spike appearing in both the capacities just named the register proved that the brig had been built as far back as the last english war as a private cruiser but recent and extensive repairs had made her better than new as her owner insisted and there was no question as to her seaworthiness it is true the insurance offices blew upon her and would have nothing to do with a craft that had seen her two score years and ten but this gave none who belonged to her any concern inasmuch as they could scarcely have been underwritten in their trade let the age of the vessel be what it might it was enough for them that the brig was safe and exceedingly fast insurances never saving the lives of the people whatever else might be their advantages with mulford it was an additional recommendation that the swash was usually thought to be of uncommonly just proportions  by halfpast two p m everything was ready for getting the brigantine under way her foretopsailor foretawsail as spike called itwas loose the fasts were singled and a spring had been carried to a post in the wharf that was well forward of the starboard bow and the brigs head turned to the southwest or down the stream and consequently facing the young flood nothing seemed to connect the vessel with the land but a broad gangway plank to which mulford had attached lifelines with more care than it is usual to meet with on board of vessels employed in short voyages the men stood about the decks with their arms thrust into the bosoms of their shirts and the whole picture was one of silent and possibly of somewhat uneasy expectation nothing was said however mulford walking the quarterdeck alone occasionally looking up the still little tenanted streets of that quarter of the suburbs as if to search for a carriage as for the revenuesteamer she had long before gone through the southern passage of blackwells steering for the gate  dats dem mr mulford josh at length cried from the lookout he had taken in a sternport where he could see over the low bulwarks of the vessel yes dats dem sir i know dat old gray horse dat carries his head so low and sorrowful like as a horse has a right to do dat has to drag a cab about this big town my eye what a horse it is sir  josh was right not only as to the gray horse that carried his head sorrowful like but as to the cab and its contents the vehicle was soon on the wharf and in its door soon appeared the short sturdy figure of capt spike backing out much as a bear descends a tree on top of the vehicle were several light articles of female appliances in the shape of bandboxes bags c the trunks having previously arrived in a cart well might that overdriven gray horse appear sorrowful and travel with a lowered head the cab when it gave up its contents discovered a load of no less than four persons besides the driver all of weight and of dimensions in proportion with the exception of the pretty and youthful rose budd even she was plump and of a wellrounded person though still light and slender but her aunt was a fair picture of a shipmasters widow solid comfortable and buxom neither was she old nor ugly on the contrary her years did not exceed forty and being well preserved in consequence of never having been a mother she might even have passed for thirtyfive the great objection to her appearance was the somewhat indefinite character of her shape which seemed to blend too many of its charms into one the fourth person in the fare was biddy noon the irish servant and factotum of mrs budd who was a pockmarked redfaced and redarmed single woman about her mistresss own age and weight though less stout to the eye  of rose we shall not stop to say much here her deepblue eye which was equally spirited and gentle if one can use such contradictory terms seemed alive with interest and curiosity running over the brig the wharf the arm of the sea the two islands and all near her including the almshouse with such a devouring rapidity as might be expected in a townbred girl who was setting out on her travels for the first time let us be understood we say townbred because such was the fact for rose budd had been both born and educated in manhattan though we are far from wishing to be understood that she was either very wellborn or highly educated her station in life may be inferred from that of her aunt and her education from her station of the two the last was perhaps a trifle the highest  we have said that the fine blue eye of rose passed swiftly over the various objects near her as she alighted from the cab and it naturally took in the form of harry mulford as he stood in the gangway offering his arm to aid her aunt and herself in passing the brigs side a smile of recognition was exchanged between the young people as their eyes met and the colour which formed so bright a charm in roses sweet face deepened in a way to prove that that colour spoke with a tongue and eloquence of its own nor was mulfords cheek mute on the occasion though he helped the hesitating halfdoubting halfbold girl along the plank with a steady hand and rigid muscles as for the aunt as a captains widow she had not felt it necessary to betray any extraordinary emotions in ascending the plank unless indeed it might be those of delight on finding her foot once more on the deck of a vessel  something of the same feeling governed biddy too for as mulford civilly extended his hand to her also she exclaimedno fear of me mr matei came from ireland by wather and knows all about ships and brigs i do if you could have seen the times we had and the saas we crossed youd not think it nadeful to say much to the likes iv me  spike had tact enough to understand he would be out of his element in assisting females along that plank and he was busy in sending what he called the old ladys dunnage on board and in discharging the cabman as soon as this was done he sprang into the mainchannels and thence vid the bulwarks on deck ordering the plank to be hauled aboard a solitary labourer was paid a quarter to throw off the fasts from the ringbolts and posts and everything was instantly in motion to cast the brig loose work went on as if the vessel were in haste and it consequently went on with activity spike bestirred himself giving his orders in a way to denote he had been long accustomed to exercise authority on the deck of a vessel and knew his calling to its minuti the only ostensible difference between his deportment today and on any ordinary occasion perhaps was in the circumstance that he now seemed anxious to get clear of the wharf and that in a way which might have attracted notice in any suspicious and attentive observer it is possible that such a one was not very distant and that spike was aware of his presence for a respectablelooking welldressed middleaged man had come down one of the adjacent streets to a spot within a hundred yards of the wharf and stood silently watching the movements of the brig as he leaned against a fence the want of houses in that quarter enabled any person to see this stranger from the deck of the swash but no one on board her seemed to regard him at all unless it might be the master  come bear a hand my hearty and toss that bowfast clear cried the captain whose impatience to be off seemed to increase as the time to do so approached nearer and nearer off with it at once and let her go  the man on the wharf threw the turns of the hawser clear of the post and the swash was released forward a smaller line for a spring had been run some distance along the wharves ahead of the vessel and brought in aft her people clapped on this and gave way to their craft which being comparatively light was easily moved and was very manageable as this was done the distant spectator who had been leaning on the fence moved toward the wharf with a step a little quicker than common almost at the same instant a short stout sailorlike looking little person waddled down the nearest street seeming to be in somewhat of a hurry and presently he joined the other stranger and appeared to enter into conversation with him pointing toward the swash as he did so all this time both continued to advance toward the wharf  in the meanwhile spike and his people were not idle the tide did not run very strong near the wharves and in the sort of a bight in which the vessel had lain but such as it was it soon took the brig on her inner bow and began to cast her head off shore the people at the spring pulled away with all their force and got sufficient motion on their vessel to overcome the tide and to give the rudder an influence the latter was put hard astarboard and helped to cast the brigs head to the southward  down to this moment the only sail that was loose on board the swash was the foretopsail as mentioned this still hung in the gear but a hand had been sent aloft to overhaul the buntlines and clewlines and men were also at the sheets in a minute the sail was ready for hoisting the swash carried a wapper of a foreandaft mainsail and what is more it was fitted with a standing gaff for appearance in port at sea spike knew better than to trust to this arrangement but in fine weather and close in with the land he found it convenient to have this sail haul out and brail like a ships spanker as the gaff was now aloft it was only necessary to let go the brails to loosen this broad sheet of canvas and to clap on the outhauler to set it this was probably the reason why the brig was so unceremoniously cast into the stream without showing more of her cloth the jib and flyingjibs however did at that moment drop beneath their booms ready for hoisting  such was the state of things as the two strangers came first upon the wharf spike was on the taffrail overhauling the mainsheet and mulford was near him casting the foretopsail braces from the pins preparatory to clapping on the halyards  i say mr mulford asked the captain did you ever see either of them chaps afore these jokers on the wharf i mean  not to my recollection sir answered the mate looking over the taffrail to examine the parties the little one is a burster the funniestlooking little fat old fellow ive seen in many a day  ay ay them fat little bursters as you call em are sometimes full of the devil i do nt like either of the chaps and am right glad we are well cast before they got here  i do not think either would be likely to do us much harm capt spike  theres no knowing sir the biggest fellow looks as if he might lug out a silver oar at any moment  i believe the silver oar is no longer used in this country at least answered mulford smiling and if it were what have we to fear from it i fancy the brig has paid her reckoning  she do nt owe a cent nor ever shall for twentyfour hours after the bill is made out while i own her they call me readymoney stephen round among the shipchandlers and caulkers but i do nt like them chaps and what i do nt relish i never swallow you know  they ll hardly try to get aboard us sir you see we are quite clear of the wharf and the mainsail will take now if we set it  spike ordered the mate to clap on the outhauler and spread that broad sheet of canvas at once to the little breeze there was this was almost immediately done when the sail filled and began to be felt on the movement of the vessel still that movement was very slow the wind being so light and the vis inertioe of so large a body remaining to be overcome the brig receded from the wharf almost in a line at right angles to its face inch by inch as it might be dropping slowly up with the tide at the same time mulford now passed forward to set the jibs and to get the topsail on the craft leaving spike on the taffrail keenly eyeing the strangers who by this time had got down nearly to the end of the wharf at the berth so lately occupied by the swash that the captain was uneasy was evident enough that feeling being exhibited in his countenance blended with a malignant ferocity  has that brig any pilot asked the larger and betterlooking of the two strangers  whats that to you friend demanded spike in return have you a hellgate branch  i may have one or i may not it is not usual for so large a craft to run the gate without a pilot  oh my gentlemans below brushing up his logarithms we shall have him on deck to take his departure before long when ill let him know your kind inquiries after his health  the man on the wharf seemed to be familiar with this sort of seawit and he made no answer but continued that close scrutiny of the brig by turning his eyes in all directions now looking below and now aloft which had in truth occasioned spikes principal cause for uneasiness  is not that capt stephen spike of the brigantine molly swash called out the little dumplinglooking person in a cracked dwarfish sort of a voice that was admirably adapted to his appearance our captain fairly started turned full toward the speaker regarded him intently for a moment and gulped the words he was about to utter like one confounded as he gazed however at little dumpy examining his bowlegs red broad cheeks and coarse snub nose he seemed to regain his selfcommand as if satisfied the dead had not really returned to life  are you acquainted with the gentleman you have named he asked by way of answer you speak of him like one who ought to know him  a body is apt to know a shipmate stephen spike and i sailed together twenty years since and i hope to live to sail with him again  you sail with stephen spike when and where may i ask and in what vyge pray  the last time was twenty years since have you forgotten little jack tier capt spike  spike looked astonished and well he might for he had supposed jack to be dead fully fifteen years time and hard service had greatly altered him but the general resemblance in figure stature and waddle certainly remained notwithstanding the jack tier that spike remembered was quite a different person from this jack tier that jack had worn his intensely black hair clubbed and curled whereas this jack had cut his locks into short bristles which time had turned into an intense gray that jack was short and thick but he was flat and square whereas this jack was just as short a good deal thicker and as round as a dumpling in one thing however the likeness still remained perfect both jacks chewed tobacco to a degree that became a distinct feature in their appearance  spike had many reasons for wishing jack tier were not resuscitated in this extraordinary manner and some for being glad to see him the fellow had once been largely in his confidence and knew more than was quite safe for any one to remember but himself while he might be of great use to him in his future operations it is always convenient to have one at your elbow who thoroughly understands you and spike would have lowered a boat and sent it to the wharf to bring jack off were it not for the gentleman who was so inquisitive about pilots under the circumstances he determined to forego the advantages of jacks presence reserving the right to hunt him up on his return  the reader will readily enough comprehend that the molly swash was not absolutely standing still while the dialogue related was going on and the thoughts we have recorded were passing through her masters mind on the contrary she was not only in motion but that motion was gradually increasing and by the time all was said that has been related it had become necessary for those who spoke to raise their voices to an inconvenient pitch in order to be heard this circumstance alone would soon have put an end to the conversation had not spikes pausing to reflect brought about the same result as mentioned  in the mean time mulford had got the canvas spread forward the swash showed all the cloth of a fullrigged brig even to royals and flying jib while aft her mast was the raking tall naked pole of an american schooner there was a taunt topmast too to which a gafftopsail was set and the gear proved that she could also show at need a staysail in this part of her if necessary as the gate was before them however the people had set none but the plain manageable canvas  the molly swash kept close on a wind luffing athwar the broad reach she was in until far enough to weather blackwells when she edged off to her course and went through the southern passage although the wind remained light and a little baffling the brig was so easily impelled and was so very handy that there was no difficulty in keeping her perfectly in command the tide too was fast increasing in strength and volocity and the movement from this cause alone was getting to be sufficiently rapid  as for the passengers of whom we have lost sight in order to get the brig under way they were now on deck again at first they had all gone below under the care of josh a somewhat rough groom of the chambers to take possession of their apartment a sufficiently neat and exceedingly comfortable cabin supplied with everything that could be wanted at sea and what was more lined on two of its sides with staterooms it is true all these apartments were small and the staterooms were very low but no fault could be found with their neatness and general arrangements when it was recollected that one was on board a vessel  here ebbery ting heart can wish said josh exultingly who being an oldschool black did not disdain to use some of the oldschool dialect of his caste yes ladies ebbery ting let capn spike alone for dat he wonerful at accommodation not a bedbug aftknow better dan come here jest like de people in dat respects and keep deir place forrard you nebber see a pig come on de quarterdeck nudder  you must maintain excellent discipline josh cried rose in one of the sweetest voices in the world which was easily attuned to merrimentand we are delighted to learn what you tell us how do you manage to keep up these distinctions and make such creatures know their places so well  nuttin easier if you begin right miss as for de pig i teach dem wid scaldin water wheneber i sees a pig come aft i gets a little water from de copper and just scald him wid it you cant tink miss how dat mend his manners and make him squeel fuss and tink arter in dat fashion i soon get de ole ones in good trainin and den i has no more trouble with dem as comes fresh aboard for de ole hog tell de young one and em wonerful cunnin and know how to take care of emself  rose budds sweet eyes were full of fun and expectation and she could no more repress her laugh than youth and spirits can always be discreet  yes with the pigs she cried that might do very well but how is it with thoseother creatures  rosy dear interrupted the aunt i wish you would say no more about such shocking things its enough for us that capt spike has ordered them all to stay forward among the men which is always done on board well disciplined vessels ive heard your uncle say a hundred times that the quarterdeck was sacred and that might be enough to keep such animals off it  it was barely necessary to look at mrs budd in the face to get a very accurate general notion of her character she was one of those inane uncultivated beings who seem to be protected by a benevolent providence in their pilgrimage on earth for they do not seem to possess the power to protect themselves her very countenance expressed imbecility and mental dependence credulity and a love of gossip notwithstanding these radical weaknesses the good woman had some of the better instincts of her sex and was never guilty of anything that could properly convey reproach  she was no monitress for rose however the niece much oftener influencing the aunt than the aunt influencing the niece the latter had been fortunate in having had an excellent instructress who though incapable of teaching her much in the way of accomplishments had imparted a great deal that was respectable and useful rose had character and strong character too as the course of our narrative will show but her worthy aunt was a pure picture of as much mental imbecility as at all comported with the privileges of selfgovernment  the conversation about those other creatures was effectually checked by mrs budds horror of the animals and josh was called on deck so shortly after as to prevent its being renewed the females staid below a few minutes to take possession and then they reappeared on deck to gaze at the horrors of the hell gate passage rose was all eyes wonder and admiration of everything she saw this was actually the first time she had ever been on the water in any sort of craft though born and brought up in sight of one of the most thronged havens in the world but there must be a beginning to everything and this was rose budds beginning on the water it is true the brigantine was a very beautiful as well as an exceedingly swift vessel but all this was lost on rose who would have admired a horsejockey bound to the west indies in this the incipient state of her nautical knowledge perhaps the exquisite neatness that mulford maintained about everything that came under his care and that included everything on deck or aboveboard and about which neatness spike occasionally muttered an oath as so much senseless trouble contributed somewhat to roses pleasure but her admiration would scarcely have been less with anything that had sails and seemed to move through the water with a power approaching that of volition  it was very different with mrs budd she good woman had actually made one voyage with her late husband and she fancied that she knew all about a vessel it was her delight to talk on nautical subjects and never did she really feel her great superiority over her niece so very unequivocally as when the subject of the ocean was introduced about which she did know something and touching which rose was profoundly ignorant or as ignorant as a girl of lively imagination could remain with the information gleaned from others  i am not surprised you are astonished at the sight of the vessel rosy observed the selfcomplacent aunt at one of her nieces exclamations of admiration a vessel is a very wonderful thing and we are told what extrorny beings they are that go down to the sea in ships but you are to know this is not a ship at all but only a halfjigger rigged which is altogether a different thing  was my uncles vessel the rose in bloom then very different from the swash  very different indeed child why the rose in bloom was a fulljiggered ship and had twelve mastsand this is only a halfjiggered brig and has but two masts see you may count themonetwo  harry mulford was coiling away a topgallantbrace directly in front of mrs budd and rose and at hearing this account of the wonderful equipment of the rose in bloom he suddenly looked up with a lurking expression about his eye that the niece very well comprehended while he exclaimed without much reflection under the impulse of surprisetwelve masts did i understand you to say maam that capt budds ship had twelve masts  yes sir twelve and i can tell you all their names for i learnt them by heartit appearing to me proper that a shipmasters wife should know the names of all the masts in her husbands vessel do you wish to hear their names mr mulford  harry mulford would have enjoyed this conversation to the top of his bent had it not been for rose she well knew her aunts general weakness of intellect and especially its weakness on this particular subject but she would suffer no one to manifest contempt for either if in her power to prevent it it is seldom one so young so mirthful so ingenuous and innocent in the expression of her countenance assumed so significant and rebuking a frown as did pretty rose budd when she heard the mates involuntary exclamation about the twelve masts harry who was not easily checked by his equals or any of his own sex submitted to that rebuking frown with the meekness of a child and stammered out in answer to the wellmeaning but weakminded widows questionif you please mrs buddjust as you please maamonly twelve is a good many masts rose frowned againthat ismore than im used to seeingthats all  i dare say mr mulfordfor you sail in only a halfjigger but capt budd always sailed in a fulljiggerand his fulljiggered ship had just twelve masts and to prove it to you ill give you the namesfirst then there were the fore main and mizen masts  yesyesmaam stammered harry who wished the twelve masts and the rose in bloom at the bottom of the ocean since her owners niece still continued to look coldly displeasedthats right i can swear  very true sir and youll find i am right as to all the rest then there were the fore main and mizen topmaststhey make six if i can count mr mulford  ah exclaimed the mate laughing in spite of roses frowns as the manner in which the old seadog had quizzed his wife became apparent to him i see how it isyou are quite right maami dare say the rose in bloom had all these masts and some to spare  yes siri knew you would be satisfied the fore main and mizen topgallantmasts make nineand the fore main and mizen royals make just twelve oh im never wrong in anything about a vessel especially if she is a fulljiggered ship  mulford had some difficulty in restraining his smiles each time the fulljigger was mentioned but roses expression of countenance kept him in excellent orderand she innocent creature saw nothing ridiculous in the term though the twelve masts had given her a little alarm delighted that the old lady had got through her enumeration of the spars with so much success rose cried in the exuberance of her spiritswell aunty for my part i find a halfjigger vessel so very very beautiful that i do not know how i should behave were i to go on board a fulljigger  mulford turned abruptly away the circumstance of roses making herself ridiculous giving him sudden pain though he could have laughed at her aunt by the hour  ah my dear that is on account of your youth and inexperiencebut you will learn better in time i was just so myself when i was of your age and thought the forerafters were as handsome as the squaredjiggers but soon after i married capt budd i felt the necessity of knowing more than i did about ships and i got him to teach me he did nt like the business at first and pretended i would never learn but at last it came all at once like and then he used to be delighted to hear me talk ship as he called it ive known him laugh with his cronies as if ready to die at my expertness in seaterms for half an hour togetherand then he would swearthat was the worst fault your uncle had rosyhe would swear sometimes in a way that frightened me i do declare  but he never swore at you aunty  i cant say that he did exactly do that but he would swear all round me even if he did nt actually touch me when things went wrongbut it would have done your heart good to hear him laugh he had a most excellent heart just like your own rosy dear but for that matter all the budds have excellent hearts and one of the commonest ways your uncle had of showing it was to laugh particularly when we were together and talking oh he used to delight in hearing me converse especially about vessels and never failed to get me at it when he had company i see his goodnatured excellenthearted countenance at this moment with the tears running down his fat manly cheeks as he shook his very sides with laughter i may live a hundred years rosy before i meet again with your uncles equal  this was a subject that invariably silenced rose she remembered her uncle herself and remembered his affectionate manner of laughing at her aunt and she always wished the latter to get through her eulogiums on her married happiness as soon as possible whenever the subject was introduced  all this time the molly swash kept in motion spike never took a pilot when he could avoid it and his mind was too much occupied with his duty in that critical navigation to share at all in the conversation of his passengers though he did endeavour to make himself agreeable to rose by an occasional remark when a favourable opportunity offered  as soon as he had worked his brig over into the south or weather passage of blackwells however there remained little for him to do until she had drifted through it a distance of a mile or more and this gave him leisure to do the honours he pointed out the castellated edifice on blackwells as the new penitentiary and the hamlet of villas on the other shore as ravenswood though there is neither wood nor ravens to authorize the name but the sunswick which satisfied the delafields and gibbses of the olden time and which distinguished their lofty halls and broad lawns was not elegant enough for the cockney tastes of these latter days so wood must be made to usurp the place of cherries and apples and ravens that of gulls in order to satisfy its cravings but all this was lost on spike he remembered the shore as it had been twenty years before and he saw what it was now but little did he care for the change on the whole he rather preferred the grecian temples over which the ravens would have been compelled to fly had there been any ravens in that neighbourhood to the oldfashioned and highly respectable residence that once alone occupied the spot the point he did understand however and on the merits of which he had something to say was a little farther ahead that too had been rechristenedthe hallets cove of the mariner being converted into astorianot that bloodyminded place at the mouth of the oregon which has come so near bringing us to blows with our ancestors in england as the worthy denizens of that quarter choose to consider themselves still if one can judge by their language this astoria was a very different place and is one of the many suburban villages that are shooting up like mushrooms in a night around the great commercial emporium this spot spike understood perfectly and it was not likely that he should pass it without communicating a portion of his knowledge to rose  there miss rose he said with a didactic sort of air pointing with his short thick finger at the little bay which was just opening to their view theres as neat a cove as a craft need bring up in that used to be a capital place to lie in to wait for a wind to pass the gate but it has got to be most too public for my taste im rural i tell mulford and love to get in outoftheway berths with my brig where she can see saltmeadows and smell the clover you never catch me down in any of the crowded slips around the markets or anywhere in that part of the town for i do love country air thats hallets cove miss rose and a pretty anchorage it would be for us if the wind and tide didnt sarve to take us through the gate  are we near the gate capt spike asked rose the fine bloom on her cheek lessening a little under the apprehension that formidable name is apt to awaken in the breasts of the inexperienced  half a mile or so it begins just at the other end of this island on our larboard hand and will be all over in about another half mile or so its no such bad place ater all is hellgate to them thats used to it i call myself a pilot in hellgate though i have no branch  i wish capt spike i could teach you to give that place its proper and polite name we call it whirlgate altogether now said the relict  well thats new to me cried spike i have heard some chickenmouthed folk say hurlgate but this is the first time i ever heard it called whirlgatetheyll get it to whirligiggate next i do nt think that my old commander capt budd called the passage anything but honest up and down hellgate  that he didthat he didand all my arguments and reading could not teach him any better i proved to him that it was whirlgate as any one can see that it ought to be it is full of whirlpools they say and that shows what nature meant the name to be  but aunty put in rose half reluctantly half anxious to speak what has gate to do with whirlpools you will remember it is called a gatethe gate to that wicked place i suppose is meant  rose you amaze me how can you a young woman of only nineteen stand up for so vulgar a name as hellgate  do you think it as vulgar as hurlgate aunty to me it always seems the most vulgar to be straining at gnats  yes said spike sentimentally im quite of miss roses way of thinkingstraining at gnats is very illmanners especially at table i once knew a man who strained in this way until i thought he would have choked though it was with a fly to be sure but gnats are nothing but small flies you know miss rose yes im quite of your way of thinking miss rose it is very vulgar to be straining at gnats and flies more particularly at table but youll find no flies or gnats aboard here to be straining at or brushing away or to annoy you stand by there my hearties and see all clear to run through hellgate do nt let me catch you straining at anything though it should be the fin of a whale  the people forward looked at each other as they listened to this novel admonition though they called out the customary ay ay sir as they went to the sheets braces and bowlines to them the passage of no hellgate conveyed the idea of any particular terror and with the one they were about to enter they were much too familiar to care anything about it  the brig was now floating fast with the tide up abreast of the east end of blackwells and in two or three more minutes she would be fairly in the gate spike was aft where he could command a view of everything forward and mulford stood on the quarterdeck to look after the headbraces an old and trustworthy seaman who acted as a sort of boatswain had the charge on the forecastle and was to tend the sheets and tack his name was rove  see all clear called out spike dye hear there forard i shall make a halfboard in the gate if the wind favour us and the tide prove strong enough to hawse us to windard sufficiently to clear the potso mind your  the captain breaking off in the middle of this harangue mulford turned his head in order to see what might be the matter there was spike levelling a spyglass at a boat that was pulling swiftly out of the north channel and shooting like an arrow directly athwart the brigs bows into the main passage of the gate he stepped to the captains elbow  just take a look at them chaps mr mulford said spike handing his mate the glass  they seem in a hurry answered harry as he adjusted the glass to his eye and will go through the gate in less time than it will take to mention the circumstance  what do you make of them sir  the little man who called himself jack tier is in the sternsheets of the boat for one answered mulford  and the other harrywhat do you make of the other  it seems to be the chap who hailed to know if we had a pilot he means to board us at rikers island and make us pay pilotage whether we want his services or not  blast him and his pilotage too give me the glasstaking another long look at the boat which by this time was glancing rather than pulling nearly at right angles across his bows i want no such pilot aboard here mr mulford take another look at himhere you can see him away on our weather bow already  mulford did take another look at him and this time his examination was longer and more scrutinizing than before  it is not easy to cover him with the glass observed the young manthe boat seems fairly to fly  were forereaching too near the hogs back capt spike roared the boatswain from forward  ready abouthard a lee shouted spike let all fly forardhelp her round boys all you can and wait for no orders bestir yourselvesbestir yourselves  it was time the crew should be in earnest while spikes attention had been thus diverted by the boat the brig had got into the strongest of the current which by setting her fast to windward had trebled the power of the air and this was shooting her over toward one of the greatest dangers of the passage on a flood tide as everybody bestirred themselves however she was got round and filled on the opposite tack just in time to clear the rocks spike breathed again but his head was still full of the boat the danger he had just escaped as scylla met him as charybdis the boatswain again roared to go about the order was given as the vessel began to pitch in a heavy swell at the next instant she rolled until the water came on deck whirled with her stern down the tide and her bows rose as if she were about to leap out of water the swash had hit the pot rock  chapter ii  watch if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him  dogb truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company  much ado about nothing     we left the brigantine of capt spike in a very critical situation and the master himself in great confusion of mind  a thorough seaman this accident would never have happened but for the sudden appearance of the boat and its passengers one of whom appeared to be a source of great uneasiness to him as might be expected the circumstance of striking a place as dangerous as the pot rock in hellgate produced a great sensation on board the vessel this sensation betrayed itself in various ways and according to the characters habits and native firmness of the parties as for the shipmasters relict she seized hold of the mainmast and screamed so loud and perseveringly as to cause the sensation to extend itself into the adjacent and thriving village of astoria where it was distinctly heard by divers of those who dwelt near the water biddy noon had her share in this clamour lying down on the deck in order to prevent rolling over and possibly to scream more at her leisure while rose had sufficient selfcommand to be silent though her cheeks lost their colour  nor was there anything extraordinary in females betraying this alarm when one remembers the somewhat astounding signs of danger by which these persons were surrounded there is always something imposing in the swift movement of a considerable body of water when this movement is aided by whirlpools and the other similar accessories of an interrupted current it frequently becomes startling more especially to those who happen to be on the element itself this is peculiarly the case with the pot rock where not only does the water roll and roar as if agitated by a mighty wind but where it even breaks the foam seeming to glance up stream in the rapid succession of wave to wave had the swash remained in her terrific berth more than a second or two she would have proved what is termed a total loss but she did not happily the pot rock lies so low that it is not apt to fetch up anything of a light draught of water and the brigantines forefoot had just settled on its summit long enough to cause the vessel to whirl round and make her obeisance to the place when a succeeding swell lifted her clear and away she went down stream rolling as if scudding in a gale and for a moment under no command whatever there lay another danger ahead or it would be better to say astern for the brig was drifting stern foremost and that was in an eddy under a bluff which bluff lies at an angle in the reach where it is no uncommon thing for craft to be cast ashore after they have passed all the more imposing and more visible dangers above it was in escaping this danger and in recovering the command of his vessel that spike now manifested the sort of stuff of which he was really made in emergencies of this sort the yards were all sharp up when the accident occurred and springing to the lee braces just as a man winks when his eye is menaced he seized the weather forebrace with his own hands and began to round in the yard shouting out to the man at the wheel to port his helm at the same time some of the people flew to his assistance and the yards were not only squared but braced a little up on the other tack in much less time than we have taken to relate the evolution mulford attended to the mainsheet and succeeded in getting the boom out in the right direction although the wind was in truth very light the velocity of the drift filled the canvas and taking the arrowlike current on her lee bow the swash like a frantic steed that is alarmed with the wreck made by his own madness came under command and sheered out into the stream again where she could drift clear of the apprehended danger astern  sound the pumps called out spike to mulford the instant he saw he had regained his seat in the saddle harry sprang amidships to obey and the eye of every mariner in that vessel was on the young man as in the midst of a deathlike silence he performed this allimportant duty it was like the physicians feeling the pulse of his patient before he pronounces on the degree of his danger  well sir cried out spike impatiently as the rod reappeared  all right sir answered harry cheerfullythe well is nearly empty  hold on a moment longer and give the water time to find its way amidships if there be any  the mate remained perched up on the pump in order to comply while spike and his people who now breathed more freely again improved the leisure to brace up and haul aft to the new course  biddy said mrs budd considerately during this pause in the incidents you need nt scream any longer the danger seems to be past and you may get up off the deck now see i have let go of the mast the pumps have been sounded and are found tight  biddy like an obedient and respectful servant did as directed quite satisfied if the pumps were tight it was some little time to be sure before she was perfectly certain whether she were alive or notbut once certain of this circumstance her alarm very sensibly abated and she became reasonable as for mulford he dropped the sounding rod again and had the same cheering report to make  the brig is as tight as a bottle sir  so much the better answered spike i never had such a whirl in her before in my life and i thought she was going to stop and pass the night there thats the very spot on which the hussar frigate was wrecked  so i have heard sir but she drew so much water that she hit slap against the rock and started a butt we merely touched on its top with our forefoot and slid off  this was the simple explanation of the swashs escape and everybody being now well assured that no harm had been done things fell into their old and regular train again as for spike his gallantry notwithstanding was upset for some hours and glad enough was he when he saw all three of his passengers quit the deck to go below mrs budds spirits had been so much agitated that she told rose she would go down into the cabin and rest a few minutes on its sofa we say sofa for that article of furniture nowadays is far more common in vessels than it was thirty years ago in the dwellings of the country  there mulford growled spike pointing ahead of the brig to an object on the water that was about half a mile ahead of them theres that bloody boatdye see i should like of all things to give it the slip theres a chap in that boat i do nt like  i do nt see how that can be very well done sir unless we anchor repass the gate at the turn of the tide and go to sea by the way of sandy hook  that will never do ive no wish to be parading the brig before the town you see mulford nothing can be more innocent and proper than the molly swash as you know from having sailed in her these twelve months youll give her that character ill be sworn  i know no harm of her capt spike and hope i never shall  no siryou know no harm of her nor does any one else a nursing infant is not more innocent than the molly swash or could have a clearer character if nothing but truth was said of her but the world is so much given to lying that one of the old saints of whom we read in the good book such as calvin and john rogers would be vilified if he lived in these times then it must be owned mr mulford whatever may be the raal innocence of the brig she has a most desperate wicked look  why yes sirit must be owned she is what we sailors call a wickedlooking craft but some of uncle sams cruisers have that appearance also  i know iti know it sir and think nothing of looks myself men are often deceived in me by my looks which have none of your longshore softness about em perhaps but my mother used to say i was one of the most tenderhearted boys she had ever heard spoken oflike one of the babes in the woods as it might be but mankind go so much by appearances that i do nt like to trust the brig too much afore their eyes now should we be seen in the lower bay waiting for a wind or for the ebb tide to make to carry us over the bar ten to one but some philotropic or other would be off with a complaint to the district attorney that we looked like a slaver and have us all fetched up to be tried for our lives as pirates no noi like to keep the brig in outoftheway places where she can give no offence to your tropics whether they be philos or of any other sort  well sir we are to the eastward of the gate and alls safe that boat cannot bring us up  you forget mr mulford the revenuecraft that steamed up on the ebb that vessel must be off sands point by this time and she may hear something to our disparagement from the feller in the boat and take it into her smoky head to walk us back to town i wish we were well to the eastward of that steamer but theres no use in lamentations if there is really any danger its some distance ahead yet thank heaven  you have no fears of the man who calls himself jack tier capt spike  none in the world that feller as i remember him was a little bustlin chap that i kept in the cabin as a sort of stewards mate there was neither good nor harm in him to the best of my recollection but josh can tell us all about himjust give josh a call  the best thing in the known history of spike was the fact that his steward had sailed with him for more than twenty years where he had picked up josh no one could say but josh and himself and neither chose to be very communicative on the subject but josh had certainly been with him as long as he had sailed the swash and that was from a time actually anterior to the birth of mulford the mate soon had the negro in the council  i say josh asked spike do you happen to remember such a hand aboard here as one jack tier  lor bless you yes sirmembers he as well as i do the pea soup that was burnt and which you trowed all over him to scald him for punishment  ive had to do that so often to one careless fellow or other that the circumstance does nt recall the man i remember himbut not as clear as i could wish how long did he sail with us  sebberal vyge sir and got left ashore down on the main one night whene boat were obliged to shove off in a hurry yes members little jack right well i does  did you see the man that spoke us from the wharf and hailed for this very jack tier  i seed a man sir dat was wonerful jack tier built like sir but i did nt hear the conwersation habbin the ladies to tend to but jack was oncommon short in his floor timbers sir and had no length of keel at all his beam was wonerful for his length altogedderwhat you call jollyboat or bumboat build and was only good aforee wind capn spike  was he good for anything aboard ship josh worth heavingto for should he try to get aboard of us again  why sir cant say much for him in dat fashion jack was handy in the cabin and capital feller to carry soup from the gally aft you see sir he was so lowrigged that the brigs lurchin and pitchin could nt get him off his pins and he stood up like a church in the heaviest weader yes sir jack was right good for dat  spike mused a momentthen he rolled the tobacco over in his mouth and added in the way a man speaks when his mind is made upay ay i see into the fellow hell make a handy ladys maid and we want such a chap just now its better to have an old friend aboard than to be pickin up strangers long shore so should this jack tier come off to us from any of the islands or points ahead mr mulford youll round to and take him aboard as for the steamer if she will only pass out into the sound where theres room it shall go hard with us but i get to the eastward of her without speaking on the other hand should she anchor this side of the fort ill not attempt to pass her there is deep water inside of most of the islands i know and well try and dodge her in that way if no better offer ive no more reason than another craft to fear a government vessel but the sight of one of them makes me oncomfortable thats all  mulford shrugged his shoulders and remained silent perceiving that his commander was not disposed to pursue the subject any further in the mean time the brig had passed beyond the influence of the bluff and was beginning to feel a stronger breeze that was coming down the wide opening of flushing bay as the tide still continued strong in her favour and her motion through the water was getting to be four or five knots there was every prospect of her soon reaching whitestone the point where the tides meet and where it would become necessary to anchor unless indeed the wind which was now getting to the southward and eastward should come round more to the south all this spike and his mate discussed together while the people were clearing the decks and making the preparations that are customary on board a vessel before she gets into rough water  by this time it was ascertained that the brig had received no damage by her salute of the pot rock and every trace of uneasiness on that account was removed but spike kept harping on the boat and the pilotlooking chap who was in her as they passed rikers island all hands expected a boat would put off with a pilot or to demand pilotage but none came and the swash now seemed released from all her present dangers unless some might still be connected with the revenue steamer to retard her advance however the wind came out a smart working breeze from the southward and eastward compelling her to make long legs and short ones on her way towards whitestone  this is beating the wind rosy dear said mrs budd complacently she and her niece having returned to the deck a few minutes after this change had taken place your respected uncle did a great deal of this in his time and was very successful in it i have heard him say that in one of his voyages between liverpool and new york he beat the wind by a whole fortnight everybody talking of it in the insurance offices as if it was a miracle  ay ay madam budd put in spike ill answer for that theyre desperate talkers in and about them there insurance offices in wall street great gossips be they and they think they know everything now just because this brig is a little old or so and was built for a privateer in the last war theyd refuse to rate her as even b no 2 and my blessing on em  yes b no 2 thats just what your dear uncle used to call me rosyhis charming b no 2 or betsy no 2 particularly when he was in a loving mood captain spike did you ever beat the wind in a long voyage  i cant say i ever did mrs budd answered spike looking grimly around to ascertain if any one dared to smile at his passengers mistake especially for so long a pull as from new york to liverpool  then your uncle used to boast of the rose in blooms wearing and attacking she would attack anything that came in her way no matter who and as for wearing i think he once told me she would wear just what she had a mind to like any human being  rose was a little mystified but she looked vexed at the same time as if she distrusted all was not right  i remember all my sea education continued the unsuspecting widow as if it had been learnt yesterday beating the wind and attacking ship my poor mr budd used to say were nice manoeuvres and required most of his tactics especially in heavy weather did you know rosy dear that sailors weigh the weather and know when it is heavy and when it is light  i did not aunt nor do i understand now how it can very well be done  oh child before you have been at sea a week you will learn so many things that are new and get so many ideas of which you never had any notion before that youll not be the same person my captain had an instrument he called a thermometer and with that he used to weigh the weather and then he would write down in the logbook today heavy weather or tomorrow light weather just as it happened and that helped him mightily along in his voyages  mrs budd has merely mistaken the name of the instrumentthe barometer is what she wished to say put in mulford opportunely  rose looked grateful as well as relieved though profoundly ignorant on these subjects herself she had always suspected her aunts knowledge it was consequently grateful to her to ascertain that in this instance the old ladys mistake had been so trifling  well it may have been the barometer for i know he had them both resumed the aunt barometer or thermometer it do nt make any great difference or quadrant or sextant they are all instruments and sometimes he used one and sometimes another sailors take on board the sun too and have an instrument for that as well as one to weigh the weather with sometimes they take on board the stars and the moon and fill their ships with the heavenly bodies as ive heard my dear husband say again and again but the most curious thing at sea as all sailors tell me is crossing the line and i do hope we shall cross the line rosy that you and i may see it  what is the line aunty and how do vessels cross it  the line my dear is a place in the ocean where the earth is divided into two parts one part being called the north pole and the other part the south pole neptune lives near this line and he allows no vessel to go out of one pole into the other without paying it a visit never neverhe would as soon think of living on dry land as think of letting even a canoe pass without visiting it  do you suppose there is such a being really as neptune aunty  to be sure i do he is king of the sea why should nt there be the sea must have a king as well as the land  the sea may be a republic aunty like this country then no king is necessary i have always supposed neptune to be an imaginary being  oh thats impossiblethe sea is no republic there are but two republics america and texas ive heard that the sea is a highway it is truethe highway of nations i believe it is called and that must mean something particular but my poor mr budd always told me that neptune was king of the seas and he was always so accurate you might depend on everything he said why he called his last newfoundland dog neptune and do you think rosy that your dear uncle would call his dog after an imaginary beingand he a man to beat the wind and attack ship and take the sun moon and stars aboard no no child fanciful folk may see imaginary beings but solid folk see solid beings  even spike was dumfounded at this and there is no knowing what he might have said had not an old seadog who had just come out of the foretopmast crosstrees come aft and hitching up his trowsers with one hand while he touched his hat with the other said with immoveable gravity  the revenuesteamer has brought up just under the fort capt spike  how do you know that bill demanded the captain with a rapidity that showed how completely mrs budd and all her absurdities were momentarily forgotten  i was up on the foretopgallant yard sir a bit ago just to look to the strap of the jewelblock which wants some sarvice on it and i seed her over the land blowin off steam and takin in her kites afore i got out of the crosstrees she was head to wind under barepoles and if she had nt anchored she was about to do so im sartin t was she sir and that she was about to bring up  spike gave a long low whistle after his fashion and he walked away from the females with the air of a man who wanted room to think in half a minute later he called outstand by to shorten sail boys man foreclewgarnets flying jib down haul topgallant sheets and gafftopsail gear in with em all my ladsin with everything with a will  an order to deal with the canvas in any way on board ship immediately commands the whole attention of all whose duty it is to attend to such matters and there was an end of all discourse while the swash was shortening sail everybody understood too that it was to gain time and prevent the brig from reaching throgs neck sooner than was desirable  keep the brig off called out spike and let her warewere too busy to tack just now  the man at the wheel knew very well what was wanted and he put his helm up instead of putting it down as he might have done without this injunction as this change brought the brig before the wind and spike was in no hurry to luff up on the other tack the swash soon ran over a mile of the distance she had already made putting her back that much on her way to the neck it is out of our power to say what the people of the different craft in sight thought of all this but an opportunity soon offered of putting them on a wrong scent a large coasting schooner carrying everything that would draw on a wind came sweeping under the stern of the swash and hailed  has anything happened on board that brig demanded her master  man overboard answered spikeyou havnt seen his hat have you  nono came back just as the schooner in her onward course swept beyond the reach of the voice her people collected together and one or two ran up the rigging a short distance stretching their necks on the lookout for the poor fellow but they were soon called down to bout ship in less than five minutes another vessel a rakish coasting sloop came within hail  did nt that brig strike the pot rock in passing the gate demanded her captain  ay ayand a devil of a rap she got too  this satisfied him there being nothing remarkable in a vessels acting strangely that had hit the pot rock in passing hell gate  i think we may get in our mainsail on the strength of this mr mulford said spike there can be nothing oncommon in a crafts shortening sail that has a man overboard and which has hit the pot rock i wonder i never thought of all this before  here is a skiff trying to get alongside of us capt spike called out the boatswain  skiff be dd i want no skiff here  the man that called himself jack tier is in her sir  the dl he is cried spike springing over to the opposite side of the deck to take a look for himself to his infinite satisfaction he perceived that tier was alone in the skiff with the exception of a negro who pulled its sculls and that this was a very different boat from that which had glanced through hell gate like an arrow darting from its bow  luff and shake your topsail called out spike get a rope there to throw to this skiff  the orders were obeyed and jack tier with his clothesbag was soon on the deck of the swash as for the skiff and the negro they were cast adrift the instant the latter had received his quarter the meeting between spike and his quondam stewards mate was a little remarkable each stood looking intently at the other as if to note the changes which time had made we cannot say that spikes hard red selfish countenance betrayed any great feeling though such was not the case with jack tiers the last a lymphatic puffy sort of a person at the best seemed really a little touched and he either actually brushed a tear from his eye or he affected so to do  so you are my old shipmate jack tier are ye exclaimed spike in a halfpatronizing halfhesitating wayand you want to try the old craft agin give us a leaf of your log and let me know where you have been this many a day and what you have been about keep the brig off mr mulford we are in no particular hurry to reach throgs youll remember sir  tier gave an account of his proceedings which could have no interest with the reader his narrative was anything but very clear and it was delivered in a cracked octave sort of a voice such as little dapper people not unfrequently enjoytones between those of a man and a boy the substance of the whole story was this tier had been left ashore as sometimes happens to sailors and by necessary connection was left to shift for himself after making some vain endeavours to rejoin his brig he had shipped in one vessel after another until he accidentally found himself in the port of new york at the same time as the swash he knowd he never should be truly happy agin until he could once more get aboard the old hussy and had hurried up to the wharf where he understood the brig was lying as he came in sight he saw she was about to cast off and dropping his clothesbag he had made the best of his way to the wharf where the conversation passed that has been related  the gentleman on the wharf was about to take boat to go through the gate concluded tier and so i begs a passage of him he was goodnatured enough to wait until i could find my bag and as soon aterwards as the men could get their grog we shoved off the molly was just getting in behind blackwells as we left the wharf and having four good oars and the shortest road we come out into the gate just ahead on you my eye what a place that is to go through in a boat and on a strong flood the gentleman who watched the brig as a cat watches a mouse says you struck on the pot as he called it but i says no for the molly swash was never knowd to hit rock or shoal in my time aboard her  and where did you quit that gentleman and what has become of him asked spike  he put me ashore on that point above us where i seed a nigger with his skiff who i thought would be willin to arn his quarter by giving me a cast alongside so here i am and a long pull ive had to get here  as this was said jack removed his hat and wiped his brow with a handkerchief which if it had never seen better days had doubtless been cleaner after this he looked about him with an air not entirely free from exultation  this conversation had taken place in the gangway a somewhat public place and spike beckoned to his recruit to walk aft where he might be questioned without being overheard  what became of the gentleman in the boat as you call him demanded spike  he pulled ahead seeming to be in a hurry  do you know who he was  not a bit of it i never saw the man before and he did nt tell me his business sir  had he anything like a silver oar about him  i saw nothing of the sort capt spike and knows nothing consarning him  what sort of a boat was he in and where did he get it  well as to the boat sir i can say a word seein it was so much to my mind and pulled so wonderful smart it was a light ships yawl with four oars and came round the hook just ater you had got the brigs head round to the eastward you must have seen it i should think though it kept close in with the wharves as if it wished to be snug  then the gentleman as you call him expected that very boat to come and take him off  i suppose so sir because it did come and take him off thats all i knows about it  had you no jaw with the gentleman you was nt mnm the whole time you was in the boat with him  not a bit of it sir silence and i does nt agree together long and so we talked most of the time  and what did the stranger say of the brig  lord sir he catechised me like as if i had been a child at sundayschool he asked me how long i had sailed in her what ports wed visited and what trade wed been in you cant think the sight of questions he put and how curous he was for the answers  and what did you tell him in your answers you said nothin about our call down on the spanish main the time you were left ashore i hope jack  not i sir i played him off surprisinly he got nothin to count upon out of me though i do owe the molly swash a grudge im not goin to betray her  you owe the molly swash a grudge have i taken an enemy on board her then  jack started and seemed sorry he had said so much while spike eyed him keenly but the answer set all right it was not given however without a moment for recollection  oh you knows what i mean sir i owe the old hussy a grudge for having desarted me like but its only a love quarrel atween us the old molly will never come to harm by my means  i hope not jack the man that wrongs the craft he sails in can never be a truehearted sailor stick by your ship in all weathers is my rule and a good rule it is to go by but what did you tell the stranger  oh i told him id been six vyges in the brig the first was to madagascar  the dl you did was he soft enough to believe that  thats more than i knows sir i can only tell you what i said i do nt pretend to know how much he believed  heave aheadwhat next  then i told him we went to kamschatka for gold dust and ivory  wheeew what did the man say to that  why he smiled a bit and ater that he seemed more curous than ever to hear all about it i told him my third vyge was to canton with a cargo of broomcorn where we took in salmon and dunfish for home ater that we went to norway with ice and brought back silks and money our next run was to the havana with salt and nips  nips what the devil be they  turnips you knows sir we always calls em nips in cargo at the havana i told him we took in leather and jerked beef and came home oh he got nothin from me capt spike thatll ever do the brig a morsel of harm  i am glad of that jack you must know enough of the seas to understand that a close mouth is sometimes better for a vessel than a clean bill of health was there nothing said about the revenuesteamer  now you name her sir i believe there wasay ay sir the gentleman did say if the steamer fetched up to the westward of the fort that he should overhaul her without difficulty on this flood  thatll do jack thatll do my honest fellow go below and tell josh to take you into the cabin again as stewards mate youre rather too dutch built in your old age to do much aloft  one can hardly say whether jack received this remark as complimentary or not he looked a little glum for a man may be as round as a barrel and wish to be thought genteel and slender but he went below in quest of josh without making any reply  the succeeding movements of spike appeared to be much influenced by what he had just heard he kept the brig under short canvas for near two hours sheering about in the same place taking care to tell everything which spoke him that he had lost a man overboard in this way not only the tide but the day itself was nearly spent about the time the former began to lose its strength however the forecourse and the mainsail were got on the brigantine with the intention of working her up toward whitestone where the tides meet and near which the revenuesteamer was known to be anchored we say near though it was in fact a mile or two more to the eastward and close to the extremity of the point  notwithstanding these demonstrations of a wish to work to windward spike was really in no hurry he had made up his mind to pass the steamer in the dark if possible and the night promised to favour him but in order to do this it might be necessary not to come in sight of her at all or at least not until the obscurity should in some measure conceal his rig and character in consequence of this plan the swash made no great progress even after she had got sail on her on her old course the wind lessened too after the sun went down though it still hung to the eastward or nearly ahead as the tide gradually lost its force moreover the set to windward became less and less until it finally disappeared altogether  there is necessarily a short reach in this passage where it is always slack water so far as current is concerned this is precisely where the tides meet or as has been intimated at whitestone which is somewhat more than a mile to the westward of throgmortons neck near the point of which stands fort schuyler one of the works recently erected for the defence of new york off the pitch of the point nearly midchannel had the steamer anchored a fact of which spike had made certain by going aloft himself and reconnoitering her over the land before it had got to be too dark to do so he entertained no manner of doubt that this vessel was in waiting for him and he well knew there was good reason for it but he would not return and attempt the passage to sea by way of sandy hook his manner of regarding the whole matter was cool and judicious the distance to the hook was too great to be made in such short nights ere the return of day and he had no manner of doubt he was watched for in that direction as well as in this then he was particularly unwilling to show his craft at all in front of the town even in the night moreover he had ways of his own for effecting his purposes and this was the very spot and time to put them in execution  while these things were floating in his mind mrs budd and her handsome niece were making preparations for passing the night aided by biddy noon the old lady was factotum or factota as it might be most classical to call her though we are entirely without authorities on the subject and was just as selfcomplacent and ambitious of seawomanship below decks as she had been above board the effect however gave spike great satisfaction since it kept her out of sight and left him more at liberty to carry out his own plans about nine however the good woman came on deck intending to take a look at the weather like a skilful marineress as she was before she turned in not a little was she astonished at what she then and there beheld as she whispered to rose and biddy both of whom stuck close to her side feeling the want of good pilotage no doubt in strange waters  the molly swash was still under her canvas though very little sufficed for her present purposes she was directly off whitestone and was making easy stretches across the passage or river as it is called having nothing set but her huge foreandaft mainsail and the jib under this sail she worked like a top and spike sometimes fancied she travelled too fast for his purposes the night air having thickened the canvas as usual until it held the wind as a bottle holds water there was nothing in this however to attract the particular attention of the shipmasters widow a sail more or less being connected with observation much too critical for her schooling nice as the last had been she was surprised to find the men stripping the brig forward and converting her into a schooner nor was this done in a loose and slovenly manner under favour of the obscurity on the contrary it was so well executed that it might have deceived even a seaman under a noonday sun provided the vessel were a mile or two distant the manner in which the metamorphosis was made was as follows the studdingsail booms had been taken off the topsailyard in order to shorten it to the eye and the yard itself was swayed up about halfmast to give it the appearance of a schooners foreyard the brigs real lower yard was lowered on the bulwarks while her royal yard was sent down altogether and the topgallantmast was lowered until the heel rested on the topsail yard all of which in the night gave the gear forward very much the appearance of that of a foretopsail schooner instead of that of a halfrigged brig as the craft really was as the vessel carried a trysail on her foremast it answered very well in the dark to represent a schooners foresail several other little dispositions of this nature were made about which it might weary the uninitiated to read but which will readily suggest themselves to the mind of a sailor  these alterations were far advanced when the females reappeared on deck they at once attracted their attention and the captains widow felt the imperative necessity as connected with her professional character of proving the same she soon found spike who was bustling around the deck now looking around to see that his brig was kept in the channel now and then issuing an order to complete her disguise  captain spike what can be the meaning of all these changes the tamper of your vessel is so much altered that i declare i should not have known her  is it by george then she is just in the state i want her to be in  but why have you done itand what does it all mean  oh mollys going to bed for the night and shes only undressing herselfthats all  yes rosy dear captain spike is right i remember that my poor mr budd used to talk about the rose in bloom having her clothes on and her clothes off just as if she was a born woman but do nt you mean to navigate at all in the night captain spike or will the brig navigate without sails  thats itshes just as good in the dark under one sort of canvas as under another so mr mulford well take a reef in that mainsail it will bring it nearer to the size of our new foresail and seem more shipshape and brister fashionthen i think shell do as the night is getting to be rather darkish  captain spike said the boatswain who had been set to lookout for that particular changethe brig begins to feel the new tide and sets to windward  let her go thennow is as good a time as another weve got to run the gantlet and the sooner it is done the better  as the moment seemed propitious not only mulford but all the people heard this order with satisfaction the night was starlight though not very clear at that objects on the water however were more visible than those on the land while those on the last could be seen well enough even from the brig though in confused and somewhat shapeless piles when the swash was brought close by the wind she had just got into the last reach of the river or that which runs parallel with the neck for near a mile doubling where the sound expands itself gradually to a breadth of many leagues still the navigation at the entrance of this end of the sound was intricate and somewhat dangerous rendering it indispensable for a vessel of any size to make a crooked course the wind stood at southeast and was very scant to lay through the reach with while the tide was so slack as barely to possess a visible current at that place the steamer lay directly off the point midchannel as mentioned showing lights to mark her position to anything which might be passing in or out the great thing was to get by her without exciting her suspicion as all on board the females excepted knew what their captain was at the attempt was made amid an anxious and profound silence or if any one spoke at all it was only to give an order in a low tone or its answer in a simple monosyllable  although her aunt assured her that everything which had been done already and which was now doing was quite in rule the quickeyed and quickwitted rose noted these unusual proceedings and had an opinion of her own on the subject spike had gone forward and posted himself on the weatherside of the forecastle where he could get the clearest look ahead and there he remained most of the time leaving mulford on the quarterdeck to work the vessel perceiving this she managed to get near the mate without attracting her aunts attention and at the same time out of earshot  why is everybody so still and seemingly so anxious harry mulford she asked speaking in a low tone herself as if desirous of conforming to a common necessity is there any new danger here i thought the gate had been passed altogether some hours ago  so it has dye see that large dark mass on the water off the point which seems almost as huge as the fort with lights above it that is a revenuesteamer which came out of york a few hours before us we wish to get past her without being troubled by any of her questions  and what do any in this brig care about her questions they can be answered surely  ay ay rosethey may be answered as you say but the answers sometimes are unsatisfactory captain spike for some reason or other is uneasy and would rather not have anything to say to her he has the greatest aversion to speaking the smallest craft when on a coast  and thats the reason he has undressed his molly as he calls her that he might not be known  mulford turned his head quickly toward his companion as if surprised by her quickness of apprehension but he had too just a sense of his duty to make any reply instead of pursuing the discourse he adroitly contrived to change it by pointing out to rose the manner in which they were getting on which seemed to be very successfully  although the swash was under much reduced canvas she glided along with great ease and with considerable rapidity of motion the heavy night air kept her canvas distended and the weatherly set of the tide trifling as it yet was pressed her up against the breeze so as to turn all to account it was apparent enough by the manner in which objects on the land were passed that the crisis was fast approaching rose rejoined her aunt in order to await the result in nearly breathless expectation at that moment she would have given the world to be safe on shore this wish was not the consequence of any constitutional timidity for rose was much the reverse from timid but it was the fruit of a newlyawakened and painful though still vague suspicion happy thrice happy was it for one of her naturally confiding and guileless nature that distrust was thus opportunely awakened for she was without a guardian competent to advise and guide her youth as circumstances required  the brig was not long in reaching the passage that opened to the sound it is probable she did this so much the sooner because spike kept her a little off the wind with a view of not passing too near the steamer at this point the direction of the passage changes at nearly a right angle the revenuesteamer lying on a line with the neck and leaving a sort of bay in the angle for the swash to enter the land was somewhat low in all directions but one and that was by drawing a straight line from the point through the steamer to the long island shore on the latter and in that quarter rose a bluff of considerable elevation with deep water quite near it and under the shadows of that bluff spike intended to perform his nicest evolutions he saw that the revenue vessel had let her fires go down and that she was entirely without steam under canvas he had no doubt of beating her hand over hand could he once fairly get to windward and then she was at anchor and would lose some time in getting under way should she even commence a pursuit it was all important therefore to gain as much to windward as possible before the people of the government vessel took the alarm  there can be no doubt that the alterations made on board the swash served her a very good turn on this occasion although the night could not be called positively dark there was sufficient obscurity to render her hull confused and indistinct at any distance and this so much the more when seen from the steamer outside or between her and the land all this spike very well understood and largely calculated on in effect he was not deceived the lookouts on board the revenue craft could trace little of the vessel that was approaching beyond the spars and sails which rose above the shores and these seemed to be the spars and sails of a common foretopsail schooner as this was not the sort of craft for which they were on the watch no suspicion was awakened nor did any reports go from the quarterdeck to the cabin the steamer had her quarter watches and officers of the deck like a vessel of war the discipline of which was fairly enough imitated but even a manofwar may be overreached on an occasion  spike was only great in a crisis and then merely as a seaman he understood his calling to its minuti and he understood the molly swash better than he understood any other craft that floated for more than twenty years had he sailed her and the careful parent does not better understand the humours of the child than he understood exactly what might be expected from his brig his satisfaction sensibly increased therefore as she stole along the land toward the angle mentioned without a sound audible but the gentle gurgling of the water stirred by the stem and which sounded like the ripple of the gentlest wave as it washes the shingle of some placid beach  as the brig drew nearer to the bluff the latter brought the wind more ahead as respected the desired course this was unfavourable but it did not disconcert her watchful commander  let her come round mr mulford said this pilotcaptain in a low voicewe are as near in as we ought to go  the helm was put down the head sheets started and away into the wind shot the molly swash forereaching famously in stays and of course gaining so much on her true course in a minute she was round and filled on the other tack spike was now so near the land that he could perceive the tide was beginning to aid him and that his weatherly set was getting to be considerable delighted at this he walked aft and told mulford to go about again as soon as the vessel had sufficient way to make sure of her in stays the mate inquired if he did not think the revenue people might suspect something unless they stood further out toward midchannel but spike reminded him that they would be apt to think the schooner was working up under the southern shore because the ebb first made there this reason satisfied mulford and as soon as they were halfway between the bluff and the steamer the swash was again tacked with her head to the former this manoeuvre was executed when the brig was about two hundred yards from the steamer a distance that was sufficient to preserve under all the circumstances the disguise she had assumed  they do not suspect us harry whispered spike to his mate we shall get to windward of em as sartain as the breeze stands that boatin gentleman might as well have staid at home as for any good his hurry done him or his employers  whom do you suppose him to be captain spike  whoa feller that lives by his own wicked deeds no matter who he is an informer perhaps at any rate he is not the man to outwit the molly swash and her old stupid foolish master and owner stephen spike luff mr mulford luff nows the time to make the most of your legluff her up and shake her she is setting to windward fast the ebb is sucking along that bluff like a boy at a molasses hogshead all she can drift on this tack is clear gain there is no hurry so long as they are asleep aboard the steamer thats itmake a halfboard at once but take care and not come round as soon as we are fairly clear of the bluff and open the bay that makes up behind it we shall get the wind more to the southward and have a fine long leg for the next stretch  of course mulford obeyed throwing the brig up into the wind and allowing her to set to windward but filling again on the same tack as ordered this of course delayed her progress toward the land and protracted the agony but it carried the vessel in the direction she most wished to go while it kept her not only end on to the steamer but in a line with the bluff and consequently in the position most favourable to conceal her true character presently the bay mentioned which was several miles deep opened darkly toward the south and the wind came directly out of it or more to the southward at this moment the swash was near a quarter of a mile from the steamer and all that distance dead to windward of her as the breeze came out of the bay spike tacked his vessel himself now and got her head up so high that she brought the steamer on her lee quarter and looked away toward the island which lies northwardly from the point and quite near to which all vessels of any draught of water are compelled to pass even with the fairest winds  shake the reef out of the mainsail mr mulford said spike when the swash was fairly in motion again on this advantageous tack we shall pass well to windward of the steamer and may as well begin to open our cloth again  is it not a little too soon sir mulford ventured to remonstrate the reef is a large one and will make a great difference in the size of the sail  theyll not see it at this distance no no sir shake out the reef and sway away on the topgallantmast rope im for bringing the molly swash into her old shape again and make her look handsome once more  do you dress the brig as well as undress her omights captain spike inquired the shipmasters reliet a little puzzled with this fickleness of purpose i do not believe my poor mr budd ever did that  fashions change madam with the timesay ay sirshake out the reef and sway away on that mastrope boys as soon as you have manned it well convart our schooner into a brig again  as these orders were obeyed of course a general bustle now took place mulford soon had the reef out and the sail distended to the utmost while the topgallantmast was soon up and fidded the next thing was to sway upon the foreyard and get that into its place the people were busied at this duty when a hoarse hail came across the water on the heavy night air  brig ahoy was the call  sway upon that foreyard said spike unmoved by this summonsstart it start it at once  the steamer hails us sir said the mate  not she she is hailing a brig we are a schooner yet  a moment of active exertion succeeded during which the foreyard went into its place then came a second hail  schooner ahoy was the summons this time  the steamer hails us again captain spike  the devil a bit were a brig now and she hails a schooner come boys bestir yourselves and get the canvas on molly forard loose the forecourse before you quit the yard there then up aloft and loosen everything you can find  all was done as ordered and done rapidly as is ever the case on board a wellordered vessel when there is occasion for exertion that occasion now appeared to exist in earnest for while the men were sheeting home the topsail a flash of light illuminated the scene when the roar of a gun came booming across the water succeeded by the very distinct whistling of its shot we regret that the relict of the late captain budd did not behave exactly as became a shipmasters widow under fire instead of remaining silent and passive even while frightened as was the case with rose she screamed quite as loud as she had previously done that very day in hellgate it appeared to spike indeed that practice was making her perfect and as for biddy the spirit of emulation became so powerful in her bosom that if anything she actually outshrieked her mistress hearing this the widow made a second effort and fairly recovered the ground some might have fancied she had lost  oh captain spike exclaimed the agitated widow do notdo not if you love me do not let them fire again  how am i to help it asked the captain a good deal to the point though he overlooked the essential fact that by heavingto and waiting for the steamers boat to board him he might have prevented a second shot as completely as if he had the ordering of the whole affair no second shot was fired however as it afterward appeared the screams of mrs budd and biddy were heard on board the steamer the captain of which naturally enough supposing that the slaughter must be terrible where such cries had arisen was satisfied with the mischief he had already done and directed his people to secure their gun and go to the capstanbars in order to help lift the anchor in a word the revenue vessel was getting under way manofwar fashion which means somewhat expeditiously  spike understood the sounds that reached him among which was the call of the boatswain and he bestirred himself accordingly experienced as he was in chases and all sorts of nautical artifices he very well knew that his situation was sufficiently critical it would have been so with a steamer at his heels in the open ocean but situated as he was he was compelled to steer but one course and to accept the wind on that course as it might offer if he varied at all in his direction it was only in a trifling way though he did make some of these variations every moment was now precious however and he endeavoured to improve the time to the utmost he knew that he could greatly outsail the revenue vessel under canvas and some time would be necessary to enable her to get up her steam half an hour at the very least on that half hour then depended the fate of the molly swash  send the booms on the yards and set stunsails at once mr mulford said spike the instant the more regular canvas was spread forward this wind will be free enough for all but the lower stunsail and we must drive the brig on  are we not looking up too high captain spike the steppingstones are ahead of us sir  i know that very well mulford but its nearly high water and the brigs in light trim and we may rub and go by making a short cut here we shall gain a full mile on the steamer that mile may save us  do you really think it possible to get away from that craft which can always make a fair wind of it in these narrow waters captain spike  one dont know sir nothin is done without tryin and by tryin more is often done than was hoped for i have a scheme in my head and providence may favour me in bringing it about  providence the religionist quarrels with the philosopher if the latter happen to remove this interposition of a higher power even so triflingly as by the intervention of secondary agencies while the biggest rascal dignifies even his success by such phrases as providential aid but it is not surprising men should misunderstand terms when they make such sad confusion in the acts which these terms are merely meant to represent spike had his providence as well as a priest and we dare say he often counted on its succour with quite as rational grounds of dependence as many of the pharisees who are constantly exclaiming the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these  sail was made on board the swash with great rapidity and the brig made a bold push at the steppingstones spike was a capital pilot he insisted if he could once gain sight of the spar that was moored on those rocks for a buoy he should run with great confidence the two lights were of great assistance of course but the revenue vessel could see these lights as well as the brig and she doubtless had an excellent pilot on board by the time the studdingsails were set on board the swash the steamer was aweigh and her long line of peculiar sails became visible unfortunately for men who were in a hurry she lay so much within the bluff as to get the wind scant and her commander thought it necessary to make a stretch over to the southern shore before he attempted to lay his course when he was ready to tack an operation of some time with a vessel of her great length the swash was barely visible in the obscurity gliding off upon a slack bowline at a rate which nothing but the damp night air the ballasttrim of the vessel united to her excellent sailing qualities could have produced with so light a breeze  the first half hour took the swash completely out of sight of the steamer in that time in truth by actual superiority in sailing by her greater state of preparation and by the distance saved by a bold navigation she had gained fully a league on her pursuer but while the steamer had lost sight of the swash the latter kept the former in view and that by means of a signal that was very portentous she saw the light of the steamers chimneys and could form some opinion of her distance and position  it was about eleven oclock when the swash passed the light at sands point close in with the land the wind stood much as it had been if there was a change at all it was half a point more to the southward and it was a little fresher such as it was spike saw he was getting in that smooth water quite eight knots out of his craft and he made his calculations thereon as yet and possibly for half an hour longer he was gaining and might hope to continue to gain on the steamer then her turn would come though no great traveller it was not to be expected that favoured by smooth water and the breeze her speed would be less than ten knots while there was no hope of increasing his own without an increase of the wind he might be five miles in advance or six at the most these six miles would be overcome in three hours of steaming to a dead certainty and they might possibly be overcome much sooner it was obviously necessary to resort to some other experiment than that of dead sailing if an escape was to be effected  the sound was now several miles in width and spike at first proposed to his mate to keep off dead before the wind and by crossing over to the north shore let the steamer pass ahead and continue a bootless chase to the eastward several vessels however were visible in the middle of the passage at distances varying from one to three miles and mulford pointed out the hopelessness of attempting to cross the sheet of open water and expect to go unseen by the watchful eyes of the revenue people  what you say is true enough mr mulford answered spike after a moment of profound reflection and every foot that they come nearer the less will be our chance but here is hempstead harbour a few leagues ahead if we can reach that before the blackguards close we may do well enough it is a deep bay and has high land to darken the view i dont think the brig could be seen at midnight by anything outside if she was once fairly up that water a mile or two  that is our chance sir exclaimed mulford cheerfully ay ay i know the spot and everything is favourabletry that captain spike ill answer for it that we go clear  spike did try it for a considerable time longer he stood on keeping as close to the land as he thought it safe to run and carrying everything that would draw but the steamer was on his heels evidently gaining fast her chimneys gave out flames and there was every sign that her people were in earnest to those on board the swash these flames seemed to draw nearer each instant as indeed was the fact and just as the breeze came fresher out of the opening in the hills or the low mountains which surround the place of refuge in which they designed to enter mulford announced that by aid of the nightglass he could distinguish both sails and hull of their pursuer spike took a look and throwing down the instrument in a way to endanger it he ordered the studdingsails taken in the men went aloft like cats and worked as if they could stand in air in a minute or two the swash was under what mrs budd might have called her attacking canvas and was close by the wind looking on a good leg well up the harbour the brig seemed to be conscious of the emergency and glided ahead at capital speed in five minutes she had shut in the flaming chimneys of the steamer in five minutes more spike tacked to keep under the western side of the harbour and out of sight as long as possible and because he thought the breeze drew down fresher where he was than more out in the bay  all now depended on the single fact whether the brig had been seen from the steamer or not before she hauled into the bay if seen she had probably been watched if not seen there were strong grounds for hoping that she might still escape about a quarter of an hour after spike hauled up the burning chimneys came again into view the brig was then half a league within the bay with a fine dark background of hills to throw her into shadow spike ordered everything taken in but the trysail under which the brig was left to set slowly over toward the western side of the harbour he now rubbed his hands with delight and pointed out to mulford the circumstance that the steamer kept on her course directly athwart the harbours mouth had she seen the swash no doubt she would have turned into the bay also nevertheless an anxious ten minutes succeeded during which the revenue vessel steamed fairly past and shut in her flaming chimneys again by the eastern headlands of the estuary  chapter iii    the western wave was all a flame   the day was well nigh done   almost upon the western wave   rested the broad bright sun   when that strange ship drove suddenly   betwixt us and the sun  the ancient mariner  at that hour on the succeeding morning when the light of day is just beginning to chase away the shadows of night the molly swash became visible within the gloom of the high land which surrounds so much of the bay of hempstead under easy sail backing and filling in order to keep within her hidingplace until a look could be had at the state of things without half an hour later she was so near the entrance of the estuary as to enable the lookouts aloft to ascertain that the coast was clear when spike ordered the helm to be put up and the brig to be kept away to her course at this precise moment rose appeared on deck refreshed by the sleep of a quiet night and with cheeks tinged with a colour even more delicate than that which was now glowing in the eastern sky and which was almost as brilliant  we stopped in this bit of a harbour for the night miss rose that is all said spike observing that his fair passenger was looking about her in some little surprise at finding the vessel so near the land and seemingly so much out of her proper position yes we always do that when we first start on a vyge and before the brig gets used to travellingdo nt we mr mulford  mr mulford who knew how hopeless was the attempt to mystify rose as one might mystify her credulous and weakminded aunt and who had no disposition to deal any way but fairly by the beautiful and in one sense now helpless young creature before him did not see fit to make any reply offend spike he did not dare to do more especially under present circumstances and mislead rose he would not do he affected not to hear the question therefore but issuing an order about the headsails he walked forward as if to see it executed rose herself was not under as much restraint as the young mate  it is convenient captain spike she coolly answered for mulford to have stoppingplaces for vessels that are wearied and i remember the time when my uncle used to tell me of such matters very much in the same vein but it was before i was twelve years old  spike hemmed and he looked a little foolish but clench the boatswain coming aft to say something to him in confidence just at that moment he was enabled to avoid the awkwardness of attempting to explain this man clench or clinch as the name was pronounced was deep in the captains secrets far more so than was his mate and would have been filling mulfords station at that very time had he not been hopelessly ignorant of navigation on the present occasion his business was to point out to the captain two or three lines of smoke that were visible above the water of the sound in the eastern board one of which he was apprehensive might turn out to be the smoke of the revenue craft from which they had so recently escaped  steamers are no rarities in long island sound clench observed the captain levelling his glass at the most suspected of the smokes that must be a providence or stonington chap coming west with the boston train  either of them would have been further west by this time captain spike returned the doubting but watchful boatswain its a large smoke and i fear it is the revenue fellow coming back after having had a look well to the eastward and satisfying himself that we are not to be had in that quarter  spike growled out his assent to the possibility of such a conjecture and promised vigilance this satisfied his subordinate for the moment and he walked forward or to the place where he belonged in the mean time the widow came on deck smiling and snuffing the salt air and ready to be delighted with anything that was maritime  good morning captain spike she criedare we in the offing yetyou know i desired to be told when we are in the offing for i intend to write a letter to my poor mr budds sister mrs sprague as soon as we get to the offing  what is the offing aunt inquired the handsome niece  why you have hardly been at sea long enough to understand me child should i attempt to explain the offing however is the place where the last letters are always written to the owners and to friends ashore the term comes i suppose from the circumstance that the vessel is about to be off and it is natural to think of those we leave behind at such a moment i intend to write to your aunt sprague my dear the instant i hear we are in the offing and what is more i intend to make you my amanuensis  but how will the letter be sent auntyi have no more objections to writing than any one else but i do not see how the letter is to be sent really the sea is a curious region with its stoppingplaces for the night and its offings to write letters at  yes its all as you say rosea most remarkable region is the sea youll admire it as i admire it when you come to know it better and as your poor uncle admired it and as captain spike admires it too as for the letters they can be sent ashore by the pilot as letters are always sent  but aunty there is no pilot in the swashfor captain spike refused to take one on board  roseyou dont understand what you are talking about no vessel ever yet sailed without a pilot if indeed any can its opposed to the law not to have a pilot and now i remember to have heard your dear uncle say it wasnt a voyage if a vessel didnt take away a pilot  but if they take them away aunty how can they send the letters ashore by them  poh poh child you dont know what youre saying but youll overlook it i hope captain spike for rose is quick and will soon learn to know better as if letters couldnt be sent ashore by the pilot though he was a hundred thousand miles from land but captain spike you must let me know when we are about to get off the sound for i know that the pilot is always sent ashore with his letters before the vessel gets off the sound  yes yes returned the captain a little mystified by the widow though he knew her so well and understood her so wellyou shall know maam when we get off soundings for i suppose that is what you mean  what is the difference off the sound or off the soundings of course must mean the same thing but rosy we will go below and write to your aunt at once for i see a lighthouse yonder and lighthouses are always put just off the soundings  rose who always suspected her aunts nautical talk though she did not know how to correct it and was not sorry to put an end to it now by going below and spreading her own writing materials in readiness to write as the other dictated biddy noon was present sewing on some of her own finery  now write as i tell you rose commenced the widowmy dear sister spraguehere we are at last just off the soundings with lighthouses all round us and so many capes and islands in sight that it does seem as if the vessel never could find its way through them all some of these islands must be the west indiesaunty that can never be exclaimed rosewe left new york only yesterday  what of that had it been old times i grant you several days might be necessary to get a sight of the west indies but now when a letter can be written to a friend in boston and an answer received in half an hour it requires no such time to go to the west indies besides what other islands are there in this part of the worldthey cant be england  nonosaid rose at once seeing it would be preferable to admit they were the west indies so the letter went onsome of these islands must be the west indies and it is high time we saw some of them for we are nearly off the sound and the lighthouses are getting to be quite numerous i think we have already seen four since we left the wharf but my dear sister sprague you will be delighted to hear how much better roses health is already becoming  my health aunty why i never knew an ill day in my life  dont tell me that my darling i know too well what all these deceptive appearances of health amount to i would not alarm you for the world rosy dear but a careful parentand im your parent in affection if not by naturebut a careful parents eye is not to be deceived i know you look well but you are ill my child though heaven be praised the sea air and hydropathy are already doing you a monstrous deal of good  as mrs budd concluded she wiped her eyes and appeared really glad that her niece had a less consumptive look than when she embarked rose sat gazing at her aunt in mute astonishment she knew how much and truly she was beloved and that induced her to be more tolerant of her connections foibles than even duty demanded feeling was blended with her respect but it was almost too much for her to learn that this long and in some respects painful voyage was undertaken on her account and without the smallest necessity for it the vexation however would have been largely increased but for certain free communications that had occasionally occurred between her and the handsome mate since the moment of her coming on board the brig rose knew that harry mulford loved her too for he had told her as much with a seamans frankness and though she had never let him know that his partiality was returned her womans heart was fast inclining toward him with all her sexs tenderness this made the mistake of her aunt tolerable though rose was exceedingly vexed it should ever have occurred  why my dearest aunt she cried they told me it was on your account that this voyage was undertaken  i know they did poor dear rosy and that was in order not to alarm you some persons of delicate constitutions  but my constitution is not in the least delicate aunt on the contrary it is as good as possible a blessing for which i trust i am truly grateful i did not know but you might be suffering though you do look so well for they all agreed in telling me you had need of a seavoyage  i a subject for hydropathy why child water is no more necessary to me than it is to a cat  but going to sea aunty is not hydropathy  dont say that rosy do not say that my dear it is hydropathy on a large scale as captain spike says and when he gets us into blue water he has promised that you shall have all the benefits of the treatment  rose was silent and thoughtful after which she spoke quickly like one to whom an important thought had suddenly occurred  and captain spike then was consulted in my case she asked  he was my dear and you have every reason to be grateful to him he was the first to discover a change in your appearance and to suggest a sea voyage marine hydropathy he said he was sure would get you up again for captain spike thinks your constitution good at the bottom though the high colour you have proves too high a state of habitual excitement  was dr monson consulted at all aunt  not at all you know the doctors are all against hydropathy and mesmerism and the magnetic telegraph and everything that is new so we thought it best not to consult him  and my aunt sprague  yes she was consulted after everything was settled and when i knew her notions could not undo what had been already done but she is a seamans widow as well as myself and has a great notion of the virtue of sea air  then it would seem that doctor spike was the principal adviser in my case  i own that he was rosy dear captain spike was brought up by your uncle who has often told me what a thorough seaman he was theres spike now he said to me one day he can almost make his brig talkthis very brig too your uncle meant rosy and of course one of the best vessels in the world to take hydropathy in  yes aunty returned rose playing with the pen while her air proved how little her mind was in her words well what shall i say next to my aunt sprague  roses health is already becoming confirmed resumed the widow who thought it best to encourage her niece by as strong terms as she could employ and i shall extol hydropathy to the skies as long as i live as soon as we reach our port of destination my dear sister sprague i shall write you a line to let you know it by the magnetic telegraph  but there is no magnetic telegraph on the sea aunty interrupted rose looking up from the paper with her clear serene blue eyes expressing even her surprise at this touch of the relicts ignorance  dont tell me that rosy child when everybody says the sparks will fly round the whole earth just as soon as they will fly from new york to philadelphia  but they must have something to fly on aunty and the ocean will not sustain wires or posts  well there is no need of being so particular if there is no telegraph the letter must come by mail you can say telegraph here and when your aunt gets the letter the postmark will tell her how it came it looks better to talk about telegraphic communications child  rose resumed her pen and wrote at her aunts dictation as followsby the magnetic telegraph when i hope to be able to tell you that our dear rose is well as yet we both enjoy the ocean exceedingly but when we get off the sound into blue water and have sent the pilot ashore or discharged him i ought to say which puts me in mind of telling you that a cannon was discharged at us only last night and that the ball whistled so near me that i heard it as plain as ever you heard roses piano  had i not better first tell my aunt sprague what is to be done when the pilot is discharged  no tell her about the cannon that was discharged first and about the ball that i heard i had almost forgot that adventure which was a very remarkable one was it not biddy  indeed missus and it was and miss rose might put in the letter how we both screamed at that cannon and might have been heard as plainly every bit of it as the ball  say nothing on the subject rose or we shall never hear the last of it so darling you may conclude in your own way for i believe i have told your aunt all that comes to mind  rose did as desired finishing the epistle in a very few words for rightly enough she had taken it into her head there was no pilot to be discharged and consequently that the letter would never be sent her short but frequent conferences with mulford were fast opening her eyes not to say her heart and she was beginning to see captain spike in his true character which was that of a great scoundrel it is true that the mate had not long judged his commander quite so harshly but had rather seen his beautiful brig and her rare qualities in her owner and commander than the man himself but jealousy had quickened his observation of late and stephen spike had lost ground sensibly with harry mulford within the last week two or three times before the young man had thought of seeking another berth on account of certain distrusts of spikes occupations but he was poor and so long as he remained in the swash harrys opportunities of meeting rose were greatly increased this circumstance indeed was the secret of his still being in the molly as spike usually called his craft the last voyage having excited suspicions that were rather of a delicate nature then the young man really loved the brig which if she could not be literally made to talk could be made to do almost everything else a vessel and a small vessel too is rather contracted as to space but those who wish to converse can contrive to speak together often even in such narrow limits such had been the fact with rose budd and the handsome mate twenty times since they sailed short as that time was had mulford contrived to get so near to rose as to talk with her unheard by others it is true that he seldom ventured to do this so long as the captain was in sight but spike was often below and opportunities were constantly occurring it was in the course of these frequent but brief conversations that harry had made certain dark hints touching the character of his commander and the known recklessness of his proceedings rose had taken the alarm and fully comprehending her aunts mental imbecility her situation was already giving her great uneasiness she had some undefined hopes from the revenue steamer though strangely enough as it appeared to her her youngest and most approved suitor betrayed a strong desire to escape from that craft at the very moment he was expressing his apprehensions on account of her presence in the brig this contradiction arose from a certain esprit de corps which seldom fails more or less to identify the mariner with his ship  but the writing was finished and the letter sealed with wax mrs budd being quite as particular in that ceremony as lord nelson when the females again repaired on deck they found spike and his mate sweeping the eastern part of the sound with their glasses with a view to look out for enemies or what to them just then was much the same thing government craft in this occupation rose was a little vexed to see that mulford was almost as much interested as spike himself the love of his vessel seemingly overcoming his love for her if not his love of the rightshe knew of no reason however why the captain should dread any other vessel and felt sufficiently provoked to question him a little on the subject if it were only to let him see that the niece was not as completely his dupe as the aunt she had not been on deck five minutes therefore during which time several expressions had escaped the two sailors touching their apprehensions of vessels seen in the distance ere she commenced her inquiries  and why should we fear meeting with other vessels rose plainly demandedhere in long island sound and within the power of the laws of the country  fear exclaimed spike a little startled and a good deal surprised at this straightforward questionfear miss rose you do not think we are afraid though there are many reasons why we do not wish to be spoken by certain craft that are hovering about in the first place you know it is war timei suppose you know madam budd that america is at war with mexico  certainly answered the widow with dignityand that is a sufficient reason rose why one vessel should chase and another should run if you had heard your poor uncle relate as i have done all his chasings and runnings away in the war times child you would understand these things better why ive heard your uncle say that in some of his long voyages he has run thousands and thousands of miles with sails set on both sides and all over his ship  yes aunty and so have i but that was running before the wind as he used to call it  i spose however miss rose put in spike who saw that the niece would soon get the better of the aunti spose miss rose that youll acknowledge that america is at war with mexico  i am sorry to say that such is the fact but i remember to have heard you say yourself captain spike when my aunt was induced to undertake this voyage that you did not consider there was the smallest danger from any mexicans  yes you did captain spike added the auntyou did say there was no danger from mexicans  nor is there a bit madam budd if miss rose and your honoured self will only hear me there is no danger because the brig has the heels of anything mexico can send to sea she has sold her steamers and as for anything else under her flag i would not care a straw  the steamer from which we ran last evening and which actually fired off a cannon at us was not mexican but american said rose with a pointed manner that put spike to his trumps  oh that steamer he stammeredthat was a raceonly a race miss rose and i wouldnt let her come near me for the world i should never hear the last of it in the insurance offices and on change did i let her overhaul us you see miss roseyou see madam budd spike ever found it most convenient to address his mystifying discourse to the aunt in preference to addressing it to the nieceyou see madam budd the master of that craft and i are old croniessailed together when boys and set great store by each other we met only last evening just ater i had left your own agreeable mansion madam budd and says he spike when do you sail tomorrows flood jones says ihis name is jonespeter jones and as good a fellow as ever lived do you go by the hook or by hellgate  hurlgate captain spike if you pleaseor whirlgate which some people think is the true sound but the other way of saying it is awful  well the captain my old master always called it hellgate and i learned the trick from him  i know he did and so do all sailors but genteel people nowadays say nothing but hurlgate or whirlgate  rose smiled at this as did mulford but neither said anything the subject having once before been up between them as for ourselves we are still so oldfashioned as to say and write hellgate and intend so to do in spite of all the yankees that have yet passed through it or who ever shall pass through it and that is saying a great deal we do not like changing names to suit their uneasy spirits  call the place hurlgate and go on with your story said the widow complacently  yes madam budddo you go by the hook or by whirlgate said jones by whirlagiggate says i well says he i shall go through the gate myself in the course of the morning we may meet somewhere to the eastward and if we do ill bet you a beaver says he that i show you my stern agreed says i and we shook hands upon it thats the whole history of our giving the steamer the slip last night and of my not wishing to let her speak me  but you went into a bay and let her go past you said rose coolly enough as to manner but with great point as to substance was not that a singular way of winning a race  it does seem so miss rose but its all plain enough when understood i found that steam was too much for sails and i stood up into the bay to let them run past us in hopes they would never find out the trick i care as little for a hat as any man but i do care a good deal about having it reported on change that the molly was beat by even a steamer  this ended the discourse for the moment clench again having something to say to his captain in private  how much of that explanation am i to believe and how much disbelieve asked rose the instant she was left alone with harry if it be all invention it was a ready and ingenious story  no part of it is true he no more expected that the steamer would pass through hellgate than i expected it myself there was no bet or race therefore but it was our wish to avoid uncle sams cruiser that was all  and why should you wish any such thing  on my honour i can give you no better reason so far as i am concerned than the fact that wishing to keep clear of her i do not like to be overhauled nor can i tell you why spike is so much in earnest in holding the revenue vessel at arms length i know he dislikes all such craft as a matter of course but i can see no particular reason for it just now a more innocent cargo was never stuck into a vessels hold  what is it  flour and no great matter of that the brig is not half full being just in beautiful ballast trim as if ready for a race i can see no sufficient reason beyond native antipathy why captain spike should wish to avoid any craft for it is humbug his dread of a mexican and least of all here in long island sound all that story about jones is a tub for whales  thank you for the allusion my aunt and myself being the whales  you know i do meancan mean nothing rose that is disrespectful to either yourself or your aunt  rose looked up and she looked pleased then she mused in silence for some time when she again spoke  why have you remained another voyage with such a man harry she asked earnestly  because as his first officer i have had access to your house when i could not have had it otherwise and because i have apprehended that he might persuade mrs budd as he had boasted to me it was his intention to do to make this voyage  rose now looked grateful and deeply grateful did she feel and had reason to feel harry had concealed no portion of his history from her like herself he was a shipmasters child but one better educated and better connected than was customary for the class his father had paid a good deal of attention to the youths early years but had made a seaman of him out of choice the father had lost his all however with his life in a shipwreck and harry was thrown upon his own resources at the early age of twenty he had made one or two voyages as a second mate when chance threw him in spikes way who pleased with some evidences of coolness and skill that he had shown in a foreign port on the occasion of another loss took him as his first officer in which situation he had remained ever since partly from choice and partly from necessity on the other hand rose had a fortune by no means a large one but several thousands in possession from her own father and as many more in reversion from her uncle it was this money taken in connection with the credulous imbecility of the aunt that had awakened the cupidity and excited the hopes of spike after a life of lawless adventure one that had been chequered by every shade of luck he found himself growing old with his brig growing old with him and little left beside his vessel and the sort of half cargo that was in her hold want of means indeed was the reason that the flourbarrels were not more numerous  rose heard mulfords explanation favourably as indeed she heard most of that which came from him but did not renew the discourse spikes conference with the boatswain just then terminating the captain now came aft and began to speak of the performances of his vessel in a way to show that he took great pride in them  we are travelling at the rate of ten knots madam budd he said exultingly and that will take us clear of the land before night shuts in agin montauk is a good place for an offing i ask for no better  shall we then have two offings this voyage captain spike asked rose a little sarcastically if we are in the offing now and are to be in the offing when we reach montauk there must be two such places  rosy dear you amaze me put in the aunt there is no offing until the pilot is discharged and when hes discharged there is nothing but offing its all offing on the sound is the first great change that befalls a vessel as she goes to sea then comes the offing next the pilot is dischargedthenthenwhat comes next captain spike  then the vessel takes her departurean old navigator like yourself madam budd ought not to forget the departure  quite true sir the departure is a very important portion of a seamans life often and often have i heard my poor dear mr budd talk about his departures his departures and his offings and his  landfalls added spike perceiving that the shipmasters relict was a little at fault  thank you sir the hint is quite welcome his landfalls also were often in his mouth  what is a landfall aunty inquired roseit appears a strange term to be used by one who lives on the water  oh there is no end to the curiosities of sailors a landfall my dear means a shipwreck of course to fall on the land and a very unpleasant fall it is when a vessel should keep on the water ive heard of dreadful landfalls in my day in which hundreds of souls have been swept into eternity in an instant  yes yes madam buddthere are such accidents truly and serious things be they to encounter answered spike hemming a little to clear his throat as was much his practice whenever the widow ran into any unusually extravagant blunder yes serious things to encounter but the landfall that i mean is a different sort of thing being as you well know what we say when we come in sight of land ater a vyge or meaning the land we may happen first to see the departure is the beginning of our calculation when we lose sight of the last cape or headland and the landfall closes it by letting us know where we are at the other end of our journey as you probably remember  is there not such a thing as clearing out in navigation asked rose quickly willing to cover a little confusion that was manifest in her aunts manner  not exactly in navigation miss rose but clearing out with honest folk ought to come first and navigation aterwards clearing out means going through the customhouse accordin to law  and the molly swash has cleared out i hope  sartaina more lawful clearance was never given in wall street its for key west and a market i did think of making it havana and a market but portcharges are lightest at key west  then key west is the place to which we are bound  it ought to be agreeable to papers though vessels sometimes miss the ports for which they clear  rose put no more questions and her aunt being conscious that she had not appeared to advantage in the affair of the landfall was also disposed to be silent spike and mulford had their attention drawn to the vessel and the conversation dropped  the reader can readily suppose that the molly swash had not been standing still all this time so far from this she was running down sound with the wind on her quarter or at southwest making great headway as she was close under the south shore or on the island side of the water she was in the vessel had no other motion than that of her speed and the females escaped everything like seasickness for the time being this enabled them to attend to making certain arrangements necessary to their comforts below previously to getting into rough water in acquitting herself of this task rose received much useful advice from josh though his new assistant jack tier turned out to be a prize indeed in the cabins the first was only a steward but the last proved himself not only a handy person of his calling but one full of resourcesa genius in his way josh soon became so sensible of his own inferiority in contributing to the comforts of females that he yielded the entire management of the ladies cabin as a little place that might have been ten feet square was called to his uncouthlooking but really expert deputy jack waddled about below as if born and brought up in such a place and seemed every way fitted for his office in height and in build generally there was a surprising conformity between the widow and the stewards deputy a circumstance which might induce one to think they must often have been in each others way in a space so small though in point of fact jack never ran foul of any one he seemed to avoid this inconvenience by a species of nautical instinct  towards the turn of the day rose had everything arranged and was surprised to find how much room she had made for her aunt and herself by means of jacks hints and how much more comfortable it was possible to be in that small cabin than she had at first supposed  after dinner spike took his siesta he slept in a little stateroom that stood on the starboard side of the quarterdeck quite aft as mulford did in one on the larboard these two staterooms were fixtures but a light deck overhead which connected them shipped and unshipped forming a shelter for the man at the wheel when in its place as well as for the officer of the watch should he see fit to use it in bad weather this sort of cuddy spike termed his coachhouse  the captain had no sooner gone into his stateroom and closed its window movements that were understood by mulford than the latter took occasion to intimate to rose by means of jack tier the state of things on deck when the young man was favoured with the young ladys company  he has turned in for his afternoons nap and will sleep for just one hour blow high or blow low said the mate placing himself at roses side on the trunk which formed the usual seat for those who could presume to take the liberty of sitting down on the quarterdeck its a habit with him and we can count on it with perfect security  his doing so now is a sign that he has no immediate fears of the revenue steamer  the coast is quite clear of her we have taken good looks at every smoke but can see nothing that appears like our late companion she has doubtless gone to the eastward on duty and merely chased us on her road  but why should she chase us at all  because we ran let a dog run or a man run or a cat run ten to one but something starts in chase it is human nature i believe to give chase though i will admit there was something suspicious about that steamers movementsher anchoring off the fort for instance but let her go for the present are you getting things right and to your mind below decks  very much so the cabin is small and the two staterooms the merest drawers that ever were used but by putting everything in its place we have made sufficient room and no doubt shall be comfortable  i am sorry you did not call on me for assistance the mate has a prescriptive right to help stow away  we made out without your services returned rose slightly blushingjack tier as he is called joshs assistant is a very useful person and has been our adviser and manager i want no better for such services  he is a queer fellow all round take him altogether i hardly ever saw so droll a being as thick as hes long with a waddle like a duck a voice that is cracked hair like bristles and knee high the man might make a fortune as a show tom thumb is scarcely a greater curiosity  he is singular in build as you call it returned rose laughing but i can assure you that he is a most excellent fellow in his wayworth a dozen of josh do you know harry that i suspect he has strong feelings towards captain spike though whether of like or dislike friendship or enmity i am at a loss to say  and why do you think that he has any feeling at all i have heard spike say he left the fellow ashore somewhere down on the spanish main or in the islands quite twenty years since but a sailor would scarce carry a grudge so long a time for such a thing as that  i do not knowbut feeling there is and much of it too though whether hostile or friendly i will not undertake to say  ill look to the chap now you tell me this it is a little odd the manner in which he got on board us taken in connection with the company he was in and a discovery may be made here he is however and as i keep the keys of the magazine he can do us no great harm unless he scuttles the brig  magazine is there such a thing here  to be sure there is and ammunition enough in it to keep eight carronades in lively conversation for a couple of hours  a carronade is what you call a gun is it not  a piece of a onebeing somewhat short like your friend jack tier who is shaped a good deal like a carronade  rose smilednay half laughed for harrys pleasantries almost took the character of wit in her eyes but she did not the less pursue her inquiries  guns and where are they if they be on this vessel  do not use such a lubberly expression my dear rose if you respect your fathers profession on a vessel is a newfangled americanism that is neither fish flesh nor redherring as we sailors sayneither english nor greek  what should i say then my wish is not to parade seatalk but to use it correctly when i use it at all  the expression is hardly seatalk as you call it but everyday englishthat is when rightly used on a vessel is no more english than it is nauticalno sailor ever used such an expression  tell me what i ought to say and you will find me a willing if not an apt scholar i am certain of having often read it in the newspapers and that quite lately  ill answer for that and its another proof of its being wrong in a vessel is as correct as in a coach and on a vessel as wrong as can be but you can say on board a vessel though not on the boards of a vessel as mrs budd has it  mr mulford  i beg a thousand pardons rose and will offend no morethough she does make some very queer mistakes  my aunt thinks it an honour to my uncles memory to be able to use the language of his professional life and if she does sometimes make mistakes that are absurd it is with motives so respectable that no sailor should deride them  i am rebuked for ever mrs budd may call the anchor a silver spoon hereafter without my even smiling but if the aunt has this kind remembrance of a seamans life why cannot the niece think equally well of it  perhaps she does returned rose smiling againseeing all its attractions through the claims of captain spike  i think half the danger from him gone now that you seem so much on your guard what an odious piece of deception to persuade mrs budd that you were fast falling into a decline  one so odious that i shall surely quit the brig at the first port we enter or even in the first suitable vessel that we may speak  and mrs buddcould you persuade her to such a course  you scarce know us harry mulford my aunt commands when there is no serious duty to perform but we change places when there is i can persuade her to anything that is right in ten minutes  you might persuade a world cried harry with strong admiration expressed in his countenance after which he began to converse with rose on a subject so interesting to themselves that we do not think it prudent to relate any more of the discourse forgetting all about the guns  about four oclock of a fine summers afternoon the swash went through the race on the best of the ebb and with a staggering southwest wind her movement by the land just at that point could not have been less than at the rate of fifteen miles in the hour spike was in high spirits for his brig had got on famously that day and there was nothing in sight to the eastward he made no doubt as he had told his mate that the steamer had gone into the vineyard sound and that she was bound over the shoals  they want to make political capital out of her he added using one of the slang phrases that the business habits of the american people are so rapidly incorporating with the common language of the countrythey want to make political capital out of her harry and must show her off to the boston folk who are full of notions well let them turn her to as much account in that way as they please so long as they keep her clear of the molly your sarvant madam buddaddressing the widow who just at that moment came on decka fine aternoon and likely to be a clear night to run off the coast in  clear nights are desirable and most of all at sea captain spike returned the relict in her best complacent manner whether it be to run off a coast or to run on a coast in either case a clear night or a bright moon must be useful  captain spike rolled his tobacco over in his mouth and cast a furtive glance at the mate but he did not presume to hazard any further manifestations of his disposition to laugh  yes madam budd he answered it is quite as you say and i am only surprised where you have picked up so much of what i call useful nautical knowledge  we live and learn sir you will recollect that this is not my first voyage having made one before and that i passed a happy happy thirty years in the society of my poor dear husband roses uncle one must have been dull indeed not to have picked up from such a companion much of a calling that was so dear to him and the particulars of which were so very dear to him he actually gave me lessons in the sea dialect as he called it which probably is the true reason i am so accurate and general in my acquisitions  yes madam buddyeshemyou areyes you are wonderful in that way we shall soon get an offing now madam buddyes soon get an offing now  and take in our departure captain spike added the widow with a very intelligent smile  yes take our departure montauk is yonder just coming in sight only some three hours run from this spot when we get there the open ocean will lie before us and give me the open sea and ill not call the king my uncle  was he your uncle captain spike  only in a philanthropic way madam budd yes let us get a good offing and a rapping togallant breeze and i do not think i should care much for two of uncle sams newfashioned revenue craft one on each side of me  how delightful do i find such conversation rose its as much like your poor dear uncles as one pea is like another yes he used to say too let me only have one on each side of me and a wrapper round the topgallant sail to hold the breeze and id not call the king my uncle now i think of it he used to talk about the king as his uncle too  it was all talk aunty he had no uncle and what is more he had no king  thats quite true miss rose rejoined spike attempting a bow which ended in a sort of jerk it is not very becoming in us republicans to be talking of kings but a habit is a habit our forefathers had kings and we drop into their ways without thinking of what we are doing foretopgallant yard there  sir  keep a bright lookout ahead let me know the instant you make anything in the neighbourhood of montauk  ay ay sir  as i was saying madam budd we seamen drop into our forefathers ways now when i was a youngster i remember one day that we fell in with a ketchyou know miss rose what a ketch is i suppose  i have not the least notion of it sir  rosy you amaze me exclaimed the auntand you a shipmasters niece and a shipmasters daughter a catch is a trick that sailors have when they quiz landsmen  yes madam budd yes we have them sort of catches too but i now mean the vessel with a peculiar rig which we call a ketch you know  is it the fulljigger or the halfjigger sort that you mean  spike could hardly stand this and he had to hail the topgallantyard again in order to keep the command of his muscles for he saw by the pretty frown that was gathering on the brow of rose that she was regarding the matter a little seriously luckily the answer of the man on the yard diverted the mind of the widow from the subject and prevented the necessity of any reply  theres a light of course sir on montauk is there not captain spike demanded the seaman who was aloft  to be sure there isevery headland hereabouts has its light and some have two  ay ay sirits that which puzzles me i think i see one lighthouse and im not certain but i see two  if there is anything like a second it must be a sail montauk has but one light  mulford sprang into the forerigging and in a minute was on the yard he soon came down and reported the lighthouse in sight with the afternoons sun shining on it but no sail near  my poor dear mr budd used to tell a story of his being cast away on a lighthouse in the east indies put in the relict as soon as the mate had ended his report which always affected me it seems there were three ships of them together in an awful tempest directly off the land  that was comfortable any how cried spikeif it must blow hard let it come off the land say i  yes sir it was directly off the land as my poor husband always said which made it so much the worse you must know rosy though captain spikes gallant spirit would rather encounter danger than not it blew what they call a hyson in the chinese seas  a what auntyhyson is the name of a tea you know  a hyson im pretty sure it was and i suppose the wind is named after the tea or the tea after the wind  the ladies do get in a gale sometimes over their tea said spike gallantly but i rather think madam budd must mean a typhoon  thats ita typhoon or a hysonthere is not much difference between them you see well it blew a typhoon and they are always mortal to somebody this my poor mr budd well knew and he had set his chronometer for that typhoon  excuse me aunty it was the barometer that he was watchingthe chronometer was his watch  so it washis watch on deck was his chronometer i declare i am forgetting a part of my education do you know the use of a chronometer now rose you have seen your uncles often but do you know how he used it  not in the least aunty my uncle often tried to explain it but i never could understand him  it must have been then because captain budd did not try to make himself comprehended said mulford for i feel certain nothing would be easier than to make you understand the uses of the chronometer  i should like to learn it from you mr mulford answered the charming girl with an emphasis so slight on the you that no one observed it but the mate but which was clear enough to him and caused every nerve to thrill  i can attempt it answered the young man if it be agreeable to mrs budd who would probably like to hear it herself  certainly mr mulford though i fancy you can say little on such a subject that i have not often heard already from my poor dear mr budd  this was not very encouraging truly but rose continuing to look interested the mate proceeded  the use of the chronometer is to ascertain the longitude said harry and the manner of doing it is simply this a chronometer is nothing more nor less than a watch made with more care than usual so as to keep the most accurate time they are of all sizes from that of a clock down to this which i wear in my fob and which is a watch in size and appearance now the nautical almanacs are all calculated to some particular meridian  yes interrupted the relict mr budd had a great deal to say about meridians  that of london or greenwich being the meridian used by those who use the english almanacs and those of paris or st petersburg by the french and russians each of these places has an observatory and chronometers that are kept carefully regulated the year round every chronometer is set by the regulator of the particular observatory or place to which the almanac used is calculated  how wonderfully like my poor dear mr budd all this is rosy meridians and calculated and almanacs i could almost think i heard your uncle entertaining me with one of his nautical discussions i declare  now the sun rises earlier in places east than in places west of us  it rises earlier in the summer but later in the winter everywhere mr mulford  yes my dear madam but the sun rises earlier every day in london than it does in new york  that is impossible said the widow dogmaticallywhy should not the sun rise at the same time in england and america  because england is east of america aunty the sun does not move you know but only appears to us to move because the earth turns round from west to east which causes those who are farthest east to see it first that is what mr mulford means  rose has explained it perfectly well continued the mate now the earth is divided into 360 degrees and the day is divided into 24 hours if 360 be divided by 24 the quotient will be 15 if follows that for each fifteen degrees of longitude there is a difference of just one hour in the rising of the sun all over the earth where it rises at all new york is near five times 15 degrees west of greenwich and the sun consequently rises five hours later at new york than at london  there must be a mistake in this rosy said the relict in a tone of desperate resignation in which the desire to break out in dissent was struggling oddly enough with an assumed dignity of deportment ive always heard that the people of london are some of the latest in the world then ive been in london and know that the sun rises in new york in december a good deal earlier than it does in london by the clockyes by the clock  true enough by the clock mrs budd for london is more than ten degrees north of new york and the farther north you go the later the sun rises in winter and the earlier in summer  the relict merely shrugged her shoulders as much as to say that she knew no such thing but rose who had been well taught raised her serene eyes to her aunts face and mildly saidall true aunty and that is owing to the fact that the earth is smaller at each end than in the middle  fiddle faddle with your middles and ends roseive been in london dear and know that the sun rises later there than in new york in the month of december and that i know by the clock i tell you  the reason of which is resumed mulford because the clocks of each place keep the time of that place now it is different with the chronometers they are set in the observatory of greenwich and keep the time of greenwich this watch chronometer was set there only six months since and this time as you see is near nine oclock when in truth it is only about four oclock here where we are  i wonder you keep such a watch mr mulford  i keep it returned the mate smiling because i know it to keep good time it has the greenwich time and as your watch has the new york time by comparing them together it is quite easy to find the longitude of new york  do you then keep watches to compare with your chronometers asked rose with interest  certainly not as that would require a watch for every separate part of the ocean and then we should only get known longitudes it would be impracticable and load a ship with nothing but watches what we do is this we set our chronometers at greenwich and thus keep the greenwich true time wherever we go the greatest attention is paid to the chronometers to see that they receive no injuries and usually there are two and often more of them to compare one with another in order to see that they go well when in the middle of the ocean for instance we find the true time of the day at that spot by ascertaining the height of the sun this we do by means of our quadrants or sextants for as the sun is always in the zenith at twelve oclock nothing is easier than to do this when the sun can be seen and an arc of the heavens measured at the instant the height of the sun is ascertained by one observer he calls to another who notes the time on the chronometer the difference in these two times or that of the chronometer and that of the sun gives the distance in degrees and minutes between the longitude of greenwich and that of the place on the ocean where the observer is and that gives him his longitude if the difference is three hours and twenty minutes in time the distance from greenwich is fifty degrees of longitude because the sun rises three hours and twenty minutes sooner in london than in the fiftieth degree of west longitude  a watch is a watch rosy put in the aunt doggedlyand time is timewhen its four oclock at our house its four oclock at your aunt spragues and its so all over the world the world may turn roundill not deny it for your uncle often said as much as that but it cannot turn in the way mr mulford says or we should all fall off it at night when it was bottom upwards no sir no youve started wrong my poor dear late mr budd always admitted that the world turned round as the books say but when i suggested to him the difficulty of keeping things in their places with the earth upside down he acknowledged candidlyfor he was all candour i must say that for himand owned that he had made a discovery by means of his barometer which showed that the world did not turn round in the way you describe or by rolling over but by whirling about as one turns in a dance you must remember your uncles telling me this rose  rose did remember her uncles telling her aunt this as well as a great many other similar prodigies captain budd had married his silly wife on account of her pretty face and when the novelty of that was over he often amused himself by inventing all sorts of absurdities to amuse both her and himself among other things rose well remembered his quieting her aunts scruples about falling off the earth by laying down the theory that the world did not roll over but whirl round but rose did not answer the question  objects are kept in their places on the earth by means of attraction mulford ventured to say with a great deal of humility of manner i believe it is thought there is no up or down except as we go from or towards the earth and that would make the position of the last a matter of indifference as respects objects keeping on it  attractions are great advantages i will own sir especially to our sex i think it will be acknowledged there has been no want of them in our family any more than there has been of sense and information sense and information we pride ourselves on attractions being gifts from god we try to think less of them but all the attractions in the world could not keep rosy here from falling off the earth did it ever come bottom upwards and mercy on me where would she fall to  mulford saw that argument was useless and he confined his remarks during the rest of the conversation to showing rose the manner in which the longitude of a place might be ascertained with the aid of the chronometer and by means of observations to get the true time of day at the particular place itself rose was so quickwitted and already so well instructed as easily to comprehend the principles the details being matters of no great moment to one of her sex and habits but mrs budd remained antagonist to the last she obstinately maintained that twelve oclock was twelve oclock or if there was any difference london hours were notoriously later than those of new york  against such assertions arguments were obviously useless and mulford perceiving that rose began to fidget had sufficient tact to change the conversation altogether  and still the molly swash kept in swift motion montauk was by this time abeam and the little brigantine began to rise and fall on the long swells of the atlantic which now opened before her in one vast sheet of green and rolling waters on her right lay the termination of long island a low rocky cape with its light and a few fields in tillage for the uses of those who tended it it was the lands end of new york while the island that was heaving up out of the sea at a distance of about twenty miles to the eastward was the property of rhode island being called blok island between the two the swash shaped her course for the ocean  spike had betrayed uneasiness as his brig came up with montauk but the coast seemed clear with not even a distant sail in sight and he came aft rubbing his hands with delight speaking cheerfully  all right mr mulford he criedeverything shipshape and bristerfashionnot even a smack fishing hereaway which is a little remarkable hawhat are you staring at over the quarter there  look here sir directly in the wake of the setting sun which we are now opening from the landis not that a sail  sail impossible sir what should a sail be doing in there so near montaukno man ever saw a sail there in his life its a spot in the sun madam budd that my mate has got a glimpse at and sailorlike he mistakes it for a sail hahahayes harry its a spot in the sun  it is a spot on the sun as you say but its a spot made by a vesseland here is a boat pulling towards her might and main going from the light as if carrying news  it was no longer possible for spikes hopes to deceive him there was a vessel sure enough though when first seen it was so directly in a line with the fiery orb of the setting sun as to escape common observation as the brig went foaming on towards the ocean however the black speck was soon brought out of the range of the orb of day and spikes glass was instantly levelled at it  just as one might expect mr mulford cried the captain lowering his glass and looking aloft to see what could be done to help his craft along a bloody revenue cutter as im a wicked sinner there she lies sir within musket shot of the shore hid behind the point as it might be in waiting for us with her head to the southward her helm hard down topsail aback and foresail brailed as wicked looking a thing as free trade and sailors rights ever ran from my life on it sir shes been put in that precise spot in waiting for the molly to arrive you see as we stand on it places her as handsomely to windward of us as the heart of man could desire  it is a revenue cutter sir now shes out of the suns wake that is plain enough and that is her boat which has been sent to the light to keep a lookout for us well sir shes to windward but we have everything set for our course and as we are fairly abeam she must be a great traveller to overhaul us  i thought these bloody cutters were all down in the gulf growled the captain casting his eyes aloft again to see that everything drew im sure the newspapers have mentioned as many as twenty that are down there and here is one lying behind montauk like a snake in the grass  at any rate by the time he gets his boat up we shall get the start of himay there he fills and falls off to go and meet her hell soon be after us captain spike at racing speed  everything occurred as those two mariners had foreseen the revenue cutter one of the usual foretopsail schooners that are employed in that service up and down the coast had no sooner hoisted up her boat than she made sail a little off the wind on a line to close with the swash as for the brig she had hauled up to an easy bowline as she came round montauk and was now standing off south southeast still having the wind at southwest the weatherly position of the cutter enabled her to steer rather more than one point freer at the commencement of this chase the vessels were about a mile and a half apart a distance too great to enable the cutter to render the light guns she carried available and it was obvious from the first that everything depended on speed and speed it was truly both vessels fairly flying the molly swash having at last met with something very like her match half an hour satisfied both spike and mulford that by giving the cutter the advantage of one point in a freer wind she would certainly get alongside of them and the alternative was therefore to keep off  a starn chase is a long chase all the world over cried spikeedge away sir edge away sir and bring the cutter well on our quarter  this order was obeyed but to the surprise of those in the swash the cutter did not exactly follow though she kept off a little more her object seemed to be to maintain her weatherly position and in this manner the two vessels ran on for an hour longer until the swash had made most of the distance between montauk and blok island objects were even becoming dimly visible on the last and the light on the point was just becoming visible a lone star above a waste of desert the sun having been down now fully a quarter of an hour and twilight beginning to draw the curtain of night over the waters  a craft under blok shouted the lookout that was still kept aloft as a necessary precaution  what sort of a craft demanded spike fiercely for the very mention of a sail at that moment aroused all his ire arnt you making a frigate out of an appleorchard  its the steamer sir i can now see her smoke shes just clearing the land on the south side of the island and seems to be coming round to meet us  a long low eloquent whistle from the captain succeeded this announcement the man aloft was right it was the steamer sure enough and she had been lying hid behind blok island exactly as her consort had been placed behind montauk in waiting for their chase to arrive the result was to put the molly swash in exceeding jeopardy and the reason why the cutter kept so well to windward was fully explained to pass out to sea between these two craft was hopeless there remained but a single alternative from capture by one or by the otherand that spike adopted instantly he kept his brig dead away setting studdingsails on both sides this change of course brought the cutter nearly aft or somewhat on the other quarter and laid the brigs head in a direction to carry her close to the northern coast of the island but the principal advantage was gained over the steamer which could not keep off without first standing a mile or two or even more to the westward in order to clear the land this was so much clear gain to the swash which was running off at racing speed on a northeast course while her most dangerous enemy was still heading to the westward as for the cutter she kept away but it was soon apparent that the brig had the heels of her dead before the wind  darkness now began to close around the three vessels the brig and the schooner soon becoming visible to each other principally by means of their nightglasses though the steamers position could be easily distinguished by means of her flaming chimney this latter vessel stood to the westward for a quarter of an hour when her commander appeared to become suddenly conscious of the ground he was losing and he wore short round and went off before the wind under steam and canvas intending to meet the chase off the northern side of the island the very person who had hailed the swash as she was leaving the wharf who had passed her in hellgate with jack tier in his boat and who had joined her off throgmortons was now on her deck urging her commander by every consideration not to let the brig escape it was at his suggestion that the course was changed nervous and eager to seize the brig he prevailed on the commander of the steamer to alter his course had he done no more than this all might have been well but so exaggerated were his notions of the swashs sailing that instead of suffering the steamer to keep close along the eastern side of the island he persuaded her commander of the necessity of standing off a long distance to the northward and eastward with a view to get ahead of the chase this was not bad advice were there any certainly that spike would stand on of which however he had no intention  the night set in dark and cloudy and the instant that spike saw by means of the flaming chimney that the steamer had wore and was going to the eastward of blok his plan was laid calling to mulford he communicated it to him and was glad to find that his intelligent mate was of his own way of thinking the necessary orders were given accordingly and everything was got ready for its execution  in the meantime the two revenue craft were much in earnest the schooner was one of the fastest in the service and had been placed under montauk as described in the confident expectation of her being able to compete with even the molly swash successfully more especially if brought upon a bowline her commander watched the receding form of the brig with the closest attention until it was entirely swallowed up in the darkness under the land towards which he then sheered himself in order to prevent the swash from hauling up and turning to windward close in under the shadow of the island against this manoeuvre however the cutter had now taken an effectual precaution and her people were satisfied that escape in that way was impossible  on the other hand the steamer was doing very well driven by the breeze and propelled by her wheels away she went edging further and further from the island as the person from the customhouse succeeded as it might be inch by inch in persuading the captain of the necessity of his so doing at length a sail was dimly seen ahead and then no doubt was entertained that the brig had got to the northward and eastward of them half an hour brought the steamer alongside of this sail which turned out to be a brig that had come over the shoals and was beating into the ocean on her way to one of the southern ports her captain said there had nothing passed to the eastward  round went the steamer and in went all her canvas ten minutes later the lookout saw a sail to the westward standing before the wind odd as it might seem the steamers people now fancied they were sure of the swash there she was coming directly for them with squared yards the distance was short or a vessel could not have been seen by that light and the two craft were soon near each other a gun was actually cleared on board the steamer ere it was ascertained that the stranger was the schooner it was now midnight and nothing was in sight but the coasting brig reluctantly the revenue people gave the matter up the molly swash having again eluded them though by means unknown  chapter iv    leander dived for love leucadias cliff   the lesbian sappho leapd from in a miff   to punish phaon icarus went dead   because the wax did not continue stiff   and had he minded what his father said   he had not given a name unto his watery bed  sands  we must now advance the time several days and change the scene to a distant part of the ocean within the tropics indeed the females had suffered slight attacks of seasickness and recovered from them and the brig was safe from all her pursuers the manner of spikes escape was simple enough and without any necromancy while the steamer on the one hand was standing away to the northward and eastward in order to head him off and the schooner was edging in with the island in order to prevent his beating up to windward of it within its shadows the brig had run close round the northern margin of the land and hauled up to leeward of the island passing between it and the steamer all this time her movements were concealed from the schooner by the island itself and from the steamer by its shadow and dark background aided by the distance by making short tacks this expedient answered perfectly well and at the very moment when the two revenue vessels met at midnight about three leagues to leeward of blok island the brigantine molly swash was just clearing its most weatherly point on the larboard tack and coming out exactly at the spot where the steamer was when first seen that afternoon spike stood to the westward until he was certain of having the island fairly between him and his pursuers when he went about and filled away on his course running out to sea again on an easy bowline at sunrise the next day he was fifty miles to the southward and eastward of montauk the schooner was going into new london her officers and people quite chopfallen and the steamer was paddling up the sound her captain being fully persuaded that the runaways had returned in the direction from which they had come and might yet be picked up in that quarter  the weather was light just a week after the events related in the close of the last chapter by this time the brig had got within the influence of the trades and it being the intention of spike to pass to the southward of cuba he had so far profited by the westerly winds as to get well to the eastward of the mona passage the strait through which he intended to shape his course on making the islands early on that morning mrs budd had taken her seat on the trunk of the cabin with a complacent air and arranged her netting some slight passages of gallantry on the part of the captain having induced her to propose netting him a purse biddy was going to and fro in quest of silks and needles her mistress having become slightly capricious in her tastes of late and giving her on all such occasions at least a double allowance of occupation as for rose she sat reading beneath the shade of the coachhouse deck while the handsome young mate was within three feet of her working up his logarithms but within the sanctuary of his own stateroom the open door and window of which however gave him every facility he could desire to relieve his mathematics by gazing at the sweet countenance of his charming neighbor jack tier and josh were both passing to and fro as is the wont of stewards between the camboose and the cabin the breakfast table being just then in the course of preparation in all other respects always excepting the man at the wheel who stood within a fathom of rose spike had the quarterdeck to himself and did not fail to pace its weatherside with an air that denoted the master and owner after exhibiting his sturdy but short person in this manner to the admiring eyes of all beholders for some time the captain suddenly took a seat at the side of the relict and dropped into the following discourse  the weather is moderate madam budd quite moderate observed spike a sentimental turn coming over him at the moment what i call moderate and agreeable  so much the better for us the ladies are fond of moderation sir  not in admiration madam buddha ha ha no not in admiration immoderation is what they like when it comes to that im a single man but i know that the ladies like admirationmind where youre sheering to the captain said interrupting himself a little fiercely considering the nature of the subject in consequence of jack tiers having trodden on his toe in passingor ill teach you the navigation of the quarterdeck mr burgoo  moderationmoderation my good captain said the simpering relict as to admiration i confess that it is agreeable to us ladies more especially when it comes from gentlemen of sense and intelligence and experience  rose fidgeted having heard every word that was said and her face flushed for she doubted not that harrys ears were as good as her own as for the man at the wheel he turned the tobacco over in his mouth hitched up his trousers and appeared interested though somewhat mystifiedthe conversation was what he would have termed talking dictionary and he had some curiosity to learn how the captain would work his way out of it it is probable that spike himself had some similar gleamings of the difficulties of his position for he looked a little troubled though still resolute it was the first time he had ever lain yardarm and yardarm with a widow and he had long entertained a fancy that such a situation was trying to the best of men  yes madam budd yes he said experence and sense carry weight with em wherever they go im glad to find that you entertain these just notions of us gentlemen and make a difference between boys and them thats seen and known experence for my part i count youngsters under forty as so much lumber about decks as to any comfort and calculations in keepin a family as a family ought to be kept  mrs budd looked interested but she remained silent on hearing this remark as became her sex  every man ought to settle in life some time or other madam budd accordin to my notion though no man ought to be in a boyish haste about it continued the captain now in my own case ive been so busy all my youthnot that im very old now but im no boybut all my younger days have been passed in trying to make things meet in a way to put any lady who might take a fancy to me  oh captainthat is too strong the ladies do not take fancies for gentlemen but the gentlemen take fancies for ladies  well well you know what i mean madam budd and so long as the parties understand each other a word dropped or a word put into a charterparty makes it neither stronger nor weaker theres a time howsomever in every mans life when he begins to think of settling down and of considerin himself as a sort of mooringchain for children and the likes of them to make fast to such is my natur i will own and ever since ive got to be intimate in your family madam budd that sentiment has grown stronger and stronger in me till it has got to be uppermost in all my idees bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh as a body might say  mrs budd now looked more than interested for she looked a little confused and rose began to tremble for her aunt it was evident that the parties most conspicuous in this scene were not at all conscious that they were overheard the intensity of their attention being too much concentrated on what was passing to allow of any observation without their own narrow circle what may be thought still more extraordinary but what in truth was the most natural of all each of the parties was so intently bent on his or her own train of thought that neither in the least suspected any mistake  grown with your growth and strengthened with your strength rejoined the relict smiling kindly enough on the captain to have encouraged a much more modest man than he happened to be  yes madam buddvery just that remark grown with my strength and strengthened with my growth as one might say though ive not done much at growing for a good many years your late husband captain budd often remarked how very early i got my growth and rated me as an ablebodied hand when most lads think it an honour to be placed among the ornaries  the relict looked grave and she wondered at any mans being so singular as to allude to a first husband at the very moment he was thinking of offering himself for a second as for herself she had not uttered as many words in the last four years as she had uttered in that very conversation without making some allusion to her poor dear mr budd the reader is not to do injustice to the captains widow however by supposing for a moment that she was actually so weak as to feel any tenderness for a man like spike which would be doing a great wrong to both her taste and her judgment as rose well knew even while most annoyed by the conversation she could not but overhear all that influenced the good relict was that besetting weakness of her sex which renders admiration so universally acceptable and predisposes a female as it might be to listen to a suitor with indulgence and some little show of kindness even when resolute to reject him as for rose to own the truth her aunt did not give her a thought as yet notwithstanding spike was getting to be so sentimental  yes your late excellent and honourable consort always said that i got my growth sooner than any youngster he ever fell in with resumed the captain after a short pause exciting fresh wonder in his companion that he would persist in lugging in the dear departed so very unseasonably i am a great admirer of all the budd family my good lady and only wish my connection with it had never tarminated if tarminated it can be called  it need not be terminated captain spike so long as friendship exists in the human heart  ay so it is always with you ladies when a man is bent on suthin closer and more interestin like youre for putting it off on friendship now friendship is good enough in its way madam budd but friendship is nt love  love echoed the widow fairly starting though she looked down at her netting and looked as confused as she knew how that is a very decided word captain spike and should never be mentioned to a womans ear lightly  so the captain now appeared to think too for no sooner had he delivered himself of the important monosyllable than he left the widows side and began to pace the deck as it might be to moderate his own ardour as for rose she blushed if her more practised aunt did not while harry mulford laughed heartily taking good care however not to be heard the man at the wheel turned the tobacco again gave his trousers another hitch and wondered anew whither the skipper was bound but the drollest manifestation of surprise came from josh the steward who was passing along the leeside of the quarterdeck with a teapot in his hand when the energetic manner of the captain sent the words friendship is nt love to his ears this induced him to stop for a single instant and to cast a wondering glance behind him after which he moved on toward the galley mumbling as he wentlub what he want of lub or what lub want of him well i do tink captain spike bowse his jib out pretty arly dis mornin  captain spike soon got over the effects of his effort and the confusion of the relict did not last any material length of time as the former had gone so far however he thought the present an occasion as good as another to bring matters to a crisis  our sentiments sometimes get to be so strong madam budd resumed the lover as he took his seat again on the trunk that they run away with us men is liable to be run away with as well as ladies i once had a ship run away with me and a pretty time we had of it did you ever hear of a ships running away with her people madam budd just as your horse ran away with your buggy  i suppose i must have heard of such things sir my education having been so maritime though just at this moment i cannot recall an instance when my horse ran away the buggy was capasided did your vessel capaside on the occasion you mention  no madam budd no the ship was off the wind at the time i mean and vessels do not capsize when off the wind ill tell you how it happened we was a scuddin under a goosewing foresail  yes yes interrupted the relict eagerly ive often heard of that sail which is small and used only in tempests  heavy weather madam buddonly in heavy weather  it is amazing to me captain how you seamen manage to weigh the weather i have often heard of light weather and heavy weather but never fairly understood the manner of weighing it  why we do make out to ascertain the difference replied the captain a little puzzled for an answer and i suppose it must be by means of the barometer which goes up and down like a pair of scales but the time i mean we was a scuddin under a goosewing foresail  a sail made of gooses wings and a beautiful object it must be like some of the caps and cloaks that come from the islands which are all of feathers and charming objects are they i beg pardonyou had your gooses wings spread  yes madam budd yes we was steering for a mediterranean port intending to clear a molehead when a sea took us under the larboardquarter gave us such a sheer toport as sent our cathead agin a spile and raked away the chainplates of the topmast backstays bringing down all the forrard hamper about our ears  this description produced such a confusion in the mind of the widow that she was glad when it came to an end as for the captain fearful that the gooses wings might be touched upon again he thought it wisest to attempt another flight on those of cupid  as i was sayin madam budd friendship is nt love no not a bit of it friendship is a common sort of feelin but love as you must know by experence madam budd is an uncommon sort of feelin  fie captain spike gentlemen should never allude to ladies knowing any thing about love ladies respect and admire and esteem and have a regard for gentlemen but it is almost too strong to talk about their love  yes madam budd yes i dare say it is so and ought to be so and i ask pardon for having said as much as i did but my love for your niece is of so animated and lastin a natur that i scarce know what i did say  captain spike you amaze me i declare i can hardly breathe for astonishment my niece surely you do not mean rosy  who else should i mean my love for miss rose is so very decided and animated i tell you madam budd that i will not answer for the consequences should you not consent to her marryin me  i can scarce believe my ears you stephen spike and an old friend of her uncles wishing to marry his niece  just so madam budd thats it to a shavin the regard i have for the whole family is so great that nothin less than the hand of miss rose in marriage can what i call mitigate my feelins  now the relict had not one spark of tenderness herself in behalf of spike while she did love rose better than any human being her own self excepted but she had viewed all the sentiment of that morning and all the fine speeches of the captain very differently from what the present state of things told her she ought to have viewed them and she felt the mortification natural to her situation the captain was so much bent on the attainment of his own object that he saw nothing else and was even unconscious that his extraordinary and somewhat loud discourse had been overheard least of all did he suspect that his admiration had been mistaken and that in what he called courtin the niece he had been all the while courtin the aunt but little apt as she was to discover any thing mrs budd had enough of her sexs discernment in a matter of this sort to perceive that she had fallen into an awkward mistake and enough of her sexs pride to resent it taking her work in her hand she left her seat and descended to the cabin with quite as much dignity in her manner as it was in the power of one of her height and build to express what is the most extraordinary neither she nor spike ever ascertained that their whole dialogue had been overheard spike continued to pace the quarterdeck for several minutes scarce knowing what to think of the relicts manner when his attention was suddenly drawn to other matters by the familiar cry of sailho  this was positively the first vessel with which the molly swash had fallen in since she lost sight of two or three craft that had passed her in the distance as she left the american coast as usual this cry brought all hands on deck and mulford out of his stateroom  it has been stated already that the brig was just beginning to feel the trades and it might have been added to see the mountains of san domingo the winds had been variable for the last day or two and they still continued light and disposed to be unsteady ranging from northeast to southeast with a preponderance in favour of the first point at the cry of sailho everybody looked in the indicated direction which was west a little northerly but for a long time without success the cry had come from aloft and mulford went up as high as the foretop before he got any glimpse of the stranger at all he had slung a glass and spike was unusually anxious to know the result of his examination  well mr mulford what do you make of her he called out as soon as the mate announced that he saw the strange vessel  wait a moment sir till i get a lookshes a long way off and hardly visible  well sir well  i can only see the heads of her topgallant sails she seems a ship steering to the southward with as many kites flying as an indiaman in the trades she looks as if she were carrying royal stunsails sir  the devil she does such a chap must not only be in a hurry but he must be stronghanded to give himself all this trouble in such light and varable winds are his yards squareis he manofwarish  theres no telling sir at this distance though i rather think its stunsails that i see go down and get your breakfast and in half an hour ill give a better account of him  this was done mrs budd appearing at the table with great dignity in her manner although she had so naturally supposed that spikes attentions had been intended for herself she was rather mortified than hurt on discovering her mistake her appetite consequently was not impaired though her stomach might have been said to be very full the meal passed off without any scene notwithstanding and spike soon reappeared on deck still masticating the last mouthful like a man in a hurry and a good deal  l amricaine mulford saw his arrival and immediately levelled his glass again  well what news now sir called out the captain you must have a better chance at him by this time for i can see the chap from off the coachhouse here  ay ay sir hes a bit nearer certainly i should say that craft is a ship under stunsails looking to the eastward of south and that there are caps with gold bands on her quarterdeck  how low down can you see her demanded spike in a voice of thunder  so emphatic and remarkable was the captains manner in putting this question that the mate cast a look of surprise beneath him ere he answered it a look with the glass succeeded when the reply was given  ay ay sir there can be no mistakeits a cruiser you may depend on it i can see the heads of her topsails now and they are so square and symmetrical that gold bands are below beyond all doubt  perhaps hes a frenchmanjohnny crapaud keeps cruisers in these seas as well as the rest onem  johnny crapauds craft dont spread such arms sir the ship is either english or american and hes heading for the mona passage as well as ourselves  come down sir come downtheres work to be done as soon as you have breakfasted  mulford did come down and he was soon seated at the table with both josh and jack tier for attendants the aunt and the niece were in their own cabin a few yards distant with the door open  what a fusse capin make bout dat sail grumbled josh who had been in the brig so long that he sometimes took liberties with even spike himself what good he tink twill do to measure him inch by inch byem by he get alongside and den e ladies even can tell all about him  he natrally wishes to know who gets alongside put in tier somewhat apologetically  what matter dat all sort of folk get alongside of molly swash and what good it do em yoh yoh yoh i do rememer sich times vide ole hussy  what old hussy do you mean demanded jack tier a little fiercely and in a way to draw mulfords eyes from the profile of roses face to the visages of his two attendants  come come gentlemen if you please recollect where you are interrupted the mate authoritatively you are not now squabbling in your galley but are in the cabin what is it to you tier if josh does call the brig an old hussy she is old as we all know and years are respectable and as for her being a hussy that is a term of endearment sometimes ive heard the captain himself call the molly a hussy fifty times and he loves her as he does the apple of his eye  this interference put an end to the gathering storm as a matter of course and the two disputants shortly after passed on deck no sooner was the coast clear than rose stood in the door of her own cabin  do you think the strange vessel is an american she asked eagerly  it is impossible to sayenglish or american i make no doubt but why do you inquire  but my aunt and myself desire to quit the brig and if the stranger should prove to be an american vessel of war might not the occasion be favourable  and what reason can you give for desiring to do so  what signifies a reason answered rose with spirit spike is not our master and we can come and go as we may see fit  but a reason must be given to satisfy the commander of the vessel of war craft of that character are very particular about the passengers they receive nor would it be altogether wise in two unprotected females to go on board a cruiser unless in a case of the most obvious necessity  will not what has passed this morning be thought a sufficient reason added rose drawing nearer to the mate and dropping her voice so as not to be heard by her aunt  mulford smiled as he gazed at the earnest but attractive countenance of his charming companion  and who could tell it or how could it be told would the commander of a vessel of war incur the risk of receiving such a person as yourself on board his vessel for the reason that the master of the craft she was in when he fell in with her desired to marry her  rose appeared vexed but she was at once made sensible that it was not quite as easy to change her vessel at sea as to step into a strange door in a town she drew slowly back into her own cabin silent and thoughtful her aunt pursuing her netting the whole time with an air of dignified industry  well mr mulford well called out spike at the head of the cabin stairs what news from the coffee  all ready sir answered the mate exchanging significant glances with rose i shall be up in a moment  that moment soon came and mulford was ready for duty while below spike had caused certain purchases to be got aloft and the mainhatch was open and the men collected around it in readiness to proceed with the work harry asked no questions for the preparations told him what was about to be done but passing below he took charge of the duty there while the captain superintended the part that was conducted on deck in the course of the next hour eight twelvepound carronades were sent up out of the hold and mounted in as many of the ports which lined the bulwarks of the brigantine the men seemed to be accustomed to the sort of work in which they were now engaged and soon had their light batteries in order and ready for service in the mean time the two vessels kept on their respective courses and by the time the guns were mounted there was a sensible difference in their relative positions the stranger had drawn so near the brigantine as to be very obvious from the latters deck while the brigantine had drawn so much nearer to the islands of san domingo and porto rico as to render the opening between them the wellknown mona passage distinctly visible  of all this spike appeared to be fully aware for he quitted the work several times before it was finished in order to take a look at the stranger and at the land when the batteries were arranged he and mulford each provided with a glass gave a few minutes to a more deliberate examination of the first  thats the mona ahead of us said the captain of that there can be no question and a very pretty landfall youve made of it harry ill allow you to be as good a navigator as floats  nevertheless sir you have not seen fit to let me know whither the brig is really bound this voyage  no matter for that young manno matter as yet all in good time when i tell you to lay your course for the mona you can lay your course for the mona and as soon as we are through the passage ill let you know what is wanted nextif that bloody chap who is nearing us will let me  and why should any vessel wish to molest us on our passage captain spike  why sure enough its wartimes you know and wartimes always bring trouble to the traderthough it sometimes brings profit too  as spike concluded he gave his mate a knowing wink which the other understood to mean that he expected himself some of the unusual profit to which he alluded mulford did not relish this secret communication for the past had induced him to suspect the character of the trade in which his commander was accustomed to engage without making any sort of reply or encouraging the confidence by even a smile he levelled his glass at the stranger as did spike the instant he ceased to grin  thats one of uncle sams fellows exclaimed the captain dropping the glass id swear to the chap in any admiralty court on arth  t is a vessel of war out of all doubt returned the mate and under a cloud of canvas i can make out the heads of her courses now and see that she is carrying hard for a craft that is almost closehauled  ay ay no merchantmen keeps his light stunsails set as near the wind as that fellows going hes a big chap tooa frigate at least by his canvas  i do not know sirthey build such heavy corvettes nowadays that i should rather take her for one of them they tell me ships are now sent to sea which mount only twoandtwenty guns but which measure quite a thousand tons  with thunderin batteries of course  with short thirtytwos and a few rapping sixtyeight paixhansor columbiads as they ought in justice to be called  and you think this chap likely to be a craft of that sort  nothing is more probable sir government has several and since this war has commenced it has been sending off cruiser after cruiser into the gulf the mexicans dare not send a vessel of war to sea which would be sending them to norfolk or new york at once but no one can say when they may begin to make a prey of our commerce  they have taken nothing as yet mr mulford and to tell you the truth id much rather fall in with one of don montezumas craft than one of uncle sams  that is a singular taste for an american captain spike unless you think now our guns are mounted we can handle a mexican returned mulford coldly at all events it is some answer to those who ask what is the navy about that months of war have gone by and not an american has been captured take away that navy and the insurance offices in wallstreet would tumble like a new york partywall in a fire  nevertheless id rather take my chance just now with don montezuma than with uncle sam  mulford did not reply though the earnest manner in which spike expressed himself helped to increase his distrust touching the nature of the voyage with him the captain had no further conference but it was different as respects the boatswain that worthy was called aft and for half an hour he and spike were conversing apart keeping their eyes fastened on the strange vessel most of the time  it was noon before all uncertainly touching the character of the stranger ceased by that time however both vessels were entering the mona passage the brig well to windward on the porto rico side while the ship was so far to leeward as to be compelled to keep everything closehauled in order to weather the island the hull of the last could now be seen and no doubt was entertained about her being a cruiser and one of some size too spike thought she was a frigate but mulford still inclined to the opinion that she was one of the new ships perhaps a real corvette or with a light spardeck over her batteries two or three of the new vessels were known to be thus fitted and this might be one at length all doubt on the subject ceased the stranger setting an american ensign and getting so near as to make it apparent that she had but a single line of guns still she was a large ship and the manner that she ploughed through the brine closehauled as she was extorted admiration even from spike  we had better begin to shorten sail mr mulford the captain at length most reluctantly remarked we might give the chap the slip perhaps by keeping close in under porto rico but he would give us a long chase and might drive us away to windward when i wish to keep off between cuba and jamaica hes a traveller look how he stands up to it under that could of canvas  mulford was slow to commence on the studdingsails and the cruiser was getting nearer and nearer at length a gun was fired and a heavy shot fell about two hundred yards short of the brig and a little out of line with her on this hint spike turned the hands up and began to shorten sail in ten minutes the swash was under her topsail mainsail and jib with her light sails hanging in the gear and all the steering canvas in in ten minutes more the cruiser was so near as to admit of the faces of the three or four men whose heads were above the hammockcloths being visible when she too began to fold her wings in went her royals topgallantsails and various kites as it might be by some common muscular agency and up went her courses everything was done at once by this time she was crossing the brigs wake looking exceedingly beautiful with her topsails lifting her light sails blowing out and even her heavy courses fluttering in the breeze there flew the glorious stars and stripes also of brief existence but full of recollections the moment she had room her helm went up her bows fell off and down she came on the weather quarter of the swash so near as to render a trumpet nearly useless  on board the brig everybody was on deck even the relict having forgotten her mortification in curiosity on board the cruiser no one was visible with the exception of a few men in each top and a group of goldbanded caps on the poop among these officers stood the captain a redfaced middleaged man with the usual signs of his rank about him and at his side was his lynxeyed first lieutenant the surgeon and purser were also there though they stood a little apart from the more nautical dignitaries the hail that followed came out of a trumpet that was thrust through the mizzenrigging the officer who used it taking his cue from the poop  what brig is that commenced the discourse  the molly swash of new york stephen spike master  where from and whither bound  from new york and bound to key west and a market  a pause succeeded this answer during which the officers on the poop of the cruiser held some discourse with him of the trumpet during the interval the cruiser ranged fairly up abeam  you are well to windward of your port sir observed he of the trumpet significantly  i know it but its war times and i didnt know but there might be piccaroons hovering about the havanna  the coast is clear and our cruisers will keep it so i see you have a battery sir  ay ay some old guns that ive had aboard these ten years theyre useful sometimes in these seas  very true ill range ahead of you and as soon as youve room ill thank you to heaveto i wish to send a boat on board you  spike was sullen enough on receiving this order but there was no help for it he was now in the jaws of the lion and his wisest course was to submit to the penalties of his position with the best grace he could the necessary orders were consequently given and the brig no sooner got room than she came by the wind and backed her topsail the cruiser went about and passing to windward backed her maintopsail just forward of the swashs beam then the latter lowered a boat and sent it with a lieutenant and a midshipman in its sternsheets on board the brigantine as the cutter approached spike went to the gangway to receive the strangers  although there will be frequent occasion to mention this cruiser the circumstances are of so recent occurrence that we do not choose to give either her name or that of any one belonging to her we shall consequently tell the curious who may be disposed to turn to their navylists and bluebooks that the search will be of no use as all the names we shall use in reference to this cruiser will be fictitious as much of the rest of our story as the reader please may be taken for gospel but we tell him frankly that we have thought it most expedient to adopt assumed names in connection with this vessel and all her officers there are good reasons for so doing and among others is that of abstaining from arming a clique to calumniate her commander who by the way like another commander in the gulf that might be named and who has actually been exposed to the sort of tracasserie to which there is allusion is one of the very ablest men in the service in order to put another in his place  the officer who now came over the side of the swash we shall call wallace he was the second lieutenant of the vessel of war he was about thirty and the midshipman who followed him was a wellgrown lad of nineteen both had a decided manofwar look and both looked a little curiously at the vessel they had boarded  your servant sir said wallace touching his cap in reply to spikes somewhat awkward bow your brig is the molly swash stephen spike bound from new york to key west and a market  youve got it all as straight lieutenant as if you was a readin it from the log  the next thing sir is to know of what your cargo is composed  flour eight hundred barrels of flour  flour would you not do better to carry that to liverpool the mississippi must be almost turned into paste by the quantity of flour it floats to market  notwithstanding that lieutenant i know uncle sams economy so well as to believe i shall part with every barrel of my flour to his contractors at a handsome profit  you read whig newspapers principally i rather think mr spike answered wallace in his cool deliberate way smiling however as he spoke  we may just as well say here that nature intended this gentleman for a second lieutenant the very place he filled he was a capital second lieutenant while he would not have earned his rations as first so well was he assured of this peculiarity in his moral composition that he did not wish to be the first lieutenant of anything in which he sailed a respectable seaman a wellread and intelligent man a capital deck officer or watch officer he was too indolent to desire to be anything more and was as happy as the day was long in the easy berth he filled the first lieutenant had been his messmate as a midshipman and ranked him but two on the list in his present commission but he did not envy him in the least on the contrary one of his greatest pleasures was to get working willy as he called his senior over a glass of wine or a tumbler of hot stuff and make him recount the labours of the day on such occasions wallace never failed to compare the situation of working willy with his own gentlemanlike ease and independence as second lieutenant his rank raised him above most of the unpleasant duty of the ship while it did not raise him high enough to plunge him into the neverending labours of his senior he delighted to call himself the ships gentleman a sobriquet he well deserved on more accounts than one  you read whig newspapers principally i rather think mr spike answered the lieutenant as has been just mentioned while we on board the poughkeepsie indulge in looking over the columns of the union as well as over those of the intelligencer when by good luck we can lay our hands on a stray number  that ship then is called the poughkeepsie is she sir inquired spike  such is her name thanks to a most beneficent and sage provision of congress which has extended its parental care over the navy so far as to imagine that a man chosen by the people to exercise so many of the functions of a sovereign is not fit to name a ship all our two and three deckers are to be called after states the frigates after rivers and the sloops after towns thus it is that our craft has the honour to be called the united states ship the poughkeepsie instead of the arrow or the wasp or the curlew or the petrel as might otherwise have been the case but the wisdom of congress is manifest for the plan teaches us sailors geography  yes sir yes one can pick up a bit of larnin in that way cheap the poughkeepsie captain  the united states ship poughkeepsie 20 captain adam mull at your service but mr spike you will allow me to look at your papers it is a duty i like for it can be performed quietly and without any fuss  spike looked distrustfully at his new acquaintance but went for his vessels papers without any very apparent hesitation every thing was en regle and wallace soon got through with the clearance manifest c indeed the cargo on paper at least was of the simplest and least complicated character being composed of nothing but eight hundred barrels of flour  it all looks very well on paper mr spike added the boarding officer with your permission we will next see how it looks in sober reality i perceive your main hatch is open and i suppose it will be no difficult matter just to take a glance at your hold  here is a ladder sir that will take us at once to the halfdeck for i have no proper twixt decks in this craft shes too small for that sort of outfit  no matter she has a hold i suppose and that can contain cargo take me to it by the shortest road mr spike for i am no great admirer of trouble  spike now led the way below wallace following leaving the midshipman on deck who had fallen into conversation with the relict and her pretty niece the halfdeck of the brigantine contained spare sails provisions and water as usual while quantities of old canvas lay scattered over the cargo more especially in the wake of the hatches of which there were two besides that which led from the quarterdeck  flour to the number of eight hundred barrels said wallace striking his foot against a barrel that lay within his reach the cargo is somewhat singular to come from new york going to key west my dear spike  i suppose you know what sort of a place key west is sir a bit of an island in which there is scarce so much as a potatoe grows  ay ay sir i know key west very well having been in and out a dozen times all eatables are imported turtle excepted but flour can be brought down the mississippi so much cheaper than it can be brought from new york  have you any idee lieutenant what uncle sams men are paying for it at new orleens just to keep soul and bodies together among the sogers  that may be true sirquite true i dare say mr spike have nt you a bit of a chair that a fellow can sit down onthis halfdeck of yours is none of the most comfortable places to stand in thank you sirthank you with all my heart what lots of old sails you have scattered about the hold especially in the wake of the hatches  why the craft being little more than in good ballast trim i keep the hatches off to air her and the spray might spit down upon the flour at odd times but for them ere sails  ay a prudent caution so you think uncle sams people will be after this flour as soon as they learn you have got it snug in at key west  what more likely sir you know how it is with our governmentalways wrong whatever it does and i can show you paragraphs in letters written from new orleens which tell us that uncle sam is paying seventyfive and eighty per cent more for flour than anybody else  he must be a flush old chap to be able to do that spike  flush i rather think he is do you know that he is spendin accordin to approved accounts at this blessed moment as much as half a million a day i own a wish to be pickin up some of the coppers while they are scattered about so plentifully  half a million a day why that is only at the rate of 187000000 per annum a mere trifle spike that is scarce worth mentioning among us mariners  its so in the newspapers i can swear lieutenant  ay ay and the newspapers will swear to it too and they that gave the newspapers their cue but no matter our business is with this flour will you sell us a barrel or two for our mess i heard the caterer say we should want flour in the course of a week or so  spike seemed embarrassed though not to a degree to awaken suspicion in his companion  i never sold cargo at sea long as ive sailed and owned a craft he answered as if uncertain what to do if youll pay the price i expect to get in the gulf and will take ten barrels i do nt know but we may make a trade ont i shall only ask expected prices  which will be  ten dollars a barrel for one hundred silver dollars i will put into your boat ten barrels of the very best brand known in the western country  this is dealing rather more extensively than i anticipated but we will reflect on it  wallance now indolently arose and ascended to the quarterdeck followed by spike who continued to press the flour on him as if anxious to make money but the lieutenant hesitated about paying a price as high as ten dollars or to take a quantity as large as ten barrels  our mess is no great matter after all he said carelessly four lieutenants the purser two doctors the master and a marine officer and you get us all nine men could never eat ten barrels of flour my dear spike you will see for yourself with the quantity of excellent bread we carry you forget the bread  not a bit of it mr wallace since that is your name but such flour as this of mine has not been seen in the gulf this many a day i ought in reason to ask twelve dollars for it and insist on such a ship as yourns taking twenty instead of the ten barrels  i thank you sir the ten will more than suffice unless indeed the captain wants some for the cabin how is it with your steerage messes mr archerdo you want any flour  we draw a little from the ship according to rule sir but we cant go as many puddings latterly as we could before we touched last at the havanna answered the laughing midshipman there is nt a fellow among us sir that could pay a shoreboat for landing him should we go in again before the end of another month i never knew such a place as havanna they say midshipmens money melts there twice as soon as lieutenants money  its clear then youll not take any of the ten i am afraid after all mr spike we cannot trade unless you will consent to let me have two barrels ill venture on two at ten dollars high as the price is  i should nt forgive myself in six months for making so had a bargain lieutenant so well say no more about it if you please  here is a lady that wishes to say a word to you mr wallace before we go back to the ship if you are at leisure to hear her or themfor there are two of them put in archer  at this moment mrs budd was approaching with a dignified step while rose followed timidly a little in the rear wallace was a good deal surprised at this application and spike was quite as much provoked as for mulford he watched the interview from a distance a great deal more interested in its result than he cared to have known more especially to his commanding officer its object was to get a passage in the vessel of war  you are an officer of that uncle sam vessel commenced mrs budd who thought that she would so much the more command the respect and attention of her listener by showing him early how familiar she was with even the slang dialect of the seas  i have the honour maam to belong to that uncle sam craft answered wallace gravely though he bowed politely at the same time looking intently at the beautiful girl in the background as he so did  so ive been told sir shes a beautiful vessel lieutenant and is full jiggered i perceive  for the first time in his life or at least for the first time since his first cruise wallace wore a mystified look being absolutely at a loss to imagine what full jiggered could mean he only looked therefore for he did not answer  mrs budd means that youve a full rigged craft put in spike anxious to have a voice in the conference this vessel being only a halfrigged brig  oh ay yes yesthe lady is quite right we are full jiggered from our deadeyes to our eyebolts  i thought as much sir from your ground hamper and toptackles added the relict smiling for my part there is nothing in nature that i so much admire as a full jiggered ship with her canvas out of the boltropes and her clewlines and clewgarnets braced sharp and her yards all abroad  yes maam it is just as you say a very charming spectacle our baby was born full grown and with all her hamper aloft just as you see her some persons refer vessels to art but i think you are quite right in referring them to nature  nothing can be more natural to me lieutenant than a fine ship standing on her canvas its an object to improve the heart and to soften the understanding  so i should think maam returned wallace a little quizzically judging from the effect on yourself  this speech unfortunately timed as it was wrought a complete change in roses feelings and she no longer wished to exchange the swash for the poughkeepsie she saw that her aunt was laughed at in secret and that was a circumstance that never failed to grate on every nerve in her system she had been prepared to second and sustain the intended applicationshe was now determined to oppose it  yes sir resumed the unconscious relict and to soften the understanding lieutenant did you ever cross the capricorn  no less than six times three going and three returning you know  and did neptune come on board you and were you shaved  everything was done secundem artem maam the razor was quite an example of what are called in poetry thoughts too deep for tears   that must have been delightful as for me im quite a devotee of neptunes but im losing time for no doubt your ship is all ready to pull away and carry on sail  aunt may i say a word to you before you go any further put in rose in her quiet but very controlling way  the aunt complied and wallace as soon as left alone felt like a man who was released from a quicksand into which every effort to extricate himself only plunged him so much the deeper at this moment the ship hailed and the lieutenant took a hasty leave of spike motioned to the midshipman to precede him and followed the latter into his boat spike saw his visiter off in person tending the side and offering the manropes with his own hands for this civility wallace thanked him calling out as his boat pulled him from the brigs sideif we pull away accenting the pull in secret derision of the relicts mistake you can pull away our filling the topsail being a sign for you to do the same  there you go and joy go with you muttered spike as he descended from the gangway a pretty kettle of fish would there have been cooked had i let him have his two barrels of flour  the manofwars cutter was soon under the lee of the ship where it discharged its freight when it was immediately run up during the whole time wallace had been absent captain mull and his officers remained on the poop principally occupied in examining and discussing the merits of the swash no sooner had their officer returned however than an order was given to fill away it being supposed that the poughkeepsie had no further concern with the brigantine as for wallace he ascended to the poop and made the customary report  its a queer cargo to be carrying to key west from the atlantic coast observed the captain in a deliberating sort of manner as if the circumstance excited suspicion yet the mexicans can hardly be in want of any such supplies  did you see the flour wallace inquired the first lieutenant who was well aware of his messmates indolence  yes sir and felt it too the lower hold of the brig is full of flour and of nothing else  ware round sirware round and pass athwart the brigs wake interrupted the captain theres plenty of room now and i wish to pass as near that craft as we can  this manoeuvre was executed the sloopofwar no sooner filled her maintopsail than she drew ahead leaving plenty of room for the brigantine to make sail on her course spike did not profit by this opening however but he sent several men aloft forward where they appeared to be getting ready to send down the upper yards and the topgallantmast no sooner was the sloopofwars helm put up than that vessel passed close along the brigantines weather side and kept off across her stern on her course as she did this the canvas was fluttering aboard her in the process of making sail and mull held a short discourse with spike  is anything the matter aloft demanded the manofwars man  ay ay ive sprung my topgallantmast and think this a good occasion to get another up in its place  shall i lend you a carpenter or two mr spike  thankee sir thankee with all my heart but we can do without them its an old stick and its high time a better stood where it does who knows but i may be chased and feel the want of reliable spars  captain mull smiled and raised his cap in the way of an adieu when the conversation ended the poughkeepsie sliding off rapidly with a free wind leaving the swash nearly stationary in ten minutes the two vessels were more than a mile apart in twenty beyond the reach of shot  notwithstanding the natural and commonplace manner in which this separation took place there was much distrust on board each vessel and a good deal of consummate management on the part of spike the latter knew that every foot the sloopofwar went on her course carried her just so far to leeward placing his own brig insomuch dead to windward of her as the swashs best point of sailing relatively considered was closehauled this was giving to spike a great security against any change of purpose on the part of the vessel of war although his people were aloft and actually sent down the topgallantmast it was only to send it up again the spar being of admirable toughness and as sound as the day it was cut  i dont think mr mulford said the captain sarcastically that uncle sams glasses are good enough to tell the difference in wood at two leagues distance so well trust to the old stick a little longer ay ay let em run off before it well find another road by which to reach our port  the sloopofwar is going round the south side of cuba captain spike answered the mate and i have understood you to say that you intended to go by the same passage  a body may change his mind and no murder only consider harry how common it is for folks to change their minds i did intend to pass between cuba and jamaica but i intend it no longer our run from montauk has been oncommon short and ive time enough to spare to go to the southward of jamaica too if the notion takes me  that would greatly prolong the passage captain spikea week at least  what if it doesive a week to spare were nine days afore our time  our time for what sir is there any particular time set for a vessels going into key west  dont be womanish and overcurous mulford i sail with sealed orders and when we get well to windward of jamaica t will be time enough to open them  spike was as good as his word as soon as he thought the sloopofwar was far enough to leeward or when she was hull down he filled away and made sail on the wind to get nearer to porto rico long ere it was dark he had lost sight of the sloopofwar when he altered his course to southwesterly which was carrying him in the direction he named or to windward of jamaica  while this artifice was being practised on board the molly swash the officers of the poughkeepsie were not quite satisfied with their own mode of proceeding with the brigantine the more they reasoned on the matter the more unlikely it seemed to them that spike could be really carrying a cargo of flour from new york to key west in the expectation of disposing of it to the united states contractors and the more out of the way did he seem to be in running through the mona passage  his true course should have been by the hole in the wall and so down along the north side of cuba before the wind observed the first lieutenant i wonder that never struck you wallace you who so little like trouble  certainly i knew it but we lazy people like running off before the wind and i did not know but such were mr spikes tastes answered the ships gentleman in my judgment the reluctance he showed to letting us have any of his flour is much the most suspicious circumstance in the whole affair  these two speeches were made on the poop in the presence of the captain but in a sort of an aside that admitted of some of the wardroom familiarity exhibited captain mull was not supposed to hear what passed though hear it he in fact did as was seen by his own remarks which immediately succeeded  i understood you to say mr wallace observed the captain a little drily that you saw the flour yourself  i saw the flourbarrels sir and as regularly built were they as any barrels that ever were branded but a flourbarrel may have contained something beside flour  flour usually makes itself visible in the handling were these barrels quite clean  far from it sir they showed flour on their staves like any other cargo after all the man may have more sense than we give him credit for and find a high market for his cargo  captain mull seemed to muse which was a hint for his juniors not to continue the conversation but rather to seem to muse too after a short pause the captain quietly remarkedwell gentlemen he will be coming down after us i suppose as soon as he gets his new topgallantmast onend and then we can keep a bright lookout for him we shall cruise off cape st antonio for a day or two and no doubt shall get another look at him i should like to have one baking from his flour  but spike had no intention to give the poughkeepsie the desired opportunity as has been stated he stood off to the southward on a wind and completely doubled the eastern end of jamaica when he put his helm up and went with favouring wind and current toward the northward and westward the consequence was that he did not fall in with the poughkeepsie at all which vessel was keeping a sharp lookout for him in the neighbourhood of cape st antonio and the isle of pines at the very moment he was running down the coast of yucatan of all the large maritime countries of the world mexico on the atlantic is that which is the most easily blockaded by a superior naval power by maintaining a proper force between key west and the havanna and another squadron between cape st antonio and loggerhead key the whole country the bay of honduras excepted is shut up as it might be in a bandbox it is true the gulf would be left open to the mexicans were not squadrons kept nearer in but as for anything getting out into the broad atlantic it would be next to hopeless the distance to be watched between the havanna and key west is only about sixty miles while that in the other direction is not much greater  while the swash was making the circuit of jamaica as described her captain had little communication with his passengers the misunderstanding with the relict embarrassed him as much as it embarrassed her and he was quite willing to let time mitigate her resentment rose would be just as much in his power a fortnight hence as she was today this cessation in the captains attentions gave the females greater liberty and they improved it singularly enough as it seemed to mulford by cultivating a strange sort of intimacy with jack tier the very day that succeeded the delicate conversation with mrs budd to a part of which jack had been an auditor the uncouthlooking stewards assistant was seen in close conference with the pretty rose the subject of their conversation being apparently of a most engrossing nature from that hour jack got to be not only a confidant but a favourite to mulfords great surprise a less inviting subject for ttettes and confidential dialogues thought the young man could not well exist but so it was womans caprices are inexplicable and not only rose and her aunt but even the captious and somewhat distrustful biddy manifested on all occasions not only friendship but kindness and consideration for jack  you quite put my nose out o joint you jack tier with e lady grumbled josh the steward de jure if not now de facto of the craft and i neber see nuttin like it i spose you expect ten dollar at least from dem passenger when we gets in but id have you to know misser jack if you please dat a steward be a steward and he do nt like to hab trick played wid him afore he own face  poh poh joshua answered jack goodnaturedly do nt distress yourself on a consail in the first place youve got no nose to be put out of joint or if you have really a nose it has no joint its natral for folks to like their own colour and the ladies prefar me because im white  no so werry white as all dat nudder grumbled josh i see great many whiter dan you but if dem lady like you so much as to gib you ten dollar as i expects when we gets in i presumes youll hand over half or six dollar of dat money to your superior officer as is law in de case  do you call six the half of ten joshua my scholar eh  well den seven if you like dat better i wants just half and just half i means to git  and half you shall have maty i only wish you would just tell me where we shall be when we gets in  how i know white man dat belong to skipper and better ask him if he do nt gib you lick in de chop prhaps he tell you  as jack tier had no taste for licks in the chops he did not follow joshs advice but his agreeing to give half of the ten dollars to the steward kept peace in the cabins he was even so scrupulous of his word as to hand to josh a halfeagle that very day money he had received from rose saying he would trust to providence for his own half of the expected douceur this concession placed jack tier on high grounds with his superior officer and from that time the former was left to do the whole of the customary service of the ladies cabin  as respects the vessel nothing worthy of notice occurred until she had passed loggerhead key and was fairly launched in the gulf of mexico then indeed spike took a step that greatly surprised his mate the latter was directed to bring all his instruments charts c and place them in the captains stateroom where it was understood they were to remain until the brig got into port spike was but an indifferent navigator while mulford was one of a higher order than common so much had the former been accustomed to rely on the latter indeed as they approached a strange coast that he could not possibly have taken any step that was not positively criminal which would have given his mate more uneasiness than this  at first mulford naturally enough suspected that spike intended to push for some mexican port by thus blinding his eyes as to the position of the vessel the direction steered however soon relieved the mate from this apprehension from the eastern extremity of yucatan the mexican coast trends to the westward and even to the south of west for a long distance whereas the course steered by spike was north easterly this was diverging from the enemys coast instead of approaching it and the circumstance greatly relieved the apprehensions of mulford  nor was the sequestration of the mates instruments the only suspicious act of spike he caused the brigs paint to be entirely altered and even went so far toward disguising her as to make some changes aloft all this was done as the vessel passed swiftly on her course and everything had been effected apparently to the captains satisfaction when the cry of landho was once more heard the land proved to be a cluster of low small islands part coral part sand that might have been eight or ten in number and the largest of which did not possess a surface of more than a very few acres many were the merest islets imaginable and on one of the largest of the cluster rose a tall gaunt lighthouse having the customary dwelling of its keeper at its base nothing else was visible the broad expanse of the blue waters of the gulf excepted all the land in sight would not probably have made one field of twenty acres in extent and that seemed cut off from the rest of the world by a broad barrier of water it was a spot of such singular situation and accessories that mulford gazed at it with a burning desire to know where he was as the brig steered through a channel between two of the islets into a capacious and perfectly safe basin formed by the group and dropped her anchor in its centre  chapter v    he sleeps but dreams of massy gold     and heaps of pearl he stretchd his hands   he hears a voice    ill man withhold     a pale one near him stands  dana  it was near nightfall when the swash anchored among the low and small islets mentioned rose had been on deck as the vessel approached this singular and solitary haven watching the movements of those on board as well as the appearance of objects on the land with the interest her situation would belikely to awaken she saw the light and manageable craft glide through the narrow and crooked passages that led into the port the process of anchoring and the scene of tranquil solitude that succeeded each following the other as by a law of nature the lighthouse next attracted her attention and as soon as the sun disappeared her eyes were fastened on the lantern in expectation of beholding the watchful and warning fires gleaming there to give the mariner notice of the position of the dangers that surrounded the place minute went by after minute however and the customary illumination seemed to be forgotten  why is not this light shining rose asked of mulford as the young man came near her after having discharged his duty in helping to moor the vessel and in clearing the decks all the lighthouses we have passed and they have been fifty have shown bright lights at this hour but this  i cannot explain it nor have i the smallest notion where we are i have been aloft and there was nothing in sight but this cluster of low islets far or near i did fancy for a moment i saw a speck like a distant sail off here to the northward and eastward but i rather think it was a gull or some other seabird glancing upward on the wing i mentioned it to the captain when i came down and he appeared to believe it a mistake i have watched that lighthouse closely too ever since we came in and i have not seen the smallest sign of life about it it is altogether an extraordinary place  one suited to acts of villany i fear harry  of that we shall be better judges tomorrow you at least have one vigilant friend who will die sooner than harm shall come to you i believe spike to be thoroughly unprincipled still he knows he can go so far and no further and has a wholesome dread of the law but the circumstance that there should be such a port as this with a regular lighthouse and no person near the last is so much out of the common way that i do not know what to make of it  perhaps the lighthouse keeper is afraid to show himself in the presence of the swash  that can hardly be for vessels must often enter the port if port it can be called but spike is as much concerned at the circumstance that the lamps are not lighted as any of us can be look he is about to visit the building in the boat accompanied by two of his oldest seadogs  why might we not raise the anchor and sail out of this place leaving spike ashore suggested rose with more decision and spirit than discretion  for the simple reason that the act would be piracy even if i could get the rest of the people to obey my orders as certainly i could not no rose you and your aunt and biddy however might land at these buildings and refuse to return spike having no authority over his passengers  still he would have the power to make us come back to his brig look he has left the vessels side and is going directly toward the lighthouse  mulford made no immediate answer but remained at roses side watching the movements of the captain the last pulled directly to the islet with the buildings a distance of only a few hundred feet the lighthouse being constructed on a rocky island that was nearly in the centre of the cluster most probably to protect it from the ravages of the waves the fact however proved as mulford did not fail to suggest to his companion that the beacon had been erected less to guide vessels into the haven than to warn mariners at a distance of the position of the whole group  in less than five minutes after he had landed spike himself was seen in the lantern in the act of lighting its lamps in a very short time the place was in a brilliant blaze reflectors and all the other parts of the machinery of the place performing their duties as regularly as if tended by the usual keeper soon after spike returned on board and the anchorwatch was set then everybody sought the rest that it was customary to take at that hour  mulford was on deck with the appearance of the sun but he found that spike had preceded him had gone ashore again had extinguished the lamps and was coming alongside of the brig on his return a minute later the captain came over the side  you were right about your sail last night ater all mr mulford said spike on coming aft there she is sure enough and we shall have her alongside to strike cargo out and in by the time the people have got their breakfasts  as spike pointed toward the lighthouse while speaking the mate changed his position a little and saw that a schooner was coming down toward the islets before the wind mulford now began to understand the motives of the captains proceedings though a good deal yet remained veiled in mystery he could not tell where the brig was nor did he know precisely why so many expedients were adopted to conceal the transfer of a cargo as simple as that of flour but he who was in the secret left but little time for reflection for swallowing a hasty breakfast on deck he issued orders enough to his mate to give him quite as much duty as he could perform when he again entered the yawl and pulled toward the stranger  rose soon appeared on deck and she naturally began to question harry concerning their position and prospects he was confessing his ignorance as well as lamenting it when his companions sweet face suddenly flushed she advanced a step eagerly toward the open window of spikes stateroom then compressed her full rich underlip with the ivory of her upper teeth and stood a single instant a beautiful statue of irresolution instigated by spirit the last quality prevailed and mulford was really startled when he saw rose advance quite to the window thrust in an arm and turn toward him with his own sextant in her hand during the course of the passage out the young man had taught rose to assist him in observing the longitude and she was now ready to repeat the practice not a moment was lost in executing her intention sights were had and the instrument was returned to its place without attracting the attention of the men who were all busy in getting up purchases and in making the other necessary dispositions for discharging the flour the observations answered the purpose though somewhat imperfectly made mulford had a tolerable notion of their latitude having kept the brigs run in his head since quitting yutacan and he now found that their longitude was about 83 o west from greenwich after ascertaining this fact a glance at the open chart which lay on spikes desk satisfied him that the vessel was anchored within the group of the dry tortugas or at the western termination of the wellknown formidable and extensive florida reef he had never been in that part of the world before but had heard enough in seagossip and had read enough in books to be at once apprised of the true character of their situation the islets were american the lighthouse was american and the haven in which the swash lay was the very spot in the contemplation of government for an outer manofwar harbour where fleets might rendezvous in the future wars of that portion of the world he now saw plainly enough the signs of the existence of a vast reef a short distance to the southward of the vessel that formed a species of seawall or mole to protect the port against the waves of the gulf in that direction this reef he knew to be miles in width  there was little time for speculation spike soon bringing the strange schooner directly alongside of the brig the two vessels immediately became a scene of activity one discharging and the other receiving the flour as fast as it could be struck out of the hold of the swash and lowered upon the deck of the schooner mulford however had practised a little artifice as the stranger entered the haven which drew down upon him an anathema or two from spike as soon as they were alone the mate had set the brigs ensign and this compelled the stranger to be markedly rude or to answer the compliment accordingly he had shown the ancient flag of spain for thus extorting a national symbol from the schooner the mate was sharply rebuked at a suitable moment though nothing could have been more forbearing than the deportment of his commander when they first met  when spike returned to his own vessel he was accompanied by a darklooking welldressed and decidedly gentlemanlike personage whom he addressed indifferently in his very imperfect spanish as don wan don juan or john or se¤or montefalderon by the latter appellation he even saw fit to introduce the very respectablelooking stranger to his mate this stranger spoke english well though with an accent  don wan has taken all the flour mr mulford and intends shoving it over into cuba without troubling the customhouse i believe but that is not a matter to give us any concern you know  the wink and the knowing look by which this speech was accompanied seemed particularly disagreeable to don juan who now paid his compliments to rose with no little surprise betrayed in his countenance but with the ease and reserve of a gentleman mulford thought it strange that a smuggler of flour should be so polished a personage though his duty did not admit of his bestowing much attention on the little trifling of the interview that succeeded  for about an hour the work went steadily and rapidly on during that time mulford was several times on board the schooner as indeed was josh jack tier and others belonging to the swash the spanish vessel was baltimore or clipper built with a trunkcabin and had every appearance of sailing fast mulford was struck with her model and while on board of her he passed both forward and aft to examine it this was so natural in a seaman that spike while he noted the proceeding took it in good part he even called out to his mate from his own quarterdeck to admire this or that point in the schooners construction as is customary with the vessels of southern nations this stranger was full of men but they continued at their work some half dozen of brawny negroes among them shouting their songs as they swayed at the falls no one appearing to manifest jealousy or concern at length tier came near the mate and said  uncle sam will not be pleased when he hears the reason that the keeper is not in his lighthouse  and what is that reason jack if you know it tell it to me  go aft and look down the companionway maty and see it for yourself  mulford did go aft and he made an occasion to look down into the schooners cabin where he caught a glimpse of the persons of a man and a boy whom he at once supposed had been taken from the lighthouse this one fact of itself doubled his distrust of the character of spikes proceedings there was no sufficient apparent reason why a mere smuggler should care about the presence of an individual more or less in a foreign port everything that had occurred looked like preconcert between the brig and the schooner and the mate was just beginning to entertain the strongest distrust that their vessel was holding treasonable communication with the enemy when an accident removed all doubt on the subject from his own mind at least spike had once or twice given his opinion that the weather was treacherous and urged the people of both crafts to extraordinary exertions in order that the vessels might get clear of each other as soon as possible this appeal had set various expedients in motion to second the more regular work of the purchases among other things planks had been laid from one vessel to the other and barrels were rolled along them with very little attention to the speed or the direction several had fallen on the schooners deck with rude shocks but no damage was done until one of which the hoops had not been properly secured met with a fall and burst nearly at mulfords feet it was at the precise moment when the mate was returning from taking his glance into the cabin toward the side of the swash a white cloud arose and half a dozen of the schooners people sprang for buckets kids or dishes in order to secure enough of the contents of the broken barrel to furnish them with a meal at first nothing was visible but the white cloud that succeeded the fall and the scrambling sailors in its midst no sooner however had the air got to be a little clear than mulford saw an object lying in centre of the wreck that he at once recognised for a keg of the gunpowder the captain of the schooner seized this keg gave a knowing look at mulford and disappeared in the hold of his own vessel carrying with him what was out of all question a most material part of the true cargo of the swash  at the moment when the flourbarrel burst spike was below in close conference with his spanish or mexican guest and the wreck being so soon cleared away it is probable that he never heard of the accident as for the two crews they laughed a little among themselves at the revelation which had been made as well as at the manner but to old seadogs like them it was a matter of very little moment whether the cargo was in reality flour or gunpowder in a few minutes the affair seemed to be forgotten in the course of another hour the swash was light having nothing in her but some piglead which she used for ballast while the schooner was loaded to her hatches and full spike now sent a boat with orders to drop a kedge about a hundred yards from the place where his own brig lay the schooner warped up to this kedge and dropped an anchor of her own leaving a very short range of cable out it being a flat calm ordinarily the trades prevail at the dry tortugas and all along the florida reef sometimes indeed this breeze sweeps across the whole width of the gulf of mexico blowing home as it is calledreaching even to the coast of texas it is subject however to occasional interruptions everywhere varying many points in its direction and occasionally ceasing entirely the latter was the condition of the weather about noon on this day or when the schooner hauled off from the brig and was secured at her own anchor  mr mulford said spike i do not like the state of the atmosphere dye see that fiery streak along the western horizonwell sir as the sun gets nearer to that streak therell be trouble or im no judge of weather  you surely do not imagine captain spike that the sun will be any nearer to that fiery streak as you call it when he is about to set than he is at this moment answered the mate smiling  im sure of one thing young man and that is that old heads are better than young ones what a man has once seen he may expect to see again if the same leading signs offer man the boat sir and carry out the kedge which is still in it and lay it off here about three pints on our larboard bow  mulford had a profound respect for spikes seamanship whatever he might think of his principles the order was consequently obeyed the mate was then directed to send down various articles out of the top and to get the topgallant and royal yards on deck spike carried his precautions so far as to have the mainsail lowered it ordinarily brailing at that season of the year with a standing gaff with this disposition completed the captain seemed more at his ease and went below to join se¤or montefalderon in a siesta the mexican for such in truth was the national character of the owner of the schooner had preceded him in this indulgence and most of the people of the brig having laid themselves down to sleep under the heat of the hour mulford soon enjoyed another favourable opportunity for a private conference with rose  harry commenced the latter as soon as they were alone i have much to tell you while you have been absent i have overheard a conversation between this spanish gentleman and spike that shows the last is in treaty with the other for the sale of the brig spike extolled his vessel to the skies while don wan as he calls him complains that the brig is old and cannot last long to which spike answered to be sure she is old se¤or montefalderon but she will last as long as your war and under a bold captain might be made to return her cost a hundred fold what war can he mean and to what does such a discourse tend  the war alludes to the war now existing between america and mexico and the money to be made is to be plundered at sea from our own merchantvessels if don juan montefalderon is really in treaty for the purchase of the brig it is to convert her into a mexican cruiser either public or private  but this would be treason on the part of spike  not more so than supplying the enemy with gunpowder as he has just been doing i have ascertained the reason he was so unwilling to be overhauled by the revenue steamer as well as the reason why the revenue steamer wished so earnestly to overhaul us each barrel of flour contains another of gunpowder and that has been sold to this se¤or montefalderon who is doubtless an officer of the mexican government and no smuggler  he has been at new york this very summer i know continued rose for he spoke of his visit and made such other remarks as leaves no doubt that spike expected to find him here on this very day of the month he also paid spike a large sum of money in doubloons and took back the bag to his schooner when he had done so after showing the captain enough was left to pay for the brig could they only agree on the terms of their bargain  ay ay it is all plain enough now spike has determined on a desperate push for fortune and foreseeing it might not soon be in his power to return to new york in safety he has included his designs on you and your fortune in the plot  my fortune the trifle i possess can scarcely be called a fortune harry  it would be a fortune to spike rose and i shall be honest enough to own it would be a fortune to me i say this frankly for i do believe you think too well of me to suppose that i seek you for any other reason than the ardent love i bear your person and character but a fact is not to be denied because it may lead certain persons to distrust our motives spike is poor like myself and the brig is not only getting to be very old but she has been losing money for the last twelve months  mulford and rose now conversed long and confidentially on their situation and prospects the mate neither magnified nor concealed the dangers of both but freely pointed out the risk to himself in being on board a vessel that was aiding and comforting the enemy it was determined between there that both would quit the brig the moment an opportunity offered and the mate even went so far as to propose an attempt to escape in one of the boats although he might incur the hazards of a double accusation those of mutiny and larceny for making the experiment unfortunately neither rose nor her aunt nor biddy nor jack tier had seen the barrel of powder and neither could testify as to the true character of spikes connection with the schooner it was manifestly necessary therefore independently of the risks that might be run by bearding the lion in his den to proceed with great intelligence and caution  this dialogue between harry and rose occurred just after the turn in the day and lasted fully an hour each had been too much interested to observe the heavens but as they were on the point of separating rose pointed out to her companion the unusual and most menacing aspect of the sky in the western horizon it appeared as if a fiery heat was glowing there behind a curtain of black vapour and what rendered it more remarkable was the circumstance that an extraordinary degree of placidity prevailed in all other parts of the heavens mulford scarce knew what to make of it his experience not going so far as to enable him to explain the novel and alarming appearance he stepped on a gun and gazed around him for a moment there lay the schooner without a being visible on board of her and there stood the lighthouse gloomy in its desertion and solitude the birds alone seemed to be alive and conscious of what was approaching they were all on the wing wheeling wildly in the air and screaming discordantly as belonged to their habits the young man leaped off the gun gave a loud call to spike at the companionway and sprang forward to call all hands  one minute only was lost when every seaman on board the swash from the captain to jack tier was on deck mulford met spike at the cabin door and pointed toward the fiery column that was booming down upon the anchorage with a velocity and direction that would now admit of no misinterpretation for one instant that sturdy old seaman stood aghast gazing at the enemy as one conscious of his impotency might have been supposed to quail before an assault that he foresaw must prove irresistible then his native spirit and most of all the effects of training began to show themselves in him and he became at once not only the man again but the resolute practised and ready commander  come aft to the spring men he shoutedclap on the spring mr mulford and bring the brig head to wind  this order was obeyed as seamen best obey in cases of sudden and extreme emergency or with intelligence aptitude and power the brig had swung nearly round in the desired direction when the tornado struck her it will be difficult we do not know but it is impossible to give a clear and accurate account of what followed as most of our readers have doubtless felt how great is the power of the wind whiffling and pressing different ways in sudden and passing gusts they have only to imagine this power increased many many fold and the baffling currents made furious as it might be by meeting with resistance to form some notion of the appalling strength and frightful inconstancy with which it blew for about a minute  notwithstanding the circumstance of spikes precaution had greatly lessened the danger every man on the deck of the swash believed the brig was gone when the gust struck her over she went in fact until the water came pouring in above her halfports like so many little cascades and spouting up through her scupperholes resembling the blowing of young whales it was the whiffling energy of the tornado that alone saved her as if disappointed in not destroying its intended victim at one swoop the tornado let up in its pressure like a dexterous wrestler making a fresh and desperate effort to overturn the vessel by a slight variation in its course that change saved the swash she righted and even rolled in the other direction or what might be called to windward with her decks full of water for a minute longer these baffling changing gusts continued each causing the brig to bow like a reed to their power one lifting as another pressed her down and then the weight or the more dangerous part of the tornado was passed though it continued to blow heavily always in whiffling blasts several minutes longer  during the weight of the gust no one had leisure or indeed inclination to look to aught beyond its effect on the brig had one been otherwise disposed the attempt would have been useless for the wind had filled the air with spray and near the islets even with sand the lurid but fiery tinge too interposed a veil that no human eye could penetrate as the tornado passed onward however and the winds lulled the air again became clear and in five minutes after the moment when the swash lay nearly on her side with her lower yardarm actually within a few feet of the water all was still and placid around her as one is accustomed to see the ocean in a calm of a summers afternoon then it was that those who had been in such extreme jeopardy could breathe freely and look about them on board the swash all was wellnot a ropeyarn had parted or an eyebolt drawn the timely precautions of spike had saved his brig and great was his joy thereat  in the midst of the infernal din of the tornado screams had ascended from the cabin and the instant he could quit the deck with propriety mulford sprang below in order to ascertain their cause he apprehended that some of the females had been driven to leeward when the brig went over and that part of the luggage or furniture had fallen on them in the main cabin the mate found se¤or montefalderon just quitting his berth composed gentlemanlike and collected josh was braced in a corner nearly grey with fear while jack tier still lay on the cabin floor at the last point to which he had rolled one word sufficed to let don juan know that the gust had passed and the brig was safe when mulford tapped at the deor of the inner cabin rose appeared pale but calm and unhurt  is any one injured asked the young man his mind relieved at once as soon as he saw that she who most occupied his thoughts was safe we heard screams from this cabin  my aunt and biddy have been frightened answered rose but neither has been hurt oh harry what terrible thing has happened to us i heard the roaring of   t was a tornado interrupted mulford eagerly but t is over t was one of those sudden and tremendous gusts that sometimes occur within the tropics in which the danger is usually in the first shock if no one is injured in this cabin no one is injured at all  oh mr mulforddear mr mulford exclaimed the relict from the corner into which she had been followed and jammed by biddy oh mr mulford are we foundered or not  heaven be praised not my dear maam though we came nearer to it than i ever was before  are we capasided  nor that mrs budd the brig is as upright as a church  upright repeated biddy in her customary accentis it as a church sure then mr mate t is a presbyterian church that you mane and that is always totterin  catholic or dutchno church in york is more completely up and down than the brig at this moment  get off of meget off of me biddy and let me rise said the widow with dignity the danger is over i see and as we return our thanks for it we have the consolation of knowing that we have done our duty it is incumbent on all at such moments to be at their posts and to set examples of decision and prudence  as mulford saw all was well in the cabin he hastened on deck followed by se¤or montefalderon just as they emerged from the companionway spike was hailing the forecastle  forecastle there he cried standing on the trunk himself as he did so and moving from side to side as if to catch a glimpse of some object ahead  sir came back from an old salt who was coiling up rigging in that seat of seamanship  whereaway is the schooner she ought to be dead ahead of us as we tend nowbut blast me if i can see as much as her mastheads  at this suggestion a dozen men sprang upon guns or other objects to look for the vessel in question the old salt forward however had much the best chance for he stepped on the heel of the bowsprit and walked as far out as the knightheads to command the whole view ahead of the brig there he stood half a minute looking first on one side of the headgear then the other when he gave his trousers a hitch put a fresh quid in his mouth and called out in a voice almost as hoarse as the tempest that had just gone by  the schooner has gone down at her anchor sir theres her buoy watching still as if nothing had happened but as for the craft itself theres not so much as a bloody yardarm or masthead of her to be seen  this news produced a sensation in the brig at once as may be supposed even se¤or montefalderon a quiet gentlemanlike person altogether superior in deportment to the bustle and fuss that usually marks the manners of persons in trade was disturbed for to him the blow was heavy indeed whether he were acting for himself or was an agent of the mexican government the loss was much the same  tom is right enough put in spike rather coolly for the circumstancesthat there schooner of yourn has foundered don wan as any one can see she must have capsized and filled for i obsarved they had left the hatches off meaning no doubt to make an end of the storage as soon as they had done sleeping  and what has become of all her men don esteban for so the mexican politely called his companion have all my poor countrymen perished in this disaster  i fear they have don wan for i see no head as of any one swimming the vessel lay so near that island next to it that a poor swimmer would have no difficulty in reaching the place but there is no living thing to be seen but man the boat men we will go to the spot se¤or and examine for ourselves  there were two boats in the water and alongside of the brig one was the swashs yawl a small but convenient craft while the other was much larger fitted with a sail and had all the appearance of having been built to withstand breezes and seas mulford felt perfectly satisfied the moment he saw this boat which had come into the haven in tow of the schooner that it had been originally in the service of the lighthouse keeper as there was a very general desire among those on the quarterdeck to go to the assistance of the schooner spike ordered both boats manned jumping into the yawl himself accompanied by don juan montefalderon and telling mulford to follow with the larger craft bringing with him as many of the females as might choose to accompany him as mrs budd thought it incumbent on her to be active in such a scene all did go including biddy though with great reluctance on the part of rose  with the buoy for a guide spike had no difficulty in finding the spot where the schooner lay she had scarcely shifted her berth in the least there having been no time for her even to swing to the gust but she had probably capsized at the first blast filled and gone down instantly the water was nearly as clear as the calm mild atmosphere of the tropics and it was almost as easy to discern the vessel and all her hamper as if she lay on a beach she had sunk as she filled or on her side and still continued in that position as the water was little more than three fathoms deep the upper side was submerged but a few inches and her yardarms would have been out of the water but for the circumstance that the yards had canted under the pressure  at first no sign was seen of any of those who had been on board this illfated schooner when she went down it was known that twentyone souls were in her including the man and the boy who had belonged to the lighthouse as the boat moved slowly over this sad ruin however a horrible and startling spectacle came in view two bodies were seen within a few feet of the surface of the water one grasped in the arms of the other in the gripe of despair the man held in the grasp was kept beneath the water solely by the deathlock of his companion who was himself held where he floated by the circumstance that one of his feet was entangled in a rope the struggle could not have been long over for the two bodies were slowly settling toward the bottom when first seen it is probable that both these men had more than once risen to the surface in their dreadful struggle spike seized a boathook and made an effort to catch the clothes of the nearest body but ineffectually both sinking to the sands beneath lifeless and without motion there being no sharks in sight mulford volunteered to dive and fasten a line to one of these unfortunate men whom don juan declared at once was the schooners captain some little time was lost in procuring a leadline from the brig when the lead was dropped alongside of the drowned provided with another piece of the same sort of line which had a small running bowline around that which was fastened to the lead the mate made his plunge and went down with great vigour of arm it required resolution and steadiness to descend so far into salt water but harry succeeded and rose with the bodies which came up with the slightest impulse all were immediately got into the boat and away the latter went toward the lighthouse which was nearer and more easy of access than the brig  it is probable that one of these unfortunate men might have been revived under judicious treatment but he was not fated to receive it spike who knew nothing of such matters undertook to direct everything and instead of having recourse to warmth and gentle treatment he ordered the bodies to be rolled on a cask suspended them by the heels and resorted to a sort of practice that might have destroyed well men instead of resuscitating those in whom the vital spark was dormant if not actually extinct  two hours later rose seated in her own cabin unavoidably overheard the following dialogue which passed in english a language that se¤or montefalderon spoke perfectly well as has been said  well se¤or said spike i hope this little accident will not prevent our final trade you will want the brig now to take the schooners place  and how am i to pay you for the brig se¤or spike even if i buy her  ill ventur to guess there is plenty of money in mexico though they do say the government is so backward about paying i have always found you punctual and am not afraid to put faith in you agin  but i have no longer any money to pay you half in hand as i did for the powder when last in new york  the bag was pretty well lined with doubloons when i saw it last se¤or  and do you know where that bag is and where there is another that holds the same sum  spike started and he mused in silence some little time ere he again spoke  i had forgotten he at length answered the gold must have all gone down in the schooner along with the powder  and the poor men  why as for the men se¤or more may be had for the asking but powder and doubloons will be hard to find when most wanted then the men were poor men accordin to my idees of what an able seaman should be or they never would have let their schooner turn turtle with them as she did  we will talk of the money don esteban if you please said the mexican with reserve  with all my heart don wannothing is more agreeable to me than money how many of them doubloons shall fall to my share if i raise the schooner and put you in possession of your craft again  can that be done se¤or demanded don juan earnestly  a seaman can do almost anything in that way don wan if you will give him time and means for onehalf the doubloons i can find in the wrack the job shall be done  you can have them answered don juan quietly a good deal surprised that spike should deem it necessary to offer him any part of the sum he might find as for the powder i suppose that is lost to my country  not at all don wan the flour is well packed around it and i dont expect it would take any harm in a month i shall not only turn over the flour to you just as if nothing had happened but i shall put four firstrate hands aboard your schooner who will take her into port for you with a good deal more sartainty than forty of the men you had my mate is a prime navigator  this concluded the bargain every word of which was heard by rose and every word of which she did not fail to communicate to mulford the moment there was an opportunity the young man heard it with great interest telling rose that he should do all he could to assist in raising the schooner in the hope that something might turn up to enable him to escape in her taking off rose and her aunt as for his carrying her into a mexican port let them trust him for that agreeably to the arrangement orders were given that afternoon to commence the necessary preparations for the work and considerable progress was made in them by the time the swashs people were ordered to knock off work for the night  after the sun had set the reaction in the currents again commenced and it blew for a few hours heavily during the night toward morning however it moderated and when the sun reappeared it scarcely ever diffused its rays over a more peaceful or quiet day spike caused all hands to be called and immediately set about the important business he had before him  in order that the vessel might be as free as possible jack tier was directed to skull the females ashore in the brigs yawl se¤or montefalderon a man of polished manners as we maintain is very apt to be the case with mexican gentlemen whatever may be the opinion of this good republic on the subject just at this moment asked permission to be of the party mulford found an opportunity to beg rose if they landed at the light to reconnoitre the place well with a view to ascertain what facilities it could afford in an attempt to escape they did land at the light and glad enough were mrs budd rose and biddy to place their feet on terr  firm after so long a confinement to the narrow limits of a vessel  well said jack tier as they walked up to the spot where the buildings stood this is a rum place for a lightus miss rose and i dont wonder the keeper and his messmates has cleared out  i am very sorry to say observed se¤or montefalderon whose countenance expressed the concern he really felt that the keeper and his only companion a boy were on board the schooner and have perished in her in common with so many of my poor countrymen there are the graves of two whom we buried here last evening after vain efforts to restore them to life  what a dreadful catastrophe it has been se¤or said rose whose sweet countenance eloquently expressed the horror and regret she so naturally felttwenty fellowbeings hurried into eternity without even an instant for prayer  you feel for them se¤oritait is natural you should and it is natural that i their countryman and leader should feel for them also i do not know what god has in reserve for my unfortunate country we may have cruel and unscrupulous men among us se¤orita but we have thousands who are just and brave and honourable  so mr mulford tells me se¤or and he has been much in your ports on the west coast  i like that young man and wonder not a little at his and your situation in this brig rejoined the mexican dropping his voice so as not to be heard by their companions as they walked a little ahead of mrs budd and biddy the se¤or spike is scarcely worthy to be his commander or your guardian  yet you find him worthy of your intercourse and trust don juan  the mexican shrugged his shoulders and smiled equivocally still in a melancholy manner it would seem he did not deem it wise to push this branch of the subject further since he turned to another  i like the se¤or mulford he resumed for his general deportment and principles so far as i can judge of him on so short an acquaintance  excuse me se¤or interrupted rose hurriedlybut you never saw him until you met him here  neveri understand you se¤orita and can do full justice to the young mans character i am willing to think he did not know the errand of his vessel or i should not have seen him now but what i most like him for is this last night during the gale he and i walked the deck together for an hour we talked of mexico and of this war so unfortunate for my country already and which may become still more so when he uttered this noble sentimentmy country is more powerful than yours se¤or montefalderon he said and in this it has been more favoured by god you have suffered from ambitious rulers and from military rule while we have been advancing under the arts of peace favoured by a most beneficent providence as for this war i know but little about it though i dare say the mexican government may have been wrong in some things that it might have controlled and some that it might notbut let right be where it will i am sorry to see a nation that has taken so firm a stand in favour of popular government pressed upon so hard by another that is supposed to be the great support of such principles america and mexico are neighbours and ought to be friends and while i do not cannot blame my own country for pursuing the war with vigour nothing would please me more than to hear peace proclaimed  that is just like harry mulford said rose thoughtfully as soon as her companion ceased to speak i do wish se¤or that there could be no use for this powder that is now buried in the sea  don juan montefalderon smiled and seemed a little surprised that the fair young thing at his side should have known of the treacherous contents of the flourbarrels no doubt he found it inexplicable that persons like rose and mulford should seemingly be united with one like spike but he was too well bred and indeed too effectually mystified to push the subject further than might be discreet  by this time they were near the entrance of the lighthouse into which the whole party entered in a sort of mute awe at its silence and solitude at se¤or montefalderons invitation they ascended to the lantern whence they could command a wide and fair view of the surrounding waters the reef was much more apparent from that elevation than from below and rose could see that numbers of its rocks were bare while on other parts of it there was the appearance of many feet of water rose gazed at it with longing eyes for from a few remarks that had fallen from mulford she suspected he had hopes of escaping among its channels and coral  as they descended and walked through the buildings rose also took good heed of the supplies the place afforded there were flour and beef and pork and many other of the common articles of food as well as water in a cistern that caught it as it flowed from the roof of the dwelling water was also to be found in casksnothing like a spring or a well existing among those islets all these things rose noted putting them aside in her memory for ready reference hereafter  in the mean time the mariners were not idle spike moved his brig and moored her head and stern alongside of the wreck before the people got their breakfasts as soon as that meal was ended both captain and mate set about their duty in earnest mulford carried out an anchor on the offside of the swash and dropped it at a distance of about eighty fathoms from the vessels beam purchases were brought from both mastheads of the brig to the chain of this anchor and were hove upon until the vessel was given a heel of more than a streak and the cable was tolerably taut other purchases were got up opposite and overhauled down in readiness to take hold of the schooners masts the anchor of the schooner was weighed by its buoyrope and the chain after being rove through the upper or opposite hawsehole brought in on board the swash another chain was dropped astern in such a way that when the schooner came upright it would be sure to pass beneath her keel some six or eight feet from the rudder slings were then sunk over the mastheads and the purchases were hooked on hours were consumed in these preliminary labours and the people went to dinner as soon as they were completed  when the men had dined spike brought one of his purchases to the windlass and the other to the capstan though not until each was bowsed taut by hand a few minutes having brought the strain so far on everything as to enable a seaman like spike to form some judgment of the likelihood that his preventers and purchases would stand some changes were found necessary to equalize the strain but on the whole the captain was satisfied with his work and the crew were soon ordered to heaveaway the windlass best  in the course of half an hour the hull of the vessel which lay on its bilge began to turn on its keel and the heads of the spars to rise above the water this was the easiest part of the process all that was required of the purchases being to turn over a mass which rested on the sands of the bay aided by the long levers afforded by the spars the work advanced so rapidly that in just one hours time after his people had begun to heave spike had the pleasure to see the schooner standing upright alongside of his own brig though still sunk to the bottom the wreck was secured in this position by means of guys and preventers in order that it might not again cant when the order was issued to hook on the slings that were to raise it to the surface these slings were the chains of the schooner one of which went under her keel while for the other the captain trusted to the strength of the two hawseholes having passed the cable out of one and in at the other in a way to serve his purposes as has just been stated  when all was ready spike mustered his crew and made a speech he told the men that he was about a job that was out of the usual line of their duty and that he knew they had a right to expect extra pay for such extra work the schooner contained money and his object was to get at it if he succeeded their reward would be a doubloon a man which would be earning more than a months wages by twentyfour hours work this was enough the men wanted to hear no more but they cheered their commander and set about their task in the happiest disposition possible  the reader will understand that the object to be first achieved was to raise a vessel with a hold filled with flour and gunpowder from off the bottom of the bay to its surface as she stood the deck of this vessel was about six feet under water and every one will understand that her weight so long as it was submerged in a fluid as dense as that of the sea would be much more manageable than if suspended in air the barrels for instance were not much heavier than the water they displaced and the wood work of the vessel itself was on the whole positively lighter than the element in which it had sunk as for the water in the hold that was of the same weight as the water on the outside of tne craft and there had not been much to carry the schooner down beside her iron the spars that were out of water and her ballast this last some ten or twelve tons in weight was in fact the principal difficulty and alone induced spike to have any doubts about his eventual success there was no foreseeing the result until he had made a trial however and the order was again given to heave away  to the infinite satisfaction of the swashs crew the weight was found quite manageable so long as the hull remained beneath the water mulford with three or four assistants was kept on board the schooner lightening her by getting the other anchor off her bows and throwing the different objects overboard or on the decks of the brig by the time the bulwarks reached the surface as much was gained in this way as was lost by having so much of the lighter woodwork rise above the water as a matter of course however the weight increased as the vessel rose and more especially as the lower portion of the spars the bowsprit boom c from being buoyant assistants became so much dead weight to be lifted  spike kept a watchful eye on his spars and the extra supports he had given them he was moving the whole time from point to point feeling shrouds and backstays and preventers in order to ascertain the degree of strain on each or examining how the purchases stood as for the crew they cheered at their toil incessantly passing from capstan bars to the handspikes and vice vers they too felt that their task was increasing in resistance as it advanced and now found it more difficult to gain an inch than it had been at first to gain a foot they seemed indeed to be heaving their own vessel out instead of heaving the other craft up and it was not long before they had the swash heeling over toward the wreck several streaks the strain moreover on everything became not only severe but somewhat menacing every shroud backstay and preventer was as taut as a bar of iron and the chaincable that led to the anchor planted off abeam was as straight as if the brig were riding by it in a gale of wind one or two ominous surges aloft too had been heard and though no more than straps and slings settling into their places under hard strains they served to remind the crew that danger might come from that quarter such was the state of things when spike called out to heave and pall that he might take a look at the condition of the wreck  although a great deal remained to be done in order to get the schooner to float a great deal had already been done her precise condition was as follows having no cabin windows the water had entered her when she capsized by the only four apertures her construction possessed these were the companionway or cabindoors the skylight the mainhatch or the large inlet amidships by which cargo went up and down and the boobyhatch which was the counterpart of the companionway forward being intended to admit of ingress to the forecastle the apartment of the crew each of these hatchways or orifices had the usual defences of coamings strong framework around their margins these coamings rose six or eight inches above the deck and answered the double purpose of strengthening the vessel in a part that without them would be weaker han common and of preventing any water that might be washing about the decks from running below as soon therefore as these three apertures or their coamings could be raised above the level of the water of the basin all danger of the vessels receiving any further tribute of that sort from the ocean would be over it was to this end consequently that spikes efforts had been latterly directed though they had only in part succeeded the schooner possessed a good deal of sheer as it is termed or her two extremities rose nearly a foot above her centre when on an even keel this had brought her extremities first to the surface and it was the additional weight which had consequently been brought into the air that had so much increased the strain and induced spike to pause the deck forward as far aft as the foremast and aft as far forward as the centre of the trunk or to the skylight was above the water or at least awash while all the rest of it was covered in the vicinity of the mainhatch there were several inches of water enough indeed to leave the upper edge of the coamings submerged by about an inch to raise the keel that inch by means of the purchases spike well knew would cost him more labour and would incur more risk than all that had been done previously and he paused before he would attempt it  the men were now called from the brig and ordered to come on board the schooner spike ascertained by actual measurement how much was wanted to bring the coamings of the mainhatch above the water until which he knew pumping and bailing would be useless he found it was quite an inch and was at a great loss to know how that inch should be obtained mulford advised another trial with the handspikes and bars but to this spike would not consent he believed that the masts of the brig had already as much pressure on them as they would bear the mate next proposed getting the main boom off the vessel and to lighten the craft by cutting away her bowsprit and masts the captain was well enough disposed to do this but he doubted whether it would meet with the approbation of don wan who was still ashore with rose and her aunt and who probably looked forward to recovering his gunpowder by means of those very spars at length the carpenter hit upon a plan that was adopted  this plan was very simple though it had its own ingenuity it will be remembered that water could now only enter the vessels hold at the mainhatch all the other hatchways having their coamings above the element the carpenter proposed therefore that the mainhatches which had been off when the tornado occurred but which had been found on deck when the vessel righted should now be put on oakum being first laid along in their rabbetings and that the cracks should be stuffed with additional oakum to exclude as much water as possible he thought that two or three men by using caulking irons for ten minutes would make the hatchway so tight that very little water would penetrate while this was doing he himself would bore as many holes forward and aft as he could with a two inch auger out of which the water then in the vessel would be certain to run spike was delighted with this project and gave the necessary orders on the spot  this much must be said of the crew of the molly swashwhatever they did in their own profession they did intelligently and well on the present occasion they maintained their claim to this character and were both active and expert the hatches were soon on and in an imperfect manner caulked while this was doing the carpenter got into a boat and going under the schooners bows where a whole plank was out of water he chose a spot between two of the timbers and bored a hole as near the surface of the water as he dared to do not satisfied with one hole however he bored manychoosing both sides of the vessel to make them and putting some aft as well as forward in a word in the course of twenty minutes the schooner was tapped in at least a dozen places and jets of water two inches in diameter were spouting from her on each bow and under each quarter  spike and mulford noted the effect some water doubtless still worked itself into the vessel about the mainhatch but that more flowed from her by means of the outlets just named was quite apparent after close watching at the outlets for some time spike was convinced that the schooner was slowly rising the intense strain that still came from the brig producing that effect as the vessel gradually became lighter by the end of half an hour there could be no longer any doubt the holes which had been bored within an inch of the water being now fully two inches above it the auger was applied anew still nearer to the surface of the sea and as fresh outlets were made those that began to manifest a dulness in their streams were carefully plugged  spike now thought it was time to take a look at the state of things on deck here to his joy he ascertained that the coamings had actually risen a little above the water the reader is not to suppose by this rising of the vessel that she had become sufficiently buoyant in consequence of the water that had run out of her to float of herself this was far from being the case but the constant upward pressure from the brig which on mechanical principles tended constantly to bring that craft upright had the effect to lift the schooner as the latter was gradually relieved from the weight that pressed her toward the bottom  the hatches were next removed when it was found that the water in the schooners hold had so far lowered as to leave a vacant space of quite a foot between the lowest part of the deck and its surface toward the two extremities of the vessel this space necessarily was much increased in consequence of the sheer men were now sent into the hatchway with orders to hook on to the flourbarrelsa whip having been rigged in readiness to hoist them on deck at the same time gangs were sent to the pumps though spike still depended for getting rid of the water somewhat on the augerthe carpenter continuing to bore and plug his holes as new opportunities offered and the old outlets became useless it was true this expedient would soon cease for the water having found its level in the vessels hold was very nearly on a level also with that on the outside bailing also was commenced both forward and aft  spikes next material advantage was obtained by means of the cargo by the time the sun had set fully two hundred barrels had been rolled into the hatchway and passed on deck whence about half of them were sent in the lighthouse boat to the nearest islet and the remainder were transferred to the deck of the brig these last were placed on the off side of the swash and aided in bringing her nearer upright a great deal was gained in getting rid of these barrels the water in the schooner lowered just as much as the space they had occupiedand the vessel was relieved at once of twenty tons in weight  just after the sun had set se¤or don juan montefalderon and his party returned on board they had staid on the island to the last moment at roses request for she had taken as close an observation of everything as possible in order to ascertain if any means of concealment existed in the event of her aunt biddy and herself quitting the brig the islets were all too naked and too small however and she was compelled to return to the swash without any hopes derived from this quarter  spike had just directed the people to get their suppers as the mexican came on board together they descended to the schooners deck where they had a long but secret conference se¤or montefalderon was a calm quiet and reasonable man and while he felt as one would be apt to feel who had recently seen so many associates swept suddenly out of existence the late catastrophe did not in the least unman him it is too much the habit of the american people to receive their impressions from newspapers which throw off their articles unreflectingly and often ignorantly as crones in petticoats utter their gossip in a word the opinions thus obtained are very much on a level in value with the thoughts of those who are said to think aloud and who give utterance to all the crudities and trivial rumours that may happen to reach their ears in this manner we apprehend very false notions of our neighbours of mexico have become circulated among us that nation is a mixed race and has necessarily the various characteristics of such an origin and it is unfortunately little influenced by the diffusion of intelligence which certainly exists here although an enemy it ought to be acknowledged however that even mexico has her redeeming points anglosaxons as we are we have no desire unnecessarily to illustrate that very marked feature in the anglosaxon character which prompts the mother stock to calumniate all who oppose it but would rather adopt some of that chivalrous courtesy of which so much that is lofty and commendable is to be found among the descendants of old spain  the se¤or montefalderon was earnestly engaged in what he conceived to be the cause of his country it was scarcely possible to bring together two men impelled by motives more distinct than spike and this gentleman the first was acting under impulses of the lowest and most grovelling nature while the last was influenced by motives of the highest however much mexico may and has weakened her cause by her own punic faith instability military oppression and political revolutions giving to the texans in particular ample justification for their revolt it was not probable that don juan montefalderon saw the force of all the arguments that a casuist of ordinary ingenuity could certainly adduce against his country for it is a most unusual thing to find a man anywhere who is willing to admit that the positions of an opponent are good he saw in the events of the day a province wrested from his nation and in his reasoning on the subject entirely overlooking the numerous occasions on which his own fluctuating government had given sufficient justification not to say motives to their powerful neighbours to take the law into their own hands and redress themselves he fancied all that has occurred was previously planned instead of regarding it as it truly is as merely the result of political events that no man could have foreseen that no man had originally imagined or that any man could control  don juan understood spike completely and quite justly appreciated not only his character but his capabilities their acquaintance was not of a day though it had ever been marked by that singular combination of caution and reliance that is apt to characterize the intercourse between the knave and the honest man when circumstances compel not only communication but to a certain extent confidence they now paced the deck of the schooner side by side for fully an hour during which time the price of the vessel the means and the mode of payment and transfer were fully settled between them  but what will you do with your passengers don esteban asked the mexican pleasantly when the more material points were adjusted i feel a great interest in the young lady in particular who is a charming se¤orita and who tells me that her aunt brought her this voyage on account of her health she looks much too blooming to be out of health and if she were this is a singular voyage for an invalid to make  you dont understand human natur yet altogether i see don wan answered spike chuckling and winking as you and i are not only good friends but what a body may call old friends ill let you into a secret in this affair well knowing that youll not betray it its quite true that the old woman thinks her niece is a pulmonary as they call it and that this vyge is recommended for her but the gal is as healthy as shes handsom  her constitution then must be very excellent for it is seldom i have seen so charming a young woman but if the aunt is misled in this matter how has it been with the niece  spike did not answer in words but he leered upon his companion and he winked  you mean to be understood that you are in intelligence with each other i suppose don esteban returned the se¤or montefalderon who did not like the captains manner and was willing to drop the discourse  spike then informed his companion in confidence that he and rose were affianced though without the aunts knowledgethat he intended to marry the niece the moment he reached a mexican port with the brig and that it was their joint intention to settle in the country he added that the affair required management as his intended had property and expected more and he begged don juan to aid him as things drew near to a crisis the mexican evaded an answer and the discourse dropped  the moon was now shining and would continue to throw its pale light over the scene for two or three hours longer spike profited by the circumstance to continue the work of lightening the schooner one of the first things done next was to get up the dead and to remove them to the boat this melancholy office occupied an hour the bodies being landed on the islet near the powder and there interred in the sands don juan montefalderon attended on this occasion and repeated some prayers over the graves as he had done in the morning in the cases of the two who had been buried near the lighthouse  while this melancholy duty was in the course of performance that of pumping and bailing was continued under the immediate personal superintendence of mulford it would not be easy to define with perfect clearness the conflicting feelings by which the mate of the swash was now impelled he had no longer any doubt on the subject of spikes treason and had it not been for rose he would not have hesitated a moment about making off in the lighthouse boat for key west in order to report all that had passed to the authorities but not only rose was there and to be cared for but what was far more difficult to get along with her aunt was with her it is true mrs budd was no longer spikes dupe but under any circumstances she was a difficult subject to manage and most especially so in all matters that related to the sea then the young man submitted more or less to the strange influence which a fine craft almost invariably obtains over those that belong to her he did not like the idea of deserting the swash at the very moment he would not have hesitated about punishing her owner for his many misdeeds in a word harry was too much of a tar not to feel a deep reluctance to turn against his cruise or his voyage however much either might be condemned by his judgment or even by his principles  it was quite nine oclock when the se¤or montefalderon and spike returned from burying the dead no sooner did the last put his foot on the deck of his own vessel than he felt the fall of one of the purchases which had been employed in raising the schooner it was so far slack as to satisfy him that the latter now floated by her own buoyancy though it might be well to let all stand until morning for the purposes of security thus apprised of the condition of the two vessels he gave the welcome order to knock off for the night  chapter vi     at the piping of all hands   when the judgment signals spread   when the islands and the land   and the seas give up their dead   and the south and the north shall come   when the sinner is dismayed   and the just man is afraid   then heaven be thy aid   poor tom  brainard  the people had now a cessation from their toil of all the labour known to seafaring men that of pumping is usually thought to be the most severe those who work at it have to be relieved every minute and it is only by having gangs to succeed each other that the duty can be done at all with anything like steadiness in the present instance it is true that the people of the swash were sustained by the love of gold but glad enough were they when mulford called out to them to knock off and turn in for the night it was high time this summons should be made for not only were the people excessively wearied but the customary hours of labour were so far spent that the light of the moon had some time before begun to blend with the little left by the parting sun glad enough were all hands to quit the toil and two minutes were scarcely elapsed ere most of the crew had thrown themselves down and were buried in deep sleep even spike and mulford took the rest they needed the cook alone being left to look out for the changes in the weather in a word everybody but this idler was exhausted with pumping and bailing and even gold had lost its power to charm until nature was recruited by rest  the excitement produced by the scenes through which they had so lately passed caused the females to sleep soundly too the deathlike stillness which pervaded the vessel contributed to their rest and rose never woke from the first few minutes after her head was on her pillow until near four in the morning the deep quiet seemed ominous to one who had so lately witnessed the calm which precedes the tornado and she arose in that low latitude and warm season few clothes were necessary and our heroine was on deck in a very few minutes here she found the same gravelike sleep pervading everything there was not a breath of air and the ocean seemed to be in one of its profoundest slumbers the hardbreathing of spike could be heard through the open windows of his stateroom and this was positively the only sound that was audible the common men who lay scattered about the decks more especially from the mainmast forward seemed to be so many logs and from mulford no breathing was heard  the morning was neither very dark nor very light it being easy to distinguish objects that were near while those at a distance were necessarily lost in obscurity availing herself of the circumstance rose went as far as the gangway to ascertain if the cook were at his post she saw him lying near his galley in as profound a sleep as any of the crew this she felt to be wrong and she felt alarmed though she knew not why perhaps it was the consciousness of being the only person up and awake at that hour of deepest night in a vessel so situated as the swash and in a climate in which hurricanes seem to be the natural offspring of the air some one must be aroused and her tastes feelings and judgment all pointed to harry mulford as the person she ought to awaken he slept habitually in his clothesthe lightest summer dress of the tropics and the window of his little stateroom was always open for air moving lightly to the place rose laid her own little soft hand on the arm of the young man when the latter was on his feet in an instant a single moment only was necessary to regain his consciousness when mulford left the stateroom and joined rose on the quarterdeck  why am i called rose the young man asked attempering his voice to the calm that reigned around him and why am i called by you  rose explained the state of the brig and the feeling which induced her to awaken him with womans gentleness she now expressed her regret for having robbed harry of his rest had she reflected a moment she might have kept watch herself and allowed him to obtain the sleep he must surely so much require  but mulford laughed at this protested he had never been awakened at a more favourable moment and would have sworn had it been proper that a minutes further sleep would have been too much for him after these first explanations mulford walked round the decks carefully felt how much strain there was on the purchases and rejoined rose to report that all was right and that he did not consider it necessary to call even the cook the black was an idler in no sense but that of keeping watch and he had toiled the past day as much as any of the men though it was not exactly at the pumps  a long and semiconfidential conversation now occurred between harry and rose they talked of spike the brig and her cargo and of the delusion of the captains widow it was scarcely possible that powder should be so much wanted at the havanna as to render smuggling at so much cost a profitable adventure and mulford admitted his convictions that the pretended flour was originally intended for mexico rose related the tenor of the conversation she had overheard between the two parties don juan and don esteban and the mate no longer doubted that it was spikes intention to sell the brig to the enemy she also alluded to what had passed between herself and the stranger  mulford took this occasion to introduce the subject of jack tiers intimacy and favour with rose he even professed to feel some jealousy on account of it little as there might be to alarm most men in the rivalry of such a competitor rose laughed as girls will laugh when there is question of their power over the other sex and she fairly shook her rich tresses as she declared her determination to continue to smile on jack to the close of the voyage then as if she had said more than she intended she added with womans generosity and tendernessafter all harry you know how much i promised to you even before we sailed and how much more since and have no just cause to dread even jack there is another reason however that ought to set your mind entirely at case on his account jack is married and has a partner living at this very moment as he does not scruple to avow himself  a hissing noise a bright light and a slight explosion interrupted the halflaughing girl and mulford turning on his heel quick as thought saw that a rocket had shot into the air from a point close under the bows of the brig he was still in the act of moving toward the forecastle when at the distance of several leagues he saw the explosion of another rocket high in the air he knew enough of the practices of vessels of war to feel certain that these were a signal and its answer from some one in the service of government not at all sorry to have the career of the swash arrested before she could pass into hostile hands or before evil could befall rose mulford reached the forecastle just in time to answer the inquiry that was immediately put to him in the way of a hail a gig pulling four oars only with two officers in its sternsheets was fairly under the vessels bows and the mate could almost distinguish the countenance of the officer who questioned him the instant he showed his head and shoulders above the bulwarks  what vessels are these demanded the stranger speaking in the authoritative manner of one who acted for the state but not speaking much above the usual conversational tone  american and spanish was the answer this brig is americanthe schooner alongside is a spaniard that turned turtle in a tornado about sixandthirty hours since and on which we have been hard at work trying to raise her since the gale which succeeded the tornado has blown its pipe out  ay ay thats the story is it i did not know what to make of you lying cheek by jowl in this fashion was anybody lost on board the schooner  all hands including every soul aft and forward the supercargo excepted who happened to be aboard here we buried seventeen bodies this afternoon on the smallest of the keys that you see near at hand and two this morning alongside of the light but what boat is that and where are you from and whom are you signalling  the boat is a gig answered the stranger deliberately and she belongs to a cruiser of uncle sams that is off the reef a short bit to the eastward and we signalled our captain but ill come on board you sir if you please  mulford walked aft to meet the stranger at the gangway and was relieved rather than otherwise at finding that spike was already on the quarterdeck should the vessel of war seize the brig he could rejoice at it but so strong were his professional ideas of duty to the craft he sailed in that he did not find it in his heart to say aught against her were any mishap to befall it or were justice to be done he preferred that it might be done under spikes own supervision rather than under his  call all hands mr mulford said spike as they met i see a streak of day coming yonder in the eastlet all hands be called at once what strange boat is this we have alongside  this question was put to the strangers spike standing on his gangwayladder to ask it while the mate was summoning the crew the officer saw that a new person was to be dealt with and in his quiet easy way he answered while stretching out his hands to take the manropeyour servant sirwe are manofwars men belonging to one of uncle sams craft outside and have just come in to pay you a visit of ceremony i told one whom i suppose was your mate that i would just step on board of you  ay ayone at a time if you please its wartime and i cannot suffer armed boats crews to board me at night without knowing something about them come up yourself if you please but order your people to stay in the boat here muster about this gangway half a dozen of you and keep an eye on the crew of this strange boat  these orders had no effect on the cool and deliberate lieutenant who ascended the brigs side and immediately stood on her deck no sooner had he and spike confronted each other than each gave a little start like that of recognition and the lieutenant spoke  ay ayi believe i know this vessel now it is the molly swash of new york bound to key west and a market and i have the honour to see captain stephen spike again  it was mr wallace the second lieutenant of the sloopofwar that had boarded the brig in the mona passage and to avoid whom spike had gone to the southward of jamaica the meeting was very malpropos but it would not do to betray that the captain and owner of the vessel thought as much as this on the contrary wallace was warmly welcomed and received not only as an old acquaintance but as a very agreeable visiter to have seen the two as they walked aft together one might have supposed that the meeting was conducive of nothing but a very mutual satisfaction it was so much like that which happens between those who keep up a hearty acquaintance  well im glad to see you again captain spike cried wallace after the greetings were passed if it be only to ask where you flew to the day we left you in the mona passage we looked out for you with all our eyes expecting you would be down between san domingo and jamaica but i hardly think you got by us in the night our master thinks you must have dove and gone past loonfashion do you ever perform that manoeuvre  no weve kept above water the whole time lieutenant answered spike heartily and that is more than can be said of the poor fellow alongside of us i was so much afraid of the isle of pines that i went round jamaica  you might have given the isle of pines a berth and still have passed to the northward of the englishmen said wallace a little drily however that island is somewhat of a scarecrow and we have been to take a look at it ourselves alls right there just now but you seem light what have you done with your flour  parted with every barrel of it you may remember i was bound to key west and a market well i found my market here in american waters  you have been lucky sir this emporium does not seem to be exactly a commercial emporium  the fact is the flour is intended for the havanna and i fancy it is to be shipped for slavers but i am to know nothing of all that youll understand lieutenant if i sell my flour in american waters at two prices its no concern of mine what becomes of it aterwards  unless it happen to pass into enemys hands certainly not and you are too patriotic to deal with mexico just now im sure pray did that flour go down when the schooner turned turtle  every barrel of it but don wan below there thinks that most of it may yet be saved by landing it on one of those keys to dry flour well packed wets in slowly you see we have some of it on deck  and who may don wan be sir pray we are sent here to look after dons and donas you know  don wan is a cuban merchant and deals in such articles as he wants i fell in with him among the reefs here where he was rummaging about in hopes of meeting with a wrack he tells me and thinking to purchase something profitable in that way but finding i had flour he agreed to take it out of me at this anchorage and send me away in ballast at once i have found don wan montefalderon ready pay and very honourable  wallace then requested an explanation of the disaster to the details of which he listened with a sailors interest he asked a great many questions all of which bore on the more nautical features of the event and day having now fairly appeared he examined the purchases and backings of the swash with professional nicety the schooner was no lower in the water than when the men had knocked off work the previous night and spike set the people at the pumps and their bailing again as the most effectual method of preventing their making any indiscreet communications to the manofwars men  about this time the relict appeared on deck when spike gallantly introduced the lieutenant anew to his passengers it is true he knew no name to use but that was of little moment as he called the officer the lieutenant and nothing else  mrs budd was delighted with this occasion to showoff and she soon broke out on the easy indolent but waggish wallace in a strain to surprise him notwithstanding the specimen of the ladys skill from which he had formerly escaped  captain spike is of opinion lieutenant that our castanchor here is excellent and i know the value of a good castanchor place for my poor mr budd was a seafaring man and taught me almost as much of your noble profession as he knew himself  and he taught you maam said wallace fairly opening his eyes under the influence of astonishment to be very particular about castanchor places  indeed he did he used to say that roadsinstead were never as good for such purposes as land thats locked havens for the anchors would return home as he called it in roadsinstead  yes maam answered wallace looking very queer at first as if disposed to laugh outright then catching a glance of rose and changing his mind i perceive that mr budd knew what he was about and preferred an anchorage where he was well landlocked and where there was no danger of his anchors coming home as so often happens in your open roadsteads  yes thats just it that was just his notion you cannot feel how delightful it is rose to converse with one that thoroughly understands such subjects my poor mr budd did indeed denounce roadsinstead at all times calling them savage  savage aunt put in rose hoping to stop the good relict by her own interpositionthat is a strange word to apply to an anchorage  not at all young lady said wallace gravely they are often wild berths and wild berths are not essentially different from wild beasts each is savage as a matter of course  i knew i was right exclaimed the widow savage castanchors come of wild births as do savage indians oh the language of the ocean as my poor mr budd used to say is eloquence tempered by common sense  wallace stared again but his attention was called to other things just at that moment the appearance of don juan montefalderon y castro on deck reminded him of his duty and approaching that gentleman he condoled with him on the grave loss he had sustained after a few civil expressions on both sides wallace made a delicate allusion to the character of the schooner  under other circumstances he said it might be my duty to inquire a little particularly as to the nationality of your vessel se¤or for we are at war with the mexicans as you doubtless know  certainly answered don juan with an unmoved air and great politeness of manner though it would be out of my power to satisfy you everything was lost in the schooner and i have not a paper of any sort to show you if it be your pleasure to make a prize of a vessel in this situation certainly it is in your power to do it a few barrels of wet flour are scarce worth disputing about  wallace now seemed a little ashamed the sang froid of the other throwing dust in his eyes and he was in a hurry to change the subject se¤or don juan was very civilly condoled with again and he was made to repeat the incidents of the loss as if his auditor took a deep interest in what he said but no further hint was given touching the nationality of the vessel the lieutenants tact let him see that se¤or montefalderon was a person of a very different calibre from spike as well as of different habits and he did not choose to indulge in the quiet irony that formed so large an ingredient in his own character with this new acquaintance he spoke spanish himself with tolerable fluency and a conversation now occurred between the two which was maintained for some time with spirit and a very manifest courtesy  this dialogue between wallace and the spaniard gave spike a little leisure for reflection as the day advanced the cruiser came more and more plainly in view and his first business was to take a good survey of her she might have been three leagues distant but approaching with a very light breeze at the rate of something less than two knots in the hour unless there was some one on board her who was acquainted with the channels of the dry tortugas spike felt little apprehension of the ships getting very near to him but he very well understood that with the sort of artillery that was in modern use among vessels of war he would hardly be safe could the cruiser get within a league that near uncle sams craft might certainly come without encountering the hazards of the channels and within that distance she would be likely to get in the course of the morning should he have the complaisance to wait for her he determined therefore not to be guilty of that act of folly  all this time the business of lightening the schooner proceeded although mulford earnestly wished that the manofwar might get an accurate notion of the true character and objects of the brig he could not prevail on himself to become an informer in order to avoid the temptation so to do he exerted himself in keeping the men at their tasks and never before had pumping and bailing been carried on with more spirit the schooner soon floated of herself and the purchases which led to the swash were removed near a hundred more barrels of the flour had been taken out of the hold of the spanish craft and had been struck on the deck of the brig or sent to the key by means of the boats this made a material change in the buoyancy of the vessel and enabled the bailing to go on with greater facility the pumps were never idle but two small streams of water were running the whole time toward the scuppers and through them into the sea  at length the men were ordered to knock off and to get their breakfasts this appeared to arouse wallace who had been chatting quite agreeably to himself with rose and seemed reluctant to depart but who now became sensible that he was neglecting his duty he called away his boats crew and took a civil leave of the passengers after which he went over the side the gig was some little distance from the swash when wallace rose and asked to see spike with whom he had a word to say at parting  i will soon return he said and bring you forty or fifty fresh men who will make light work with your wreck i am certain our commander will consent to my doing so and will gladly send on board you two or three boats crews  if i let him muttered spike between his teeth i shall be a poor miserable castanchor devil thats all  to wallace however he expressed his hearty acknowledgments begged him not to be in a hurry as the worst was now over and the row was still a long one if he got back toward evening it would be all in good time wallace waved his hand and the gig glided away as for spike he sat down on the planksheer where he had stood and remained there ruminating intently for two or three minutes when he descended to the deck his mind was fully made up his first act was to give some private orders to the boatswain after which he withdrew to the cabin whither he summoned tier without delay  jack commenced the captain using very little circumlocution in opening his mind you and i are old shipmates and ought to be old friends though i think your natur has undergone some changes since we last met twenty years ago there was no man in the ship on whom i could so certainly depend as on jack tier now you seem given up altogether to the women your mind has changed even more than your body  time does that for all of us captain spike returned tier coolly i am not what i used to be ill own nor are you yourself for that matter when i saw you last noble captain you were a handsome man of forty and could go aloft with any youngster in the brig but now youre heavy and not overactive  inot a bit of change has taken place in me for the last thirty years i defy any man to show the contrary but thats neither here nor there you are no young woman jack that i need be boasting of my health and beauty before you i want a bit of real sarvice from you and want it done in oldtimes fashion and i mean to pay for it in oldtimes fashion too  as spike concluded he put into tiers hand one of the doubloons that he had received from se¤or montefalderon in payment for the powder the doubloons for which so much pumping and bailing were then in process were still beneath the waters of the gulf  ay ay sir returned jack smiling and pocketing the gold with a wink of the eye and a knowing look this does resemble old times sumat i now begin to know captain spike my old commander again and see that hes more like himself than i had just thought him what am i to do for this sir speak plain that i may be sartain to steer the true course  oh just a trifle jacknothing that will break up the groundtier of your wits my old shipmate you see the state of the brig and know that she is in no condition for ladies  t would have been better all round sir had they never come aboard at all answered jack looking dark  spike was surprised but he was too much bent on his projects to heed trifles  you know what sort of flour theyre whipping out of the schooner and must understand that the brig will soon be in a pretty litter i do not intend to let them send a single barrel of it beneath my hatches again but the deck and the islands must take it all now i wish to relieve my passengers from the confinement this will occasion and i have ordered the boatswain to pitch a tent for them on the largest of these here tortugas and what i want of you is to muster food and water and other womens knicknacks and go ashore with them and make them as comfortable as you can for a few days or until we can get this schooner loaded and off  jack tier looked at his commander as if he would penetrate his most secret thoughts a short pause succeeded during which the stewards mate was intently musing then his countenance suddenly brightened he gave the doubloon a fillip and caught it on the palm of his hand as it descended and he uttered the customary ay ay sir with apparent cheerfulness nothing more passed between these two worthies who now parted jack to make his arrangements and spike to tell his yarn as he termed the operation in his own mind to mrs budd rose and biddy the widow listened complacently though she seemed half doubting half ready to comply as for rose she received the proposal with delightthe confinement of the vessel having become irksome to her the principal obstacle was in overcoming the difficulties made by the aunt biddy appearing to like the notion quite as much as miss rosy as for the lighthouse mrs budd had declared nothing would induce her to go there for she did not doubt that the place would soon be if it were not already haunted in this opinion she was sustained by biddy and it was the knowledge of this opinion that induced spike to propose the tent  are you sure captain spike it is not a desert island asked the widow i remember that my poor mr budd always spoke of desert islands as horrid places and spots that every one should avoid  what if it is aunty said rose eagerly while we have the brig here close at hand we shall suffer none of the wants of such a place so long as our friends can supply us  and such friends miss rose exclaimed spike a little sentimentally for him friends that would undergo hunger and thirst themselves before you should want for any comforts  do now madam budd put in biddy in her hearty way its an island yell remimber and sure thats just what ould ireland has ever been god bless it islands make the pleasantest risidences  well ill venture to oblige you and biddy rosy dear returned the aunt still half reluctant to yield but youll remember that if i find it at all a desert island ill not pass the night on it on any account whatever  with this understanding the party was transferred to the shore the boatswain had already erected a sort of a tent on a favourable spot using some of the old sails that had covered the flourbarrels not only for the walls but for a carpet of some extent also this tent was ingeniously enough contrived in addition to the little room that was entirely enclosed there was a sort of piazza or open verandah which would enable its tenants to enjoy the shade in the open air beneath this verandah a barrel of fresh water was placed as well as three or four ships stools all of which had been sent ashore with the materials for constructing the tent the boat had been going and coming for some time and the distance being short the desert island was soon a desert no longer it is true that the supplies necessary to support three women for as many days were no great matter and were soon landed but jack tier had made a provision somewhat more ample a capital caterer he had forgotten nothing within the compass of his means that could contribute to the comfort of those who had been put especially under his care long before the people knocked off for their dinners the arrangements were completed and the boatswain was ready to take his leave  well ladies said that grum old salt i can do no more for you as i can see this here island is now almost as comfortable as a ship that has been in blue water for a month and i do nt know how it can be made more comfortabler  this was only according to the boatswains notion of comfort but rose thanked him for his care in her winning way while her aunt admitted that for a place that was almost a desert island things did look somewhat promising in a few minutes the men were all gone and the islet was left to the sole possession of the three females and their constant companion jack tier rose was pleased with the novelty of her situation though the islet certainly did deserve the opprobrium of being a desert island there was no shade but that of the tent and its verandahlike covering though the last in particular was quite extensive there was no water that in the barrel and that of the ocean excepted of herbage there was very little on this islet and that was of the most meagre and coarse character being a long wiry grass with here and there a few stunted bushes the sand was reasonably firm however more especially round the shore and the walking was far from unpleasant little did rose know it but a week earlier the spot would have been next to intolerable to her on account of the musquitoes gallinippers and other similar insects of the family of tormentors but everything of the sort had temporarily disappeared in the currents of the tornado to do spike justice he was aware of this circumstance or he might have hesitated about exposing females to the ordinary annoyances of one of these spots not a musquito or anything of the sort was left however all having gone to leeward in the vortex which had come so near sweeping off the mexican schooner  this place will do very well aunty for a day or two cried rose cheerfully as she returned from a short excursion and threw aside her hat one made to shade her face from the sun of a warm climate leaving the seabreeze that was just beginning to blow to fan her blooming and sunny cheeks it is better than the brig the worst piece of land is better than the brig  do not say that rosenot if its a desert island dear and this is desperately like a desert island i am almost sorry i ventured on it  it will not be deserted by us aunty until we shall see occasion to do so why not endeavour to get on board of yonder ship and return to new york in her or at least induce her captain to put us ashore somewhere near this and go home by land your health never seemed better than it is at this moment and as for mine i do assure you aunty dear i am as perfectly well as i ever was in my life  all from this voyage i knew it would set you up and am delighted to hear you say as much biddy and i were talking of you this very morning my child and we both agreed that you were getting to be yourself again oh ships and brigs and schooners fulljigger or halfjigger for pulmonary complaints say i my poor mr budd always maintained that the ocean was the cure for all diseases and i determined that to sea you should go the moment i became alarmed for your health  the good widow loved rose most tenderly and she was obliged to use her handkerchief to dry the tears from her eyes as she concluded those tears sprung equally from a past feeling of apprehension and a present feeling of gratitude rose saw this and she took a seat at her aunts side touched herself as she never failed to be on similar occasions with this proof of her relatives affection at that moment even harry mulford would have lost a good deal in her kind feelings toward him had he so much as smiled at one of the widows nautical absurdities at such times rose seemed to be her aunts guardian and protectress instead of reversing the relations and she entirely forgot herself the many reasons which existed for wishing that she had been placed in childhood under the care of one better qualified than the wellmeaning relict of her uncle for the performance of her duties  thank you auntythankee dear aunty said rose kissing the widow affectionately i know that you mean the best for me though you are a little mistaken in supposing me ill i do assure you dear patting her aunts cheek as if she herself had been merely a playful child i never was better and if i have been pulmonary i am entirely cured and am now ready to return home  god be praised for this rosy under his divine providence it is all owing to the sea if you really feel so much restored however i do not wish to keep you a moment longer on a ships board than is necessary we owe something to captain spikes care and cannot quit him too unceremoniously but as soon as he is at liberty to go into a harbour i will engage him to do so and we can return home by landunless indeed the brig intends to make the home voyage herself  i do not like this brig aunty and now we are out of her i wish we could keep out of her nor do i like your captain spike who seems to me anything but an agreeable gentleman  thats because you arnt accustomed to the sea my poor mr budd had his ways like all the rest of them it takes time to get acquainted with them all sailors are so  rose bent her face involuntarily but so low as to conceal the increasing brightness of her native bloom as she answered  harry mulford is not so aunty dearand he is every inch a sailor  well there is a difference i must acknowledge though i dare say harry will grow every day more and more like all the rest of them in the end he will resemble captain spike  never said rose firmly  you cant tell child i never saw your uncle when he was harrys age for i was nt born till he was thirty but often and often has he pointed out to me some slender genteel youth and say just such a lad was i at twenty though nothing could be less alike at the moment he was speaking than they two we all change with our years now i was once as slender and almostnot quite rosy for few there are that bebut almost as handsome as you yourself  yes aunty ive heard that before said rose springing up in order to change the discourse but harry mulford will never become like stephen spike i wish we had never known the man dearest aunty  it was all your own doings child hes a cousin of your most intimate friend and she brought him to the house and one could nt offend mary mulford by telling her we did nt like her cousin  rose seemed vexed and she kept her little foot in motion patting the sail that formed the carpet as girls will pat the ground with their feet when vexed this gleam of displeasure was soon over however and her countenance became as placid as the clear blue sky that formed the vault of the heavens above her head as if to atone for the passing rebellion of her feelings she threw her arms around her aunts neck after which she walked away along the beach ruminating on her present situation and of the best means of extricating their party from the power of spike  it requires great familiarity with vessels and the seas for one to think read and pursue the customary train of reasoning on board a ship that one has practised ashore rose had felt this embarrassment during the past month for the whole of which time she had scarcely been in a condition to act up to her true character suffering her energies and in some measure her faculties to be drawn into the vortex produced by the bustle novelties and scenes of the vessel and the ocean but now she was once more on the land diminutive and naked as was the islet that composed her present world and she found leisure and solitude for reflection and decision she was not ignorant of the nature of a vessel of war or of the impropriety of unprotected females placing themselves on board of one but gentlemen of character like the officers of the ship in sight could hardly be wanting in the feelings of their caste and anything was better than to return voluntarily within the power of spike she determined within her own mind that voluntarily she would not we shall leave this young girl slowly wandering along the beach of her islet musing on matters like these while we return to the vessels and the mariners  a good breeze had come in over the reef from the gulf throwing the sloopofwar dead to leeward of the brigantines anchorage this was the reason that the former had closed so slowly still the distance between the vessels was so small that a swift cruiser like the ship of war would soon have been alongside of the wreckers but for the intervening islets and the intricacies of their channels she had made sail on the wind however and was evidently disposed to come as near to the danger as her lead showed would be safe even if she did not venture among them  spike noted all these movements and he took his measures accordingly the pumping and bailing had been going on since the appearance of light and the flour had been quite half removed from the schooners hold that vessel consequently floated with sufficient buoyancy and no further anxiety was felt on account of her sinking still a great deal of water remained in her the cabin itself being nearly half full spikes object was to reduce this water sufficiently to enable him to descend into the stateroom which se¤or montefalderon had occupied and bring away the doubloons that alone kept him in the vicinity of so ticklish a neighbour as the poughkeepsie escape was easy enough to one who knew the passages of the reef and islets more especially since the wind had so fortunately brought the cruiser to leeward spike most apprehended a movement upon him in the boats and he had almost made up his mind should such an enterprise be attempted to try his hand in beating it off with his guns a good deal of uncertainty on the subject of mulfords consenting to resist the recognised authorities of the country as well as some doubts of a similar nature in reference to two or three of the best of the foremast hands alone left him at all in doubt as to the expediency of such a course as no boats were lowered from the cruiser however the necessity of resorting to so desperate a measure did not occur and the duty of lightening the schooner had proceeded without interruption as soon as the boatswain came off from the islet he and the men with him were directed to take the hands and lift the anchors of which it will be remembered the swash had several down even mulford was shortly after set at work on the same duty and these expert and ready seamen soon had the brig clear of the ground as the schooner was anchored and floated without assistance the swash rode by her  such was the state of things when the men turned to after having had their dinners by this time the sloopofwar was within half a league of the bay her progress having been materially retarded by the set of the current which was directly against her spike saw that a collision of some sort or other must speedily occur and he determined to take the boatswain with him and descend into the cabin of the schooner in quest of the gold the boatswain was summoned and se¤or montefalderon repeated in this mans presence the instructions that he thought it necessary for the adventurers to follow in order to secure the prize knowing how little locks would avail on board a vessel were the men disposed to rob him that gentleman had trusted more to secreting his treasure than to securing it in the more ordinary way when the story had again been told spike and his boatswain went on board the schooner and undressing they prepared to descend into the cabin the captain paused a single instant to take a look at the sloopofwar and to examine the state of the weather it is probable some new impression was made on him by this inquiry for hailing mulford he ordered him to loosen the sails and to sheet home and hoist the foretopsail in a word to see all ready to cast off and make sail on the brig at the shortest notice with this command he disappeared by the schooners companionway  spike and his companion found the water in the cabin very much deeper than they had supposed with a view to comfort the cabinfloor had been sunk much lower than is usual on board american vessels and this brought the water up nearly to the armpits of two men as short as our captain and his sturdy little boatswain the former grumbled a good deal when he ascertained the fact and said something about the mates being better fitted to make a search in such a place but concluding with the remark that the man who wants ticklish duty well done must see to it himself  the goldhunters groped their way cautiously about the cabin for some time feeling for a drawer in which they had been told they should find the key of se¤or montefalderons stateroom door in this spike himself finally succeeded he being much better acquainted with cabins and their fixtures than the boatswain  here it is ben said the captain now for a dive among the dons valables should you pick up anything worth speaking of you can condemn it for salvage as i mean to cast off and quit the wrack the moment weve made sure of the doubloons  and what will become of all the black flour that is lying about sir asked the boatswain with a grin  it may take care of itself my agreement will be up as soon as the doubloons are found if the don will come down handsomely with his share of what will be left i may be bought to put the kegs we have in the brig ashore for him somewhere in mexico but my wish is to get out of the neighbourhood of that bloody sloopofwar as soon as possible  she makes but slow headway agin the current sir but a body would think she might send in her boats  the boats might be glad to get back again muttered spike ay here is the door unlocked and we can now fish for the money  some object had rolled against the stateroom door when the vessel was capsized and there was a good deal of difficulty in forcing it open they succeeded at last and spike led the way by wading into the small apartment here they began to feel about beneath the water and by a very insufficient light in quest of the hidden treasure spike and his boatswain differed as to the place which had just been described to them as men will differ even in the account of events that pass directly before their eyes while thus employed the report of a heavy gun came through the doors of the cabin penetrating to the recess in which they were thus employed  ay thats the beginning of it exclaimed spike i wonder that the fool has put it off so long  that gun was a heavy fellow captain spike returned the boatswain and it sounded in my ears as ift was shotted  ay ay i dare say youre right enough in both opinions they put such guns on board their sloopsofwar nowadays as a fellow used to find in the lower batteries of a twodecker only in old times and as for shot why uncle sam pays and they think it cheaper to fire one out of a gun than to take the trouble of drawing it  i believe heres one of the bags captain spike said the boatswain making a dip and coming up with onehalf of the desired treasure in his fist by george ive grabbed him sir and the other bag cant be far off  hand that over to me said the captain a little authoritatively and take a dive for the next  as the boatswain was obeying this order a second gun was heard and spike thought that the noise made by the near passage of a large shot was audible also he called out to ben to bear a hand as the ship seems in arnest but the head of the boatswain being under water at the time the admonition was thrown away the fellow soon came up however puffing like a porpoise that has risen to the surface to blow  hand it over to me at once said spike stretching out his unoccupied hand to receive the prize we have little time to lose  thats sooner said than done sir answered the boatswain a box has driven down upon the bag and theres a tight jam i got hold of the neck of the bag and pulled like a horse but it wouldnt come no how  show me the place and let me have a drag at it there goes another of his bloody guns  down went spike and the length of time he was under water proved how much he was in earnest up he came at length and with no better luck than his companion he had got hold of the bag satisfied himself by feeling its outside that it contained the doubloons and hauled with all his strength but it would not come the boatswain now proposed to take a jamming hitch with a rope around the neck of the bag which was long enough to admit of such a fastening and then to apply their united force spike assented and the boatswain rummaged about for a piece of small rope to suit his purpose at this moment mulford appeared at the companionway to announce the movements on the part of the sloopofwar he had been purposely tardy in order to give the ship as much time as possible but he saw by the looks of the men that a longer delay might excite suspicion  below there called out the mate  whats wanting sirwhats wanting sir answered spike lets know at once  have you heard the guns captain spike  ay ay every grumbler of them theyve done no mischief i trust mr mulford  none as yet sir though the last shot and it was a heavy fellow passed just above the schooners deck ive the topsail sheeted home and hoisted and its that which has set them at work if i clewed up again i dare say theyd not fire another gun  clew up nothing sir but see all clear for casting off and making sail through the south pass what do you say ben are you ready for a drag  all ready sir answered the boatswain once more coming up to breathe now for it sir a steady pull and a pull all together  they did pull but the hitch slipped and both went down beneath the water in a moment they were up again puffing a little and swearing a great deal just then another gun and a clatter above their heads brought them to a stand  what means that mr mulford demanded spike a good deal startled  it means that the sloopofwar has shot away the head of this schooners foremast sir and that the shot has chippd a small piece out of the heel of our maintopmastthats all  though excessively provoked at the mates cool manner of replying spike saw that he might lose all by being too tenacious about securing the remainder of the doubloons pronouncing in very energetic terms on uncle sam and all his cruisers an anathema that we do not care to repeat he gave a surly order to ben to knockoff and abandoned his late design in a minute he was on deck and dressed  cast off lads cried the captain as soon as on the deck of his own brig again and four of you man that boat we have got half of your treasure se¤or wan but have been driven from the rest of it as you see there is the bag when at leisure well divide it and give the people their share mr mulford keep the brig in motion hauling up toward the south pass while i go ashore for the ladies ill meet you just in the throat of the passage  this said spike tumbled into his boat and was pulled ashore as for mulford though he cast many an anxious glance toward the islet he obeyed his orders keeping the brig standing off and on under easy canvas but working her up toward the indicated passage  spike was met by jack tier on the beach of the little island  muster the women at once ordered the captain we have no time to lose for that fellow will soon be firing broadsides and his shot now range half a mile beyond us  youll no more move the widow and her maid than youll move the island answered jack laconically  why should i not move them do they wish to stay here and starve  its little that they think of that the sloopofwar no sooner begun to fire than down went mrs budd on the canvas floor of the tent and set up just such a screaming as you may remember she tried her hand at the night the revenue craft fired into us biddy lay down alongside of her mistress and at every gun they just scream as loud as they can as if they fancied they might frighten off uncle sams men from their duty  dutyyou little scamp do you call tormenting honest traders in this fashion the duty of any man  well captain im no ways particlar about a word or two their ways if you like that better than duty sir  wheres rose is she down too screaming and squalling  no captain spike no miss rose is endeavouring like a handsome young christian lady as she is to pacify and mollify her aunt and biddy and right down sensible talk does she give them  then she at least can go aboard the brig exclaimed spike with a sudden animation and an expression of countenance that jack did not at all like  i rayyther think shell wish to hold on to the old lady observed the stewardsmate a little emphatically  you be dd cried spike fiercely when your opinion is wanted ill ask for it if i find youve been setting that young womans mind agin me ill toss you overboard as i would the offals of a shark  young womens minds when they are only nineteen get set agin boys of fiftysix without much assistance  fiftysix yourself  im fiftythreethat ill own without making faces at it returned jack meekly and stephen spike you logged fiftysix your last birthday or a false entry was made  this conversation did not take place in the presence of the boats crew but as the two walked together toward the tent they were now in the verandah as we have called the shaded opening in front and actually within sound of the sweet voice of rose as she exhorted her aunt in tones a little louder than usual for her to use to manifest more fortitude under such circumstances spike did not deem it expedient to utter that which was uppermost in his mind but turning short upon tier he directed a tremendous blow directly between his eyes jack saw the danger and dodged falling backward to avoid a concussion which he knew would otherwise be fearful coming as it would from one of the best forecastle boxers of his time the full force of the blow was avoided though jack got enough of it to knock him down and to give him a pair of black eyes spike did not stop to pick the assistant steward up for another gun was fired at that very instant and mrs budd and biddy renewed their screams instead of pausing to kick the prostrate tier as had just before been his intention the captain entered the tent  a scene that was sufficiently absurd met the view of spike when he found himself in the presence of the females the widow had thrown herself on the ground and was grasping the cloth of the sail on which the tent had been erected with both her hands and was screaming at the top of her voice biddys imitation was not exactly literal for she had taken a comfortable seat at the side of her mistress but in the way of cries she rather outdid her principal  we must be off cried spike somewhat unceremoniously the manofwar is blazing away as if she was a firin minuteguns over our destruction and i can wait no longer  ill not stir answered the widowi cant stiri shall be shot if i go out no no noill not stir an inch  well be kiltwell be kilt echoed biddy and a wicket murthert will be in that same man war or no war  the captain perceived the uselessness of remonstrance at such a moment and perhaps he was secretly rejoiced thereat but it is certain that he whipped rose up under his arm and walked away with her as if she had been a child of two or three years of age rose did not scream but she struggled and protested vehemently it was in vain already the captain had carried her half the distance between the tent and the boat in the last of which a minute more would have deposited his victim when a severe blow on the back of his head caused spike to stumble and he permitted rose to escape from his grasp in the effort to save himself from a fall turning fiercely toward his assailant whom he suspected to be one of his boats crew he saw tier standing within a few yards levelling a pistol at him  advance a step and youre a dead man villain screamed jack his voice almost cracked with rage and the effort he made to menace  spike muttered an oath too revolting for our pages but it was such a curse as none but an old salt could give vent to and that in the bitterness of his fiercest wrath at that critical moment while rose was swelling with indignation and wounded maiden pride almost within reach of his arms looking more lovely than ever as the flush of anger deepened the colour in her cheeks a fresh and deep report from one of the guns of the sloopofwar drew all eyes in her direction the belching of that gun seemed to be of double the power of those which had preceded it and jets of water that were twenty feet in height marked the course of the formidable missile that was projected from the piece the ship had indeed discharged one of those monstercannons that bear the name of a distinguished french engineer but which should more properly be called by the name of the ingenious officer who is at the head of our own ordnance as they came originally from his inventive faculties though somewhat improved by their european adopter spike suspected the truth for he had heard of these pazans as he called them and he watched the booming leaping progress of the eightinch shell that this gun threw with the apprehension that unknown danger is apt to excite as jet succeeded jet each rising nearer and nearer to his brig the interval of time between them seeming fearfully to diminish he muttered oath upon oath the last leap that the shell made on the water was at about a quarter of a miles distance of the islet on which his people had deposited at least a hundred and fifty barrels of his spurious flourthence it flew as it might be without an effort with a grand and stately bound into the very centre of the barrels exploding at the moment it struck all saw the scattering of flour which was instantly succeeded by the heavy though slightly straggling explosion of all the powder on the island a hundred kegs were lighted as it might be in a common flash and a cloud of white smoke poured out and concealed the whole islet and all near it  rose stood confounded nor was jack tier in a much better state of mind though he still kept the pistol levelled and menaced spike but the last was no longer dangerous to any there he recollected that piles of the barrels encumbered the decks of his vessel and he rushed to the boat nearly frantic with haste ordering the men to pull for their lives in less than five minutes he was alongside and on the deck of the swashhis first order being totumble every barrel of this bloody powder into the sea men over with it mr mulford clear away the midship ports and launch as much as you can through them  remonstrance on the part of se¤or montefalderon would have been useless had he been disposed to make it but sooth to say he was as ready to get rid of the powder as any there after the specimen he had just witnessed of the power of a paixhan gun  thus it is ever with men had two or three of those shells been first thrown without effect as might very well have happened under the circumstances none there would have cared for the risk they were running but the chance explosion which had occurred presented so vivid a picture of the danger dormant and remote as it really was as to throw the entire crew of the swash into a frenzy of exertion  nor was the vessel at all free from danger on the contrary she ran very serious risk of being destroyed and in some degree in the very manner apprehended perceiving that spike was luffing up through one of the passages nearest the reef which would carry him clear of the group a long distance to windward of the point where he could only effect the same object the commander of the sloopofwar opened his fire in good earnest hoping to shoot away something material on board the swash before she could get beyond the reach of his shot the courses steered by the two vessels just at that moment favoured such an attempt though they made it necessarily very shortlived while the swash was near the wind the sloopofwar was obliged to run off to avoid islets ahead of her a circumstance which while it brought the brig square with the ships broadside compelled the latter to steer on a diverging line to the course of her chase it was in consequence of these facts that the sloopofwar now opened in earnest and was soon canopied in the smoke of her own fire  great and important changes as has been already mentioned have been made in the armaments of all the smaller cruisers within the last few years half a generation since a ship of the ratewe do not say of the sizeof the vessel which was in chase of spike and his craft would not have had it in her power to molest an enemy at the distance these two vessels were now apart but recent improvements have made ships of this nominal force formidable at nearly a leagues distance more especially by means of their paixhans and their shells  for some little time the range carried the shot directly over the islet of the tent jack tier and rose both of whom were watching all that passed with intense interest standing in the open air the whole time seemingly with no concern for themselves so absorbed was each notwithstanding all that had passed in the safety of the brig as for rose she thought only of harry mulford and of the danger he was in by those fearful explosions of the shells her quick intellect comprehended the peculiar nature of the risk that was incurred by having the flourbarrels on deck and she could not but see the manner in which spike and his men were tumbling them into the water as the quickest manner of getting rid of them after what had just passed between jack tier and his commander it might not be so easy to account for his manifest nay intense interest in the escape of the swash this was apparent by his troubled countenance by his exclamations and occasionally by his openly expressed wishes for her safety perhaps it was no more than the interest the seaman is so apt to feel in the craft in which he has so long sailed and which to him has been a home and of which mulford exhibited so much in his struggles between feeling and consciencebetween a true and a false duty  as for spike and his people we have already mentioned their efforts to get rid of the powder shell after shell exploded though none very near the brig the ship working her guns as if in action at length the officers of the sloopofwar detected a source of error in their aim that is of very common occurrence in seagunnery their shot had been thrown to ricochet quartering a low but very regular succession of little waves each shot striking the water at an acute angle to its agitated surface was deflected from a straight line and described a regular curve toward the end of its career or it might be truer to say an irregular curvature for the deflection increased as the momentum of the missile diminished  no sooner did the commanding officer of the sloopofwar discover this fact and it was easy to trace the course of the shots by the jets of water they cast into the air and to see as well as to hear the explosions of the shells than he ordered the guns pointed more to windward as a means of counteracting the departure from the straight lines this expedient succeeded in part the solid shot falling much nearer to the brig the moment the practice was resorted to no shell was fired for some little time after the new order was issued and spike and his people began to hope these terrific missiles had ceased their annoyance the men cheered finding their voices for the first time since the danger had seemed so imminent and spike was heard animating them to their duty as for mulford he was on the coachhouse deck working the brig the captain having confided to him that delicate duty the highest proof he could furnish of confidence in his seamanship the handsome young mate had just made a halfboard in the neatest manner shoving the brig by its means through a most difficult part of the passage and had got her handsomely filled again on the same tack looking right out into open water by a channel through which she could now stand on a very easy bowline everything seemed propitious and the sloopofwars solid shot began to drop into the water a hundred yards short of the brig in this state of things one of the paixhans belched forth its angry flame and sullen roar again there was no mistaking the gun then came its mass of iron a globe that would have weighed just sixtyeight pounds had not sufficient metal been left out of its interior to leave a cavity to contain a single pound of powder its course as usual was to be marked by its path along the sea as it bounded half a mile at a time from wave to wave spike saw by its undeviating course that this shell was booming terrifically toward his brig and a cry to look out for the shell caused the work to be suspended that shell struck the water for the last time within two hundred yards of the brig rose dark and menacing in its furious leap but exploded at the next instant the fragments of the iron were scattered on each side and ahead of the last three or four fell into the water so near the vessel as to cast their spray on her decks  overboard with the rest of the powder shouted spike keep the brig off a little mr mulfordkeep her off sir you luff too much sir  ay ay sir answered the mate keep her off it is  there comes the other shell cried ben but the men did not quit their toil to gaze this time each seaman worked as if life and death depended on his single exertions spike alone watched the course of the missile on it came booming and hurtling through the air tossing high the jets at each leap it made from the surface striking the water for its last bound seemingly in a line with the shell that had just preceded it from that spot it made its final leap every hand in the brig was stayed and every eye was raised as the rushing tempest was heard advancing the mass went muttering directly between the masts of the swash it had scarcely seemed to go by when the fierce flash of fire and the sharp explosion followed happily for those in the brig the projectile force given by the gun carried the fragments from them as in the other instance it had brought them forward else would few have escaped mutilation or death among their crew  the flashing of fire so near the barrels of powder that still remained on their deck caused the frantic efforts to be renewed and barrel after barrel was tumbled overboard amid the shouts that were now raised to animate the people to their duty  luff mr mulfordluff you may sir cried spike no answer was given  dye hear there mr mulfordit is luff you may sir  mr mulford is not aft sir called out the man at the helmbut luff it is sir  mr mulford not aft wheres the mate man tell him he is wanted  no mulford was to be found a call passed round the decks was sent below and echoed through the entire brig but no sign or tidings could be had of the handsome mate at that exciting moment the sloopofwar seemed to cease her firing and appeared to be securing her guns  chapter vii     thou art the same eternal sea   the earth has many shapes and forms   of hill and valley flower and tree   fields that the fervid noontide warms   or winters rugged grasp deforms   or bright with autumns golden store   thou coverest up thy face with storms   or smilest serenebut still thy roar   and dashing foam go up to vex the seabeat shore  lunt  we shall now advance the time eightandforty hours the baffling winds and calms that succeeded the tornado had gone and the trades blew in their stead both vessels had disappeared the brig leading doubling the western extremity of the reef and going off before both wind and current with flowing sheets fully three hours before the sloopofwar could beat up against the latter to a point that enabled her to do the same thing by that time the swash was fiveandtwenty miles to the eastward and consequently but just discernible in her loftiest sails from the ships royal yards still the latter continued the chase and that evening both vessels were beating down along the southern margin of the florida reef against the trades but favoured by a three or four knot current the brig out of sight to windward our narrative leads us to lose sight of both these vessels for a time in order to return to the islets of the gulf eightandforty hours had made some changes in and around the haven of the dry tortugas the tent still stood and a small fire that was boiling its pot and its kettle at no great distance from it proved that the tent was still inhabited the schooner also rode at her anchors very much as she had been abandoned by spike the bag of doubloons however had been found and there it lay tied but totally unguarded in the canvas verandah of rose budds habitation jack tier passed and repassed it with apparent indifference as he went to and fro between his pantry and kitchen busy as a bee in preparing his noontide meal for the day this man seemed to have the islet all to himself however no one else being visible on any part of it he sang his song in a cracked contre alto voice and appeared to be happy in his solitude occasionally he talked to himself aloud most probably because he had no one else to speak to we shall record one of his recitatives which came in between the strains of a very inharmonious air the words of which treated of the seas while the stewards assistant was stirring an exceedingly savoury mess that he had concocted of the ingredients to be found in the united larders of the swash and the mexican schooner  stephen spike is a capital willian exclaimed jack smelling at a ladle filled with his soupa capital willian i call him to think at his time of life of such a handsome and pleasant young thing as this rose budd and then to try to get her by underhand means and by making a fool of her silly old aunt it s wonderful what fools some old aunts be quite wonderful if i was as great a simpleton as this mrs budd id never cross my threshhold yes stephen spike is a prodigious willian as his best friend must own well i gave him a thump on the head that hell not forget this vyge to think of carryin off that pretty rose budd in his very arms in so indecent a manner yet the man has his good pints if a body could only forget his bad ones hes a firstrate seaman how he worked the brig till he doubled the reef ater she got into open water and how he made her walk off afore the wind with stunsails alow and aloft as soon as ever he could make em draw my life for it he ll tire the legs of uncle sams man afore he can fetch up with him for running away when hard chased stephen spike has nt his equal on arth but hes a great williana prodigious willian i cannot say i actually wish him hanged but i would rather have him hanged than see him get pretty rose in his power what has he to do with girls of nineteen if the rascal is one year old hes fiftysix i hope the sloopofwar will find her match and i think she will the mollys a great traveller and not to be outdone easily t would be a thousand pities so lovely a craft should be cut off in the flower of her days as it might be and i do hope shell lead that bloody sloop on some sunken rock  well theres the other bag of doubloons it seems stephen could not get it thats odd too for hes great at grabbin gold the man bears his age well but hes a willian i wonder whether he or mulford made that halfboard in the narrow channel it was well done and stephen is a perfect sailor but he says mulford is the same nice young man that mulford just fit for rose and rose for him pity to part them can find no great fault with him except that he has too much conscience theres such a thing as having too much as well as too little conscience mulford has too much and spike has too little for him to think of carryin off a gal of nineteen i say hes fiftysix if hes a day how fond he used to be of this very soup if ive seen him eat a quart of it ive seen him eat a puncheon full of it in my time what an appetite the man has when hes had a hard days duty on t there s a great deal to admire and a great deal to like in stephen spike but hes a reglar willian i dare say he fancies himself a smart jaunty youth agin as i can remember him a lad of twenty which was about his years when i first saw him by the sign that i was very little turned of fifteen myself spike was comely then though i acknowledge hes a willian i can see him now with his deep blue roundabout his bellmouthed trowsers both of fine clothtoo fine for such a willianbut fine it was and much did it become him  here jack made a long pause during which though he may have thought much he said nothing nevertheless he was nt idle the while on the contrary he passed no less than three several times from the fire to the tent and returned each time in going and coming he looked intently at the bag of doubloons though he did not stop at it or touch it some associations connected with spikes fruitless attempts to obtain it must have formed its principal interest with this singular being as he muttered his captains name each time in passing though he said no more audibly the concerns of the dinner carried him back and forth and in his last visit to the tent he began to set a small tableone that had been brought for the convenience of mrs budd and her niece from the brig and which of course still remained on the islet it was while thus occupied that jack tier recommenced his soliloquy  i hope that money may do some worthy fellow good yet its mexican gold and thats inemys gold and might be condemned by law i do suppose stephen had a hankerin ater it but he did not get it it come easy enough to the next man that tried that spike s a willian and the gold was too good for him he has no conscience at all to think of a gal of nineteen and one fit for his betters in the bargain the time has been when stephen spike might have pretended to rose budds equal that much ill ever maintain but that times gone and what is more it will never come again i should like mulford better if he had a little less conscience conscience may do for uncle sams ships but it is sometimes in the way aboard a trading craft what can a fellow do with a conscience when dollars is to be smuggled off or tobacco smuggled ashore i do suppose ive about as much conscience as it is useful to have and ive got ashore in my day twenty thousand dollars worth of stuff of one sort or another if ive got ashore the valie of ten dollars but spike carries on business on too large a scale and manys the time ive told him so i could have forgiven him anything but this attempt on rose budd and hes altogether too old for that to say nothing of other peoples rights hes an upanddown willian and a body can make no more nor any less of him that soup must be near done and ill hoist the signal for grub  this signal was a bluepeter of which one had been brought ashore to signal the brig and with which jack now signalled the schooner if the reader will turn his eyes toward the last named vessel he will find the guests whom tier expected to surround his table rose her aunt and biddy were all seated under an awning made by a sail on the deck of the schooner which now floated so buoyantly as to show that she had materially lightened since last seen such indeed was the fact and he who had been the instrument of producing this change appeared on deck in the person of mulford as soon as he was told that the bluepeter of jack tier was flying  the boat of the lighthouse that in which spike had landed in quest of rose was lying alongside of the schooner and sufficiently explained the manner in which the mate had left the brig this boat in fact had been fastened astern in the hurry of getting from under the sloopofwars fire and mulford had taken the opportunity of the consternation and frantic efforts produced by the explosion of the last shell thrown to descend from his station on the coachhouse into this boat to cut the painter and to let the swash glide away from him this the vessel had done with great rapidity leaving him unseen under the cover of her stern as soon as in the boat the mate had seized an oar and sculled to an islet that was within fifty yards concealing the boat behind a low hummock that formed a tiny bay all this was done so rapidly that united to the confusion on board the swash no one discovered the mate or the boat had he been seen however it is very little probable that spike would have lost a moment of time in the attempt to recover either but he was not seen and it was the general opinion on board the swash for quite an hour that her handsome mate had been knocked overboard and killed by a fragment of the shell that had seemed to explode almost in the ears of her people when the reef was doubled however and spike made his preparations for meeting the rough water he hove to and ordered his own yawl which was also towing astern to be hauled up alongside in order to be hoisted in then indeed some glimmerings of the truth were shed on the crew who missed the lighthouse boat though many contended that its painter must also have been cut by a fragment of the shell and that the mate had died loyal to roguery and treason mulford was much liked by the crew and he was highly valued by spike on account of his seamanship and integrity this latter being a quality that is just as necessary for one of the captains character to meet with in those he trusts as to any other man but spike thought differently of the cause of mulfords disappearance from his crew he ascribed it altogether to love for rose when in truth it ought in justice to have been quite as much imputed to a determination to sail no longer with a man who was clearly guilty of treason of smuggling mulford had long suspected spike though he had no direct proof of the fact but now he could not doubt that he was not only engaged in supplying the enemy with the munitions of war but was actually bargaining to sell his brig for a hostile cruiser and possibly to transfer himself and crew along with her  it is scarcely necessary to speak of the welcome mulford received when he reached the islet of the tent he and rose had a long private conference the result of which was to let the handsome mate into the secret of his pretty companions true feelings toward himself she had received him with tears and a betrayal of emotion that gave him every encouragement and now she did not deny her preference in that interview the young people plighted to each other their troth rose never doubted of obtaining her aunts consent in due time all her prejudices being in favour of the sea and sailors and should she not she would soon be her own mistress and at liberty to dispose of herself and her pretty little fortune as she might choose but a cypher as she was in all questions of real moment mrs budd was not a person likely to throw any real obstacle in the way of the young peoples wishes the true grounds of whose present apprehensions were all to be referred to spike his intentions and his wellknown perseverance mulford was convinced that the brig would be back in quest of the remaining doubloons as soon as she could get clear of the sloopofwar though he was not altogether without a hope that the latter when she found it impossible to overhaul her chase might also return in order to ascertain what discoveries could be made in and about the schooner the explosion of the powder on the islet must have put the manofwars men in possession of the secret of the real quality of the flour that had composed her cargo and it doubtless had awakened all their distrust on the subject of the swashs real business in the gulf under all the circumstances therefore it did appear quite as probable that one of the parties should reappear at the scene of their recent interview as the other  bearing all these things in mind mulford had lost no time in completing his own arrangements he felt that he had some atonement to make to the country for the part he had seemingly taken in the late events and it occurred to him could he put the schooner in a state to be moved then place her in the hands of the authorities his own peace would be made and his character cleared rose no sooner understood his plans and motives than she entered into them with all the ardour and selfdevotion of her sex for the single hour of confidential and frank communication which had just passed doubled the interest she felt in mulford and in all that belonged to him jack tier was useful on board a vessel though his want of stature and force rendered him less so than was common with seafaring men his proper sphere certainly had been the cabins where his usefulness was beyond all cavil but he was now very serviceable to mulford on the deck of the schooner the first two days mrs budd had been left on the islet to look to the concerns of the kitchen while mulford accompanied by rose biddy and jack tier had gone off to the schooner and set her pumps in motion again it was little that rose could do or indeed attempt to do at this toil but the pumps being small and easily worked biddy and jack were of great service by the end of the second day the pumps sucked the cargo that remained in the schooner as well as the form of her bottom contributing greatly to lessen the quantity of the water that was to be got out of her  then it was that the doubloons fell into mulfords hands along with everything else that remained below decks it was perhaps fortunate that the vessel was thoroughly purified by her immersion and the articles that were brought on deck to be dried were found in a condition to give no great offence to those who removed them by leaving the hatches off and the cabin doors open the warm winds of the trades effectually dried the interior of the schooner in the course of a single night and when mulford repaired on board of her on the morning of the third day he found her in a condition to be fitted for his purposes on this occasion mrs budd had expressed a wish to go off to look at her future accommodations and jack was left on the islet to cook the dinner which will explain the actual state of things as described in the opening of this chapter  as those who toil usually have a relish for their food the appearance of the bluepeter was far from being unwelcome to those on board of the schooner they got into the boat and were sculled ashore by mulford who seamanlike used only one hand in performing this service in a very few minutes they were all seated at the little table which was brought out into the tentverandah for the enjoyment of the breeze  so far well said mulford after his appetite was mainly appeased rose picking crumbs and affecting to eat merely to have the air of keeping him company one of the minor proofs of the little attentions that spring from the affections so far well the sails are bent and though they might be never and better they can be made to answer it was fortunate to find anything like a second suit on board a mexican craft of that size at all as it is we have foresail mainsail and jib and with that canvas i think we might beat the schooner down to key west in the course of a day and a night if i dared to venture outside of the reef it might be done sooner even for they tell me there is a fourknot current sometimes in that track but i do not like to venture outside so shorthanded the current inside must serve our turn and we shall get smooth water by keeping under the lee of the rocks i only hope we shall not get into an eddy as we go further from the end of the reef and into the bight of the coast  is there danger of that demanded rose whose quick intellect had taught her many of these things since her acquaintance with vessels  there may be looking at the formation of the reef and islands though i know nothing of the fact by actual observation this is my first visit in this quarter  eddies are serious matters put in mrs budd and my poor husband could not abide them tides are good things but eddies are very disagreeable  well aunty i should think eddies might sometimes be as welcome as tides it must depend however very much on the way one wishes to go  rose you surprise me all that you have read and all that you have heard must have shown you the difference do they not say a man is floating with the tide when things are prosperous with himand dont ships drop down with the tide and beat the wind with the tide and dont vessels sometimes tide it up to town as it is called and is nt it thought an advantage to have the tide with you  all very true aunty but i do not see how that makes eddies any the worse  because eddies are the opposite of tides child when the tide goes one way the eddy goes anotheris nt it so harry mulford you never heard of ones floating in an eddy  thats what we mean by an eddy mrs budd answered the handsome mate delighted to hear roses aunt call him by an appellation so kind and familiara thing she had never done previously to the intercourse which had been the consequence of their present situation though i agree with rose in thinking an eddy may be a good or a bad thing and very much like a tide as one wishes to steer  you amaze me both of you tides are always spoken of favourably but eddies never if a ship gets ashore the tide can float her off that ive heard a thousand times then what do the newspapers say of president and governor and congressman why that they all float in the tide of public opinion and that must mean something particularly good as they are always in office no no harry ill acknowledge that you do know something about ships a good deal considering how young you are but you have something to learn about eddies never trust one as long as you live  mulford was silent and rose took the occasion to change the discourse  i hope we shall soon be able to quit this place she said for i confess to some dread of captain spikes return  captain stephen spike has greatly disappointed me observed the aunt gravely i do not know that i was ever before deceived in judging a person i could have sworn he was an honest frank wellmeaning sailora character of all others that i love but it has turned out otherwise  hes a willian mutttered jack tier  mulford smiled at which speech we must leave to conjecture but he answered rose as he ever did promptly and with pleasure  the schooner is ready and this must be our last meal ashore he said our outfit will be no great matter but if it will carry us down to key west i shall ask no more of it as for the return of the swash i look upon it as certain she could easily get clear of the sloopofwar with the start she had and spike is a man that never yet abandoned a doubloon when he knew where one was to be found  stephen spike is like all his fellowcreatures put in jack tier pointedly he has his faults and he has his virtues  virtue is a term i should never think of applying to such a man returned mulford a little surprised at the fellows earnestness the word is a big one and belongs to quite another class of persons jack muttered a few syllables that were unintelligible when again the conversation changed  rose now inquired of mulford as to their prospects of getting to key west he told her that the distance was about sixty miles their route lying along the north or inner side of the florida reef the whole distance was to be made against the tradewind which was then blowing about an eightknot breeze though bating eddies they might expect to be favoured with the current which was less strong inside than outside of the reef as for handling the schooner mulford saw no great difficulty in that she was not large and was both lightly sparred and lightly rigged all her tophamper had been taken down by spike and nothing remained but the plainest and most readilymanaged gear a foreandaft vessel sailing close by the wind is not difficult to steer will almost steer herself indeed in smooth water jack tier could take his trick at the helm in any weather even in running before the wind the time when it is most difficult to guide a craft and rose might be made to understand the use of the tiller and taught to govern the motions of a vessel so small and so simply rigged when on a wind and in smooth water on the score of managing the schooner therefore mulford thought there would be little cause for apprehension should the weather continue settled he had little doubt of safely landing the whole party at key west in the course of the next fourandtwenty hours short sail he should be obliged to carry as well on account of the greater facility of managing it as on account of the circumstance that the schooner was now in light ballast trim and would not bear much canvas he thought that the sooner they left the islets the better as it could not be long ere the brig would be seen hovering around the spot all these matters were discussed as the party still sat at table and when they left it which was a few minutes later it was to remove the effects they intended to carry away to the boat this was soon done both jack tier and biddy proving very serviceable while rose tripped backward and forward with a step elastic as a gazelles carrying light burdens in half an hour the boat was ready here lies the bag of doubloons still said mulford smiling is it to be left or shall we give it up to the admiralty court at key west and put in a claim for salvage  better leave it for spike said jack unexpectedly should he come back and find the doubloons he may be satisfied and not look for the schooner on the other hand when the vessel is missing he will think that the money is in her better leave it for old stephen  i do not agree with you tier said rose though she looked as amicably at the stewards assistant as she thus opposed his opinion as if anxious to persuade rather than coerce i do not quite agree with you this money belongs to the spanish merchant and as we take away with us his vessel to give it up to the authorities at key west i do not think we have a right to put his gold on the shore and abandon it  this disposed of the question mulford took the bag and carried it to the boat without waiting to ascertain if jack had any objection while the whole party followed in a few minutes everybody and everything in the boat were transferred to the deck of the schooner as for the tent the old sails of which it was made the furniture it contained and such articles of provisions as were not wanted they were left on the islet without regret the schooner had several casks of fresh water which were found in her hold and she had also a cask or two of salted meats besides several articles of food more delicate that had been provided by se¤or montefalderon for his own use and which had not been damaged by the water a keg of boston crackers were among these eatables quite half of which were still in a state to be eaten they were biddys delight and it was seldom that she could be seen when not nibbling at one of them the bread of the crew was hopelessly damaged but jack had made an ample provision of bread when sent ashore and there was still a hundred barrels of the flour in the schooners hold one of these had been hoisted on deck by mulford and opened the injured flour was easily removed leaving a considerable quantity fit for the uses of the kitchen as for the keg of gunpowder it was incontinently committed to the deep  thus provided for mulford decided that the time had arrived when he ought to quit his anchorage he had been employed most of that morning in getting the schooners anchor a work of great toil to him though everybody had assisted he had succeeded and the vessel now rode by a kedge that he could easily weigh by means of a deck tackle it remained now therefore to lift this kedge and to stand out of the bay of the islets no sooner was the boat secured astern and its freight disposed of than the mate began to make sail in order to hoist the mainsail well up he was obliged to carry the halyards to the windlass thus aided he succeeded without much difficulty he and jack tier and biddy got the jib hoisted by hand and as for the foresail that would almost set itself of course it was not touched until the kedge was aweigh mulford found little difficulty in lifting the last and he soon had the satisfaction of finding his craft clear of the ground as jack tier was every way competent to take charge of the forecastle mulford now sprang aft and took his own station at the helm rose acting as his pretty assistant on the quarterdeck  there is little mystery in getting a foreandaft vessel under way her sails fill almost as a matter of course and motion follows as a necessary law thus did it prove with the mexican schooner which turned out to be a fastsailing and an easilyworked craft she was indeed an american bottom as it is termed having been originally built for the chesapeake and though not absolutely what is understood by a baltimore clipper so nearly of that mould and nature as to possess some of the more essential qualities as usually happens however when a foreigner gets hold of an american schooner the mexicans had shortened her masts and lessened her canvas this circumstance was rather an advantage to mulford who would probably have had more to attend to than he wished under the original rig of the craft  everybody even to the fastidious mrs budd was delighted with the easy and swift movement of the schooner mulford now he had got her under canvas handled her without any difficulty letting her stand toward the channel through which he intended to pass with her sheets just taken in though compelled to keep a little off in order to enter between the islets no difficulty occurred however and in less than ten minutes the vessel was clear of the channels and in open water the sheets were now flattened in and the schooner brought close by the wind a trial of the vessel on this mode of sailing was no sooner made than mulford was induced to regret he had taken so many precautions against any increasing power of the wind to meet emergencies and under the notion he should have his craft more under command the young man had reefed his mainsail and taken the bonnets off of the foresail and jib as the schooner stood up better than he had anticipated the mate felt as all seamen are so apt to feel when they see that their vessels might be made to perform more than is actually got out of them as the breeze was fresh however he determined not to let out the reef and the labour of lacing on the bonnets again was too great to be thought of just at that moment  we all find relief on getting in motion when pressed by circumstances mulford had been in great apprehension of the reappearance of the swash all that day for it was about the time when spike would be apt to return in the event of his escaping from the sloopofwar and he dreaded roses again falling into the hands of a man so desperate nor is it imputing more than a very natural care to the young man to say that he had some misgivings concerning himself spike by this time must be convinced that his business in the gulf was known and one who had openly thrown off his service as his mate had done would unquestionably be regarded as a traitor to his interests whatever might be the relation in which he would stand to the laws of the country it was probable such an alleged offender would not be allowed to appear before the tribunals of the land to justify himself and to accuse the truly guilty if it were in the power of the last to prevent it great therefore was the satisfaction of our handsome young mate when he found himself again fairly in motion with a craft under him that glided ahead in a way to prove that she might give even the swash some trouble to catch her in the event of a trial of speed  everybody entered into the feelings of mulford as the schooner passed gallantly out from between the islets and entered the open water fathom by fathom did her wake rapidly increase until it could no longer be traced back as far as the sandy beaches that had just been left in a quarter of an hour more the vessel had drawn so far from the land that some of the smaller and lowest of the islets were getting to be indistinct at that instant everybody had come aft the females taking their seats on the trunk which in this vessel as in the swash herself gave space and height to the cabin  well exclaimed mrs budd who found the freshness of the sea air invigorating as well as their speed exciting this is what i call maritime rosy dear this is what is meant by the maritime states about which we read so much and which are commonly thought to be so important we are now in a maritime state and i feel perfectly happy after all our dangers and adventures  yes aunty and i am delighted that you are happy answered rose with frank affection we are now rid of that infamous spike and may hope never to see his face more  stephen spike has his good pints as well as another said jack tier abruptly  i know that he is an old shipmate of yours tier and that you cannot forget how he once stood connected with you and am sorry i have said so much against him answered rose expressing her concern even more by her looks and tones than by her words  jack was mollified by this and he let his feeling be seen though he said no more than to mutter hes a willian words that had frequently issued from his lips within the last day or two  stephen spike is a capital seaman and that is something in any man observed the relict of captain budd he learned his trade from one who was every way qualified to teach him and its no wonder he should be expert do you expect mr mulford to beat the wind the whole distance to key west  it was not possible for any one to look more grave than the mate did habitually while the widow was floundering through her seaterms rose had taught him that respect for her aunt was to be one of the conditions of her own regard though rose had never opened her lips to him on the subject  yes maam answered the mate respectfully we are in the trades and shall have to turn to windward every inch of the way to key west  of what lock is this place the key rosy asked the aunt innocently enough i know that forts and towns are sometimes called keys but they always have locks of some sort or other now gibraltar is the key of the mediterranean as your uncle has told me fifty times and i have been there and can understand why it should bebut i do not know of what lock this west is the key  it is not that sort of key which is meant aunty at allbut quite a different thing the key meant is an island  and why should any one be so silly as to call an island a key  the place where vessels unload is sometimes called a key answered mulfordthe french calling it a quai and the dutch kaye i suppose our english word is derived from these now a low sandy island looking somewhat like keys or wharves seamen have given them this name key west is merely a low island  then there is no lock to it or anything to be unfastened said the widow in her most simple manner  it may turn out to be the key to the gulf of mexico one of these days maam uncle sam is surveying the reef and intends to do something here i believe when uncle sam is really in earnest he is capable of performing great things  mrs budd was satisfied with this explanation though she told biddy that evening that locks and keys go together and that the person who christened the island to which they were going must have been very weak in his upper story but these reflections on the intellects of her fellowcreatures were by no means uncommon with the worthy relict and we cannot say that her remarks made any particular impression on her irish maid  in the mean time the mexican schooner behaved quite to mulfords satisfaction he thought her a little tender in the squalls of which they had several that afternoon but he remarked to rose who expressed her uneasiness at the manner in which the vessel lay over in one of them that she comes down quite easy to her bearings but it is hard forcing her beyond them the vessel needs more cargo to ballast her though on the whole i find her as stiff as one could expect i am now glad that i reefed and reduced the head sails though i was sorry at having done so when we first came out at this rate of sailing we ought to be up with key west by morning  but that rate of sailing did not continue toward evening the breeze lessened almost to a calm again the late tornado appearing to have quite deranged the ordinary stability of the trades when the sun set and it went down into the broad waters of the gulf a flood of flame there was barely a twoknot breeze and mulford had no longer any anxiety on the subject of keeping his vessel on her legs his solicitude now was confined to the probability of falling in with the swash as yet nothing was visible either in the shape of land or in that of a sail between the islets of the dry tortugas and the next nearest visible keys there is a space of open water of some forty miles in width the reef extends across it of course but nowhere does the rock protrude itself above the surface of the sea the depth of water on this reef varies essentially in some places a ship of size might pass on to it if not across it while in others a man could wade for miles there is one deep and safe channelsafe to those who are acquainted with itthrough the centre of this open space and which is sometimes used by vessels that wish to pass from one side to the other but it is ever better for those whose business does not call them in that direction to give the rocks a good berth more especially in the night  mulford had gleaned many of the leading facts connected with the channels and the navigation of those waters from spike and the older seamen of the brig during the time they had been lying at the tortugas such questions and answers are common enough on board ships and as they are usually put and given with intelligence one of our mates general knowledge of his profession was likely to carry away much useful information by conversations of this nature and by consulting the charts which spike did not affect to conceal after the name of his port became known the young man in fact had so far made himself master of the subject as to have tolerably accurate notions of the courses distances and general peculiarities of the reef when the sun went down he supposed himself to be about halfway across the space of open water and some fiveandtwenty miles dead to windward of his port of departure this was doing very well for the circumstances and mulford believed himself and his companions clear of spike when as night drew its veil over the tranquil sea nothing was in sight  a very judicious arrangement was made for the watches on board the mexican schooner on this important night mrs budd had a great fancy to keep a watch for once in her life and after the party had supped and the subject came up in the natural course of things a dialogue like this occurred  harry must be fatigued said rose kindly and must want sleep the wind is so light and the weather appears to be so settled that i think it would be better for him to turn in as he calls ithere rose laughed so prettily that the handsome mate wished she would repeat the wordsbetter that he should turn in now and we can call him should there be need of his advice or assistance i dare say jack tier and i can take very good care of the schooner until daylight  mrs budd thought it would be no more than proper for one of her experience and years to rebuke this levity as well as to enlighten the ignorance her niece had betrayed  you should be cautious my child how you propose anything to be done on a ships board observed the aunt it requires great experience and a suitable knowledge of rigging to give maritime advice now as might have been expected considering your years and the short time you have been at sea you have made several serious mistakes in what you have proposed in the first place there should always be a mate on the deck as i have heard your dear departed uncle say again and again and how can there be a mate on the deck if mr mulford turns in as you propose seeing that hes the only mate we have then you should never laugh at any maritime expression for each and all are as a body might say solemnized by storms and dangers that harry is fatigued i think is very probable and he must set our watches as they call it when he can make his arrangements for the night and take his rest as is usual here is my watch to begin with and ill engage he does not find it two minutes out of the way though yours rosy dear like most girls timepieces is ill venture to say dreadfully wrong where is your chronometer mr mulford let us see how this excellent watch of mine which was once my poor departed mr budds will agree with that piece of yours which i have heard you say is excellent  here was a flight in science and nautical language that poor mulford could not have anticipated even in the captains relict that mrs budd should mistake setting the watch for setting our watches was not so very violent a blunder that one ought to be much astonished at it in her but that she should expect to find a chronometer that was intended to keep the time of greenwich agreeing with a watch that was set for the time of new york betrayed a degree of ignorance that the handsome mate was afraid rose would resent on him when the mistake was made to appear as the widow held out her own watch for the comparison however he could not refuse to produce his own by mrs budds watch it was past seven oclock while by his own or the greenwichset chronometer it was a little past twelve  how very wrong your watch is mr mulford cried the good lady notwithstanding all you have said in its favour its quite five hours too fast i do declare and now rosy dear you see the importance of setting watches on a ships board as is done every evening my departed husband has often told me  harrys must be what he calls a dogwatch aunty said rose laughing though she scarce knew at what  the watch goes too added the widow raising the chronometer to her ear though it is so very wrong well set it mr mulford then we will set roses which ill engage is half an hour out of the way though it can never be as wrong as yours  mulford was a good deal embarrassed but he gained courage by looking at rose who appeared to him to be quite as much mystified as her aunt for once he hoped rose was ignorant for nothing would be so likely to diminish the feeling produced by the exposure of the aunts mistake as to include the niece in the same category  my watch is a chronometer you will recollect mrs budd said the young man  i know it and they ought to keep the very best timethat ive always heard my poor mr budd had two and they were as large as compasses and sold for hundreds after his lamented decease  they were ships chronometers but mine was made for the pocket it is true chronometers are intended to keep the most accurate time and usually they do this of mine in particular would not lose ten seconds in a twelvemonth did i not carry it on my person  no no it does not seem to lose any harry it only gains cried rose laughing  mulford was now satisfied notwithstanding all that had passed on a previous occasion that the laughing brighteyed and quickwitted girl at his elbow knew no more of the uses of a chronometer than her unusually dull and ignorant aunt and he felt himself relieved from all embarrassment at once though he dared not even seem to distrust mrs budds intellect or knowledge before rose he did not scruple to laugh at rose herself to rose with her there was no jealousy on the score of capacity her quickness being almost as obvious to all who approached her as her beauty  rose budd you do not understand the uses of a chronometer i see said the mate firmly notwithstanding all i have told you concerning them  it is to keep time harry mulford is it not  true to keep timebut to keep the time of a particular meridian you know what meridian means i hope  rose looked intently at her lover and she looked singularly lovely for she blushed slightly though her smile was as open and amicable as ingenuousness and affection could make it  a meridian means a point over our headsthe spot where the sun is at noon said rose doubtingly  quite right but it also means longitude in one sense if you draw a line from one pole to the other all the places it crosses are on the same meridian as the sun first appears in the east it follows that he rises sooner in places that are east than in places that are further west thus it is that at greenwich in england where there is an observatory made for nautical purposes the sun rises about five hours sooner than it does here all this difference is subject to rules and we know exactly how to measure it  how can that be harry you told me this but the other day yet have i forgotten it  quite easily as the earth turns round in just twentyfour hours and its circumference is divided into three hundred and sixty equal parts called degrees we have only to divide 360 by 24 to know how many of these degrees are included in the difference produced by one hour of time there are just fifteen of them as you will find by multiplying 24 by 15 it follows that the sun rises just one hour later each fifteen degrees of longitude as you go west or one hour earlier each fifteen degrees of longitude as you go east having ascertained the difference by the hour it is easy enough to calculate for the minutes and seconds  yes yes said rose eagerly i see all thatgo on  now a chronometer is nothing but a watch made with great care so as not to lose or gain more than a few seconds in a twelvemonth its whole merit is in keeping time accurately  still i do not see how that can be anything more than a very good watch  you will see in a minute rose for purposes that you will presently understand books are calculated for certain meridians or longitudes as at greenwich and paris and those who use the books calculated for greenwich get their chronometers set at greenwich and those who use the paris get their chronometers set to paris time when i was last in england i took this watch to greenwich and had it set at the observatory by the true solar time ever since it has been running by that time and what you see here is the true greenwich time after allowing for a second or two that it may have lost or gained  all that is plain enough said the much interested rosebut of what use is it all  to help mariners to find their longitude at sea and thus know where they are as the sun passes so far north and so far south of the equator each year it is easy enough to find the latitude by observing his position at noonday but for a long time seamen had great difficulty in ascertaining their longitudes that too is done by observing the different heavenly bodies and with greater accuracy than by any other process but this thought of measuring the time is very simple and so easily put in practice that we all run by it now  still i cannot understand it said rose looking so intently so eagerly and so intelligently into the handsome mates eyes that he found it was pleasant to teach her other things besides how to love  i will explain it having the greenwich time in the watch we observe the sun in order to ascertain the true time wherever we may happen to be it is a simple thing to ascertain the true time of day by an observation of the sun which marks the hours in his track and when we get our observation we have some one to note the time at a particular instant on the chronometer by noting the hour minutes and seconds at greenwich at the very instant we observe here when we have calculated from that observation the time here we have only to add or subtract the time here from that of greenwich to know precisely how far east or west we are from greenwich which gives us our longitude  i begin to comprehend it again exclaimed rose delighted at the acquisition in knowledge she had just made how beautiful it is yet how simplebut why do i forget it  perfectly simple and perfectly sure too when the chronometer is accurate and the observations are nicely made it is seldom we are more than eight or ten miles out of the way and for them we keep a lookout it is only to ascertain the time where you are by means that are easily used then look at your watch to learn the time of day at greenwich or any other meridian you may have selected and to calculate your distance east or west from that meridian by the difference in the two times  rose could have listened all night for her quick mind readily comprehended the principle which lies at the bottom of this useful process though still ignorant of some of the details this time she was determined to secure her acquisition though it is quite probable that womanlike they were once more lost almost as easily as made mulford however was obliged to leave her to look at the vessel before he stretched himself on the deck in an old sail it having been previously determined that he should sleep first while the wind was light and that jack tier assisted by the females should keep the first watch rose would not detain the mate therefore but let him go his way in order to see that all was right before he took his rest  mrs budd had listened to mulfords second explanation of the common mode of ascertaining the longitude with all the attention of which she was capable but it far exceeded the powers of her mind to comprehend it there are persons who accustom themselves to think so superficially that it becomes a painful process to attempt to dive into any of the arcana of nature and who ever turn from such investigations wearied and disgusted many of these persons perhaps most of them need only a little patience and perseverance to comprehend all the more familiar phenomena but they cannot command even that much of the two qualities named to obtain the knowledge they would fain wish to possess mrs budd did not belong to a division as high in the intellectual scale as even this vapid class her intellect was unequal to embracing anything of an abstracted character and only received the most obvious impressions and those quite half the time it received wrong the mates reasoning therefore was not only inexplicable to her but it sounded absurd and impossible  rosy dear said the worthy relict as soon as she saw mulford stretch his fine frame on his bed of canvas speaking at the same time in a low confidential tone to her niece what was it that harry was telling you a little while ago it sounded to me like rank nonsense and men will talk nonsense to young girls as i have so often warned you child you must never listen to their nonsense rosy but remember your catechism and confirmation vow and be a good girl  to how many of the feebleminded and erring do those offices of the church prove a stay and support when their own ordinary powers of resistance would fail them rose however viewed the matter just as it was and answered accordingly  but this was nothing of that nature aunty she said and only an account of the mode of finding out where a ship is when out of sight of land in the middle of the ocean we had the same subject up the other day  and how did harry tell you this time that was done my dear  by finding the difference in the time of day between two placesjust as he did before  but there is no difference in the time of day child when the clocks go well  yes there is aunty dear as the sun rises in one place before it does in another  rose youve been listening to nonsense now remember what i have so often told you about young men and their way of talking i admit harry mulford is a respectable youth and has respectable connections and since you like one another you may have him with all my heart as soon as he gets a fulljiggered ship for i am resolved no niece of my poor dear husbands shall ever marry a mate or a captain even unless he has a fulljiggered ship under his feet but do not talk nonsense with him nonsense is nonsense though a sensible man talks it as for all this stuff about the time of day you can see it is nonsense as the sun rises but once in twentyfour hours and of course there cannot be two times as you call it  but aunty dear it is not always noon at london when it is noon at new york  fiddlefaddle child noon is noon and there are no more two noons than two suns or two times distrust what young men tell you rosy if you would be safe though they should tell you you are handsome  poor rose sighed and gave up the explanation in despair then a smile played around her pretty mouth it was not at her aunt that she smiled this she never permitted herself to do weak as was that person and weak as she saw her to be she smiled at the recollection how often mulford had hinted at her good looksfor rose was a female and had her own weaknesses as well as another but the necessity of acting soon drove these thoughts from her mind and rose sought jack tier to confer with him on the subject of their new duties  as for harry mulford his head was no sooner laid on its bunch of sail than he fell into a profound sleep there he lay slumbering as the seaman slumbers with no sense of surrounding things the immense fatigues of that and of the two preceding daysfor he had toiled at the pumps even long after night had come until the vessel was clearweighed him down and nature was now claiming her influence and taking a respite from exertion had he been left to himself it is probable the mate would not have arisen until the sun had reappeared some hours  it is now necessary to explain more minutely the precise condition as well as the situation of the schooner on quitting his port mulford had made a stretch of some two leagues in length toward the northward and eastward when he tacked and stood to the southward there was enough of southing in the wind to make his last course nearly due south as he neared the reef he found that he fell in some miles to the eastward of the isletsproof that he was doing very well and that there was no current to do him any material harm if indeed there were not actually a current in his favour he next tacked to the northward again and stood in that direction until near night when he once more went about the wind was now so light that he saw little prospect of getting in with the reef again until the return of day but as he had left orders with jack tier to be called at twelve oclock at all events this gave him no uneasiness at the time when the mate lay down to take his rest therefore the schooner was quite fiveandtwenty miles to windward of the dry tortugas and some twenty miles to the northward of the florida reef with the wind quite light at eastsoutheast such then was the position or situation of the schooner  as respects her condition it is easily described she had but the three sails bentmainsail foresail and jib her topmasts had been struck and all the hamper that belonged to them was below the mainsail was single reefed and the foresail and jib were without their bonnets as has already been mentioned this was somewhat short canvas but mulford knew that it would render his craft more manageable in the event of a blow usually at that season and in that region the east trades prevailed with great steadiness sometimes diverging a little south of east as at present and generally blowing fresh but for a short time previously to and ever since the tornado the wind had been unsettled the old currents appearing to regain their ascendancy by fits and then losing it in squalls contrary currents and even by short calms  the conference between jack tier and rose was frank and confidential  we must depend mainly on you said the latter turning to look toward the spot where mulford lay buried in the deepest sleep that had ever gained power over him harry is so fatigued it would be shameful to awaken him a moment sooner than is necessary  ay ay so it is always with young women when they lets a young man gain their ears answered jack without the least circumlocution so it is and so it always will be im afeard nevertheless men is willians  rose was not affronted at this plain allusion to the power that mulford had obtained over her feelings it would seem that jack had got to be so intimate in the cabins that his sex was in a measure forgotten and it is certain that his recent services were not without a question but for his interference the pretty rose budd would at that moment have been the prisoner of spike and most probably the victim of his design to compel her to marry him  all men are not stephen spikes said rose earnestly and least of all is harry mulford to be reckoned as one of his sort but we must manage to take care of the schooner the whole night and let harry get his rest he wished to be called at twelve but we can easily let the hour go by and not awaken him  the commanding officer ought not to be sarved so miss rose what he says is to be done  i know it jack as to ordinary matters but harry left these orders that we might have our share of rest and for no other reason at all and what is to prevent our having it we are four and can divide ourselves into two watches one watch can sleep while the other keeps a lookout  ay ay and pretty watches they would be theres madam budd now why shes quite a navigator and knows all about weerin and haulin and i dares to say could put the schooner about to keep her off the reef on a pinch though which way the craft would come round could best be told ater it has been done its as much as id undertake myself miss rose to take care of the schooner should it come on to blow and as for you madam budd and that squalling irishwoman youd be no better than so many housewives ashore  we have strength and we have courage and we can pull as you have seen i know very well which way to put the helm now and biddy is as strong as you are yourself and could help me all i wished then we could always call you at need and have your assistance nay harry himself can be called if there should be a real necessity for it and i do wish he may not be disturbed until there is that necessity  it was with a good deal of reluctance that jack allowed himself to be persuaded into this scheme he insisted for a long time that an officer should be called at the hour mentioned by himself and declared he had never known such an order neglected marchantman privateer or manofwar rose prevailed over his scruples however and there was a meeting of the three females to make the final arrangements mrs budd a kindhearted woman at the worst gave her assent most cheerfully though rose was a little startled with the nature of the reasoning with which it was accompanied  you are quite right rosy dear said the aunt and the thing is very easily done ive long wanted to keep one watch at sea just one watch to complete my maritime education your poor uncle used to say give my wife but one nightwatch and youd have as good a seaman in her as heart could wish im sure ive had nightwatches enough with him and his ailings but it seems that they were not the sort of watches he meant indeed i did nt know till this evening there were so many watches in the world at all but this is just what i want and just what im resolved to have tier shall command one watch and ill command the other jacks shall be the dogwatch as they call it and mine shall be the middlewatch and last till morning you shall be in jacks watch rose and biddy shall be in mine you know a good deal that jack do nt know and biddy can do a good deal im rather too stout to do i do nt like pulling ropes but as for ordering ill turn my back on no captains widow out of york  rose had her own misgivings on the subject of her aunts issuing orders on such a subject to any one but she made the best of necessity and completed the arrangements without further discussion her great anxiety was to secure a good nights rest for harry already feeling a womans care in the comfort and ease of the man she loved and rose did love harry mulford warmly and sincerely if the very decided preference with which she regarded him before they sailed had not absolutely amounted to passion it had come so very near it as to render that access of feeling certain under the influence of the association and events which succeeded we have not thought it necessary to relate a tithe of the interviews and intercourse that had taken place between the handsome mate and the pretty rose budd during the month they had now been shipmates having left the reader to imagine the natural course of things under such circumstances nevertheless the plighted troth had not been actually given until harry joined her on the islet at a moment when she fancied herself abandoned to a fate almost as serious as death rose had seen mulford quit the brig had watched the mode and manner of his escape and in almost breathless amazement and felt how dear to her he had become by the glow of delight which warmed her heart when assured that he could not would not forsake her even though he remained at the risk of life she was now true to the instinct of her sex mostly occupied in making such a return for an attachment so devoted as became her tenderness and the habits of her mind  as mrs budd chose what she was pleased to term the middlewatch giving to jack tier and rose her dogwatch the two last were first on duty it is scarcely necessary to say the captains widow got the names of the watches all wrong as she got the names of everything else about a vessel but the plan was to divide the night equally between these quasi mariners giving the first half to those who were first on the lookout and the remainder to their successors it soon became so calm that jack left the helm and came and sat by rose on the trunk where they conversed confidentially for a long time although the reader will hereafter be enabled to form some plausible conjectures on the subject of this dialogue we shall give him no part of it here all that need now be said is to add that jack did most of the talking that his past life was the principal theme and that the terrible stephen spike he from whom they were now so desirous of escaping was largely mixed up with the adventures recounted jack found in his companion a deeply interested listener although this was by no means the first time they had gone over together the same story and discussed the same events the conversation lasted until tier who watched the glass seeing that its sands had run out for the last time announced the hour of midnight this was the moment when mulford should have been called but when mrs budd and biddy noon were actually awakened in his stead  now dear aunty said rose as she parted from the new watch to go and catch a little sleep herself remember you are not to awaken harry first but to call tier and myself it would have done your heart good to have seen how sweetly he has been sleeping all this time i do not think he has stirred once since his head was laid on that bunch of sails and there he is at this moment sleeping like an infant  yes returned the relict it is always so with your true maritime people i have been sleeping a great deal more soundly the whole of the dogwatch than i ever slept at home in my own excellent bed but its your watch below rosy and contrary to rule for you to stay on the deck after youve been relieved ive heard this a thousand times  rose was not sorry to lie down and her head was scarcely on its pillow in the cabin before she was fast asleep as for jack he found a place among mulfords sails and was quickly in the same state  to own the truth mrs budd was not quite as much at ease in her new station for the first half hour as she had fancied to herself might prove to be the case it was a flat calm it is true but the widow felt oppressed with responsibility and the novelty of her situation time and again had she said and even imagined she should be delighted to fill the very station she then occupied or to be in charge of a deck in a middle watch in this instance however as in so many others reality did not equal anticipation she wished to be doing everything but did not know how to do anything as for biddy she was even worse off than her mistress a months experience or for that matter a twelvemonths could not unravel to her the mysteries of even a schooners rigging mrs budd had placed her at the wheel as she called it though the vessel had no wheel being steered by a tiller on deck in the longshore fashion in stationing biddy the widow told her that she was to play tricks at the wheel leaving it to the astounded irish womans imagination to discover what those tricks were failing in ascertaining what might be the nature of her tricks at the wheel biddy was content to do nothing and nothing under the circumstances was perhaps the very best thing she could have done  little was required to be done for the first four hours of mrs budds watch all that time rose slept in her berth and mulford and jack tier on their sail while biddy had played the wheel a trick indeed by lying down on deck and sleeping too as soundly as if she were in the county down itself but there was to be an end of this tranquillity suddenly the wind began to blow at first the breeze came in fitful puffs which were neither very strong nor very lasting this induced mrs budd to awaken biddy luckily a schooner without a topsail could not very well be taken aback especially as the headsheets worked on travellers and mrs budd and her assistant contrived to manage the tiller very well for the first hour that these varying puffs of wind lasted it is true the tiller was lashed and it is also true the schooner ran in all directions having actually headed to all the cardinal points of the compass under her present management at length mrs budd became alarmed a puff of wind came so strong as to cause the vessel to lie over so far as to bring the water into the lee scuppers she called jack tier herself therefore and sent biddy down to awaken rose in a minute both these auxiliaries appeared on deck the wind just then lulled and rose supposing her aunt was frightened at trifles insisted on it that harry should be permitted to sleep on he had turned over once in the course of the night but not once had he raised his head from his pillow  as soon as reinforced mrs budd began to bustle about and to give commands such as they were in order to prove that she was unterrified jack tier gaped at her elbow and by way of something to do he laid his hand on the painter of the swashs boat which boat was towing astern and remarked that some knownothing had belayed it with three halfhitches this was enough for the relict she had often heard the saying that three halfhitches lost the kings longboat and she busied herself at once in repairing so imminent an evil it was far easier for the good woman to talk than to act she became what is called all fingers and thumbs and in loosening the third halfhitch she cast off the two others at that instant a puff of wind struck the schooner again and the end of the painter got away from the widow who had a last glimpse at the boat as the vessel darted ahead leaving its little tender to vanish in the gloom of the night  jack was excessively provoked at this accident for he had foreseen the possibility of having recourse to that boat yet in order to escape from spike by abandoning the schooner and pulling on to the reef it might have been possible to get out of their pursuers hands when all other means should fail them as he was at the tiller he put his helm up and ran off until far enough to leeward to be to the westward of the boat when he might tack fetch and recover it nevertheless it now blew much harder than he liked for the schooner seemed to be unusually tender had he had the force to do it he would have brailed the foresail he desired rose to call mulford but she hesitated about complying  call himcall the mate i say cried out jack in a voice that proved how much he was in earnest these puffs come heavy i can tell you and they come often too call himcall him at once miss rose for it is time to tack if we wish to recover the boat tell him too to brail the foresail while we are in staysthats right another call will start him up  the other call was given aided by a gentle shake from roses hand harry was on his feet in a moment a passing instant was necessary to clear his faculties and to recover the tenor of his thoughts during that instant the mate heard jack tiers shrill cry of hard aleeget in that foresailbear ahandin with it i say  the wind came rushing and roaring and the flaps of the canvas were violent and heavy  in with the foresail i say shouted jack tier she files round like a top and will be off the wind on the other tack presently bear ahandbear ahand it looks black as night to windward  mulford then regained all his powers he sprang to the foresheet calling on the others for aid the violent surges produced by the wind prevented his grasping the sheet as soon as he could wish and the vessel whirled round on her heel like a steed that is frightened at that critical and dangerous instant when the schooner was nearly without motion through the water a squall struck the flattened sails and bowed her down as the willow bends to the gale mrs budd and biddy screamed as usual and jack shouted until his voice seemed cracked to let go the headsheets mulford did make one leap forward to execute this necessary office when the inclining plane of the deck told him it was too late the wind fairly howled for a minute and over went the schooner the remains of her cargo shifting as she capsized in a way to bring her very nearly bottom upward  1 we suppress the names used by mrs budd out of delicacy to the individuals mentioned who are still living  chapter viii    ay fare you well fair gentleman  as you like it  while the tyro believes the vessel is about to capsize at every puff of wind the practised seaman alone knows when danger truly besets him in this particular form thus it was with harry mulford when the mexican schooner went over as related in the close of the preceding chapter he felt no alarm until the danger actually came then indeed no one there was so quickly or so thoroughly apprized of what the result would be and he directed all his exertions to meet the exigency while there was the smallest hope of success he did not lessen in the least his endeavours to save the vessel making almost superhuman efforts to cast off the foresheet so as to relieve the schooner from the pressure of one of her sails but no sooner did he hear the barrels in the hold surging to leeward and feel by the inclination of the deck beneath his feet that nothing could save the craft than he abandoned the sheet and sprang to the assistance of rose it was time he did for having followed him into the vessels leewaist she was the first to be submerged in the sea and would have been hopelessly drowned but for mulfords timely succour women might swim more readily than men and do so swim in those portions of the world where the laws of nature are not counteracted by human conventions rose budd however had received the vicious education which civilized society inflicts on her sex and as a matter of course was totally helpless in an element in which it was the design of divine providence she should possess the common means of sustaining herself like every other being endued with animal life not so with mulford he swam with ease and force and had no difficulty in sustaining rose until the schooner had settled into her new berth or in hauling her on the vessels bottom immediately after  luckily there was no swell or so little as not to endanger those who were on the schooners bilge and mulford had no sooner placed her in momentary safety at least whom he prized far higher than his own life than he bethought him of his other companions jack tier had hauled himself up to windward by the rope that steadied the tiller and he had called on mrs budd to imitate his example it was so natural for even a woman to grasp anything like a rope at such a moment that the widow instinctively obeyed while biddy seized at random the first thing of the sort that offered owing to these fortunate chances jack and mrs budd succeeded in reaching the quarter of the schooner the former actually getting up on the bottom of the wreck on to which he was enabled to float the widow who was almost as buoyant as cork as indeed was the case with jack himself all the stern and bows of the vessel were under water in consequence of her leanness forward and aft but though submerged she offered a precarious footing even in these extremities to such as could reach them on the other hand the place where rose stood or the bilge of the vessel was two or three feet above the surface of the sea though slippery and inclining in shape  it was not half a minute from the time that mulford sprang to roses succour ere he had her on the vessels bottom in another half minute he had waded down on the schooners counter where jack tier was lustily calling to him for help and assisted the widow to her feet and supported her until she stood at roses side leaving the last in her aunts arms half distracted between dread and joy he turned to the assistance of biddy the rope at which the irish woman had caught was a straggling end that had been made fast to the main channels of the schooner for the support of a fender and had been hauled partly inboard to keep it out of the water biddy had found no difficulty in dragging herself up to the chains therefore and had she been content to sustain herself by the rope leaving as much of her body submerged as comported with breathing her task would have been easy but like most persons who do not know how to swim the good woman was fast exhausting her strength by vain efforts to walk on the surface of an element that was never made to sustain her unpractised persons in such situations cannot be taught to believe that their greatest safety is in leaving as much of their bodies as possible beneath the water keeping the mouth and nose alone free for breath but we have seen even instances in which men who were in danger of drowning seemed to believe it might be possible for them to craw over the waves on their hands and knees the philosophy of the contrary course is so very simple that one would fancy a very child might be made to comprehend it yet it is rare to find one unaccustomed to the water and who is suddenly exposed to its dangers that does not resort under the pressure of present alarm to the very reverse of the true means to save his or her life  mulford had no difficulty in finding bridget whose exclamations of murther help hellup jasus and other similar cries led him directly to the spot where she was fast drowning herself by her own senseless struggles seizing her by the arm the active young mate soon placed her on her feet though her cries did not cease until she was ordered by her mistress to keep silence  having thus rescued the whole of his companions from immediate danger mulford began to think of the future he was seized with sudden surprise that the vessel did not sink and for a minute he was unable to account for the unusual fact on the former occasion the schooner had gone down almost as soon as she fell over but now she floated with so much buoyancy as to leave most of her keel and all of her bilge on one side quite clear of the water as one of the main hatches was off and the cabindoors and boobyhatch doors forward were open and all were under water it required a little reflection on the part of mulford to understand on what circumstance all their lives now depended the mate soon ascertained the truth however and we may as well explain it to the reader in our own fashion in order to put him on a level with the young seaman  the puff of wind or little squall had struck the schooner at the most unfavourable moment for her safety she had just lost her way in tacking and the hull not moving ahead as happens when a craft is thus assailed with the motion on her all the power of the wind was expended in the direction necessary to capsize her another disadvantage arose from the want of motion the rudder which acts solely by pressing against the water as the vessel meets it was useless and it was not possible to luff and throw the wind from the sails as is usually practised by foreandaft rigged craft in moments of such peril in consequence of these united difficulties the shifting of the cargo in the hold the tenderness of the craft itself and the force of the squall the schooner had gone so far over as to carry all three of the openings to her interior suddenly under water where they remained held by the pressure of the cargo that had rolled to leeward had not the water completely covered these openings or hatches the schooner must have sunk in a minute or two or by the time mulford had got all his companions safe on her bilge but they were completely submerged and so continued to be which circumstance alone prevented the vessel from sinking as the following simple explanation will show  any person who will put an empty tumbler bottom upwards into a bucket of water will find that the water will not rise within the tumbler more than an inch at most at that point it is arrested by the resistance of the air which unable to escape and compressed into a narrow compass forms a body that the other fluid cannot penetrate it is on this simple and familiar principle that the chemist keeps his gases in inverted glasses placing them on shelves slightly submerged in water thus it was then that the schooner continued to float though nearly bottom upward and with three inlets open by which the water could and did penetrate a considerable quantity of the element had rushed in at the instant of capsizing but meeting with resistance from the compressed and pent air its progress had been arrested and the wreck continued to float sustained by the buoyancy that was imparted to it in containing so large a body of a substance no heavier than atmospheric air after displacing its weight of water enough of buoyancy remained to raise the keel a few feet above the level of the sea  as soon as mulford had ascertained the facts of their situation he communicated them to his companions encouraging them to hope for eventual safety it was true their situation was nearly desperate admitting that the wreck should continue to float for ever since they were almost without food or anything to drink and had no means of urging the hull through the water they must float too at the mercy of the winds and waves and should a sea get up it might soon be impossible for mulford himself to maintain his footing on the bottom of the wreck all this the young man had dimly shadowed forth to him through his professional experience but the certainty of the vessels not sinking immediately had so far revived his spirits as to cause him to look on the bright side of the future pale as that glimmering of hope was made to appear whenever reason cast one of its severe glances athwart it  harry had no difficulty in making rose comprehend their precise situation her active and clear mind understood at once the causes of their present preservation and most of the hazards of the future it was not so with jack tier he was composed even resigned but he could not see the reason why the schooner still floated  i know that the cabindoors were open he said and if they wasnt of no great matter would it be since the joints arnt caulked and the water would run through them as through a sieve im afeard mr mulford we shall find the wreck going from under our feet afore long and when we least wish it perhaps  i tell you the wreck will float so long as the air remains in its hold returned the mate cheerfully do you not see how buoyant it isthe certain proof that there is plenty of air within so long as that remains the hull must float  ive always understood said jack sticking to his opinion that wessels floats by vartue of water and not by vartue of air and that when the water gets on the wrong side on em theres little hope left of keepin em up  what has become of the boat suddenly cried the mate i have been so much occupied as to have forgotten the boat in that boat we might all of us still reach key west i see nothing of the boat  a profound silence succeeded this sudden and unexpected question all knew that the boat was gone and all knew that it had been lost by the widows pertinacity and clumsiness but no one felt disposed to betray her at that grave moment mulford left the bilge and waded as far aft as it was at all prudent for him to proceed in the vain hope that the boat might be there fastened by its painter to the schooners tafferel as he had left it but concealed from view by the darkness of the night not finding what he was after he returned to his companions still uttering exclamations of surprise at the unaccountable loss of the boat rose now told him that the boat had got adrift some ten or fifteen minutes before the accident befell them and that they were actually endeavouring to recover it when the squall which capsized the schooner struck them  and why did you not call me rose asked harry with a little of gentle reproach in his manner it must have soon been my watch on deck and it would have been better that i should lose half an hour of my watch below than that we should lose the boat  rose was now obliged to confess that the time for calling him had long been past and that the faint streak of light which was just appearing in the east was the near approach of day this explanation was made gently but frankly and mulford experienced a glow of pleasure at his heart even in that moment of jeopardy when he understood roses motive for not having him disturbed as the boat was gone with little or no prospect of its being recovered again no more was said about it and the window who had stood on thorns the while had the relief of believing that her awkwardness was forgotten  it was such a relief from an imminent danger to have escaped from drowning when the schooner capsized that those on her bottom did not for some little time realize all the terrors of their actual situation the inconvenience of being wet was a trifle not to be thought of and in fact the light summer dresses worn by all linen or cotton as they were entirely were soon effectually dried in the wind the keel made a tolerably convenient seat and the whole party placed themselves on it to await the return of day in order to obtain a view of all that their situation offered in the way of a prospect while thus awaiting a broken and short dialogue occurred  had you stood to the northward the whole night asked mulford gloomily of jack tier for gloomily he began to feel as all the facts of their case began to press more closely on his mind if so we must be well off the reef and out of the track of wreckers and turtlers how had you the wind and how did you head before the accident happened  the wind was light the whole time and for some hours it was nearly calm answered jack in the same vein i kept the schooners head to the norard until i thought we were getting too far off our course and then i put her about i do not think we could have been any great distance from the reef when the boat got away from us and i suppose we are in its neighbourhood now for i was tacking to fall in with the boat when the craft went over  to fall in with the boat did you keep off to leeward of it then that you expected to fetch it by tacking  ay a good bit and i think the boat is now away here to windward of us drifting athwart our bows  this was important news to mulford could he only get that boat the chances of being saved would be increased a hundred fold nay would almost amount to a certainty whereas so long as the wind held to the southward and eastward the drift of the wreck must be toward the open water and consequently so much the further removed from the means of succor the general direction of the trades in that quarter of the world is east and should they get round into their old and proper quarter it would not benefit them much for the reef running southwest they could scarcely hope to hit the dry tortugas again in their drift were life even spared them sufficiently long to float the distance then there might be currents about which mulford knew nothing with certainty they might set them in any direction and did they exist as was almost sure to be the case were much more powerful than the wind in controlling the movements of a wreck  the mate strained his eyes in the direction pointed out by jack tier in the hope of discovering the boat through the haze of the morning and he actually did discern something that it appeared to him might be the much desired little craft if he were right there was every reason to think the boat would drift down so near them as to enable him to recover it by swimming this cheering intelligence was communicated to his companions who received it with gratitude and delight but the approach of day gradually dispelled that hope the object which mulford had mistaken for the boat within two hundred yards of the wreck turning out to be a small low but bare hummock of the reef at a distance of more than two miles  that is a proof that we are not far from the reef at least cried mulford willing to encourage those around him all he could and really much relieved at finding himself so near even this isolated fragment of terra firma this fact is the next encouraging thing to finding ourselves near the boat or to falling in with a sail  ay ay said jack gloomily boat or no boat t will make no great matter of difference now theres customers thatll be sartain to take all the grists you can send to their mill  what things are those glancing about the vessel cried rose almost in the same breath those dark sharplooking stickssee there are five or six of them and they move as if fastened to something under the water that pulls them about  thems the customers i mean miss rose answered jack in the same strain as that in which he had first spoken theyre the same thing at sea as lawyers be ashore and seem made to live on other folks thems sharks  and yonder is truly the boat added mulford with a sigh that almost amounted to a groan the light had by this time so far returned as to enable the party not only to see the fins of half a dozen sharks which were already prowling about the wreck the almost necessary consequence of their proximity to a reef in that latitude but actually to discern the boat drifting down toward them at a distance that promised to carry it past within the reach of mulfords powers of swimming though not as near as he could have wished even under more favourable circumstances had their extremity been greater or had rose begun to suffer from hunger or thirst mulford might have attempted the experiment of endeavoring to regain the boat though the chances of death by means of the sharks would be more than equal to those of escape but still fresh and not yet feeling even the heat of the sun of that low latitude he was not quite goaded into such an act of desperation all that remained for the party therefore was to sit on the keel of the wreck and gaze with longing eyes at a little object floating past which once at their command might so readily be made to save them from a fate that already began to appear terrible in the perspective near an hour was thus consumed ere the boat was about half a mile to leeward during which scarcely an eye was turned from it for one instant or a word was spoken  it is beyond my reach now mulford at length exclaimed sighing heavily like one who became conscious of some great and irretrievable loss were there no sharks i could hardly venture to attempt swimming so far with the boat drifting from me at the same time  i should never consent to let you make the trial harry murmured rose though it were only half as far  another pause succeeded  we have now the light of day resumed the mate a minute or two later and may see our true situation no sail is in sight and the wind stands steadily in its old quarter still i do not think we leave the reef there you may see breakers off here at the southward and it seems as if more rocks rise above the sea in that direction i do not know that our situation would be any the better however were we actually on them instead of being on this floating wreck  the rocks will never sink said jack tier with so much emphasis as to startle the listeners  i do not think this hull will sink until we are taken off it or are beyond caring whether it sink or swim returned mulford  i do not know that mr mulford nothing keeps us up but the air in the hold you say  certainly not but that air will suffice as long as it remains there  and what do you call these things rejoined the assistant steward pointing at the water near him in or on which no one else saw anything worthy of attention  mulford however was not satisfied with a cursory glance but went nearer to the spot where tier was standing then indeed he saw to what the steward alluded and was impressed by it though he said nothing hundreds of little bubbles rose to the surface of the water much as one sees them rising in springs these bubbles are often met with in lakes and other comparatively shallow waters but they are rarely seen in those of the ocean the mate understood at a glance that those he now beheld were produced by the air which escaped from the hold of the wreck in small quantities at a time it was true but by a constant and increasing process the great pressure of the water forced this air through crevices so minute that under ordinary circumstances they would have proved impenetrable to this as they were still to the other fluid though they now permitted the passage of the former it might take a long time to force the air from the interior of the vessel by such means but the result was as certain as it might be slow as constant dropping will wear a stone so might the power that kept the wreck afloat be exhausted by the ceaseless rising of these minute airbubbles  although mulford was entirely sensible of the nature of this new source of danger we cannot say he was much affected by it at the moment it seemed to him far more probable that they must die of exhaustion long before the wreck would lose all of its buoyancy by this slow process than that even the strongest of their number could survive for such a period the new danger therefore lost most of its terrors under this view of the subject though it certainly did not add to the small sense of security that remained to know that inevitably their fate must be sealed through its agency should they be able to hold out for a sufficient time against hunger and thirst it caused mulford to muse in silence for many more minutes  i hope we are not altogether without food the mate at length said it sometimes happens that persons at sea carry pieces of biscuit in their pockets especially those who keep watch at night the smallest morsel is now of the last importance  at this suggestion every one set about an examination the result was that neither mrs budd nor rose had a particle of food of any sort about their persons biddy produced from her pockets however a whole biscuit a large bunch of excellent raisins that she had filched from the stewards stores and two applesthe last being the remains of some fruit that spike had procured a month earlier in new york mulford had half a biscuit at which he had been accustomed to nibble in his watches and jack lugged out along with a small plug of tobacco a couple of sweet oranges here then was everything in the shape of victuals or drink that could be found for the use of five persons in all probability for many days the importance of securing it for equal distribution was so obvious that mulfords proposal to do so met with a common assent the whole was put in mrs budds bag and she was intrusted with the keeping of this precious store  it may be harder to abstain from food at first when we have not suffered from its want than it will become after a little endurance said the mate we are now strong and it will be wiser to fast as long as we conveniently can today and relieve our hunger by a moderate allowance toward evening than to waste our means by too much indulgence at a time when we are strong weakness will be sure to come if we remain long on the wreck  have you ever suffered in this way harry demanded rose with interest  i have and that dreadfully but a merciful providence came to my rescue then and it may not fail me now the seaman is accustomed to carry his life in his hand and to live on the edge of eternity  the truth of this was so apparent as to produce a thoughtful silence anxious glances were cast around the horizon from time to time in quest of any sail that might come in sight but uselessly none appeared and the day advanced without bringing the slightest prospect of relief mulford could see by the now almost sunken hummocks that they were slowly drifting along the reef toward the southward and eastward a current no doubt acting slightly from the northwest their proximity to the reef however was of no advantage as the distance was still so great as to render any attempt to reach it even on the part of the mate unavailable nor would he have been any better off could he have gained a spot on the rocks that was shallow enough to admit of his walking since wading about in such a place would have been less desirable than to be floating where he was  the want of water to drink threatened to be the great evil of this the party on the wreck had not a single drop as the warmth of the day was added to the feverish feeling produced by excitement they all experienced thirst though no one murmured so utterly without means of relieving this necessity did each person know them all to be that no one spoke on the subject at all in fact shipwreck never produced a more complete destitution of all the ordinary agents of helping themselves in any form or manner than was the case here so sudden and complete had been the disaster that not a single article beyond those on the persons of the sufferers came even in view the masts sails rigging spare spars in a word everything belonging to the vessel was submerged and hidden from their sight with the exception of a portion of the vessels bottom which might be forty feet in length and some ten or fifteen in width including that which was above water on both sides of the keel though one only of these sides was available to the females as a place to move about on had mulford only a boathook he would have felt it a relief for not only did the sharks increase in number but they grew more audacious swimming so near the wreck that more than once mulford apprehended that some one of the boldest of them might make an effort literally to board them it is true he had never known of one of these fishes attempting to quit his own element in pursuit of his prey but such things were reported and those around the wreck swam so close and seemed so eager to get at those who were on it that there really might be some excuse for fancying they might resort to unusual means of effecting their object it is probable that like all other animals they were emboldened by their own numbers and were acting in a sort of concert that was governed by some of the many mysterious laws of nature that have still escaped human observation  thus passed the earlier hours of that appalling day toward noon mulford had insisted on the females dividing one of the oranges between them and extracting its juice by way of assuaging their thirst the effect was most grateful as all admitted and even mrs budd urged harry and tier to take a portion of the remaining orange but this both steadily refused mulford did consent to receive a small portion of one of the apples more with a view of moistening his throat than to appease his hunger though it had in a slight degree the latter effect also as for jack tier he declined even the morsel of apple saying that tobacco answered his purpose as indeed it temporarily might  it was near sunset when the stewards assistant called mulford aside and whispered to him that he had something private to communicate the mate bade him say on as they were out of earshot of their companions  ive been in sitiations like this afore said jack and one larns experence by experence i know how cruel it is on the feelins to have the hopes disappinted in these cases and therefore shall proceed with caution but mr mulford theres a sail in sight if there is a drop of water in the gulf  a sail jack i trust in heaven you are not deceived  old eyes are true eyes in such matters sir be careful not to start the women they go off like gunpowder and lord help em have no more command over themselves when you loosen em once than so many flyingfish with a dozen dolphins ater them look hereaway sir just clear of the irishwomans bonnet a little broad off the spot where the reef was last seenif that ant a sail my flame is not jack tier  a sail there was sure enough it was so very distant however as to render its character still uncertain though mulford fancied it was a squarerigged vessel heading to the northward by its position it must be in one of the channels of the reef and by its course if he were not deceived it was standing through from the main passage along the southern side of the rocks to come out on the northern all this was favourable and at first the young mate felt such a throbbing of the heart as we all experience when great and unexpected good intelligence is received a moments reflection however made him aware how little was to be hoped for from this vessel in the first place her distance was so great as to render it uncertain even which way she was steering then there was the probability that she would pass at so great a distance as to render it impossible to perceive an object as low as the wreck and the additional chance of her passing in the night under all the circumstances therefore mulford felt convinced that there was very little probability of their receiving any succour from the strange sail and he fully appreciated jack tiers motive in forbearing to give the usual call of sail ho when he made this discovery still he could not deny himself the pleasure of communicating to rose the cheering fact that a vessel was actually in sight she could not reason on the circumstances as he had done and might at least pass several hours of comparative happiness by believing that there was some visible chance of delivery  the females received the intelligence with very different degrees of hope rose was delighted to her their rescue appeared an event so very probable now that harry mulford almost regretted he had given rise to an expectation which he himself feared was to be disappointed the feelings of mrs budd were more suppressed the wreck and her present situation were so completely at variance with all her former notions of the sea and its incidents that she was almost dumbfounded and feared either to speak or to think biddy differed from either of her mistressesthe young or the old she appeared to have lost all hope and her physical energy was fast giving way under her profound moral debility  from the return of light that day mulford had thought if it were to prove that providence had withdrawn its protecting hand from them biddy who to all appearance ought to be the longest liver among the females at least would be the first to sink under her sufferings such is the influence of moral causes on the mere animal  rose saw the night shut in around them amid the solemn solitude of the ocean with a mingled sensation of awe and hope she had prayed devoutly and often in the course of the preceding day and her devotions had contributed to calm her spirits once or twice while kneeling with her head bowed to the keel she had raised her eyes toward harry with a look of entreaty as if she would implore him to humble his proud spirit and place himself at her side and ask that succour from god which was so much needed and which indeed it began most seriously to appear that god alone could yield the young mate did not comply for his pride of profession and of manhood offered themselves as stumblingblocks to prevent submission to his secret wishes though he rarely prayed harry mulford was far from being an unbeliever or one altogether regardless of his duties and obligations to his divine creator on the contrary his heart was more disposed to resort to such means of selfabasement and submission than he put in practice and this because he had been taught to believe that the anglosaxon mariner did not call on hercules on every occasion of difficulty and distress that occurred as was the fashion with the italian and romish seamen but he put his own shoulder to the wheel confident that hercules would not forget to help him who knew how to help himself but harry had great difficulty in withstanding roses silent appeal that evening as she knelt at the keel for the last time and turned her gentle eyes upward at him as if to ask him once more to take his place at her side withstand the appeal he did however though in his inward spirit he prayed fervently to god to put away this dreadful affliction from the young and innocent creature before him when these evening devotions were ended the whole party became thoughtful and silent  it was necessary to sleep and arrangements were made to do so if possible with a proper regard for their security mulford and tier were to have the lookout watch and watch this was done that no vessel might pass near them unseen and that any change in the weather might be noted and looked to as it was the wind had fallen and seemed about to vary though it yet stood in its old quarter or a little more easterly perhaps as a consequence the drift of the wreck insomuch as it depended on the currents of the air was more nearly in a line with the direction of the reef and there was little ground for apprehending that they might be driven further from it in the night although that reef offered in reality no place of safety that was available to his party mulford felt it as a sort of relief to be certain that it was not distant possibly influenced by a vague hope that some passing wrecker or turtler might yet pick them up  the bottom of the schooner and the destitute condition of the party admitted of only very simple arrangements for the night the females placed themselves against the keel in the best manner they could and thus endeavoured to get a little of the rest they so much needed the day had been warm as a matter of course and the contrast produced by the setting of the sun was at first rather agreeable than otherwise luckily rose had thrown a shawl over her shoulders not long before the vessel capsized and in this shawl she had been saved it had been dried and it now served for a light covering to herself and her aunt and added essentially to their comfort as for biddy she was too hardy to need a shawl and she protested that she should not think of using one had she been better provided the patient meek manner in which that humble but generoushearted creature submitted to her fate and the earnestness with which she had begged that miss rosy might have her morsel of the portion of biscuit each received for a supper had sensibly impressed mulford in her favour and knowing how much more necessary food was to sustain one of her robust frame and sturdy habits than to rose he had contrived to give the woman unknown to herself a double allowance nor was it surprising that biddy did not detect this little act of fraud in her favour for this double allowance was merely a single mouthful the want of water had made itself much more keenly felt than the want of food for as yet anxiety excitement and apprehension prevented the appetite from being much awakened while the claims of thirst were increased rather than the reverse by these very causes still no one had complained on this or any other account throughout the whole of the long and weary day which had passed  mulford took the first lookout with the intention of catching a little sleep if possible during the middle hours of the night and of returning to his duty as morning approached for the first hour nothing occurred to divert his attention from brooding on the melancholy circumstances of their situation it seemed as if all around him had actually lost the sense of their cares in sleep and no sound was audible amid that ocean waste but the light washing of the water as the gentle waves rolled at intervals against the weather side of the wreck it was now that mulford found a moment for prayer and seated on the keel that he called on the divine aid in a fervent but silent petition to god to put away this trial from the youthful and beautiful rose at least though he himself perished it was the first prayer that mulford had made in many months or since he had joined the swasha craft in which that duty was very seldom thought of  a few minutes succeeded this petition when biddy spoke  missusmadam budddear missushalf whispered the irish woman anxious not to disturb rose who lay furthest from hermissus bees ye asleep at sich a time as this  no biddy sleep and i are strangers to each other and are likely to be till morning what do you wish to say  anything is better than my own toughts missus dear and i wants to talk to ye is it no wather at all theyll give us so long as we stay in this place  there is no one to give it to us but god poor biddy and he alone can say what in his gracious mercy it may please him to do ah biddy i fear me that i did an unwise and thoughtless thing to bring my poor rose to such a place as this were it to be done over again the riches of wall street would not tempt me to be guilty of so wrong a thing  the arm of rose was thrown around her aunts neck and its gentle pressure announced how completely the offender was forgiven  is very sorry for miss rose rejoined biddy and i suffers so much the more meself in thinking how hard it must be for the like of her to be wantin in a swallow of fresh wather  it is no harder for me to bear it poor biddy answered the gentle voice of our heroine than it is for yourself  is it meself then sure am i that if i had a quarrt of good swate wather from our own pump and thats far betther is it than the crothon the best day the crothon ever seedbut had i a quarrt of it every dhrap would i give to you miss rose to appase your thirst i would  water would be a great relief to us all just now my excellent biddy answered rose and i wish we had but a tumbler full of that you name to divide equally among the whole five of us  is it divide then it would be agin dividin that my voice would be raised for that same rason that the tumbler would never hold as much as you could dhrink yourself miss rose  yet the tumbler full would be a great blessing for us all just now murmured mrs budd  and is nt mutthon good atin ladies och if i had but a good swate pratie now from my own native ireland and a dhrap of milk to help wash it down its mighty little that a body thinks of sich thrifles when theres abundance of them but when theres none at all they get to be stronger in the mind than riches and honours  you say the truth biddy rejoined the mistress and there is a pleasure in talking of them if one cant enjoy them ive been thinking all the afternoon rose what a delicious food is a good roast turkey with cranberry sauce and i wonder now that i have not been more grateful for the very many that providence has bestowed on me in my time my poor mr budd was passionately fond of mutton and i used wickedly to laugh at his fondness for it sometimes when he always had his answer ready and that was that there are no sheep at sea how true that is rosy dear there are indeed no sheep at sea  no aunty answered roses gentle voice from beneath the shawlthere are no such animals on the ocean but god is with us here as much as he would be in new york  a long silence succeeded this simple remark of his well beloved and the young mate hoped that there would be no more of a dialogue every syllable of which was a dagger to his feelings but nature was stronger than reflection in mrs budd and biddy and the latter spoke again after a pause of near a quarter of an hour  pray for me missus she said moaningly that i may sleep a bit of sleep would do a body almost as much good as a bit of breadi wont say as much as a dhrap of wather  be quiet biddy and we will pray for you answered rose who fancied by her breathing that her aunt was about to forget her sufferings for a brief space in broken slumbers  is it for you ill do thatand sure will i miss rose niver would i have quitted ireland could i have thought there was sich a spot on this earth as a place where no wather was to be had  this was the last of biddys audible complaints for the remainder of this long and anxious watch of mulford he then set himself about an arrangement which shall be mentioned in its proper place at twelve oclock or when he thought it was twelve he called jack tier who in turn called the mate again at four  it looks dark and threatening said mulford as he rose to his feet and began to look about him once more though there does not appear to be any wind  its a flat calm mr mate and the darkness comes from yonder cloud which seems likely to bring a little rain  rain then god is indeed with us here you are right jack rain must fall from that cloud we must catch some of it if it be only a drop to cool roses parched tongue  in what answered tier gloomily she may wring her clothes when the shower is over and in that way get a drop i see no other method  i have bethought me of all that and passed most of my watch in making the preparations  mulford then showed tier what he had been about in the long and solitary hours of the first watch it would seem that the young man had dug a little trench with his knife along the schooners bottom commencing two or three feet from the keel and near the spot where rose was lying and carrying it as far as was convenient toward the run until he reached a point where he had dug out a sort of reservoir to contain the precious fluid should any be sent them by providence while doing this there were no signs of rain but the young man knew that a shower alone could save them from insanity if not from death and in speculating on the means of profiting by one should it come he had bethought him of this expedient the large knife of a seaman had served him a good turn in carrying on his work to complete which there remained now very little to do and that was in enlarging the receptacle for the water the hole was already big enough to contain a pint and it might easily be sufficiently enlarged to hold double that quantity  jack was no sooner made acquainted with what had been done than he out knife and commenced tearing splinter after splinter from the planks to help enlarge the reservoir this could only be done by cutting on the surface for the wood was not three inches in thickness and the smallest hole through the plank would have led to the rapid escape of the air and to the certain sinking of the wreck it required a good deal of judgment to preserve the necessary level also and mulford was obliged to interfere more than once to prevent his companion from doing more harm than good he succeeded however and had actually made a cavity that might contain more than a quart of water when the first large drop fell from the heavens this cavity was not a hole but a long deep trenchdeep for the circumstancesso nicely cut on the proper level as to admit of its holding a fluid in the quantity mentioned  rosedearestrise and be ready to drink said mulford tenderly disturbing the uneasy slumbers of his beloved it is about to rain and god is with us here as he might be on the land  wather exclaimed biddy who was awoke with the same call what a blessed thing is good swate wather and sure am i we ought all to be thankful that there is such a precious gift in the worrld  come then said mulford hurriedly it will soon raini hear it pattering on the sea come hither all of you and drink as a merciful god furnishes the means  this summons was not likely to be neglected all arose in haste and the word water was murmured from every lip biddy had less selfcommand than the others and she was heard saying aloudoch and did nt i dhrame of the blessed springs and wells of ireland the night and havent i dhrunk at em all but now its over and i am awake no good hast done me and im ready to die for one dhrap of wather  that drop soon came however and with it the blessed relief which such a boon bestows mulford had barely time to explain his arrangements and to place the party on their knees along his little reservoir and the gutter which led to it when the pattering of the rain advanced along the sea with a deep rushing sound presently the uplifted faces and open mouths caught a few heavy straggling drops to cool the parched tongues when the water came tumbling down upon them in a thousand little streams there was scarcely any wind and merely the skirt of a large black cloud floated over the wreck on which the rain fell barely one minute but it fell as rain comes down within the tropics and in sufficient quantities for all present purposes everybody drank and found relief and when all was over mulford ascertained by examination that his receptacle for the fluid was still full to overflowing the abstinence had not been of sufficient length nor the quantity taken of large enough amount to produce injury though the thirst was generally and temporarily appeased it is probable that the coolness of the hour day dawning as the cloud moved past and the circumstance that the sufferers were wetted to their skins contributed to the change  oh blessed blessed wather exclaimed biddy as she rose from her knees america afther all isnt as dhry a country as some say ive niver tasted swater wather in ireland itself  rose murmured her thanksgiving in more appropriate language a few exclamations also escaped mrs budd and jack tier had his sententious eulogy on the precious qualities of sweet water  the wind rose as the day advanced and a swell began to heave the wreck with a power that had hitherto been dormant mulford understood this to be a sign that there had been a blow at some distance from them that had thrown the sea into a state of agitation which extended itself beyond the influence of the wind eagerly did the young mate examine the horizon as the curtain of night arose inch by inch as it might be on the watery panorama in the hope that a vessel of some sort or other might be brought within the view nor was he wholly disappointed the strange sail seen the previous evening was actually there and what was more so near as to allow her hull to be distinctly visible it was a ship under her square canvas standing from between divided portions of the reef as if getting to the northward in order to avoid the opposing current of the gulf stream vessels bound to mobile new orleans and other ports along the coast of the republic in that quarter of the ocean often did this and when the young mate first caught glimpses of the shadowy outline of this ship he supposed it to be some packet or cottondroger standing for her port on the northern shore but a few minutes removed the veil and with it the error of this notion a seaman could no longer mistake the craft her length her square and massive hamper with the symmetry of her spars and the long straight outline of the hull left no doubt that it was a cruiser with her hammocks unstowed mulford now cheerfully announced to his companions that the ship they so plainly saw scarcely a gunshot distant from them was the sloopofwar which had already become a sort of an acquaintance  if we can succeed in making them see our signal cried mulford all will yet be well come jack and help me to put abroad this shawl the only ensign we can show  the shawl of rose was the signal spread tier and mulford stood on the keel and holding opposite corners let the rest of the cloth blow out with the wind for near an hour did these two extend their arms and try all possible expedients to make their signal conspicuous but unfortunately the wind blew directly toward the cruiser and instead of exposing a surface of any breadth to the vision of those on board her it must at most have offered little more than a flitting waving line  as the day advanced sail was made on the cruiser she had stood through the passage in which she had been becalmed most of the night under short canvas but now she threw out fold after fold of her studdingsails and moved away to the westward with the stately motion of a ship before the wind no sooner had she got far enough to the northward of the reef than she made a deviation from her course as first seen turning her stern entirely to the wreck and rapidly becoming less and less distinct to the eyes of those who floated on it  mulford saw the hopelessness of their case as it respected relief from this vessel still he persevered in maintaining his position on the keel tossing and waving the shawl in all the variations that his ingenuity could devise he well knew however that their chances of being seen would have been trebled could they have been ahead instead of astern of the ship mariners have few occasions to look behind them while a hundred watchful eyes are usually turned ahead more especially when running near rocks and shoals mrs budd wept like an infant when she saw the sloopofwar gliding away reaching a distance that rendered sight useless in detecting an object that floated as low on the water as the wreck as for biddy unable to control her feelings the poor creature actually called to the crew of the departing vessel as if her voice had the power to make itself heard at a distance which already exceeded two leagues it was only by means of the earnest remonstrances of rose that the faithful creature could be quieted  why will ye not come to our relaif she cried at the top of her voice here are we helpless as newborn babies and ye sailing away from us in a conthrary way dye not bethink you of the missus who is much of a sailor but not sich a one as to sail on a wrack and poor miss rose who is the charrm and delight of all eyes only come and take off miss rose and lave the rest of us if ye so likes for its a sin and a shame to lave the likes of her to die in the midst of the ocean as if she was no betther nor a fish then it will be soon that we shall agin feel the want of wather and that too with nothing but wather to be seen on all sides of us  it is of no use said harry mournfully stepping down from the keel and laying aside the shawl they cannot see us and the distance is now so great as to render it certain they never will there is only one hope left we are evidently set to and fro by the tides and it is possible that by keeping in or near this passage some other craft may appear and we be more fortunate the relief of the rain is a sign that we are not forgotten by divine providence and with such a protector we ought not to despair  a gloomy and scanty breaking of the fast succeeded each person had one large mouthful of bread which was all that prudence would authorize mulford to distribute he attempted a pious fraud however by placing his own allowance along with that of roses under the impression that her strength might not endure privation as well as his own but the tender solicitude of rose was not to be thus deceived judging of his wishes and motives by her own she at once detected the deception and insisted on retaining no more than her proper share when this distribution was completed and the meagre allowance taken only sufficient bread remained to make one more similar scanty meal if meal a single mouthful could be termed as for the water a want of which would be certain to be felt as soon as the sun obtained its noonday power the shawl was extended over it in a way to prevent evaporation as much as possible and at the same time to offer some resistance to the fluids being washed from its shallow receptacle by the motion of the wreck which was sensibly increasing with the increase of the wind and waves  mulford had next an anxious duty to perform throughout the whole of the preceding day he had seen the air escaping from the hull in an incessant succession of small bubbles which were formidable through their numbers if not through their size the mate was aware that this unceasing loss of the buoyant property of the wreck must eventually lead to their destruction should no assistance come and he had marked the floating line on the bottom of the vessel with his knife ere darkness set in on the previous evening no sooner did his thoughts recur to this fact after the excitement of the first hour of daylight was over than he stepped to the different places thus marked and saw with an alarm that it would be difficult to describe that the wreck had actually sunk into the water several inches within the last few hours this was indeed menacing their security in a most serious manner setting a limit to their existence which rendered all precaution on the subject of food and water useless by the calculations of the mate the wreck could not float more than eightandforty hours should it continue to lose the air at the rate at which it had been hitherto lost bad as all this appeared things were fated to become much more serious the motion of the water quite sensibly increased lifting the wreck at times in a way greatly to increase the danger of their situation the reader will understand this movement did not proceed from the waves of the existing wind but from what is technically called a groundswell or the long heavy undulations that are left by the tempest that is past or by some distant gale the waves of the present breeze were not very formidable the reef making a lee though they might possibly become inconvenient from breaking on the weather side of the wreck as soon as the drift carried the latter fairly abreast of the passage already mentioned but the dangers that proceeded from the heavy groundswell which now began to give a considerable motion to the wreck will best explain itself by narrating the incidents as they occurred  harry had left his marks and had taken his seat on the keel at roses side impatiently waiting for any turn that providence might next give to their situation when a heavy roll of the wreck first attracted his attention to this new circumstance  if any one is thirsty he observed quietly he or she had better drink now while it may be done two or three more such rolls as this last will wash all the water from our gutters  wather is a blessed thing said biddy with a longing expression of the eyes and it would be betther to swallow it than to let it be lost  then drink for heavens sake good womanit may be the last occasion that will offer  sure am i that i would not touch a dhrap while the missus and miss rosy was a sufferin  i have no thirst at all answered rose sweetly and have already taken more water than was good for me with so little food on my stomach  eat another morsel of the bread beloved whispered harry in a manner so urgent that rose gratefully complied drink biddy and we will come and share with you before the water is wasted by this increasing motion  biddy did as desired and each knelt in turn and took a little of the grateful fluid leaving about a gill in the gutters for the use of those whose lips might again become parched  wather is a blessed thing repeated biddy for the twentieth timea blessed blessed thing is wather  a little scream from mrs budd which was dutifully taken up by the maid interrupted the speech of the latter and every eye was turned on mulford as if to ask an explanation of the groaning sound that had been heard within the wreck the young mate comprehended only too well the rolling of the wreck had lifted a portion of the open hatchway above the undulating surface of the sea and a large quantity of the pent air within the hold had escaped in a body the entrance of water to supply the vacuum had produced the groan mulford had made new marks on the vessels bottom with his knife and he stepped down to them anxious and nearly heartbroken to note the effect that one surging of the wreck had permitted air enough to escape to lower it in the water several inches as yet however the visible limits of their floating foundation had not been sufficiently reduced to attract the attention of the females and the young man said nothing on the subject he thought that jack tier was sensible of the existence of this new source of danger but if he were that experienced mariner imitated his own reserve and made no allusion to it thus passed the day occasionally the wreck rolled heavily when more air escaped the hull settling lower and lower in the water as a necessary consequence the little bubbles continued incessantly to rise and mulford became satisfied that another day must decide their fate taking this view of their situation he saw no use in reserving their food but encouraged his companions to share the whole of what remained at sunset little persuasion was necessary and when night once more came to envelope them in darkness not a mouthful of food or a drop of water remained to meet the necessities of the coming morn it had rained again for a short time in the course of the afternoon when enough water had been caught to allay their thirst and what was almost of as much importance to the females now a sufficiency of sun had succeeded to dry their clothes thus enabling them to sleep without enduring the chilling damps that might otherwise have prevented it the wind had sensibly fallen and the groundswell was altogether gone but mulford was certain that the relief had come too late so much air had escaped while it lasted as scarce to leave him the hope that the wreck could float until morning the rising of the bubbles was now incessant the crevices by which they escaped having most probably opened a little in consequence of the pressure and the unceasing action of the currents small as the latter were  just as darkness was shutting in around them for the second time rose remarked to mulford that it seemed to her that they had not as large a space for their little world as when they were first placed on it the mate however successfully avoided an explanation and when the watch was again set for the night the females lay down to seek their repose more troubled with apprehensions for a morrow of hunger and thirst than by any just fears that might so well have arisen from the physical certainty that the body which alone kept them from being engulfed in the sea could float but a few hours longer this night tier kept the lookout until jupiter reached the zenith when mulford was called to hold the watch until light returned  it may seem singular that any could sleep at all in such a situation but we get accustomed in an incredibly short time to the most violent changes and calamities that seem insupportable when looked at from a distance lose half their power if met and resisted with fortitude the last may indeed be too insignificant a word to be applied to all of the party on the wreck on the occasion of which we are writing though no one of them all betrayed fears that were troublesome of mulford it is unnecessary to speak his deportment had been quiet thoughtful and full of a manly interest in the comfort of others from the first moment of the calamity that rose should share the largest in his attentions was natural enough but he neglected no essential duty to her companions rose herself had little hope of being rescued her naturally courageous character however prevented any undue exhibitions of despair and now it was that the niece became the principal support of the aunt completely changing the relations that had formerly existed between them mrs budd had lost all the little buoyancy of her mind not a syllable did she now utter concerning ships and their manoeuvres she had been at first a little disposed to be querulous and despairing but the soothing and pious conversation of rose awakened a certain degree of resolution in her and habit soon exercised its influence over even her inactive mind biddy was a strange mixture of courage despair humility and consideration for others not once had she taken her small allowance of food without first offering it and that too in perfect good faith to her missus and miss rosy yet her moanings for this sort of support and her complaints of bodily suffering much exceeded that of all the rest of the party put together as for jack tier his conduct singularly belied his appearance no one would have expected any great show of manly resolution from the little rotund lymphatic figure of tier but he had manifested a calmness that denoted either great natural courage or a resolution derived from familiarity with danger in this particular even mulford regarded his deportment with surprise not unmingled with respect  you have had a tranquil watch jack said harry when he was called by the person named and had fairly aroused himself from his slumbers has the wind stood as it is since sunset  no change whatever sir it has blown a good working breeze the whole watch and what is surprising not as much lipper has got up as would frighten a colt on a seabeach  we must be near the reef by that i think the only currents we feel come from the tide and they seem to be setting us back and forth instead of carrying us in any one settled direction  quite likely sir and this makes my opinion of what i saw an hour since all the more probable  what you saw in the name of a merciful providence tier do not trifle with me has any thing been seen near by  dont talk to me of your liquors and other dhrinks murmured biddy in her sleep its wather that is a blessed thing and i wish i lived the night and the day by the swate pump thats in our own yard i do  the woman has been talking in her sleep in this fashion most of the watch observed jack coolly and perhaps a little contemptuously but mr mulford unless my eyes have cheated me we are near that boat again the passage through the reef is close aboard us here on our larboard bow as it might be and the current has sucked us in it in a fashion to bring it in a sort of athwarthawse direction to us  if that boat after all should be sent by providence to our relief how long is it since you saw it jack  but a bit since sir or for that matter i think i see it now look hereaway sir just where the deadeyes of the forerigging would bear from us if the craft stood upon her legs as she ought to do if that isnt a boat its a rock out of water  mulford gazed through the gloom of midnight and saw or fancied he saw an object that might really be the boat it could not be very distant either and his mind was instantly made up as to the course he would pursue should it actually turn out to be that which he now so much hoped for and its distance in the morning did not prove too great for human powers he was resolved to swim for it at the hazard of his life in the meantime or until light should return there remained nothing to do but to exercise as much patience as could be summoned and to confide in god soliciting his powerful succour by secret prayer  mulford was no sooner left alone as it might be by tiers seeking a place in which to take his rest than he again examined the state of the wreck little as he had hoped from its longcontinued buoyancy he found matters even worse than he apprehended they would be the hull had lost much air and had consequently sunk in the water in an exact proportion to this loss the space that was actually above the water was reduced to an area not more than six or seven feet in one direction by some ten or twelve in the other this was reducing its extent since the evening previous by fully onehalf and there could be no doubt that the air was escaping in consequence of the additional pressure in a ratio that increased by a sort of arithmetical progression the young man knew that the whole wreck under its peculiar circumstances might sink entirely beneath the surface and yet possess sufficient buoyancy to sustain those that were on it for a time longer but this involved the terrible necessity of leaving the females partly submerged themselves  our mate heard his own heart beat as he became satisfied of the actual condition of the wreck and of the physical certainty that existed of its sinking at least to the point last mentioned ere the sun came to throw his glories over the last view that the sufferers would be permitted to take of the face of day it appeared to him that no time was to be lost there lay the dim and shapeless object that seemed to be the boat distant as he thought about a mile it would not have been visible at all but for the perfect smoothness of the sea and the low position occupied by the observer at times it did disappear altogether when it would rise again as if undulating in the groundswell this last circumstance more than any other persuaded harry that it was not a rock but some floating object that he beheld thus encouraged he delayed no longer every moment was precious and all might be lost by indecision he did not like the appearance of deserting his companions but should he fail the motive would appear in the act should he fail every one would alike soon be beyond the reach of censure and in a state of being that would do full justice to all  harry threw off most of his clothes reserving only his shirt and a pair of light summer trowsers he could not quit the wreck however without taking a sort of leave of rose on no account would he awake her for he appreciated the agony she would feel during the period of his struggles kneeling at her side he made a short prayer then pressed his lips to her warm cheek and left her rose murmured his name at that instant but it was as the innocent and young betray their secrets in their slumbers neither of the party awoke  it was a moment to prove the heart of man that in which harry mulford in the darkness of midnight alone unsustained by any encouraging eye or approving voice with no other aid than his own stout arm and the unknown designs of a mysterious providence committed his form to the sea for an instant he paused after he had waded down on the wreck to a spot where the water already mounted to his breast but it was not in misgivings he calculated the chances and made an intelligent use of such assistance as could be had there had been no sharks near the wreck that day but a splash in the water might bring them back again in a crowd they were probably prowling over the reef near at hand the mate used great care therefore to make no noise there was the distant object and he set it by a bright star that wanted about an hour before it would sink beneath the horizon that star was his beacon and muttering a few words in earnest prayer the young man threw his body forward and left the wreck swimming lightly but with vigour  jack tier  chapter i    the night has been unruly where we lay   our chimneys were blown down and as they say   lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death   and prophesying with accents terrible   of dire combustion and confused events   new hatched to the woful time   macbeth  it is seldom that man is required to make an exertion as desperate and appalling in all its circumstances as that on which harry mulford was now bent the night was starlight it was true and it was possible to see objects near by with tolerable distinctness still it was midnight and the gloom of that hour rested on the face of the sea lending its solemn mystery and obscurity to the other trying features of the undertaking then there was the uncertainty whether it was the boat at all of which he was in pursuit and if the boat it might drift away from him as fast as he could follow it nevertheless the perfect conviction that without some early succour the party on the wreck including rose budd must inevitably perish stimulated him to proceed and a passing feeling of doubt touching the prudence of his course that came over the young mate when he was a few yards from the wreck vanished under a vivid renewal of this last conviction on he swam therefore riveting his eye on the thoughtful star that guided his course and keeping his mind as tranquil as possible in order that the exertions of his body might be the easier  mulford was an excellent swimmer the want of food was a serious obstacle to his making one of his best efforts but as yet he was not very sensible of any great loss of strength understanding fully the necessity of swimming easily if he would swim long he did not throw out all his energy at first but made the movements of his limbs as regular continued and skilful as possible no strength was thrown away and his progress was in proportion to the prudence of this manner of proceeding for some twenty minutes he held on his course in this way when he began to experience a little of that weariness which is apt to accompany an unremitted use of the same set of muscles in a monotonous and undeviating mode accustomed to all the resources of his art he turned on his back for the double purpose of relieving his arms for a minute and of getting a glimpse of the wreck if possible in order to ascertain the distance he had overcome swim long in this new manner however he could not with prudence as the star was necessary in order to keep the direct line of his course it may be well to explain to some of our readers that though the surface of the ocean may be like glass as sometimes really happens it is never absolutely free from the long undulating motion that is known by the name of a ground swell this swell on the present occasion was not very heavy but it was sufficient to place our young mate at moments between two dark mounds of water that limited his view in either direction to some eighty or a hundred yards then it raised him on the summit of a rounded wave that enabled him to see far as his eye could reach under that obscure light profiting by this advantage mulford now looked behind him in quest of the wreck but uselessly it might have been in the trough while he was thus on the summit of the waves or it might be that it floated so low as to be totally lost to the view of one whose head was scarcely above the surface of the water for a single instant the young man felt a chill at his heart as he fancied that the wreck had already sunk but it passed away when he recalled the slow progress by which the air escaped and he saw the certainty that the catastrophe however inevitable could not yet have really arrived he waited for another swell to lift him on its summit when by treading water he raised his head and shoulders fairly above the surface of the sea and strained his eyes in another vain effort to catch a glimpse of the wreck he could not see it in point of fact the mate had swum much further than he had supposed and was already so distant as to render any such attempt hopeless he was fully a third of a mile distant from the point of his departure  disappointed and in a slight degree disheartened mulford turned and swam in the direction of the sinking star he now looked anxiously for the boat it was time that it came more plainly into view and a new source of anxiety beset him as he could discover no signs of its vicinity certain that he was on the course after making a due allowance for the direction of the wind the stouthearted young man swam on he next determined not to annoy himself by fruitless searches or vain regrets but to swim steadily for a certain time a period long enough to carry him a material distance ere he again looked for the object of his search  for twenty minutes longer did that courageous and active youth struggle with the waste of waters amid the obscurity and solitude of midnight he now believed himself near a mile from the wreck and the star which had so long served him for a beacon was getting near to the horizon he took a new observation of another of the heavenly bodies nigh it to serve him in its stead when it should disappear altogether and then he raised himself in the water and looked about again for the boat the search was in vain no boat was very near him of a certainty and the dreadful apprehension began to possess his mind of perishing uselessly in that waste of gloomy waters while thus gazing about him turning his eyes in every quarter hoping intently to catch some glimpse of the muchdesired object in the gloom he saw two dark pointed objects that resembled small stakes in the water within twenty feet of him mulford knew them at a glance and a cold shudder passed through his frame as he recognised them they were out of all question the fins of an enormous shark an animal that could not measure less than eighteen or twenty feet in length  it is scarcely necessary to say that when our young mate discovered the proximity of this dangerous animal situated as he was he gave himself up for lost he possessed his knife however and had heard of the manner in which even sharks were overcome and that too in their own element by the skilful and resolute at first he was resolved to make one desperate effort for life before he submitted to a fate as horrible as that which now menaced him but the movements of his dangerous neighbour induced him to wait it did not approach any nearer but continued swimming back and fro on the surface of the water according to the known habits of the fish as if watching his own movements there being no time to be wasted our young mate turned on his face and began again to swim in the direction of the setting star though nearly chilled by despair for ten minutes longer did he struggle on beginning to feel exhaustion however and always accompanied by those two dark sharp and gliding fins there was no difficulty in knowing the position of the animal and mulfords eyes were oftener on those fins than on the beacon before him strange as it may appear he actually became accustomed to the vicinity of this formidable creature and soon felt his presence a sort of relief against the dreadful solitude of his situation he had been told by seamen of instances and had once witnessed a case himself in which a shark had attended a swimming man for a long distance either forbearing to do him harm from repletion or influenced by that awe which nature has instilled into all of the inferior for the highest animal of the creation he began to think that he was thus favoured and really regarded the shark as a friendly neighbour rather than as a voracious foe in this manner did the two proceed nearly another third of a mile the fins sometimes in sight ahead gliding hither and thither and sometimes out of view behind the swimmer leaving him in dreadful doubts as to the movements of the fish when mulford suddenly felt something hard hit his foot believing it to be the shark dipping for his prey a slight exclamation escaped him at the next instant both feet hit the unknown substance again and he stood erect the water no higher than his waist quick and comprehending everything connected with the sea the young man at once understood that he was on a part of the reef where the water was so shallow as to admit of his wading  mulford felt that he had been providentially rescued from death his strength had been about to fail him when he was thus led unknown to himself to a spot where his life might yet be possibly prolonged for a few more hours or days he had leisure to look about him and to reflect on what was next to be done almost unwittingly he turned in quest of his terrible companion in whose voracious mouth he had actually believed himself about to be immolated a few seconds before there the two hornlike fins still were gliding about above the water and indicating the smallest movement of their formidable owner the mate observed that they went a short distance ahead of him describing nearly a semicircle and then returned doing the same thing in his rear repeating the movements incessantly keeping always on his right this convinced him that shoaler water existed on his left hand and he waded in that direction until he reached a small spot of naked rock  for a time at least he was safe the fragment of coral on which the mate now stood was irregular in shape but might have contained a hundred feet square in superficial measurement and was so little raised above the level of the water as not to be visible even by daylight at the distance of a hundred yards mulford found it was perfectly dry however an important discovery to him as by a close calculation he had made of the tides since quitting the dry tortugas he knew it must be near high water could he have even this small portion of bare rock secure it made him for the moment rich as the most extensive landholder living a considerable quantity of seaweed had lodged on the rock and as most of this was also quite dry it convinced the young sailor that the place was usually bare but though most of this seaweed was dry there were portions of the more recent accessions there that still lay in or quite near to the water which formed exceptions in handling these weeds in order to ascertain the facts mulford caught a small shellfish and finding it fresh and easy to open he swallowed it with the eagerness of a famishing man never had food proved half so grateful to him as that single swallow of a very palatable testaceous animal by feeling further he found several others of the same family and made quite as large a meal as under the circumstances was probably good for him then grateful for his escape but overcome by fatigue he hastily arranged a bed of seaweed drew a portion of the plant over his body to keep him warm and fell into a deep sleep that lasted for hours  mulford did not regain his consciousness until the rays of the rising sun fell upon his eyelids and the genial warmth of the great luminary shed its benign influence over his frame at first his mind was confused and it required a few seconds to bring a perfect recollection of the past and a true understanding of his real situation they came however and the young man moved to the highest part of his little domain and cast an anxious hurried look around in quest of the wreck a knowledge of the course in which he had swum aided by the position of the sun told him on what part of the naked waste to look for the object he sought god had not yet forsaken them there was the wreck or it might be more exact to say there were those whom the remaining buoyancy of the wreck still upheld from sinking into the depths of the gulf in point of fact but a very little of the bottom of the vessel actually remained above water some two or three yards square at most and that little was what seamen term nearly awash two or three hours must bury that small portion of the still naked wood beneath the surface of the sea though sufficient buoyancy might possibly remain for the entire day still to keep the living from death  there the wreck was however yet floating and though not visible to mulford with a small portion of it above water he saw the four persons only and what was more they saw him this was evident by jack tiers waving his hat like a man cheering when mulford returned this signal the shawl of rose was tossed into the air in a way to leave no doubt that he was seen and known the explanation of this early recognition and discovery of the young mate was very simple tier was not asleep when harry left the wreck though seeing the importance of the step the other was taking he had feigned to be so when rose awoke missed her lover and was told what had happened her heart was kept from sinking by his encouraging tale and hopes an hour of agony had succeeded nevertheless when light returned and no mulford was to be seen the despair that burst upon the heart of our heroine was followed by the joy of discovering him on the rock  it is scarcely necessary to say how much the parties were relieved on ascertaining their respective positions faint as were the hopes of each of eventual delivery the two or three minutes that succeeded seemed to be minutes of perfect happiness after this rush of unlookedfor joy mulford continued his intelligent examination of surrounding objects  the wreck was fully half a mile from the rock of the mate but much nearer to the reef than it had been the previous night could it but ground on the rocks thought the young man it would be a most blessed event the thing was possible though the first half hour of his observations told him that its drift was in the direction of the open passage so often named rather than toward the nearest rocks still that drift brought rose each minute nearer and nearer to himself again in looking round however the young man saw the boat it was a quarter of a mile distant with open water between them apparently grounded on a rock for it was more within the reef than he was himself he must have passed it in the dark and the boat had been left to obey the wind and currents and to drift to the spot where it then lay  mulford shouted aloud when he saw the boat and at once determined to swim in quest of it as soon as he had collected a little refreshment from among the seaweed on taking a look at his rock by daylight he saw that its size was quadrupled to the eye by the falling of the tide and that water was lying in several of the cavities of its uneven surface at first he supposed this to be seawater left by the flood but reflecting a moment he remembered the rain and hoped it might be possible that one little cavity containing two or three gallons of the fluid would turn out to be fresh kneeling beside it he applied his lips in feverish haste and drank the sweetest draught that had ever passed his lips slaking his thirst which had begun again to be painfully severe he arose with a heart overflowing with gratitudecould he only get rose to that narrow and barren rock it would seem to be an earthly paradise mulford next made his scanty but all things considered sufficient meal drank moderately afterward and then turned his attention and energies toward the boat which though now aground and fast might soon float on the rising tide and drift once more beyond his reach it was his first intention to swim directly for his object but just when about to enter the water he saw with horror the fins of at least a dozen sharks which were prowling about in the deeper water of the reef and almost encircling his hold to throw himself in the midst of such enemies would be madness and he stopped to reflect and again to look about him for the first time that morning he took a survey of the entire horizon to see if anything were in sight for hitherto his thoughts had been too much occupied with rose and her companions to remember anything else to the northward and westward he distinctly saw the upper sails of a large ship that was standing on a wind to the northward and eastward as there was no port to which a vessel of that character would be likely to be bound in the quarter of the gulf to which such a course would lead mulford at once inferred it was the sloopofwar which after having examined the islets at the dry tortugas and finding them deserted was beating up either to go into key west or to pass to the southward of the reef again by the passage through which she had come as lately as the previous day this was highly encouraging and could he only get to the boat and remove the party from the wreck before it sunk there was now every prospect of a final escape  to the southward also the mate fancied he saw a sail it was probably a much smaller vessel than the ship in the northwest and at a greater distance it might however be the lofty sails of some large craft standing along the reef going westward bound to new orleans or to that new and important port point isabel or it might be some wrecker or other craft edging away into the passage as it was it appeared only as a speck in the horizon and was too far off to offer much prospect of succour  thus acquainted with the state of things around him mulford gave his attention seriously to his duties he was chiefly afraid that the returning tide might lift the boat from the rock on which it had grounded and that it would float beyond his reach then there was the frightful and everincreasing peril of the wreck and the dreadful fate that so inevitably menaced those that it held were not relief prompt this thought goaded him nearly to desperation and he felt at moments almost ready to plunge into the midst of the sharks and fight his way to his object  but reflection showed him a less hazardous way of making an effort to reach the boat the sharks fins described a semicircle only as had been the case of his single attendant during the night and he thought that the shealness of the water prevented their going further than they did in a southeasterly direction which was that of the boat he well knew that a shark required sufficient water to sink beneath its prey ere it made its swoop and that it uniformly turned on its back and struck upward whenever it gave one of its voracious bites this was owing to the greater length of its upper than of its lower jaw and mulford had heard it was a physical necessity of its formation right or wrong he determined to act on this theory and began at once to wade along the part of the reef that his enemies seemed unwilling to approach  had our young mate a weapon of any sort larger than his knife he would have felt greater confidence in his success as it was however he drew that knife and was prepared to sell his life dearly should a foe assail him no sooner was his step heard in the water than the whole group of sharks were set in violent motion glancing past and frequently quite near him as if aware their intended prey was about to escape had the water deepened much harry would have returned at once for a conflict with such numbers would have been hopeless but it did not on the contrary it shoaled again after a very short distance at which it had been waistdeep and mulford found himself wading over a long broad surface of rock and that directly toward the boat through water that seldom rose above his knees and which occasionally scarce covered his feet there was no absolutely naked rock near him but there seemed to be acres of that which might be almost said to be awash amid the greedy throng that endeavoured to accompany him the mate even fancied he recognised the enormous fins of his old companion who sailed to and fro in the crowd in a stately manner as if merely a curious lookeron of his own movements it was the smaller and probably the younger sharks that betrayed the greatest hardihood and voracity one or two of these made fierce swoops toward harry as if bent on having him at every hazard but they invariably glided off when they found their customary mode of attack resisted by the shoalness of the water  our young mate got ahead but slowly being obliged to pay a cautious attention to the movements of his escort sometimes he was compelled to wade up to his arms in order to cross narrow places that he might get on portions of the rock that were nearly bare and once he was actually compelled to swim eight or ten yards nevertheless he did get on and after an hour of this sort of work he found himself within a hundred yards of the boat which lay grounded near a low piece of naked rock but separated from it by a channel of deep water into which all the sharks rushed in a body as if expressly to cut off his escape mulford now paused to take breath and to consider what ought to be done on the spot where he stood he was quite safe though ancledeep in the sea the shallow water extending to a considerable distance on all sides of him with the single exception of the channel in his front he stood on the very verge of that channel and could see in the pellucid element before him that it was deep enough to float a vessel of some size  to venture into the midst of twenty sharks required desperation and harry was not yet reduced to that he had been so busy in making his way to the point where he stood as to have no leisure to look for the wreck but he now turned his eyes in quest of that allinteresting object he saw the shawl fluttering in the breeze and that was all he could see tier had contrived to keep it flying as a signal where he was to be found but the hull of the schooner had sunk so low in the water that they who were seated on its keel were not visible even at the short distance which now separated them from mulford encouraged by this signal and animated by the revived hope of still saving his companions harry turned toward the channel half inclined to face every danger rather than to wait any longer at that moment the fins were all gliding along the channel from him and in the same direction some object drew the sharks away in a body and the young mate let himself easily into the water and swam as noiselessly as he could toward the boat  it was a fearful trial but mulford felt that everything depended on his success stimulated by his motive and strengthened by the food and water taken an hour before never had he shown so much skill and power in the water in an incredibly short period he was halfway across the channel still swimming strong and unharmed a few strokes more sent him so near the boat that hope took full possession of his soul and he shouted in exultation that indiscreet but natural cry uttered so near the surface of the sea turned every shark upon him as the pack springs at the fox in view mulford was conscious of the folly of his cry the instant it escaped him and involuntarily he turned his head to note the effect on his enemies every fin was gliding toward hima dark array of swift and furious foes ten thousand bayonets levelled in their line could not have been onehalf as terrible and the efforts of the young man became nearly frantic but strong as he was and ready in the element what is the movement of a man in the water compared to that of a vigorous and voracious fish mulford could see those fins coming on like a tempest and he had just given up all hope and was feeling his flesh creep with terror when his foot hit the rock giving himself an onward plunge he threw his body upward toward the boat and into so much shoaler water at least a dozen feet by that single effort recovering his legs as soon as possible he turned to look behind him the water seemed alive with fins each pair gliding back and forth as the bulldog bounds in front of the oxs muzzle just then a lightcoloured object glanced past the young man so near as almost to touch him it was a shark that had actually turned on its back to seize its prey and was only prevented from succeeding by being driven from the line of its course by hitting the slimy rock over which it was compelled to make its plunge the momentum with which it came on added to the inclination of the rock forced the head and half of the body of this terrible assailant into the air giving the intended victim an opportunity of seeing from what a fate he had escaped mulford avoided this fish without much trouble however and the next instant he threw himself into the boat on the bottom of which he lay panting with the violence of his exertions and unable to move under the reaction which now came over his system  the mate lay in the bottom of the boat exhausted and unable to rise for several minutes during that space he devoutly returned thanks to god for his escape and bethought him of the course he was next to pursue in order to effect the rescue of his companions the boat was larger than common it was also well equippeda mast and sail lying along with the oars on its thwarts the rock placed harry to windward of the wreck and by the time he felt sufficiently revived to rise and look about him his plan of proceeding was fully arranged in his own mind among other things that he saw as he still lay in the bottom of the boat was a breaker which he knew contained fresh water and a breadbag these were provisions that it was customary for the men to make when employed on boat duty and the articles had been left where he now saw them in the hurry of the movements as the brig quitted the islets  harry rose the instant he felt his strength returning striking the breaker with his foot and feeling the basket with a hand he ascertained that the one held its water and the other its bread this was immense relief for by this time the sufferings of the party on the wreck must be returning with redoubled force the mate then stepped the mast and fitted the sprit to the sail knowing that the latter would be seen fluttering in the wind by those on the wreck and carry joy to their hearts after this considerate act he began to examine into the position of the boat it was still aground having been left by the tide but the water had already risen several inches and by placing himself on a gunwale so as to bring the boat on its bilge and pushing with an oar he soon got it into deep water it only remained to haul aft the sheet and right the helm to be standing through the channel at a rate that promised a speedy deliverance to his friends and most of all to rose  mulford glanced past the rocks and shoals attended by the whole company of the sharks they moved before behind and on each side of him as if unwilling to abandon their prey even after he had got beyond the limits of their power to do him harm it was not an easy thing to manage the boat in that narrow and crooked channel with no other guide for the courses than the eye and it required so much of the mates vigilance to keep clear of the sharp angles of the rocks that he could not once cast his eyes aside to look for the fluttering shawl which now composed the standing signal of the wreck at length the boat shot through the last passage of the reef and issued into open water mulford knew that he must come out half a mile at least to leeward of his object and without even raising his head he flattened in the sheet put his helm down and luffed close to the wind then and then only did he venture to look around him  our mate felt his heart leap toward his mouth as he observed the present state of the wreck it was dead to windward of him in the first place and it seemed to be entirely submerged he saw the shawl fluttering as before for tier had fastened one corner to a buttonhole of his own jacket and another to the dress of biddy leaving the part which might be called the fly to rise at moments almost perpendicularly in the air in a way to render it visible at some distance he saw also the heads and the bodies of those on the schooners bottom but to him they appeared to be standing in or on the water the distance may have contributed a little to this appearance but no doubt remained that so much air had escaped from the hold of the vessel as to permit it to sink altogether beneath the surface of the sea it was time indeed to proceed to the relief of the sufferers  notwithstanding the boat sailed particularly fast and worked beautifully it could not equal the impatience of mulford to get on passing away to the northeast a sufficient distance as he thought to weather on the wreck the young man tacked at last and had the happiness to see that every foot he proceeded was now in a direct line toward rose it was only while tacking he perceived that all the fins had disappeared he felt little doubt that they had deserted him in order to push for the wreck which offered so much larger and so much more attainable prey this increased his feverish desire to get on the boat seeming to drag in his eyes at the very moment it was leaving a wake full of eddies and little whirlpools the wind was steady but it seemed to mulford that the boat was set to leeward of her course by a current though this could hardly have been the case as the wreck the sole mark of his progress would have had at least as great a drift as the boat at length mulfordto him it appeared to be an age in truth it was after a run of about twenty minutescame near the goal he so earnestly sought and got an accurate view of the state of the wreck and of those on it the hull of the schooner had in truth sunk entirely beneath the surface of the sea and the party it sustained stood already kneedeep in the water this was sufficiently appalling but the presence of the sharks who were crowding around the spot rendered the whole scene frightful to the young mate it seemed as if he must still be too late to save rose from a fate more terrible than drowning for his boat fell so far to leeward as to compel him to tack once more as he swept past the wreck he called out to encourage his friends begging them to be of good heart for five minutes longer when he should be able to reach them rose held out her arms entreatingly and the screams of mrs budd and biddy which were extorted by the closer and closer approach of the sharks proclaimed the imminency of the danger they ran and the importance of not losing a moment of time  mulford took his distance with a seamans eye and the boat went about like a top the latter fell off and the sail filled on the other tack then the young mariner saw with a joy no description can pourtray that he looked to windward of the fluttering shawl toward which his little craft was already flying he afterward believed that shawl alone prevented the voracious party of fish from assailing those on the wreck for though there might not yet be sufficient depth of water to allow of their customary mode of attack creatures of their voracity did not always wait for such conveniences but the boat was soon in the midst of the fins scattering them in all directions and mulford let go his sheet put his helm down and sprang forward to catch the extended arms of rose  it might have been accident or it might have been the result of skill and interest in our heroine but certain it is that the bows of the boat came on the wreck precisely at the place where rose stood and her hand was the first object that the young man touched  take my aunt first cried rose resisting mulfords efforts to lift her into the boat she is dreadfully alarmed and can stand with difficulty  although two of roses activity and lightness might have been drawn into the boat while the process was going on in behalf of the widow mulford lost no time in discussion but did as he was desired first directing tier to hold on to the painter he applied his strength to the arms of mrs budd and assisted by rose and biddy got her safely into the boat over its bows rose now waited not for assistance but followed her aunt with a haste that proved fear lent her strength in despite her long fast biddy came next though clumsily and not without trouble and jack tier followed the instant he was permitted so to do of course the boat no longer held by its painter drifted away from the spot and the hull of the schooner relieved from the weight of four human beings rose so near the surface again as to bring a small line of its keel out of water no better evidence could have been given of the trifling power which sustained it and of the timely nature of the succour brought by mulford had the boat remained near the schooner it would have been found half an hour later that the hull had sunk slowly out of sight finding its way doubtless inch by inch toward the bottom of the gulf  by this time the sun was well up and the warmth of the hour season and latitude was shed on the sufferers there was an old sail in the boat and in this the party dried their limbs and feet which were getting to be numb by their long immersion then the mate produced the bag and opened it in quest of bread a small portion was given to each and on looking farther the mate discovered that a piece of boiled ships beef had been secreted in this receptacle of this also he gave each a moderate slice taking a larger portion for himself as requiring less precaution the suffering of the party from hunger was far less than that they endured from thirst neither had been endured long enough seriously to enfeeble them or render a full meal very dangerous but the thirst had been much the hardest to be borne of this fact biddy soon gave audible evidence  the mate is good she said and the bread tastes swate and refreshing but wather is a blessed thing can you no give us one dhrap of the wather that falls from heaven mr mulford for this wather of the saa is of no use but to drown christians in  in an instant the mate had opened a breaker and filled the tin pot which is almost always to be found in a boat biddy said no more but her eyes pleaded so eloquently that rose begged the faithful creature might have the first drink one eager swallow went down and then a cry of disappointment succeeded the water was salt and had been put in the breaker for ballast the other breaker was tried with the same success  it is terrible to be without one drop of water murmured rose and this food makes it more necessary than ever  patience patience dearest rosepatience for ten minutes and you shall all drink answered the mate filling the sail and keeping the boat away while speaking there is water god be praised on the rock to which i first swam and we will secure it before another days sun help to make it evaporate  this announcement quieted the longings of those who endured a thirst which disappointment rendered doubly hard to bear and away the boat glided toward the rock as he now flew over the distance lessened more than onehalf by the drift of the wreck mulford recalled the scene through which he had so painfully passed the previous night as often happens he shuddered at the recollection of things which at the moment a desperate resolution had enabled him to encounter with firmness still he thought nothing less than the ardent desire to save rose could have carried him through the trial with the success which attended his struggles the dear being at his side asked a few explanations of what had passed and she bowed her head and wept equally with pain and delight as imagination pictured to her the situation of her betrothed amid that waste of water with his fearful companions and all in the hours of deep night  but that was over now there was the rockthe blessed rock on which mulford had so accidentally struck close before themand presently they were all on it the mate took the pot and ran to the little reservoir returning with a sweet draught for each of the party  a blessed blessed thing is wather exclaimed biddy this time finding the relief she sought and a thousand blessings on you mr mulford who have niver done us anything but good  rose looked a still higher eulogy on the young man and even mrs budd had something commendatory and grateful to say jack tier was silent but he had all his eyes about him as he now proved  weve all on us been so much taken up with our own affairs remarked the stewards assistant that weve taken but little notice of the neighbourhood if that is nt the brig mr mulford running through this very passage with stunsails set alow and aloft i do nt know the molly swash when i see her  the brig exclaimed the mate recollecting the vessels he had seen at the breakofday for the first time in hours can it be possible that the craft i made out to the southward is the brig  look and judge for yourself sir there she comes like a racehorse and if she holds her present course she must pass somewhere within a mile or so of us if we stay where we are  mulford did look as did all with him there was the swash sure enough coming down before the wind and under a cloud of canvas she might be still a league or a league and a half distant but at the rate at which she was travelling that distance would soon be past she was running through the passage no doubt with a view to proceed to the dry tortugas to look after the schooner spike having the hope that he had dodged his pursuers on the coast of cuba the mate now looked for the ship in the northwestern board believing as he did that she was the sloopofwar that vessel had gone about and was standing to the southward on a taut bowline she was still a long way off three or four leagues at least but the change she had made in her position since last seen proved that she was a great sailer then she was more than hull down whereas now she was near enough to let the outline of a long straight fabric be discovered beneath her canvas  it is hardly possible that spike should not see the vessel here in the northern board mulford observed to tier who had been examining the ship with him the lookout is usually good on board the swash and just now should certainly be as good as common spike is no dawdler with serious business before him  hes a willain muttered jack tier  the mate regarded his companion with some surprise jack was a very insignificantlooking personage in common and one would scarcely pause to give him a second look unless it might be to laugh at his rotundity and little waddling legs but now the mate fancied he was swelling with feelings that actually imparted somewhat more than usual stature and dignity to his appearance his face was full of indignation and there was something about the eye that to mulford was inexplicable as rose however had related to him the scene that took place on the islet at the moment when spike was departing the mate supposed that jack still felt a portion of the resentment that such a collision would be apt to create from the expression of jacks countenance at that instant it struck him spike might not be exactly safe should accident put it in the power of the former to do him an injury  it was now necessary to decide on the course that ought to be pursued the bag contained sufficient food to last the party several days and a gallon of water still remained in the cavity of the rock this last was collected and put in one of the breakers which was emptied of the salt water in order to receive it as water however was the great necessity in that latitude mulford did not deem it prudent to set sail with so small a supply and he accordingly commenced a search on some of the adjacent rocks jack tier accompanying him they succeeded in doubling their stock of water and collected several shellfish that the females found exceedingly grateful and refreshing on the score of hunger and thirst indeed no one was now suffering by judiciously sipping a little water at a time and retaining it in the mouth before swallowing the latter painful feeling had been gotten rid of and as for food there was even more than was actually needed and that of a very good quality it is probable that standing in the water for hours as rose and her aunt and biddy had been obliged to do had contributed to lessen the pain endured from thirst though they had all suffered a good deal from that cause especially while the sun shone  mulford and tier were half an hour in obtaining the water by the end of that period the brigantine was so near as to render her hull distinctly visible it was high time to decide on their future course the sail had been brailed when the boat reached the rock and the boat itself lay on the side of the latter opposite to the brig and where no part of it could be seen to those on board the swash with the exception of the mast under the circumstances therefore mulford thought it wisest to remain where they were and let the vessel pass before they attempted to proceed toward key west their intended place of refuge in order to do this however it was necessary to cause the whole party to lie down in such a way as to be hid by the inequalities in the rock as it was now very evident the brig would pass within half a mile of them hitherto it was not probable that they had been seen and by using due caution the chances of spikes overlooking them altogether amounted nearly to certainty  the necessary arrangements were soon made the boats masts unstepped the party placed behind their covers and the females comfortably bestowed in the spare sail where they might got a little undisturbed sleep after the dreadful night or morning they had passed even jack tier lay down to catch his nap as the most useful manner of bestowing himself for a couple of hours the time mulford had mentioned as the period of their stay where they were  as for the mate vigilance was his portion and he took his position hid like all the rest where he could watch the movements of his old craft in about twenty minutes the brig was quite near so near that mulford not only saw the people on board her who showed themselves in the rigging but fancied he could recognise their persons as yet nothing had occurred in the way of change but just as the swash got abreast of the rock she began to take in her studdingsails and that hurriedly as is apt to occur on board a vessel in sudden emergencies our young man was a little alarmed at first believing that they might have been discovered but he was soon induced to think that the crew of the brigantine had just then begun to suspect the character of the ship to the northward that vessel had been drawing near all this time and was now only some three leagues distant owing to the manner in which she headed or bows on it was not a very easy matter to tell the character of this stranger though the symmetry and squareness of his yards rendered it nearly certain he was a cruiser though spike could not expect to meet his old acquaintance here after the chase he had so lately led her down on the opposite coast he might and would have his misgivings and mulford thought it was his intention to haul up close round the northern angle of the reef and maintain his advantage of the wind over the stranger if this were actually done it might expose the boat to view for the brig would pass within a quarter of a mile of it and on the side of the rock on which it lay it was too late however to attempt a change since the appearance of human beings in such a place would be certain to draw the brigs glasses on them and the glasses must at once let spike know who they were it remained therefore only to await the result as patiently as possible  a very few minutes removed all doubt the brig hauled as close round the reef as she dared to venture and in a very short time the boat lay exposed to view to all on board her the vessel was now so near that mulford plainly saw the boatswain get upon the coachhouse or little hurricanehouse deck where spike stood examining the ship with his glass and point out the boat where it lay at the side of the rock in an instant the glass was levelled at the spot and the movements on board the brig immediately betrayed to mulford that the boat was recognised sail was shortened on board the swash and men were seen preparing to lower her stern boat while everything indicated that the vessel was about to be hoveto there was no time now to be lost but the young man immediately gave the alarm  no sooner did the party arise and show themselves than the crew of the swash gave three cheers by the aid of the glass spike doubtless recognised their persons and the fact was announced to the men by way of stimulating their exertions this gave an additional spur to the movements of those on the rock who hastened into their own boat and made sail as soon as possible  it was far easier to do all that has been described than to determine on the future course capture was certain if the fugitives ventured into the open water and their only hope was to remain on the reef if channels for the passage of the boat could be found escape was highly probable as the schooners boat could sail much faster than the brigs boat could row fast as mulford knew the last to be but the experience of the morning had told the mate that the rock rose too near the surface in many places for the boat small as it was to pass over it and he must trust a great deal to chance away he went however standing along a narrow channel through which the wind just permitted him to lay with the sail occasionally shaking  by this time the swash had her boat in the water manned with four powerful oars spike steering it in his own person our young mate placed tier in the bows to point out the deepest water and kept his sail a rap full in order to get ahead as fast as possible ahead he did get but it was on a course that soon brought him out in the open water of the main passage through the reef leaving spike materially astern the latter now rose in his boat and made a signal with his hat which the boatswain perfectly understood the latter caused the brig to ware short round on her heel and boarded his foretack in chase hauling up into the passage as soon as he could again round the reef mulford soon saw that it would never do for him to venture far from the rocks the brig going two feet to his one though not looking quite as high as he did in the boat but the swash had her guns and it was probable they would be used rather than he should escape when distant two hundred yards from the reef therefore he tacked the new course brought the fugitives nearly at right angles to that steered by spike who stood directly on as if conscious that sooner or later such a rencounter must occur it would seem that the tide was setting through the passage for when the boat of mulford again reached the reef it was considerably to windward of the channel out of which she had issued and opposite to another which offered very opportunely for her entrance into this new channel then the mate somewhat blindly ran feeling the necessity of getting out of gunshot of the brig at every hazard she at least could not follow him among the rocks let spike in his boat proceed as he might  according to appearances spike was not likely to be very successful he was obliged to diverge from his course in order to go into the main passage at the very point where mulford had just before done the same thing and pull along the reef to windward in order to get into the new channel into which the boat he was pursuing had just entered this brought him not only astern again but a long bit astern inasmuch as he was compelled to make the circuit described on he went however as eager in the chase as the hound with his game in view  mulfords boat seemed to fly and glided ahead at least three feet to that of spikes two the direction of the channel it was in brought it pretty close to the wind but the water was quite smooth and our mate managed to keep the sail full and his little craft at the same time quite near the weatherly side of the rocks in the course of ten minutes the fugitives were fully a mile from the brig which was unable to follow them but kept standing off and on in the main passage waiting the result at one time mulford thought the channel would bring him out into open water again on the northern side of the reef and more than a mile to the eastward of the point where the shipchannel in which the swash was plying commenced but an accidental circumstance prevented his standing in far enough to ascertain the fact that circumstance was as follows  in running a mile and a half over the reef in the manner described mulford had left the boat of spike quite half a mile astern he was now out of gunshot from the brig or at least beyond the range of her grape the only missile he feared and so far to windward that he kept his eye on every opening to the southward which he fancied might allow of his making a stretch deeper into the mazes of the reef among which he believed it easiest for him to escape and to weary the oarsmen of his pursuers two or three of these openings offered as he glided along but it struck him that they all looked so high that the boat would not lay through theman opinion in which he was right at length he came abreast of one that seemed straight and clear of obstacles as far as he could see and through which he might run with a flowing sheet down went his helm and about went his boat running away to the southward as fast as ever  had spike followed doubled the same shoal and kept away again in the same channel as had been done by the boat he chased all his hopes of success must have vanished at once this he did not attempt therefore but sheering into one of the openings which the mate had rejected he cut off quite half a mile in his distance this was easy enough for him to accomplish as a rowboat would pull even easier near to the wind than with the wind broad on its bow in consequence of this short cut therefore spike was actually crossing out into mulfords new channel just as the latter had handsomely cleared the mouth of the opening through which he effected his purpose  it is scarcely necessary to say that the two boats must have been for a few minutes quite near to each other so near indeed did the fugitives now pass to their pursuers that it would have been easy for them to have conversed had they been so disposed not a word was spoken however but mulford went by leaving spike about a hundred yards astern this was a trying moment to the latter and the devil tempted him to seek his revenge he had not come unarmed on his enterprise but three or four loaded muskets lay in the sternsheets of his yawl he looked at his men and saw that they could not hold out much longer to pull as they had been pulling then he looked at mulfords boat and saw it gliding away from him at a rate that would shortly place it another half mile in advance he seized a musket and raised it to his shoulder nay was in the act of taking aim at his mate when rose who watched his movements threw herself before harry and if she did not actually save his life at least prevented spikes attempt on it for that occasion in the course of the next ten minutes the fugitives had again so far gained on their pursuers that the latter began to see that their efforts were useless spike muttered a few bitter curses and told his men to lay on their oars  its well for the runaway he added that the gal put herself between us else would his grog have been stopped for ever ive long suspected this but had i been sure of it the gulf stream would have had the keeping of his body the first dark night we were in it together lay on your oars men lay on your oars im afeared the villian will get through our fingers ater all  the men obeyed and then for the first time did they turn their heads to look at those they had been so vehemently pursuing the other boat was quite half a mile from them and it had again tacked this last occurrence induced spike to pull slowly ahead in quest of another short passage to cut the fugitives off but no such opening offered  there he goes about again by george exclaimed spike give way ladsgive way an easy stroke for if he is embayed he cant escape us  sure enough poor mulford was embayed and could see no outlet by which to pass ahead he tacked his boat two or three times and he wore round as often but on every side shoals or rocks that actually rose above the surface of the water impeded his course the fact was not to be concealed after all his efforts and so many promises of success not only was his further progress ahead cut off but equally so was retreat the passage was not wide enough to admit the hope of getting by his pursuers and the young man came to the conclusion that his better course was to submit with dignity to his fate for himself he had no hopehe knew spikes character too well for that but he did not apprehend any great immediate danger to his companions spike had a coarse brutal admiration for rose but her expected fortune which was believed to be of more amount than was actually the case was a sort of pledge that he would not willingly put himself in a situation that would prevent the possibility of enjoying it strange hurried and somewhat confused thoughts passed through harry mulfords mind as he brailed his sail and waited for his captors to approach and take possession of his boat and himself this was done quietly and with very few words on the part of spike  mulford would have liked the appearance of things better had his old commander cursed him and betrayed other signs of the fury that was boiling in his very soul on the contrary never had stephen spike seemed more calm or under better selfcommand he smiled and saluted mrs budd just as if nothing unpleasant had occurred and alluded to the sharpness of the chase with facetiousness and seeming goodhumour the females were deceived by this manner and hoped after all that the worst that would happen would be a return to their old position on board the swash this was being so much better off than their horrible situation on the wreck that the change was not frightful to them  what has become of the schooner mr mulford asked spike as the boats began to pass down the channel to return to the brigtwo of the swashs men taking their seats in that which had been captured along with their commander while the other two got a tow from the use of the sail i see you have the boat here that we used alongside of her and suppose you know something of the craft itself  she capsized with us in a squall answered the mate and we only left the wreck this morning  capsizedhumthat was a hard fate to be sure and denotes bad seamanship now ive sailed all sorts of craft these forty years or fiveandthirty at least and never capsized anything in my life stand by there forard to hold on by that rock  a solitary cap of the coral rose above the water two or three feet close to the channel and was the rock to which spike alluded it was only some fifty feet in diameter and of an oval form rising quite above the ordinary tides as was apparent by its appearance it is scarcely necessary to say it had no other fresh water than that which occasionally fell on its surface which surface being quite smooth retained very little of the rain it received the boat was soon alongside of this rock where it was held broadsideto by the two seamen  mr mulford do me the favour to step up here said spike leading the way on to the rock himself i have a word to say to you before we get on board the old molly once more  mulford silently complied fully expecting that spike intended to blow his brains out and willing the bloody deed should be done in a way to be as little shocking to rose as circumstances would allow but spike manifested no such intention a more refined cruelty was uppermost in his mind and his revenge was calculated and took care to fortify itself with some of the quibbles and artifices of the law he might not be exactly right in his legal reservations but he did not the less rely on their virtue  harke mr mulford said spike sharply as soon as both were on the rock you have run from my brig thereby showing your distaste for her and ive no disposition to keep a man who wishes to quit me here you are sir on terrum firm as the scholars call it and here you have my full permission to remain i wish you a good morning sir and will not fail to report when we get in that you left the brig of your own pleasure  you will not have the cruelty to abandon me on this naked rock captain spike and that without a morsel of food or a drop of water  wather is a blessed thing exclaimed biddy do not think of lavin the gentleman widout wather  you left me sir without food or water and you can fit out your own rockyes de sir you left me under fire and that is a thing no truehearted man would have thought of stand by to make sail boys and if he offer to enter the boat pitch him out with the boathooks  spike was getting angry and he entered the boat again without perceiving that rose had left it light of foot and resolute of spirit the beautiful girl handsomer than ever perhaps by her excited feelings and dishevelled hair had sprung on the rock as spike stepped into the boat forward and when the latter turned round after loosening the sail he found he was drifting away from the very being who was the object of all his efforts mulford believing that rose was to be abandoned as well as himself received the noble girl in his arms though ready to implore spike on his knees to return and at least to take her off but spike wanted no solicitation on that point he returned of his own accord and had just reached the rock again when a report of a gun drew all eyes toward the brig  the swash had again run out of the passage and was beating up close to the reef as she dared to go with a signal flying all the seamen at once understood the cause of this hint the strange sail was getting too near and everybody could see that it was the sloopofwar spike looked at rose a moment in doubt but mulford raised his beloved in his arms and carried her to the side of the rock stepping on board the boat  spike watched the movements of the young man with jealous vigilance and no sooner was rose placed on her seat than he motioned significantly to the mate to quit the boat  i cannot and will not voluntarily captain spike answered harry calmly it would be committing a sort of suicide  a sign brought two of the men to the captains assistance while the latter held rose in her place the sailors shoved harry on the rock again had mulford been disposed to resist these two men could not very easily have ejected him from the boat if they could have done it at all but he knew there were others in reserve and feared that blood might be shed in the irritated state of spike in the presence of rose while therefore he would not be accessary to his own destruction he would not engage in what he knew would prove not only a most harassing but a bootless resistance the consequence was that the boats proceeded leaving him alone on the rock  it was perhaps fortunate for rose that she fainted her condition occupied her aunt and biddy and spike was enabled to reach his brig without any further interruption rose was taken on board still nearly insensible while her two female companions were so much confused and distressed that neither could have given a reasonably clear account of what had just occurred not so with jack tier however that singular being noted all that passed seated in the eyes of the boat away from the confusion that prevailed in its sternsheets and apparently undisturbed by it  as the party was sailing back toward the brig the lighthouse boat towing the swashs yawl jack took as good an observation of the channels of that part of the reef as his low position would allow he tried to form in his mind a sort of chart of the spot for from the instant mulford was thus deserted the little fellow had formed a stern resolution to attempt his rescue how that was to be done however was more than he yet knew and when they reached the brigs side tier may be said to have been filled with good intentions rather than with any very available knowledge to enable him to put them in execution  as respects the two vessels the arrival of spike on board his own was not a moment too soon the poughkeepsie for the stranger to the northward was now ascertained to be that sloopofwar was within long gunshot by this time and near enough to make certain by means of her glasses of the character of the craft with which she was closing luckily for the brig she lay in the channel so often mentioned and through which both she and her present pursuer had so lately come on their way to the northward this brought her to windward as the wind then stood with a clear passage before her not a moment was lost no sooner were the females sent below than sail was made on the brig and she began to beat through the passage making long legs and short ones she was chased as a matter of course and that hard the difference in sailing between the two crafts not being sufficiently great to render the brigantines escape by any means certain while absolutely within the range of those terrible missiles that were used by the manofwars men  but spike soon determined not to leave a point so delicate as that of his own and his vessels security to be decided by a mere superiority in the way of heels the florida reef with all its dangers windings and rocks was as well known to him as the entrances to the port of new york in addition to its larger channels of which there are three or four through which ships of size can pass it had many others that would admit only vessels of a lighter draught of water the brig was not flying light it is true but she was merely in good ballast trim and passages would be available to her into which the poughkeepsie would not dare to venture one of these lesser channels was favourably placed to further the escape of spike and he shoved the brig into it after the struggle had lasted less than an hour this passage offered a shorter cut to the south side of the reef than the main channel and the sloopofwar doubtless perceiving the uselessness of pursuit under such circumstances wore round on her heel and came down through the main channel again just entering the open water near the spot where the schooner had sunk as the sun was setting  chapter ii  shallow did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound  evans ay and her father is make her a petter penny  shallow i know the young gentlewoman she has good gifts  evans seven hundred pounds and possibilities is good gifts  shakspeare  as for spike he had no intention of going to the southward of the florida reef again until his business called him there the lost bag of doubloons was still gleaming before his imagination and no sooner did the poughkeepsie bear up than he shortened sail standing back and forth in his narrow and crooked channel rather losing ground than gaining though he took great pains not to let his artifice be seen when the poughkeepsie was so far to the northward as to render it safe he took in everything but one or two of his lowest sails and followed easily in the same direction as the sloopofwar carried her light and loftier sails she remained visible to the people of the swash long after the swash had ceased to be visible to her profiting by this circumstance spike entered the main channel again some time before it was dark and selected a safe anchorage there that was well known to him a spot where sufficient sand had collected on the coral to make good holding ground and where a vessel would be nearly embayed though always to windward of her channel going out by the formation of the reef here he anchored in order to wait until morning ere he ventured further north during the whole of that dreadful day rose had remained in her cabin disconsolate nearly unable as she was absolutely unwilling to converse now it was that she felt the total insufficiency of a mind feeble as that of her aunts to administer consolation to misery like her own nevertheless the affectionate solicitude of mrs budd as well as that of the faithful creature biddy brought some relief and reason and resignation began slowly to resume their influence yet was the horrible picture of harry dying by inches deserted in the midst of the waters on his solitary rock ever present to her thoughts until once or twice her feelings verged on madness prayer brought its customary relief however and we do not think that we much exaggerate the fact when we say that rose passed fully onehalf of that terrible afternoon on her knees  as for jack tier he was received on board the brig much as if nothing had happened spike passed and repassed him fifty times without even an angry look or a word of abuse and the deputysteward dropped quietly into the duties of his office without meeting with either reproach or hindrance the only allusion indeed that was made to his recent adventures took place in a conversation that was held on the subject in the galley the interlocutors being jack himself josh the steward and simon the cook  where you been scullin to bout on dat reef jack wid dem ere women i woner now demanded josh after tasting the cabin soup in order to ascertain how near it was to being done itink it no great fun to dodge bout among dem rock in a boat for anudder hurricane might come when a body least expeck him  oh said jack cavalierly two hurricanes no more come in one month than two shot in the same hole weve been turtlin thats all i wish we had in your coppers cook some of the critturs that we fell in with in our cruise  wishe had master steward wid all my heart answered the fat glistening potentate of the galley but harkee jack what became of our young mate can e tell some say he get kill ate dry tortugas and some say he war scullin round in dat boat you hab wide young woman eh  ah boys answered jack mournfully sure enough what has become of him  you know why cant you tell what good to hab secret among friend  are ye his friends lads do you really feel as if you could give a poor soul in its agony a helpin hand  why not said josh in a reproachful way misser mulforde bess mate dis brig ebber get and i dont see why capin spikewant to be rid of him  because hes a willian returned jack between his grated teeth dye know what that means in english master josh and can you and cook here both of whom have sailed with the man years in and years out say whether my words be true or not  dat as a body understand em accordin to some rule stephen spike not a werry honest man but accordin to nudder some he as good as any body else  yes dat just be upshot of de matter put in simon approvingly de whole case lie in dat meanin  dye call it right to leave a human being to starve or to suffer for water on a naked rock in the midst of the ocean  who do dat  the willian who is captain of this brig and all because he thinks young eyes and bloomin cheeks prefar young eyes and bloomin cheeks to his own grizzly beard and old lookouts  dat bad dat werry bad said josh shaking his head a way of denoting dissatisfaction in which simon joined him for no crime appeared sufficiently grave in the eyes of these two sleek and wellfed officials to justify such a punishment dat monsous bad and capin ought to know better dan do dat i nebber starves a mouse if i catches him in de breadlocker now dat a sort of reasonble punishment too but i nebber does it if mouse eat my bread it do seem right to tell mouse dat he hab enough and dat he must not eat any more for a week or a mont but it too cruel for me and i nebber does it no i trows de little debil overboard and lets him drown like a gentleem  yes drawled out simon in a philanthropical tone of voice date best way what good it do to torment a fellow critter if misser mulford run why put him down run and let him go i say ony mulk his wages but what good it do anybody to starve him now dis is my opinion gentleem and dat is dat starwation be wuss dan choleric choleric kill i knows and so does starwation kill but of de two gib me de choleric fuss if i gets well of dat den try starwation if you can  im glad to hear you talk in this manner my hearties put in jack and i hope i may find you accommodatin in a plan ive got to help the maty out of this difficulty as a friend of stephen spikes i would do it for it must be a terrible thing to die with such a murder on ones soul heres the boat that we pickd up at the lighthouse yonder in tow of the brig at this minute and theres everything in her comfortable for a good long run as i know from having sailed in her and what i mean is this as we left mr mulford i took the bearings and distance of the rock he was on dye understand and think i could find my way back to it you see the brig is travelin slowly north agin and afore long we shall be in the neighbourhood of that very rock we cook and stewards will be called on to keep an anchorwatch if the brig fetches up as i heard the captain tell the spanish gentleman he thought she would and then we can take the boat thats in the water and go and have a hunt for the maty  the two blacks looked at tier earnestly then they turned their heads to look at each other the idea struck each as bold and novel but each saw serious difficulties in it at length josh as became his superior station took on himself the office of expressing the objections that occurred to his mind  dat nebber do exclaimed the steward we bes quite willin to sarvee mate whos a good gentleem and as nice a young man as ever sung out hard alee but we must tink little bit of number one or for dat matter of number two as simon would be implercated as well as myself if capin spike once knew weve lent a hand in sich a job hed never overlook it i knows him well and that is sayin as much as need be said of any mans character you nebber catch me runnin myself into his jaws would rather fight a shark widout any knife no noi knows him well den comes anudder werry unanswerable objecshun and dat is date brig owe bot simon and i money fifty dollars each on us if she owe one cent now do you tink in cander jack dat two colour gentleem like us can trow away our fortins like two sons of a york merchant dat has inherited a hundred tousand dollar tudder day  there is no occasion for running at all or for losing your wages  how you gete mate off den can he walk away on de water if so let him go widout us a werry good gentleem is misser mulford but not good enough to mulk simon and me out of fifty dollar each  you will not hear my project josh and so will never know what i would be at  well come tell him jest as you surposes him now listen simon so dat not a word be loss  my plan is to take the boat if we anchor as anchor i know we shall and go and find the rock and bring mr mulford off then we can come back to the brig and get on board ourselves and let the mate sail away in the boat by himself on this plan nobody will run and no wages be mulcted  but dat take time and an anchorwatch last but two hour surposin even datey puts all tree of us in de same watch  spike usually does that you know let the cook and the stewards keep the midnight watch he commonly says and that will give the foremost hands a better snooze  yes he do say dat josh put in simon most ebbery time we comesto  i know he does and surposes he will say it tonight if he comesto tonight but a two hour watch may not be long enough to do all you wants and den jest tink for a moment should e capin come on deck and haile forecastle and find us all gone i wouldnt be in your skin jack for dis brig in sich a kerlamity i knows capin spike well tree time i endebber to run myself and each time he bring me up wid a round turn so nowadays i nebber tinks of sich a projeck any longer  but i do not intend to leave the forecastle without some one on it to answer a hail no all i want is a companion for i do not like to go out on the reef at midnight all alone if one of you will go with me the other can stay and answer the captains hail should he really come on deck in our watcha thing very little likely to happen when once his head is on his pillow ater a hard days work its not very apt to be lifted agin without a call or a squall if you do know stephen spike well josh i know him better  well jack dis here is a new idee dye see and a body must take time to consider on it if simon and i do ship for dis vyge t will be for lub of mr mulford and not for his money or yourn  this was all the encouragement of his project jack tier could obtain on that occasion from either his brother steward or from the cook these blacks were well enough disposed to rescue an innocent and unoffending man from the atrocious death to which spike had condemned his mate but neither lost sight of his own security and interest they promised tier not to betray him however and he had the fullest confidence in their pledges they who live together in common usually understand the feeling that prevails on any given point in their own set and jack felt pretty certain that harry was a greater favourite in and about the camboose than the captain on that feeling he relied and he was fain to wait the course of events ere he came to any absolute conclusion as to his own course  the interview in the galley took place about half an hour before the brig anchored for the night tier who often assisted on such occasions went aloft to help secure the royal one of the gaskets of which had got loose and from the yard he had an excellent opportunity to take a look at the reef the situation of the vessel and the probable bearings of the rock on which poor mulford had been devoted to a miserable death this opportunity was much increased by spikes hailing him while on the yard and ordering him to take a good look at the sloopofwar and at the same time to ascertain if any boats were prowlin about in order to make a set upon us in the night on receiving this welcome order jack answered with a cheerful ay ay sir and standing up on the yard he placed an arm around the mast and remained for a long time making his observations the command to lookout for boats would have been a sufficient excuse had he continued on the yard as long as it was light  jack had no difficulty in finding the poughkeepsie which was already through the passage and no longer visible from the deck she appeared to be standing to the northward and westward under easy canvas like a craft that was in no hurry this fact was communicated to spike in the usual way the latter seemed pleased and he answered in a hearty manner just as if no difficulty had ever occurred between him and the stewards assistant  very well jack bravo jacknow take a good look for boats youll have light enough for that this half hour cried the captain if any are out youll find them pulling down the channel or maybe theyll try to shorten the cut by attempting to pull athwart the reef take a good and steady look for them my man  ay ay sir ill do all i can with naked eyes answered jack but i could do better sir if they would only send me up a glass by these here signalhalyards with a glass a fellow might speak with some sartainty  spike seemed struck with the truth of this suggestion and he soon sent a glass aloft by the signalhalyards thus provided jack descended as low as the crosstrees where he took his seat and began a survey at his leisure while thus employed the brig was secured for the night her decks were cleared and the people were ordered to get their suppers previously to setting an anchorwatch and turningin for the night no one heeded the movements of tierfor spike had gone into his own stateroomwith the exception of josh and simon those two worthies were still in the galley conversing on the subject of jacks recent communications and ever and anon one of them would stick his head out of the door and look aloft withdrawing it and shaking it significantly as soon as his observations were ended  as for tier he was seated quite at his ease and having slung his glass to one of the shrouds in a way to admit of its being turned as on a pivot he had every opportunity for observing accurately and at his leisure the first thing jack did was to examine the channel very closely in order to make sure that no boats were in it after which he turned the glass with great eagerness toward the reef in the almost hopeless office of ascertaining something concerning mulford in point of fact the brig had anchored quite three leagues from the solitary rock of the deserted mate and favoured as he was by his elevation jack could hardly expect to discern so small and low an object as that rock at so great a distance nevertheless the glass was much better than common it had been a present to spike from one who was careful in his selections of such objects and who had accidentally been under a serious obligation to the captain knowing the importance of a good look as regards the boats spike had brought this particular instrument of which in common he was very chary from his own stateroom and sent it aloft in order that jack might have every available opportunity of ascertaining his facts it was this glass then which was the means of the important discoveries the little fellow who was thus perched on the foretopmast crosstrees of the swash did actually succeed in making  jack actually started when he first ascertained how distinctly and near the glass he was using brought distant objects the gulls that sailed across its disk though a league off appeared as if near enough to be touched by the hand and even their feathers gave out not only their hues but their forms thus too was it with the surface of the ocean of which the little waves that agitated the water of the reef might be seen tossing up and down at more than twice the range of the poughkeepsies heaviest gun naked rocks low and subdued as they were in colour too were to be noted scattered up and down in the panorama at length tier fancied his glass covered a field that he recognized it was distant but might be seen from his present elevation a second look satisfied him he was right and he next clearly traced the last channel in which they had endeavoured to escape from spike or that in which the boat had been taken following it along by slowly moving the glass he actually hit the rock on which mulford had been deserted it was peculiar in shape size and elevation above the water and connected with the circumstance of the channel which was easily enough seen by the colour of the water and more easily from his height than if he had been in it he could not be mistaken the little fellows heart beat quick as he made the glass move slowly over its surface anxiously searching for the form of the mate it was not to be seen a second and a more careful sweep of the glass made it certain that the rock was deserted  although a little reflection might have satisfied any one mulford was not to be sought in that particular spot so long after he had been left there jack tier felt grievously disappointed when he was first made certain of the accuracy of his observations a minute later he began to reason on the matter and he felt more encouraged the rock on which the mate had been abandoned was smooth and could not hold any fresh water that might have been left by the late showers jack also remembered that it had neither seaweed nor shellfish in short the utmost malice of spike could not have selected for the immolation of his victim a more suitable place now tier had heard harrys explanation to rose touching the manner in which he had waded and swum about the reef that very morning and it at once occurred to him that the young man had too much energy and spirit to remain helpless and inactive to perish on a naked rock when there might be a possibility of at least prolonging existence if not of saving it this induced the steward to turn the glass slowly over the water and along all the ranges of visible rock that he could find in that vicinity for a long time the search was useless the distance rendering such an examination not only difficult but painful at length jack about to give up the matter in despair took one sweep with the glass nearer to the brig as much to obtain a general idea of the boatchannels of the reef as in any hope of finding mulford when an object moving in the water came within the field of the glass he saw it but for an instant as the glass swept slowly past but it struck him it was something that had life and was in motion carefully going over the same ground again after a long search he again found what he so anxiously sought a good look satisfied him that he was right it was certainly a man wading along the shallow water of the reef immersed to his waistand it must be mulford  so excited was jack tier by this discovery that he trembled like a leaf a minute or two elapsed before he could again use the glass and when he did a long and anxious search was necessary before so small an object could be once more found find it he did however and then he got its range by the vessel in a way to make sure of it yes it was a man and it was mulford  circumstances conspired to aid jack in the investigation that succeeded the sun was near setting but a stream of golden light gleamed over the waters particularly illuminating the portion which came within the field of the glass it appeared then that harry in his efforts to escape from the rock and to get nearer to the edge of the main channel where his chances of being seen and rescued would be tenfold what they were on his rock had moved south by following the naked reef and the shallow places and was actually more than a league nearer to the brig than he would have been had he remained stationary there had been hours in which to make this change and the young man had probably improved them to the utmost  jack watched the form that was wading slowly along with an interest he had never before felt in the movements of any human being whether mulford saw the brig or not it was difficult to say she was quite two leagues from him and now that her sails were furled she offered but little for the eye to rest on at that distance at first jack thought the young man was actually endeavouring to get nearer to her though it must have been a forlorn hope that should again place him in the hands of spike it was however a more probable conjecture that the young man was endeavouring to reach the margin of the passage where a good deal of rock was above water and near to which he had already managed to reach at one time jack saw that the mate was obliged to swim and he actually lost sight of him for a time his form however reappeared and then it slowly emerged from the water and stood erect on a bare rock of some extent jack breathed freer at this for mulford was now on the very margin of the channel and might be easily reached by the boat should he prevail on josh or simon to attempt the rescue  at first jack tier fancied that mulford had knelt to return thanks on his arrival at a place of comparative safety but a second look satisfied him that harry was drinking from one of the little pools of fresh water left by the late shower when he rose from drinking the young man walked about the place occasionally stooping signs that he was picking up shellfish for his supper suddenly mulford darted forward and passed beyond the field of the glass when jack found him again he was in the act of turning a small turtle using his knife on the animal immediately after had jack been in danger of starvation himself and found a source of food as ample and as grateful as this he could scarcely have been more delighted the light now began to wane perceptibly still harrys movements could be discerned the turtle was killed and dressed sufficiently at least for the mates purposes and the latter was seen collecting seaweed and bits of plank boards and sticks of wood of which more or less in drifting past had lodged upon the rocks is it possible thought jack that he is so werry particlar he cant eat his turtle raw will he indeed venture to light a fire or has he the means mulford was so particular however he did venture to light a fire and he had the means this may be said to be the age of matchesnot in a connubial though in an inflammatory senseand the mate had a small stock in a tight box that he habitually carried on his person tier saw him at work over a little pile he had made for a long time the beams of day departing now so fast as to make him fearful he should soon lose his object in the increasing obscurity of twilight suddenly a light gleamed and the pile sent forth a clear flame mulford went to and fro collecting materials to feed his fire and was soon busied in cooking his turtle all this tier saw and understood the light of the flames coming in proper time to supply the vacuum left by the departure of that of day  in a minute tier had no difficulty in seeing the fire that mulford had lighted on his low and insulated domains with the naked eye it gleamed brightly in that solitary place and the steward was much afraid it would be seen by some one on deck get to be reported to spike and lead to harrys destruction after all the mate appeared to be insensible to his danger however occasionally casting piles of dry seaweed on his fire in a way to cause the flames to flash up as if kindled anew by gunpowder it now occurred to tier that the young man had a double object in lighting this fire which would answer not only the purposes of his cookery but as a signal of distress to anything passing near the sloopofwar though more distant than the brig was in his neighbourhood and she might possibly yet send relief such was the state of things when jack was startled by a sudden hail from below it was spikes voice and came up to him short and quick  foretopmast crosstrees there what are ye about all this time master jack tier in them foretopmast crosstrees i say demanded spike  keeping a lookout for boats from the sloopofwar as you bade me sir answered jack coolly  dye see any my man is the water clear ahead of us or not  its getting to be so dark sir i can see no longer while there was daylight no boat was to be seen  come down mancome down ive business for you below the sloop is far enough to the norard and we shall neither see nor hear from her tonight come down i say jackcome down  jack obeyed and securing the glass he began to descend the rigging he was soon as low as the top when he paused a moment to take another look the fire was still visible shining like a torch on the surface of the water casting its beams abroad like a good deed in a naughty world jack was sorry to see it though he once more took its bearing from the brig in order that he might know where to find the spot in the event of a search for it when on the stretcher of the forerigging jack stopped and again looked for his beacon it had disappeared having sunk below the circular formation of the earth by ascending two or three ratlins it came into view and by going down as low as the stretcher again it disappeared trusting that no one at that hour would have occasion to go aloft jack now descended to the deck and went aft with the spyglass  spike and the señor montefalderon were under the coachhouse no one else appearing on any part of the quarterdeck the people were eating their suppers and josh and simon were busy in the galley as for the females they chose to remain in their own cabin where spike was well pleased to leave them  come this way jack said the captain in his besthumoured tone of voice ive a word to say to you put the glass in at my stateroom window and come hither  tier did as ordered  so you can make out no boats to the norard ha jack nothing to be seen thereaway  nothing in the way of a boat sir  ay ay i dare say theres plenty of water and some rock the florida reef has no scarcity of either to them that knows where to look for one and to steer clear of the other harke jack so you got the schooner under way from the dry tortugas and undertook to beat her up to key west when she fancied herself a turtle and over she went with youis that it my man  the schooner turned turtle with us sure enough sir and we all came near drowning on her bottom  no sharks in that latitude and longitude eh jack  plenty on em sir and i thought they would have got us all at one time more than twenty set of fins were in sight at once for several hours  you could hardly have supplied the gentlemen with a leg or an arm each but where was the boat all this timeyou had the lighthouse boat in tow i suppose  she had been in tow sir but madam budd talked so much dictionary to the painter that it got adrift  yet i found you all in it  very true sir mr mulford swam quite a mile to reach the rocks and found the boat aground on one on em as soon as he got the boat he made sail and came and took us off we had reason to thank god he could do so  spike looked dark and thoughtful he muttered the words swam and rocks but was too cautious to allow any expressions to escape him that might betray to the mexican officer that which was uppermost in his mind he was silent however for quite a minute and jack saw that he had awakened a dangerous source of distrust in the captains breast  well jack resumed spike after the pause can you tell us anything of the doubloons i natrally expected to find them in the boat but there were none to be seen you scarcely pumped the schooner out without overhauling her lockers and falling in with them doubloons  we found them sure enough and had them ashore with us in the tent down to the moment when we sailed  when you took them off to the schooner eh my life for it the gold was not forgotten  it was not sure enough sir but we took it off with us to the schooner and it went down in her when she finally sunk  another pause during which señor montefalderon and captain spike looked significantly at each other  do you think jack you could find the spot where the schooner went down  i could come pretty near it sir though not on the very spot itself water leaves no mark over the grave of a sunken ship  if you can take us within a reasonable distance we might find it by sweeping for it them doubloons are worth some trouble and their recovery would be better than a long vyge to us any day  they would indeed don esteban observed the mexican and my poor country is not in a condition to bear heavy losses if señor jack tier can find the wreck and we regain the money ten of those doubloons shall be his reward though i take them from my own share much diminished as it will be  you hear jackhere is a chance to make your fortune you say you sailed with me in old timesand old times were good times with this brig though times has changed but if you sailed with me in old times you must remember that whatever the swash touched she turned to gold  i hope you do nt doubt captain spike my having sailed in the brig not only in old times but in her best times  jack seemed hurt as he put this question and spike appeared in doubt the latter gazed at the little rotund queerlooking figure before him as if endeavouring to recognise him and when he had done he passed his hand over his brow like one who endeavoured to recall past objects by excluding those that are present  you will then show us the spot where my unfortunate schooner did sink señor jack tier put in the mexican  with all my heart señor if it is to be found i think i could take you within a cables length of the place though hunger and thirst and sharks and the fear of drowning will keep a fellow from having a very bright lookout for such a matter  in what water do you suppose the craft to lie jack demanded the captain  you know as much of that as i do myself sir she went down about a cables length from the reef toward which she was a settin at the time and had she kept afloat an hour longer she might have grounded on the rocks  she s better where she is if we can only find her by sweeping on the rocks we could do nothing with her but break her up and ten to one the doubloons would be lost by the way jack do you happen to know where that scoundrel of a mate of mine stowed the money  when we left the island i carried it down to the boat myselfand a good lift i had of it as sure as you are there señor i was obliged to take it on a shoulder when it came out of the boat mr mulford carried it below and i heard him tell miss rose aterwards that he had thrown it into a breadlocker  where we shall find it don wan notwithstanding all this veering and hauling the old brig has luck when doubloons are in question and ever has had since ive commanded her jack we shall have to call on the cook and stewards for an anchorwatch tonight the people are a good deal fagged with boxing about this reef so much and i shall want em all as fresh tomorrow as they can be got you idlers had better take the middle watches which will give the forecastle chaps longer naps  ay ay sir well manage that for em josh and simon can go on at twelve and i will take the watch at two which will give the men all the rest they want as i can hold out for four hours full im as good for an anchorwatch as any man in the brig captain spike  that you are jack and better than some on em take you all round and round it is you re a rum un my ladthe queerest little jigger that ever lay out on a royalyard  jack might have been a little offended at spikes compliments but he was certainly not sorry to find him so goodnatured after all that had passed he now left the captain and his mexican companion seemingly in close conference together while he went below himself and dropped as naturally into the routine of his duty as if he had never left the brig in the cabin he found the females of course rose scarce raising her face from the shawl which lay on the bed of her own berth jack busied himself in a locker near this berth until an opportunity occurred to touch rose unseen by her aunt or biddy the poor heartstricken girl raised her face from which all the colour had departed and looked almost vacantly at jack as if to ask an explanation hope is truly by a most benevolent provision of providence one of the very last blessings to abandon us it is probable that we are thus gifted in order to encourage us to rely on the great atonement to the last moment since without this natural endowment to cling to hope despair might well be the fate of millions who there is reason to think reap the benefit of that act of divine mercy it would hardly do to say that anything like hope was blended with the look rose now cast on jack but it was anxious and inquiring  the steward bent his head to the locker bringing his face quite near to that of rose and whisperedthere is hope miss rosebut do not betray me  these were blessed words for our heroine to hear and they produced an immediate and great revolution in her feelings commanding herself however she looked her questions instead of trusting even to a whisper jack did not say any more just then but shortly after he called rose whose eyes were now never off him into the main cabin which was empty it was so much pleasanter to sleep in an airy stateroom on deck that señor montefalderon indeed had given up the use of this cabin in a great measure seldom appearing in it except at meals having taken possession of the deserted apartment of mulford josh was in the galley where he spent most of his time and rose and jack had no one to disturb their conference  he is safe miss rosegod be praised whispered jack safe for the present at least with food and water and fire to keep him warm at night  it was impossible for rose not to understand to whom there was allusion though her head became dizzy under the painful confusion that prevailed in it she pressed her temples with both hands and asked a thousand questions with her eyes jack considerately handed her a glass of water before he proceeded as soon as he found her a little more composed he related the facts connected with his discovery of mulford precisely as they had occurred  he is now on a large rocka little island indeedwhere he is safe from the ocean unless it comes on to blow a hurricane concluded jack has fresh water and fresh turtle in the bargain a man might live a month on one such turtle as i saw mr mulford cutting up this evening  is there no way of rescuing him from the situation you have mentioned jack in a year or two i shall be my own mistress and have money to do as i please with put me only in the way of taking mr mulford from that rock and i will share all i am worth on earth with you dear jack  ay so it is with the whole sex muttered tier let them only once give up their affections to a man and he becomes dearer to them than pearls and rubies but you know me miss rose and know why and how well i would sarve you my story and my feelins are as much your secret as your story and your feelins is mine we shall pull together if we do nt pull so very strong now hearken to me miss rose and i will let you into the secret of my plan to help mr mulford make a launch  jack then communicated to his companion his whole project for the night spike had of his own accord given to him and his two associates simon and josh the care of the brig between midnight and morning if he could prevail on either of these men to accompany him it was his intention to take the lighthouse boat which was riding by its painter astern of the brig and proceed as fast as they could to the spot whither mulford had found his way by his calculations if the wind stood as it then was little more than an hour would be necessary to reach the rock and about as much more to return should the breeze lull of which there was no great danger since the easterly trades were again blowing jack thought he and josh might go over the distance with the oars in about double the time should both josh and simon refuse to accompany him he thought he should attempt the rescue of the mate alone did the wind stand trusting to mulfords assistance should he need it in getting back to the brig  you surely would not come back here with harry did you once get him safe from off that rock exclaimed rose  why you know how it is with me miss rose answered jack my business is here on board the swash and i must attend to it nothing shall tempt me to give up the brig so long as she floats and sartain folk float in her unless it might be some such matter as that which happened on the bit of an island at the dry tortugas ah hes a willian but if i do come back it will be only to get into my own proper berth agin and not to bring mr mulford into the lions jaws he will only have to put me back on board the molly here when he can make the best of his own way to key west half an hour would place him out of harms way especially as i happen to know the course spike means to steer in the morning  i will go with you jack said rose mildly but with great firmness  you miss rose but why should i show surprise its like all the sex when they have given away their affections yes woman will be woman put her on a naked rock or put her in silks and satins in her parlour at home how different is it with men they dote for a little while and turn to a new face it must be said mens willians  not mulford jackno not harry mulford a truer or a nobler heart never beat in a human breast and you and i will drown together rather than he should not be taken from that rock  it shall be as you say answered jack a little thoughtfully perhaps it would be best that you should quit the brig altogether spike is getting desperate and you will be safer with the young mate than with so great an old willian yes you shall go with me miss rose and if josh and simon both refuse we will go alone  with you jack but not with mr mulford i cannot desert my aunt nor can i quit the swash alone in company with her mate as for spike i despise him too much to fear him he must soon go into port somewhere and at the first place where he touches we shall quit him he dare not detain usnay he cannotand i do not fear him we will save harry but i shall remain with my aunt  well see miss rose well see said tier smiling perhaps a handsome young man like mr mulford will have better luck in persuading you than an old fellow like me if he should fail t will be his own fault  so thought jack tier judging of women as he had found them but so did not think rose budd the conversation ended here however each keeping in view its purport and the serious business that was before them  the duty of the vessel went on as usual the night promised to be clouded but not very dark as there was a moon when spike ordered the anchorwatches he had great care to spare his crew as much as possible for the next day was likely to be one of great toil to them he intended to get the schooner up again if possible and though he might not actually pump her out so as to cause her to float enough water was to be removed to enable him to get at the doubloons the situation of the breadlocker was known and as soon as the cabin was sufficiently freed from water to enable one to move about in it spike did not doubt his being able to get at the gold with his resources and ingenuity the matter in his own mind was reduced to one of toil and time eightandforty hours and some hard labour he doubted not would effect all he cared for  in setting the anchorwatches for the night therefore stephen spike bethought him as much of the morrow as of the present moment don juan offered to remain on deck until midnight and as he was as capable of giving an alarm as any one else the offer was accepted josh and simon were to succeed the mexican and to hold the lookout for two hours when jack was to relieve them and to continue on deck until light returned when he was to give the captain a call this arrangement made tier turned in at once desiring the cook to call him half an hour before the proper period of his watch commenced that half hour jack intended to employ in exercising his eloquence in endeavouring to persuade either josh or simon to be of his party by eight oclock the vessel lay in a profound quiet señor montefalderon pacing the quarterdeck alone while the deep breathing of spike was to be heard issuing through the open window of his stateroom a window which it may be well to say to the uninitiated opened inboard or toward the deck and not outboard or toward the sea  for four solitary hours did the mexican pace the deck of the stranger resting himself for a few minutes at a time only when wearied with walking does the reader fancy that a man so situated had not plenty of occupation for his thoughts don juan montefalderon was a soldier and a gallant cavalier and love of country had alone induced him to engage in his present duties not that patriotism which looks to political preferment through a popularity purchased by the valgar acclamation which attends success in arms even when undeserved or that patriotism which induces men of fallen characters to endeavour to retrieve former offences by the shortest and most reckless mode or that patriotism which shouts our country right or wrong regardless alike of god and his eternal laws that are never to be forgotten with impunity but the patriotism which would defend his home and fireside his altars and the graves of his fathers from the ruthless steps of the invader we shall not pretend to say how far this gentleman entered into the merits of the quarrel between the two republics which no arts of european jealousy can ever conceal from the judgment of truth for with him matters had gone beyond the point when men feel the necessity of reasoning and when perhaps if such a condition of the mind is ever to be defended he found his perfect justification in feeling he had travelled and knew life by observation and not through traditions and books he had never believed therefore that his countrymen could march to washington or even to the sabine but he had hoped for better things than had since occurred the warlike qualities of the americans of the north as he was accustomed to call those who term themselves par excellence americans a name they are fated to retain and to raise high on the scale of national power and national preeminence unless they fall by their own hands had taken him by surprise as they have taken all but those who knew the country well and who understood its people little had he imagined that the small widelyspread body of regulars that figured in the blue books almanacs and armyregisters of america as some six or seven thousand men scattered along frontiers of a thousand leagues in extent could at the beck of the government swell into legions of invaders men able to carry war to the capitals of his own states thousands of miles from their doors and formidable alike for their energy their bravery their readiness in the use of arms and their numbers he saw what is perhaps justly called the boasting of the american character vindicated by their exploits and marches conquests and victories that if sober truth were alone to cover the pages of history would far outdo in real labour and danger the boasted passage of the alps under napoleon and the exploits that succeeded it  don juan montefalderon was a grave and thoughtful man of pure iberian blood he might have had about him a little of the exaltation of the spanish character the overflowings of a generous chivalry at the bottom and under its influence he may have set too high an estimate on mexico and her sons but he was not one to shut his eyes to the truth he saw plainly that the northern neighbours of his country were a race formidable and enterprising and that of all the calumnies that had been heaped upon them by rivalries and european superciliousness that of their not being military by temperament was perhaps the most absurd of all on the contrary he had himself though anticipating evil been astounded by the suddenness and magnitude of their conquests which in a few short months after the breaking out of hostilities had overrun regions larger in extent than many ancient empires all this had been done too not by disorderly and barbarous hordes seeking in other lands the abundance that was wanting at home but with system and regularity by men who had turned the ploughshare into the sword for the occasion quitting abundance to encounter fatigue famine and danger in a word the señor montefalderon saw all the evils that environed his own land and foresaw others of a still graver character that menaced the future on matters such as these did he brood in his walk and bitter did he find the minutes of that sad and lonely watch although a mexican he could feel although an avowed foe of this good republic of ours he had his principles his affections and his sense of right whatever may be the merits of the quarrel and we are not disposed to deny that our provocation has been great a sense of right should teach every man that what may be patriotic in an american would not be exactly the same thing in a mexican and that we ought to respect in others sentiments that are so much vaunted among ourselves midnight at length arrived and calling the cook and steward the unhappy gentleman was relieved and went to his berth to dream in sorrow over the same pictures of national misfortunes on which while waking he had brooded in such deep melancholy  the watch of josh and simon was tranquil meeting with no interruption until it was time to summon jack one thing these men had done however that was of some moment to tier under a pledge given by josh and which had been taken in return for a dollar in hand they had managed to haul the lighthouse boat alongside from its position astern and this so noiselessly as not to give the alarm to any one there it lay when jack appeared ready at the mainrigging to receive him at any moment he might choose to enter it  a few minutes after jack appeared on deck rose and biddy came stealthily out of the cabin the latter carrying a basket filled with bread and broken meat and not wanting in sundry little delicacies such as womans hands prepare and in this instance womans tenderness had provided the whole party met at the galley a place so far removed from the staterooms aft as to be out of earshot here jack renewed his endeavours to persuade either josh or simon to go in the boat but without success the negroes had talked the matter over in their watch and had come to the conclusion the enterprise was too hazardous  i tell you jack you does nt know capin spike as well as i does josh said in continuance of the discourse no you does nt know him at all as well as i does if he finds out that anybody has quit dis brig dis werry night woful will come it no good to try to run i run tree time an simon here run twice what good it all do we got cotched and here we is just as fast as ever i knows capin spike and does nt want to fall in athwart his hawse any more  yes dat my judgment too put in the cook we wishes you well jack and we wishes miss rose well and mr mulford well but we cant no how run athart hawse as josh says dat is my judgment too  well if your minds are made up to this my darkies i spose therell be no changing them said jack at all ewents youll lend us a hand by answering any hail that may come from aft in my watch and in keepin our secret theres another thing you can do for us which may be of service should captain spike miss the boat and lay any trap to catch us you can just light this here bit of lantern and hang it over the brigs bows where hell not be likely to see it that we may know matters are going wrong and give the craft a wide berth  sartain said josh who entered heartily into the affair so far as good wishes for its success were concerned at the very moment when he had a most salutary care of his own back sartain we do all dat and no tank asked it no great matter to answer a hail or to light a lantern and sling him over de bows and if captain spike want to know who did it let him find out  here both negroes laughed heartily manifesting so little care to suppress their mirth that rose trembled lest their noise should awaken spike accustomed sounds however seldom produce this effect on the ears of the sleeper and the heavy breathing from the stateroom succeeded the merriment of the blacks as soon as the latter ceased jack now announced his readiness to depart some little care and management were necessary to get into the boat noiselessly more especially with biddy it was done however with the assistance of the blacks who cast off the painter when jack gave the boat a shove to clear the brig and suffered it to drift astern for a considerable distance before he ventured to cast loose the sail  i know spike well said jack in answer to a remonstrance from the impatient rose concerning his delay a single flap of that canvas would wake him up with the brig anchored while he would sleep through a salute of heavy guns if it came in regular course quick ears has old stephen and its best to humour them in a minute more well set our canvas and be off  all was done as jack desired and the boat got away from the brig unheard and undetected it was blowing a good breeze and jack tier had no sooner got the sail on the boat than away it started at a speed that would have soon distanced spike in his yawl and with his best oarsmen the main point was to keep the course though the direction of the wind was a great assistant by keeping the wind abeam jack thought he should be going toward the rock of mulford in one hour or even in less time he expected to reach it and he was guided by time in his calculations as much as by any other criterion previously to quitting the brig he had gone up a few ratlins of the forerigging to take the bearings of the fire on mulfords rock but the light was no longer visible as no star was to be seen the course was a little vague but jack was navigator enough to understand that by keeping on the weather side of the channel he was in the right road and that his great danger of missing his object was in overrunning it  so much of the reef was above water that it was not difficult to steer a boat along its margin the darkness to be sure rendered it a little uncertain how near they were running to the rocks but on the whole jack assured rose he had no great difficulty in getting along  these trades are almost as good as compasses he said and the rocks are better if we can keep close aboard them without going on to them i do not know the exact distance of the spot we seek from the brig but i judged it to be about two leagues as i looked at it from aloft now this boat will travel them two leagues in an hour with this breeze and in smooth water  i wish you had seen the fire again before we left the brig said rose too anxious for the result not to feel uneasiness on some account or other  the mate is asleep and the fire has burned down thats the explanation besides fuel is not too plenty on a place like that mr mulford inhabits just now as we get near the spot i shall look out for embers which may sarve as a lighthouse or beacon to guide us into port  mr mulford will be charmed to see us now that we take him wather exclaimed biddy wather is a blessed thing and its hard will be the heart that does not fale gratitude for a planty of swate wather  the maty has plenty of food and water where he is said jack ill answer for both them sarcumstances i saw him turn a turtle as plain as if i had been at his elbow and i saw him drinking at a hole in the rock as heartily as a boy ever pulled at a gimblethole in a molasses hogshead  but the distance was so great jack i should hardly think you could have distinguished objects so small  i went by the motions altogether i saw the man and i saw the movements and i knowed what the last meant its true i couldnt swear to the turtle though i saw something on the rock that i knowed by the way in which it was handled must be a turtle then i saw the mate kneel and put his head low and then i knowed he was drinking  perhaps he prayed said rose solemnly  not he sailors isnt so apt to pray miss rose not as apt as they ought to be women for prayers and men for work mr mulford is no worse than many others but i doubt if he be much given to that  to this rose made no answer but biddy took the matter up and as the boat went briskly ahead she pursued the subject  then more is the shame for him said the irish woman and miss rose and missus and even i prayin for him all as if he was our own brudder its seldom i ask anything for a heretic but i could not forget a fine young man like mr mulford and miss rose so partial to him and he in so bad a way he ought to be ashamed to make his brags that he is too proud to pray  harry has made no such wicked boast put in rose mildly nor do we know that he has not prayed for us as well as for himself it may all be a mistake of jacks you know  yes added jack coolly it may be a mistake ater all for i was lookin at the maty six miles off and through a spyglass no one can be sure of anything at such a distance so overlook the matter my good biddy and carry mr mulford the nice things youve mustered in that basket all the same as if he was pope  this is a subject we had better drop rose quietly observed  anything to oblige you miss rose though religion is a matter it would do me no harm to talk about once and awhile its many a long year since ive had time and opportunity to bring my thoughts to dwell on holy things ever since i left my mothers side ive been a wanderer in my mind as much as in my body  poor jack i understand and feel for your sufferings but a better time will come when you may return to the habits of your youth and to the observances of your church  i do nt know that miss rose i do nt know that answered tier placing the elbow of his short arm on the seemingly shorter leg and bending his head so low as to lean his face on the palm of the hand an attitude in which he appeared to be suffering keenly through his recollections childhood and innocence never come back to us in this world what the grave may do we shall all learn in time  innocence can return to all with repentance jack and the heart that prompts you to do acts as generous as this you are now engaged in must contain some good seed yet  if jack will go to a praste and just confess when he can find a father it will do his sowl good said biddy who was touched by the mental suffering of the strange little being at her side  but the necessity of managing the boat soon compelled its coxswain to raise his head and to attend to his duty the wind sometimes came in puffs and at such moments jack saw that the large sail of the lighthouse boat required watching a circumstance that induced him to shake off his melancholy and give his mind more exclusively to the business before him as for rose she sympathised deeply with jack tier for she knew his history his origin the story of his youth and the wellgrounded causes of his contrition and regrets from her jack had concealed nothing the gentle commiseration of one like rose being a balm to wounds that had bled for long and bitter years the great poet of our language and the greatest that ever lived perhaps short of the inspired writers of the old testament and old homer and dante has well reminded us that the little beetle in yielding its breath can feel a pang as great as when a giant dies thus is it too in morals abasement and misery and poverty and sin may and all do contribute to lower the tone of our moral existence but the principle that has been planted by nature can be eradicated by nature only it exists as long as we exist and if dormant for a time under the pressure of circumstances it merely lies in the moral system like the acorn or the chestnut in the ground waiting its time and season to sprout and bud and blossom should that time never arrive it is not because the seed is not there but because it is neglected thus was it with the singular being of whose feelings we have just spoken the germ of goodness had been implanted early in him and was nursed with tenderness and care until selfwilled and governed by passion he had thrown off the connections of youth and childhood to connect himself with spikea connection that had left him what he was before closing our legend we shall have occasion to explain it  we have run our hour miss rose resumed jack breaking a continued silence during which the boat had passed through a long line of water we have run our hour and ought to be near the rock we are in search of but the morning is so dark that i fear we shall have difficulty in finding it it will never do to run past it and we must haul closer into the reef and shorten sail that we may be sartain to make no such mistake  rose begged her companion to omit no precaution as it would be dreadful to fail in their search after incurring so much risk in their own persons  harry may be sleeping on the seaweed of which you spoke she added and the danger of passing him will be much increased in such a case what a gloomy and frightful spot is this in which to abandon a human being i fear jack that we have come faster than we have supposed and may already have passed the rock  i hope not miss roseit seemed to me a good two leagues to the place where i saw him and the boat is fast that will run two leagues in an hour  we do not know the time jack and are obliged to guess at that as well as at the distance how very dark it is  dark in one sense it was not though roses apprehensions doubtless induced her to magnify every evil the clouds certainly lessened the light of the moon but there was still enough of the last to enable one to see surrounding objects and most especially to render distinct the character of the solitude that reigned over the place  the proximity of the reef which formed a weather shore to the boat prevented anything like a swell on the water notwithstanding the steadiness and strength of the breeze which had now blown for near twentyfour hours the same wind in open water would have raised sea enough to cause a ship to pitch or roll whereas the lighthouse boat placed where she was scarce rose and fell under the undulations of the channel through which she was glancing  this is a good boat and a fast boat too observed jack tier after he had luffed up several minutes in order to make sure of his proximity to the reef and it might carry us all safe enough to key west or certainly back to the dry tortugas was we inclined to try our hands at either  i cannot quit my aunt said rose quickly so we will not even think of any such thing  no t would never do to abandon the missus said biddy and she on the wrack wid us and falin the want of wather as much as ourselves  we three have sartainly gone through much in company returned jack and it ought to make us friends for life  i trust it will jack i hope when we return to new york to see you among us anchored as you would call it for the rest of your days under my aunts roof or under my own should i ever have one  no miss rose my business is with the swash and her captain i shall stick by both now ive found em again until they once more desart me a mans duty is his duty and a womans duty is her duty  you same to like the brig and her captain jack tier observed biddy and theres no use in gainsaying such a likin what will come to pass must come to pass captain spike is a mighty great sailor anyway  hes a willian muttered jack  there cried rose almost breathless there is a rock above the water surely do not fly by it so swiftly jack but let us stop and examine it  there is a rock sure enough and a large piece it is answered tier we will go alongside of it and see what it is made of biddy shall be boatkeeper while you and i miss rose explore  jack had thrown the boat into the wind and was shooting close alongside of the reef even while speaking the party found no difficulty in landing the margin of the rock admitting the boat to lie close alongside of it and its surface being even and dry jack had brailed the sail and he brought the painter ashore and fastened it securely to a fragment of stone that made a very sufficient anchor in addition to this precaution a lazy painter was put into biddys hands and she was directed not to let go of it while her companions were absent these arrangements concluded rose and jack commenced a hurried examination of the spot  a few minutes sufficed to give our adventurers a tolerably accurate notion of the general features of the place on which they had landed it was a considerable portion of the reef that was usually above water and which had even some fragments of soil or sand on which was a stinted growth of bushes of these last however there were very few nor were there many spots of the sand driftwood and seaweed were lodged in considerable quantities about its margin and in places piles of both had been tossed upon the rock itself by the billows of former gales of wind nor was it long before jack discovered a turtle that had been up to a hillock of sand probably to deposit its eggs there was enough of the sportsman in jack notwithstanding the business he was on to turn this animal though with what object he might have been puzzled himself to say this exploit effected jack followed rose as fast as his short legs would permit our heroine pressing forward eagerly though almost without hope in order to assertain if mulford were there  i am afraid this is not the rock said rose nearly breathless with her own haste when jack had overtaken her i see nothing of him and we have passed over most of the place  very true miss rose answered her companion who was in a good humour on account of his capture of the turtle but there are other rocks besides this ha what was that yonder pointing with a finger here more toward the brig as im a sinner there was a flashing as of fire  if a fire it must be that made by harry let us go to the spot at once  jack led the way and sure enough he soon reached a place where the embers of what had been a considerable body of fire were smouldering on the rock the wind had probably caused some brand to kindle momentarily which was the object that had caught tiers eye no doubt any longer remained of their having found the very place where the mate had cooked his supper and lighted his beacon though he himself was not near it around these embers were all the signs of mulfords having made the meal of which jack had seen the preparations a portion of the turtle much the greater part of it indeed lay in its shell and piles of wood and seaweed both dry had been placed at hand ready for use a ships topgallantyard with most of its rope attached lay with a charred end near the fire of where the fire had been the wood having burned until the flames went out for want of contact with other fuel there were many pieces of boards of pitchpine in the adjacent heap and two or three beautiful planks of the same wood entire in short from the character and quantity of the materials of this nature that had thus been heaped together jack gave it as his opinion that some vessel freighted with lumber had been wrecked to windward and that the adjacent rocks had been receiving the tribute of her cargo wrecks are of very very frequent occurrence on the florida reef and there are always moments when such gleanings are to be made in some part of it or other  i see no better way to give a call to the mate miss rose than to throw some of this dry weed and some of this lumber on the fire said jack after he had rummaged about the place sufficiently to become master of its condition there is plenty of amunition and here goes for a broadside  jack had no great difficulty in effecting his object in a few minutes he succeeded in obtaining a flame and then he fed it with such fragments of the brands and boards as were best adapted to his purpose the flames extended gradually and by the time tier had dragged the topgallantyard over the pile and placed several planks on their edges alongside of it the whole was ready to burst into a blaze the light was shed athwart the rock for a long distance and the whole place which was lately so gloomy and obscure now became gay under the bright radiance of a blazing fire  there is a beaconlight that might almost be seen on board said jack exulting in his success if the mate is anywhere in this latitude he will soon turn up  i see nothing of him answered rose in a melancholy voice surely surely jack he cannot have left the rock just as we have come to rescue him  rose and her companion had turned their faces from the fire to look in an opposite direction in quest of him they sought unseen by them a human form advanced swiftly toward the fire from a point on its other side it advanced nearer then hesitated afterward rushed forward with a tread that caused the two to turn and at the next moment rose was clasped to the heart of mulford  chapter iii    i might have passd that lovely cheek   nor perchance my heart have left me   but the sensitive blush that came trembling there   of my heart it for ever bereft me   who could blame had i loved that face   ere my eyes could twice explore her   yet it is for the fairy intelligence there   and her warm warm heart i adore her  wolfe  the stories of the respective parties who had thus so strangely met on that barren and isolated rock were soon told harry confirmed all of jacks statements as to his own proceedings and rose had little more to say than to add how much her own affections had led her to risk in his behalf in a word ten minutes made each fully acquainted with the others movements then tier considerately retired to the boat under the pretence of minding it and seeing everything ready for a departure but as much to allow the lovers the ten or fifteen minutes of uninterrupted discourse that they now enjoyed as for any other reason  it was a strange scene that now offered on the rock by this time the fire was burning not only brightly but fiercely shedding its bright light far and near under its most brilliant rays stood harry and rose both smiling and happy delighted in their meeting and for the moment forgetful of all but their present felicity never indeed had rose appeared more lovely than under these circumstances her face was radiant with those feelings which had so recently changed from despair to delighta condition that is ever most propitious to beauty and charms that always appeared feminine and soft now seemed elevated to a bright benignancy that might best be likened to our fancied images of angels the mild beaming serene and intelligent blue eyes the cheeks flushed with happiness the smiles that came so easily and were so replete with tenderness and the rich hair deranged by the breeze and moistened by the air of the sea each and all perhaps borrowed some additional lustre from the peculiar light under which they were exhibited as for harry happiness had thrown all the disadvantages of exposure want of dress and a face that had not felt the razor for sixandthirty hours into the background when he left the wreck he had cast aside his cap and his light summer jacket in order that they might not encumber him in swimming but both had been recovered when he returned with the boat to take off his friends in his ordinary sea attire then he now stood holding roses two hands in front of the fire every garment clean and white as the waters of the ocean could make them but all betraying some of the signs of his recent trials his fine countenance was full of the love he bore for the intrepid and devoted girl who had risked so much in his behalf and a painter might have wished to preserve the expression of ardent manly admiration which glowed in his face answering to the gentle sympathy and womanly tenderness it met in that of rose  the background of this picture was the wide even surface of the coral reef with its exterior setting of the dark and gloomy sea on the side of the channel however appeared the boat already winded with biddy still on the rock looking kindly at the lovers by the fire while jack was holding the painter beginning to manifest a little impatience at the delay  theyll stay there an hour holding each others hands and looking into each others faces half grumbled the little rotund assistantsteward anxious to be on his way back to the brig unless a body gives em a call captain spike will be in no very good humour to receive you and me on board agin if he should find out what sort of a trip weve been making hereaway  let em alonelet em alone jacky answered the goodnatured and kindhearted irish woman its happy they bees jist now and it does my eyes good to look at em  ay theyre happy enough now i only hope it may last  last what should help its lasting miss rose is so good and so handsomeand shes a fortin too and the mate so nice a young man think of the likes of them jack wantin the blessed gift of wather and all within one day and two nights sure its providence that takes care of and not we ourselves kings on their thrones is nt as happy as them at this moment  mens willians growled jack and more fools women for trustin em  not sich a nice young man as our mate jacky no not he now the mate of the ship i came from liverpool in this time ten years agone he was a villain he grudged us our potaties and our own bread and he grudged us every dhrap of swate wather that went into our mouths call him a villain if you will jack but niver call the likes of mr mulford by so hard a name  i wish him well and nothing else and for that very reason must put a stop to his looking so fondly into that young womans face time wont stand still biddy to suit the wishes of lovers and stephen spike is a man not to be trifled with halloo there maty its high time to think of getting under way  at this summons both harry and rose started becoming aware of the precious moments they were losing carrying a large portion of the turtle the former moved toward the craft in which all were seated in less than three minutes with the sail loose and the boat in motion for a few moments the mate was so much occupied with rose that he did not advert to the course but one of his experience could not long be misled on such a point and he turned suddenly to tier who was steering to remonstrate  hows this jack cried mulford youve got the boats head the wrong way  not i sir shes heading for the brig as straight as she can go this wind favours us on both legs and its lucky it does fort will be hard on upon daylight afore we are alongside of her youll want half an hour of dark at the very least to get a good start of the swash in case she makes sail ater you  straight for the brigwhat have we to do with the brig our course is for key west unless it might be better to run down before the wind to the dry tortugas again and look for the sloopofwar duty and perhaps my own safety tells me to let captain mull know what spike is about with the swash and i shall not hesitate a moment about doing it after all that has passed give me the helm jack and let us ware short round on our heel  never master matynever i must go back to the brig miss rose there knows that my business is with stephen spike and with him only  and i must return to my aunt harry put in rose herself it would never do for me to desert my aunt you know  and i have been taken from that rock to be given up to the tender mercies of spike again  this was said rather in surprise than in a complaining way and it at once induced rose to tell the young man the whole of their project  never harry never she said firmly it is our intention to return to the brig ourselves and let you escape in the boat afterwards jack tier is of opinion this can be done without much risk if we use proper caution and do not lose too much time on no account would i consent to place you in the hands of spike againdeath would be preferable to that harry  and on no account can or will i consent to place you again in the hands of spike rose answered the young man now that we know his intentions such an act would be almost impious  remember my aunt dear harry what would be her situation in the morning when she found herself deserted by her niece and biddyby me whom she has nursed and watched from childhood and whom she loves so well  i shall not deny your obligations to your aunt rose and your duty to her under ordinary circumstances but these are not ordinary circumstances and it would be courting the direst misfortunes nay almost braving providence to place yourself in the hands of that scoundrel again now that you are clear of them  spikes a willian muttered jack  and my desartin the missus would be a sin that no praste would overlook aisily put in biddy when miss rose told me of this vyge that she meant to make in the boat wid jack tier i asked to come along that i might take care of her and see that there was plenty of wather but illluck befall me if i would have tought of sich a thing and the missus desarted  we can then run alongside of the brig and put biddy and jack on board of her said mulford reflecting a moment on what had just been said when you and i can make the best of our way to key west where the means of sending government vessels out after the swash will soon offer in this way we can not only get our friends out of the lions jaws but keep out of them ourselves  reflect a moment harry said rose in a low voice but not without tenderness in its tones it would not do for me to go off alone with you in this boat  not when you have confessed your willingness to go over the wide world with me rosewith me and with me only  not even then harry i know you will think better of this when your generous nature has time to reason with your heart on my account  i can only answer in your own words rosenever if you return to the swash i shall go on board with you and throw defiance into the very teeth of spike i know the men do not dislike me and perhaps assisted by señor montefalderon and a few friends among the people i can muster a force that will prevent my being thrown into the sea  rose burst into tears and then succeeded many minutes during which mulford was endeavouring with manly tenderness to soothe her as soon as our heroine recovered her selfcommand she began to discuss the matter at issue between them more coolly for half an hour everything was urged by each that feeling affection delicacy or distrust of spike could well urge and mulford was slowly getting the best of the argument as well he might the truth being mostly of his side rose was bewildered really feeling a strong reluctance to quit her aunt even with so justifiable a motive but principally shrinking from the appearance of going off alone in a boat and almost in the open sea with mulford had she loved harry less her scruples might not have been so active but the consciousness of the strength of her attachment as well as her fixed intention to become his wife the moment it was in her power to give him her hand with the decencies of her sex contributed strangely to prevent her yielding to the young mans reasoning on the subject of the aunt the mate made out so good a case that it was apparent to all in the boat rose would have to abandon that ground of refusal spike had no object to gain by illtreating mrs budd and the probability certainly was that he would get rid of her as soon as he could and in the most easy manner this was so apparent to all that harry had little difficulty in getting rose to assent to its probability but there remained the reluctance to go off alone with the mate in a boat this part of the subject was more difficult to manage than the other and mulford betrayed as much by the awkwardness with which he managed it at length the discussion was brought to a close by jack tier suddenly saying  yonder is the brig and we are heading for her as straight as if she was the pole and the keel of this boat was a compass i see how it is miss rose and ater all i must give in i suppose some other opportunity will offer for me to get on board of the brig agin and ill trust to that if you wont go off with the mate alone i suppose youll not refuse to go off in my company  will you accompany us jack this is more than i had hoped for yes harry if jack tier will be of the party i will trust my aunt to biddy and go with you to key west in order to escape from spike  this was said so rapidly and so unexpectedly as to take mulford completely by surprise scarce believing what he heard the young man was disposed at first to feel hurt though a moments reflection showed him that he ought to rejoice in the result let the cause be what it might  more than i had hoped for he could not refrain from repeating a little bitterly is jack tier then of so much importance that his company is thought preferable to mine  hush harry said rose laying her hand on mulfords arm by way of strengthening her appeal do not say that you are ignorant of circumstances at another time you shall know them but not now let it be enough for the present that i promise to accompany you if jack will be of our party  ay ay miss rose i will be of the party seeing there is no other way of getting the lamb out of the jaws of the wolf ater all it may be the wisest thing i can do though back to the swash i must and will come powder or no powder treason or no treason at the first opportunity yes my business is with the molly and to the molly i shall return its lucky miss rose since you have made up your mind to ship for this new cruise that i bethought me of telling biddy to make up a bundle of duds for you this carpetbag has a change or two in it and all owing to my forethought your woman said miss rose will come back wid us jack and whats the use of rumplin the clothes for a few hours sail in the boat but i knew womankind better and foreseed that if master mate fell in alongside of you agin you would not be apt to part company very soon  i thank you jack for the provision made for my comfort though some money would have added to it materially my purse has a little gold in it but a very little and i fear you are not much better off harry it will be awkward to find ourselves in key west penniless  we shall not be quite that i left the brig absolutely without a cent but foreseeing that necessity might make them of use i borrowed half a dozen of the doubloons from the bag of señor montefalderon and fortunately they are still in my pocket all i am worth in the world is in a bag of halfeagles rather more than a hundred altogether which i left in my chest in my own stateroom aboard the brig  youll find that in the carpetbag too master mate said jack coolly  find what mannot my money surely  ay every piece of it spike broke into your chest this aternoon and made me hold the tools while he was doing it he found the bag and overhauled ita hundred and seven half eleven quarter and one fullgrown eagle was the count when he had done the job he put all back agin ater giving me the fullgrown eagle for my share of the plunder and told me to say nothing of what i had seen i did say nothing but i did a good bit of work for while he was at supper i confiserated that bag as they call itand you will find it there among miss roses clothes with the fullgrown gentleman back in his nest agin  this is being not only honest tier cried mulford heartily but thoughtful onehalf that money shall be yours for this act  i thanke sir but ill not touch a cent of it it came hard i know mr mulford for my own hands have smarted too much with tar not to know that the seaman earns his money like the horse  still it would not be spending it like an ass jack to give you a portion of mine but there will be other opportunities to talk of this it is a sign of returning to the concerns of life rose that money begins to be of interest to us how little did we think of the doubloons or halfeagles a few hours since when on the wreck  it was wather that we tought of then put in biddy goold is good in a market or in a town or to send back to ireland to help a bodys aged fader or mudder in comfort wid but wather is the blessed thing on a wrack  the brig is coming quite plainly into view and you had better give me the helm jack it is time to bethink us of the manner of approaching her and how we are to proceed when alongside  this was so obviously true that everybody felt disposed to forget all other matters in order to conduct the proceedings of the next twenty minutes with the necessary prudence and caution when mulford first took the helm the brig was just coming clearly into view though still looking a little misty and distant she might then have been half a league distant and would not have been visible at all by that light but for the circumstance that she had no background to swallow up her outlines drawn against clouds above which the rays of the moon were shed her tracery was to be discerned however and minute by minute it was getting to be more and more distinct until it was now so plainly to be seen as to admonish the mate of the necessity of preparation in the manner mentioned  tier now communicated to the mate his own proposed manner of proceeding the brig tended to the trades the tides having very little influence on her in the bight of the reef where she lay as the wind stood at about east southeast the brigs stern pointed to about west northwest while the boat was coming down the passage from a direction nearly north from her having as a matter of course the wind just free enough to lay her course jacks plan was to pass the brig to windward and having got well on her bow to brail the sail and drift down upon her expecting to fall in alongside abreast of the forechains into which he had intended to help biddy and to ascend himself when he supposed that mulford would again make sail and carry off his mistress to this scheme the mate objected that it was awkward and a little lubberly he substituted one in its place that differed in seamanship and which was altogether better instead of passing to windward mulford suggested the expediency of approaching to leeward and of coming alongside under the open bowport letting the sheet fly and brailing the sail when the boat should be near enough to carry her to the point of destination without further assistance from her canvass  jack tier took his officers improvement on his own plan in perfect good part readily and cheerfully expressing his willingness to aid the execution of it all that lay in his power as the boat sailed unusually well there was barely time to explain to each individual his or her part in the approaching critical movements ere the crisis itself drew near then each of the party became silent and anxious and events were regarded rather than words  it is scarcely necessary to say that mulford sailed a boat well he held the sheet in his hand as the little craft came up under the leequarter of the brig while jack stood by the brail the eyes of the mate glanced over the hull of the vessel to ascertain if possible who might be stirring but not a sign of life could he detect on board her this very silence made mulford more distrustful and anxious for he feared a trap was set for him he expected to see the head of one of the blacks at least peering over the bulwarks but nothing like a man was visible it was too late to pause however and the sheet was slowly eased off jack hauling on the brail at the same time the object being to prevent the sails flapping and the sound reaching the ears of spike as mulford used great caution and had previously schooled jack on the subject this important point was successfully achieved then the mate put his helm down and the boat shot up under the brigs leebow jack was ready to lay hold of one of the bowsprit shrouds and presently the boat was breasted up under the desired port and secured in that position mulford quitted the sternsheets and cast a look in upon deck nothing was to be seen though he heard the heavy breathing of the blacks both of whom were sound asleep on a sail that they had spread on the forecastle  the mate whispered for biddy to come to the port this the irishwoman did at once having kissed rose and taken her leave of her previously tier also came to the port through which he passed getting on deck with a view to assist biddy who was awkward almost as a matter of course to pass through the same opening he had just succeeded when the whole party was startled some of them almost petrified indeed by a hail from the quarterdeck in the wellknown deep tones of spike  forard there hailed the captain receiving no answer he immediately repeated in a shorter quicker call forecastle there  sir answered jack tier who by this time had come to his senses  who has the lookout on that forecastle  i have it siri jack tier you know sir i was to have it from two till daylight  ay ay i remember now how does the brig ride to her anchor  as steady as a church sir shes had no more sheer the whole watch than if she was moored head and starn  does the wind stand as it did  no change sir as dead a trade wind as ever blowed  what hard breathing is that i hear forard  t is the two niggers sir theyve turned in on deck and are napping it off at the rate of six knots theres no keepin way with a nigger in snorin  i thought i heard loud whispering too but i suppose it was a sort of halfdream im often in that way nowadays jack  sir  go to the scuttlebutt and get me a pot of fresh watermy coppers are hot with hard thinking  jack did as ordered and soon stood beneath the coachhouse deck with spike who had come out of his stateroom heated and uneasy at he knew not what the captain drank a full pint of water at a single draught  thats refreshing he said returning jack the tinpot and i feel the cooler for it how much does it want of daylight jack  two hours i think sir the order was passed to me to have all hands called as soon as it was broad day  ay that is right we must get our anchor and be off as soon as there is light to do it in doubloons may melt as well as flour and are best cared for soon when cared for at all  i shall see and give the call as soon as it is day i hope captain spike i can take the liberty of an old shipmate however and say one thing to you which is thislook out for the poughkeepsie which is very likely to be on your heels when you least expect her  thats your way of thinking is it jack well i thank you old one for the hint but have little fear of that craft weve had our legs together and i think the brig has the longest  as the captain said this he gaped like a hound and went into his stateroom jack lingered on the quarterdeck waiting to hear him fairly in his berth when he made a sign to biddy who had got as far aft as the galley where she was secreted to pass down into the cabin as silently as possible in a minute or two more he moved forward singing in a low cracked voice as was often his practice and slowly made his way to the forecastle mulford was just beginning to think the fellow had changed his mind and meant to stick by the brig when the little rotund figure of the assistantsteward was seen passing through the port and to drop noiselessly on a thwart jack then moved to the bow and cast off the painter the head of the boat slowly falling off under the pressure of the breeze on that part of her mast and sail which rose above the hull of the swash almost at the same moment the mate let go the sternfast and the boat was free  it required some care to set the sail without the canvas flapping it was done however before the boat fairly took the breeze when all was safe in half a minute the wind struck the sail and away the little craft started passing swiftly ahead of the brig soon as far enough off mulford put up his helm and wore short round bringing the boats head to the northward or in its proper direction after which they flew along before the wind which seemed to be increasing in force with a velocity that really appeared to defy pursuit all this time the brig lay in its silence and solitude no one stirring on board her and all in fact biddy alone excepted profoundly ignorant of what had just been passing alongside of her ten minutes of running off with a flowing sheet caused the swash to look indistinct and hazy again in ten minutes more she was swallowed up hull spars and all in the gloom of night  mulford and rose now felt something like that security without the sense of which happiness itself is but an uneasy feeling rendering the anticipations of evil the more painful by the magnitude of the stake there they sat now in the sternsheets by themselves jack tier having placed himself near the bows of the boat to look out for rocks as well as to trim the craft it was not long before rose was leaning on harrys shoulder and ere an hour was past she had fallen into a sweet sleep in that attitude the young man having carefully covered her person with a capacious shawl the same that had been used on the wreck as for jack he maintained his post in silence sitting with his arms crossed and the hands thrust into the breast of his jacket sailor fashion a picture of nautical vigilance it was some time after rose had fallen asleep that this singular being spoke for the first time  keep her away a bit maty he said keep her away half a point or so shes been travelin like a racer since we left the brig and yonders the first streak of day  by the time we have been running observed mulford i should think we must be getting near the northern side of the reef  all of that sir depend on it heres a rock close aboard on us to which were comin fastjust off here on our weatherbow that looks to me like the place where you landed ater that swim and where we had stowed ourselves when stephen spike made us out and gave chase  it is surprising to me jack that you should have any fancy to stick by a man of spikes character he is a precious rascal as we all can see now and you are rather an honest sort of fellow  do you love the young woman there thats lying in your arms as it might be and whom you say you wish to marry  the question is a queer one but it is easily answered more than my life jack  well how happens it that you succeed when the world has so many other young men who might please her as well as yourself  it may be that no other loves her as well and she has had the sagacity to discover it  quite likely so it is with me and stephen spike i fancy a man whom other folk despise and condemn why i stand by him is my own secret but stand by him i do and will  this is all very strange after your conduct on the island and your conduct tonight i shall not disturb your secret however jack but leave you to enjoy it by yourself is this the rock of which you spoke that we are now passing  the same and theres the spot in which we was stowed when they made us out from the brig and hereaway a cables length more or less the wreck of that mexican craft must lie  what is that rising above the water thereaway jack more on our weatherbeam  i see what you mean sir it looks like a spar by george theres two on em and they do seem to be the schooners masts  sure enough a second look satisfied mulford that two mastheads were out of water and that within a hundred yards of the place the boat was running past standing on a short distance or far enough to give himself room the mate put his helm down and tacked the boat the flapping of the sail and the little movement of shifting over the sheet awoke rose who was immediately apprized of the discovery as soon as round the boat went glancing up to the spars and presently was riding by one jack tier having caught hold of a topmastshroud when mulford let fly his sheet again and luffed short up to the spot by this time the increasing light was sufficiently strong to render objects distinct when near by and no doubt remained any longer in the mind of mulford about the two mastheads being those of the unfortunate mexican schooner  well of all i have ever seen ive never seed the like of this afore exclaimed jack when we left this here craft sir youll remember she had almost turned turtle laying over so far as to bring her upper coamings under water now she stands right side up as erect as if docked my navigation cant get along with this mr mulford and it does seem like witchcraft  it is certainly a very singular incident jack and i have been trying to come at its causes  have you succeeded harry asked rose by this time wide awake and wondering like the others  it must have happened in this wise the wreck was abandoned by us some little distance out here to windward the schooners masts of course pointed to leeward and when she drifted in here they have first touched on a shelving rock and as they have been shoved up little by little they have acted as levers to right the hull until the cargo has shifted back into its proper berth which has suddenly set the vessel up again  ay ay sir answered jack all that might have happened had she been above water or any part of her above water but youll remember maty that soon after we left her she went down  not entirely the wreck settled in the water no faster after we had left it than it had done before it continued to sink inch by inch as the air escaped and no faster after it had gone entirely out of sight than before not as fast indeed as the water became denser the lower it got the great argument against my theory is the fact that after the hull got beneath the surface the wind could not act on it this is true in one sense however and not in another the waves or the pressure of the water produced by the wind might act on the hull for some time after we ceased to see it but the currents have set the craft in here and the hull floating always very little force would cant the craft if the rock were shelving and slippery i see no great difficulty in the way and the barrels may have been so lodged that a trifle would set them rolling back again each one helping to produce a change that would move another as for the ballast that i am certain could not shift for it was stowed with great care as the vessel righted the air still in her moved and as soon as the water permitted it escaped by the hatches when the craft went down as a matter of course this air may have aided in bringing the hull upright by its movements in the water  this was the only explanation to which the ingenuity of mulford could help him under the circumstances and it may have been the right one or not there lay the schooner however in some five or six fathoms of water with her two topmasts and lower mastheads out of the element as upright as if docked it may all have occurred as the mate fancied or the unusual incident may have been owing to some of the many mysterious causes which baffle inquiry when the agents are necessarily hidden from examination  spike intends to come and look for this wreck you tell me jack in the hope of getting at the doubloons it contains said mulford when the boat had lain a minute or two longer riding by the masthead  ay ay sir thats his notion sir and hell be in a great stew as soon as he turns out which must be about this time and finds me missing for i was to pilot him to the spot  hell want no pilot now it will be scarcely possible to pass anywhere near this and not see these spars but this discovery almost induces me to change my own plans what say you rose we have now reached the northern side of the reef when it is time to haul close by the wind if we wish to beat up to key west there is a moral certainty however that the sloopofwar is somewhere in the neighbourhood of the dry tortugas which are much the most easily reached being to leeward we might run down to the lighthouse by midday while it is doubtful if we could reach the town until tomorrow morning i should like exceedingly to have five minutes conversation with the commander of the poughkeepsie  ay to let him know where he will be likely to fall in with the molly swash and her traitor master stephen spike cried jack tier never mind maty let em come on both the molly and her master have got long legs and clean heels stephen spike will show em how to thread the channels of a reef  it is amazing to me jack that you should stand by your old captain in feeling while you are helping to thwart him all you can in his warmest wishes  hes a willian muttered jacka reglar willian is stephen spike  if a villain why do you so evidently wish to keep him out of the hands of the law let him be captured and punished as his crimes require  mens willians all round still muttered jack harke mr mulford ive sailed in the brig longer than you and knowd her in her comeliest and best dayswhen she was young and blooming and lovely to the eye as the young creature at your sideand it would go to my heart to have anything happen to her then ive knowd stephen a long time too and old shipmates get a feelin for each other sooner or later i tell you now honestly mr mulford captain adam mull shall never make a prisoner of stephen spike if i can prevent it  the mate laughed at this sally but rose appeared anxious to change the conversation and she managed to open a discussion on the subject of the course it might be best to steer mulford had several excellent reasons to urge for wishing to run down to the islets all of which with a single exception he laid before his betrothed the concealed reason was one of the strongest of them all as usually happens when there is a reason to conceal but of that he took care to say nothing the result was an acquiescence on the part of rose whose consent was yielded more to the influence of one particular consideration than to all the rest united that one was this harry had pointed out to her the importance to himself of his appearing early to denounce the character and movements of the brig lest through his former situation in her his own conduct might be seriously called in question  as soon as the matter was determined jack was told to let go his hold the sheet was drawn aft and away sped the boat no sooner did mulford cause the little craft to keep away than it almost flew as if conscious it were bound to its proper home skimming swiftly over the waves like a bird returning eagerly to its nest an hour later the party breakfasted while at this meal jack tier pointed out to the mate a white speck in the southeastern board which he took to be the brig coming through the passage on her way to the wreck  no matter returned the mate though we can see her she cannot see us there is that much advantage in our being small rose if it do prevent our taking exercise by walking the deck  soon after mulford made a very distant sail in the northwestern board which he hoped might turn out to be the poughkeepsie it was but another speck but its position was somewhat like that in which he had expected to meet the sloopofwar the two vessels were so far apart that one could not be seen from the other and there was little hope that the poughkeepsie would detect spike at his toil on the wreck but the mate fully expected that the ship would go into the anchorage among the islets in order to ascertain what had become of the schooner if she did not go in herself she would be almost certain to send in a boat  the party from the brigantine had run down before the wind more than two hours before the lighthouse began to show itself just rising out of the waves this gave them the advantage of a beacon mulford having steered hitherto altogether by the sun the direction of the wind and the treading of the reef now he had his port in sight it being his intention to take possession of the dwelling of the lighthouse keeper and to remain in it until a favourable opportunity occurred to remove rose to key west the young man had also another important project in view which it will be in season to mention as it reaches the moment of its fulfillment  the rate of sailing of the lighthouse boat running before a brisk trade wind could not be much less than nine miles in the hour about eleven oclock therefore the lively craft shot through one of the narrow channels of the islets and entered the haven in a few minutes all three of the adventurers were on the little wharf where the lighthouse people were in the habit of landing rose proceeded to the house while harry and jack remained to secure the boat for the latter purpose a sort of slip or little dock had been made and when the boat was hauled into it it lay so snug that not only was the craft secure from injury but it was actually hid from the view of all but those who stood directly above it  this is a snug berth for the boat jack observed the mate when he had hauled it into the place mentioned and by unstepping the mast a passerby would not suspect such a craft of lying in it who knows what occasion there may be for concealment and ill een do that thing  to a casual listener harry in unstepping the mast might have seemed influenced merely by a motiveless impulse but in truth a latent suspicion of jacks intentions instigated him and as he laid the mast sprit and sail on the thwarts he determined in his own mind to remove them all to some other place as soon as an opportunity for doing so unobserved should occur he and jack now followed rose to the house  the islets were found deserted and tenantless not a human being had entered the house since rose left it the evening she had remained so long ashore in company with her aunt and the señor montefalderon this our heroine knew from the circumstance of finding a slight fastening of the outer door in the precise situation in which she had left it with her own hands at first a feeling of oppression and awe prevailed with both harry and rose when they recollected the fate of those who had so lately been tenants of the place but this gradually wore off and each soon got to be more at home as for jack he very coolly rummaged the lockers as he called the drawers and closets of the place and made his preparations for cooking a very delicious repast in which callipash and callipee were to be material ingredients the necessary condiments were easily enough found in that place turtle being a common dish there and it was not long before steams that might have quickened the appetite of an alderman filled the kitchen rose rummaged too and found a clean tablecloth plates glasses bowls spoons and knives in a word all that was necessary to spread a plain but plentiful board while all this was doing harry took some fishingtackle and proceeded to a favourable spot among the rocks in twenty minutes he returned with a fine mess of that most delicious little fish that goes by the very unpoetical name of hogfish from the circumstance of its giving a grunt not unlike that of a living porker when rudely drawn from its proper element nothing was now wanting to not only a comfortable but to what was really a most epicurian meal and jack just begged the lovers to have patience for an hour or so when he promised them dishes that even new york could not furnish  harry and rose first retired to pay a little attention to their dress and then they joined each other in a walk the mate had found some razors and was clean shaved he had also sequestered a shirt and made some other little additions to his attire that contributed to give him the appearance of being that which he really was a very gentlemanlike looking young sailor rose had felt no necessity for taking liberties with the effects of others though a good deal of female attire was found in the dwelling as was afterward ascertained a family ordinarily dwelt there but most of it had gone to key west on a visit at the moment when the man and boy left in charge had fallen into the hands of the mexicans losing their lives in the manner mentioned  while walking together harry opened his mind to rose on the subject which lay nearest to his heart and which had been at the bottom of this second visit to the islets of the dry tortugas during the different visits of wallace to the brig the boats crew of the poughkeepsie had held more or less discourse with the people of the swash this usually happens on such occasions and although spike had endeavoured to prevent it when his brig lay in this bay he had not been entirely successful such discourse is commonly jocular and sometimes witty every speech coming from which side it may ordinarily commencing with shipmate though the interlocutors never saw each other before that interview in one of the visits an allusion was made to cargo when the pretty gal aft was mentioned as being a part of the cargo of the swash in answer to this remark the wit of the poughkeepsie had told the brigs man you had better send her on board us for we carry a chaplain a regularbuilt one that will be a bishop some day or other perhaps and we can get her spliced to one of our young officers this remark had induced the sailor of the molly to ask if a sloopofwar really carried such a piece of marine luxury as a chaplain and the explanation given went to say that the clergyman in question did not properly belong to the poughkeepsie but was to be put on board a frigate as soon as they fell in with one that he named now all this mulford overheard and he remembered it at a moment when it might be of use situated as he and rose were he felt the wisdom and propriety of their being united and his present object was to persuade his companion to be of the same way of thinking he doubted not that the sloopofwar would come in ere long perhaps that very day and he believed it would be an easy matter to induce her chaplain to perform the ceremony america is a country in which every facility exists with the fewest possible impediments to getting married and we regret to be compelled to add to getting unmarried also there are no banns no licenses no consent of parents even usually necessary and persons who are of the age of discretion which as respects females and matrimony is a very tender age indeed may be married if they see fit almost without form or ceremony there existed therefore no legal impediment to the course mulford desired to take and his principal if not his only difficulty would be with rose over her scruples he hoped to prevail and not without reason as the case he could and did present was certainly one of a character that entitled him to be heard with great attention  in the first place mrs budd had approved of the connection and it was understood between them that the young people were to be united at the first port in which a clergyman of their own persuasion could be found and previously to reaching home this had been the aunts own project for weak and silly as she was the relict had a womans sense of the proprieties it had occured to her that it would be more respectable to make the long journey which lay before them escorted by a nephew and husband than escorted by even an accepted lover it is true that she had never anticipated a marriage in a lighthouse and under the circumstances in which rose was now placed though it might be more reputable that her niece should quit the islets as the wife of harry than as his betrothed then mulford still apprehended spike in that remote part of the world almost beyond the confines of society it was not easy to foretell what claims he might set up in the event of his meeting them there armed with the authority of a husband mulford could resist him in any such case with far better prospects of success than if he should appear only in the character of a suitor  rose listened to these arguments ardently and somewhat eloquently put as a girl of her years and habits would be apt to listen to a favoured lover she was much too sincere to deny her own attachment which the events of the last few days had increased almost to intenseness so apt is our tenderness to augment in behalf of those for whom we feel solicitude and her judgment told her that the more sober part of harrys reasoning was entitled to consideration as his wife her situation would certainly be much less equivocal and awkward than while she bore a different name and was admitted to be a single woman and it might yet be weeks before the duty she owed her aunt would allow her to proceed to the north but after all harry prevailed more through the influence of his hold on roses affections as would have been the case with almost every other woman than through any force of reasoning he truly loved and that made him eloquent when he spoke of love sympathy in all he uttered being his great ally when summoned to the house by the call of jack who announced that the turtlesoup was ready they returned with the understanding that the chaplain of the poughkeepsie should unite them did the vessel come in and would the functionary mentioned consent to perform the ceremony  it would be awkwardnay it would be distressing harry to have him refuse said the blushing rose as they walked slowly back to the house more desirous to prolong their conversation than to partake of the bountiful provision of jack tier the latter could not but be acceptable nevertheless to a young man like mulford who was in robust health and who had fared so badly for the last eightandforty hours when he sat down to the table therefore which was covered by a snowwhite cloth with smoking and most savoury viands on it it will not be surprising if we say it was with a pleasure that was derived from one of the great necessities of our nature  sancho calls for benediction on the man who invented sleep it would have been more just to have asked this boon in behalf of him who invented eating and turtlesoup the wearied fall into sleep as it might be unwittingly sometimes against their will and often against their interests while many a man is hungry without possessing the means of appeasing his appetite still more daily feel hunger without possessing turtlesoup certain persons impute this delicious compound to the genius of some london alderman but we rather think unjustly aldermanic genius is easily excited and rendered active no doubt by strong appeals on such a theme but our own experience inclines us to believe that the tropics usually send their inventions to the less fruitful regions of the earth along with their products we have little doubt could the fact be now ascertained that it would be found turtlesoup was originally invented by just some such worthy as jack tier who in filling his coppers to tickle the captains appetite had used all the condiments within his reach ventured on a sort of regents punch and as the consequence had brought forth the dish so often eulogized and so well beloved it is a little extraordinary that in paris the seat of gastronomy one rarely if ever hears of or sees this dish while in london it is to be met in almost as great abundance as in one of our larger commercial towns but so it is and we cannot say we much envy a cuisine its patés and soufflets and its à la this and à la thats but which was never redolent with the odours of turtlesoup  upon my word jack you have made out famously with your dinner or supper whichever you may please to call it cried mulford gaily as he took his seat at table after having furnished rose with a chair nothing appears to be wanting but here is good pilot bread potatoes even and other little niceties in addition to the turtle and the fish these good people of the light seem to have lived comfortably at any rate  why should they not maty answered jack beginning to help to soup living on one of these islets is like living afloat everything is laid in as for an outward bound craft then the reef must always furnish fish and turtle ive overhauled the lockers pretty thoroughly and find a plenty of stores to last us a month tea sugar coffee bread pickles potatoes onions and all other knickknacks  the poor people who own these stores will be heavyhearted enough when they come to learn the reason why we have been put in undisturbed possession of their property said rose we must contrive some means of repaying them for such articles as we may use harry  thats easily enough done miss rose drop one of the halfeagles in a teapot or a mug and theyll be certain to fall in with it when they come back nothin is easier than to pay a bodys debts when a body has the will and the means now the worst enemy of stephen spike must own that his brig never quits port with unsettled bills stephen has his faults like other mortals but he has his good pints too  still praising spike my good jack cried the mate a little provoked at this pertinacity in the deputysteward in sticking to his ship and his shipmate i should have thought that you had sailed with him long enough to have found him out and to wish never to put your foot in his cabin again  why no maty a craft is a craft and a body gets to like even the faults of one in which a body has gone through gales and squalls with a whole skin i like the swash and for sartain things i like her captain  meaning by that it is your intention to get on board of the one and to sail with the other again as soon as you can  i do mr mulford and make no bones in telling ont you know that i came here without wishing it  well jack no one will attempt to control your movements but you shall be left your own master i feel it to be a duty however as one who may know more of the law than yourself as well as more of stephen spike to tell you that he is engaged in a treasonable commerce with the enemy and that he and all who voluntarily remain with him knowing this fact may be made to swing for it  then ill swing for it returned jack sullenly  there is a little obstinacy in this my good fellow and you must be reasoned out of it i am under infinite obligations to you jack and shall ever be ready to own them without you to sail the boat i might have been left to perish on that rockfor god only knows whether any vessel would have seen me in passing most of those who go through that passage keep the western side of the reef aboard they tell me on account of there being better water on that side of the channel and the chance of a mans being seen on a rock by ships a league or two off would be small indeed yes jack i owe my life to you and am proud to own it  you owe it to miss rose maty who put me up to the enterprise and who shared it with me  to her i owe more than life answered harry looking at his beloved as she delighted in being regarded by him but even she with all her wishes to serve me would have been helpless without your skill in managing a boat i owe also to your goodnature the happiness of having rose with me at this moment for without you she would not have come  ill not deny it matytake another ladlefull of the soup miss rosy a quart of it would nt hurt an infantill not deny it mr mulfordi know by the way youve got rid of the first bowlfull that you are ready for another and there it isill not deny it and all i can say is that you are heartily welcome to my sarvices  i thank you jack but all this only makes me more desirous of being of use to you now when its in my power i wish you to stick by me and not to return to the swash as soon as i get to new york i shall build or buy a ship and the berth of steward in her shall always be open to you  thanke maty thanke with all my heart its something to know that a port is open to leeward and though i cannot now accept your offer the day may come when i shall be glad to do so  if you like living ashore better our house will always be ready to receive you i should be glad to leave as handy a little fellow as yourself behind me whenever i went to sea there are a hundred things in which you might be useful and fully earn your biscuit so as to have no qualms about eating the bread of idleness  thanke thanke maty cried jack dashing a tear out of his eye with the back of his hand thanke sir from the bottom of my heart the time may come but not now my papers is signed for this vyge stephen spike has a halter round his neck as you say yourself and its necessary for me to be there to look tot we all have our callins and duties and this is mine i stick by the molly and her captain until both are out of this scrape or both are condemned i know nothin of treason but if the law wants another victim i must take my chance  mulford was surprised at this steadiness of jacks in what he thought a very bad cause and he was quite as much surprised that rose did not join him in his endeavours to persuade the steward not to be so foolhardy as to endeavour to go back to the brig rose did not however sitting silently eating her dinner the whole time though she occasionally cast glances of interest at both the speakers the while in this state of things the mate abandoned the attempt for the moment intending to return to the subject after having had a private conference with his betrothed  notwithstanding the little drawback just related that was a happy as well as a delicious repast the mate did full justice to the soup and afterward to the fish with the unpoetical name and rose ate more than she had done in the last three days the habits of discipline prevented jack from taking his seat at table though pressed by both rose and harry to do so but he helped himself to the contents of a bowl and did full justice to his own art on one aside the little fellow was delighted with the praises that were bestowed on his dishes and for the moment the sea its dangers its tornadoes wrecks and races were all forgotten in the security and pleasures of so savoury a repast  folk ashore do nt know how sailors sometimes live said jack holding a large spoon filled with the soup ready to plunge into a tolerably capacious mouth  or how they sometimes starve answered rose remember our own situation less than fortyeight hours since  all very true miss rose yet you see turtlesoup brings us up ater all would you like a glass of wine maty  very much indeed jack after so luscious a soup but wishing for it will not bring it here  that remains to be seen sir i call this a bottle of something that looks wery much like a wine  claret as i live why where should lighthouse keepers get the taste for claret  ive thought of that myself mr mulford and have supposed that some of uncle sams officers have brought the liquor to this part of the world i understand a party on em was here surveyin all last winter it seems they come in the cool weather and get their sights and measure their distances and go home in the warm weather and work out their traverses in the shade as it might be  this seems likely jack but come whence it may it is welcome and we will taste it  mulford then drew the cork of this mild and grateful liquor and helped his companions and himself in this age of moral tours de force one scarcely dare say anything favourable of a liquid that even bears the name of wine or extol the shape of a bottle it is truly the era of exaggeration nothing is treated in the oldfashioned natural common sense way virtue is no longer virtue unless it get upon stilts and as for sins being confined to transgression against the law of god audacious would be the wretch who should presume to limit the sway of the societies by any dogma so narrow a man may be as abstemious as an anchorite and get no credit for it unless he sigu the pledge or signing the pledge he may get fuddled in corners and be cited as a miracle of sobriety the test of morals is no longer in the abuse of the gifts of providence but in their use prayers are deserting the closet for the corners of streets and charity not the giving of alms has got to be so earnest in the demonstration of its nature as to be pretty certain to begin at home and to end where it begins even the art of mendacity has been aroused by the great progress which is making by all around it and many manifest the strength of their ambition by telling ten lies where their fathers would have been satisfied with telling only one this art has made an extraordinary progress within the last quarter of a century aspiring to an ascendency that was formerly conceded only to truth until he who gains his daily bread by it has some such contempt for the sneaking wretch who does business on the small scale as the slayer of his thousands in the field is known to entertain for him who kills only a single man in the course of a long life  at the risk of damaging the reputations of our hero and heroine we shall frankly aver the fact that both harry and rose partook of the vin de bordeaux a very respectable bottle of medoc by the way which had been forgotten by uncle sams people in the course of the preceding winter agreeably to jack tiers conjecture one glass sufficed for rose and contrary as it may be to all modern theory she was somewhat the better for it while the mate and jack tier quite half emptied the bottle being none the worse there they sat enjoying the security and abundance which had succeeded to their late danger happy in that security happy in themselves and happy in the prospects of a bright future it was just as practicable for them to remain at the dry tortugas as it was for the family which ordinarily dwelt at the light the place was amply supplied with everything that would be necessary for their wants for months to come and harry caused his betrothed to blush as he whispered to her should the chaplain arrive he should delight in passing the honeymoon where they then were  i could tend the light he added smiling which would be not only an occupation but a useful occupation you could read all those books from beginning to end and jack could keep us suplied with fish by the way master steward are you in the humour for motion so soon after your hearty meal  anything to be useful answered jack cheerfully  then do me the favour to go up into the lantern of the lighthouse and take a look for the sloopofwar if shes in sight at all youll find her off here to the northward and while you are aloft you may as well make a sweep of the whole horizon there hangs the lighthouse keepers glass which may help your eyes by stepping into the gallery outside of the lantern  jack willingly complied taking the glass and proceeding forthwith to the other building mulford had two objects in view in giving this commission to the steward he really wished to ascertain what was the chance of seeing the poughkeepsie in the neighbourhood of the islets and felt just that indisposition to move himself that is apt to come over one who has recently made a very bountiful meal while he also desired to have another private conversation with rose  a good portion of the time that jack was gone and he stayed quite an hour in the lantern our lovers conversed as lovers are much inclined to converse that is to say of themselves their feelings and their prospects mulford told rose of his hopes and fears while he visited at the house of her aunt previously to sailing and the manner in which his suspicions had been first awakened in reference to the intentions of spikeintentions so far as they were connected with an admiration of his old commanders niece and possibly in connection also with the little fortune she was known to possess but not in reference to the bold project to which he had in fact resorted no distrust of the scheme finally put in practice had ever crossed the mind of the young mate until he received the unexpected order mentioned in our opening chapter to prepare the brig for the reception of mrs budd and her party harry confessed his jealousy of one youth whom he dreaded far more even than he had ever dreaded spike and whose apparent favour with rose and actual favour with her aunt had given him many a sleepless night  they next conversed of the future which to them seemed full of flowers various were the projects started discussed and dismissed between them the last almost as soon as proposed on one thing they were of a mind as soon as proposed harry was to have a ship as quick as one could be purchased by roses means and the promised bride laughingly consented to make one voyage to europe along with her husband  i wonder dear rose my poverty has never presented any difficulties in the way of our union said harry sensibly touched with the free way his betrothed disposed of her own money in his behalf but neither you nor mrs budd has ever seemed to think of the difference there is between us in this respect  what is the trifle i possess harry set in the balance against your worth my aunt as you say has thought i might even be the gainer by the exchange  i am sure i feel a thousand times indebted to mrs budd  aunt budd you must learn to say my aunt budd mr henry mulford if you mean to live in peace with her unworthy niece  aunt budd then returned harry laughing for the laugh came easily that evening aunt budd if you wish it rose i can have no objection to call any relative of yours uncle or aunt  i think we are intimate enough now to ask you a question or two harry touching my aunt continued rose looking stealthily over her shoulder as if apprehensive of being overheard you know how fond she is of speaking of the sea and of indulging in nautical phrases  any one must have observed that rose answered the young man gazing up at the wall in order not to be compelled to look the beautiful creature before him in the eyesmrs budd has very strong tastes that way  now tell me harrythat is answer me franklyi meanshe is not always right is she  why no not absolutely sothat is not absolutely always sofew persons are always right you know  rose remained silent and embarrassed for a moment after which she pursued the discourse  but aunty does not know as much of the sea and of ships as she thinks she does  perhaps not we all overrate our own acquirements i dare say that even i am not as good a seaman as i fancy myself to be  even spike admits that you are what he calls a prime seaman but it is not easy for a woman to get a correct knowledge of the use of all the strange and sometimes uncouth terms that you sailors use  certainly not and for that reason i would rather you should never attempt it rose we rough sons of the ocean would prefer to hear our wives make divers pretty blunders rather than to be swaggering about like so many old salts  mr mulford does aunt budd swagger like an old salt  dearest rose i was not thinking of your aunt but of you of you as you are feminine spirited lovely alike in form and character and of you a graduate of the ocean and full of its language and ideas  it was probable rose was not displeased at this allusion to herself for a smile struggled around her pretty mouth and she did not look at all angry after another short pause she resumed the discourse  my aunt did not very clearly comprehend those explanations of yours about the time of day and the longitude she said nor am i quite certain that i did myself  you understood them far better than mrs budd rose women are so little accustomed to think on such subjects at all that it is not surprising they sometimes get confused i do wish however that your aunt could be persuaded to be more cautious in the presence of strangers on the subject of terms she does not understand  i feared it might be so harry answered rose in a low voice as if unwilling even he should know the full extent of her thoughts on this subject but my aunts heart is most excellent though she may make mistakes occasionally i owe her a great deal if not absolutely my education certainly my health and comfort through childhood and more prudent womanly advice than you may suppose perhaps since i have left school how she became the dupe of spike indeed is to me unaccountable for in all that relates to health she is in general both acute and skilful  spike is a man of more art than he appears to be to superficial observers on my first acquaintance with him i mistook him for a frank fearless but wellmeaning sailor who loved hazardous voyages and desperate speculationa sort of innocent gambler but i have learned to know better his means are pretty much reduced to his brig and she is getting old and can do but little more service his projects are plain enough now by getting you into his power he hoped to compel a marriage in which case both your fortune and your aunts would contribute to repair his  he might have killed me but i never would have married him rejoined rose firmly is not that jack coming down the steps of the lighthouse  it is i find that fellows attachment to spike very extraordinary rose can you in any manner account for it  rose at first seemed disposed to reply her lips parted as if about to speak and closed again as glancing her eyes toward the open door she seemed to expect the appearance of the stewards little rotund form on its threshold which held her tonguetied a brief interval elapsed however ere jack actually arrived and rose perceiving that harry was curiously expecting her answer said hurriedlyit may be hatred not attachment  the next instant jack tier entered the room he had been gone rather more than an hour not returning until just as the sun was about to set in a flame of fire  well jack what news from the poughkeepsie demanded the mate you have been gone long enough to make sure of your errand is it certain that we are not to see the manofwarsmen tonight  whatever you see my advice to you is to keep close and to be on your guard answered jack evasively  i have little fear of any of uncle sams craft a plain story and an honest heart will make all clear to a welldisposed listener we have not been accomplices in spikes treasons and cannot be made to answer for them  take my advice maty and be in no hurry to hail every vessel you see uncle sams fellows may not always be at hand to help you do you not know that this island will be tabooed to seamen for some time to come  why so jack the islet has done no harm though others may have performed wicked deeds near it  two of the drowned men lie within a hundred yards of this spot and sailors never go near newmade graves if they can find any other place to resort to  you deal in enigmas jack and did i not know that you are very temperate i might suspect that the time you have been gone has been passed in the company of a bottle of brandy  that will explain my meanin said jack laconically pointing as he spoke seemingly at some object that was to be seen without  the door of the house was wide open for the admission of air it faced the haven of the islets and just as the mates eyes were turned to it the end of a flyingjibboom with the sail down and fluttering beneath it was coming into the view the poughkeepsie exclaimed mulford in delight seeing all his hopes realized while rose blushed to the eyes a pause succeeded during which mulford drew aside keeping his betrothed in the background and as much out of sight as possible the vessel was shooting swiftly into view and presently all there could see it was the swash  chapter iv    but nohe surely is not dreaming   another minute makes it clear   a scream a rush a burning tear   from inez cheek dispel the fear   that bliss like his is only seeming  washington alston  a moment of appalled surprise succeeded the instant when harry and rose first ascertained the real character of the vessel that had entered the haven of the dry tortugas then the first turned toward jack tier and sternly demanded an explanation of his apparent faithlessness  rascal he cried has this treachery been intended did you not see the brig and know her  hush harrydear harry exclaimed rose entreatingly my life for it jack has not been faithless  why then has he not let us know that the brig was coming for more than an hour has he been aloft on the lookout and here are we taken quite by surprise rely on it rose he has seen the approach of the brig and might have sooner put us on our guard  ay ay lay it on maty said jack coolly neither angry nor mortified so far as appearances went at these expressions of dissatisfaction my back is used to it if i did nt know what it is to get hard raps on the knuckles i should be but a young steward but as for this business a little reflection will tell you i am not to blame  give us your own explanations for without them i shall trust you no longer  well sir what good would it have done had i told you the brig was standing for this place there she came down like a racehorse and escape for you was impossible as the wind is now blowin the molly would go two feet to the boats one and a chase would have been madness  i do nt know that sirrah answered the mate the boat might have got into the smaller passages of the reef where the brig could not enter or she might have dodged about among these islets until it was night and then escaped in the darkness  i thought of all that mr mulford but it came too late when i first went aloft i came out on the northwest side of the lantern and took my seat to look out for the sloopofwar as you bade me sir well there i was sweepin the horizon with the glass for the better part of an hour sometimes fancyin i saw her and then givin it up for to this moment i am not sartain there is nt a sail off here to the westward turning up toward the light on a bowline but if there be shes too far off to know anything particlar about her well sir there i sat looking for the poughkeepsie for the better part of an hour when i thought i would go round on t other side of the lantern and take a look to windward my heart was in my mouth i can tell you miss rose when i saw the brig and i felt both glad and sorry glad on my own account and sorry on yourn there she was however and no help for it within two miles of this very spot and coming down as if she despised touching the water at all now what could i do there was nt time mr mulford to get the boat out and the mast stepped afore we should have been within reach of canister and stephen spike would not have spared that in order to get you again within his power  depend on it harry this is all true said rose earnestly i know jack well and can answer for his fidelity he wishes to and if he can he will return to the brig whither he thinks his duty calls him but he will never willingly betray usleast of all me do i speak as i ought jack  gospel truth miss rose and mr mulford will get over this squall as soon as he comes to think of matters as he ought there s my hand maty to show i bear no malice  i take it jack for i must believe you honest after all you have done for us excuse my warmth which if a little unreasonable was somewhat natural under the circumstances i suppose our case is now hopeless and that we shall all be soon on board the brig again for spike will hardly think of abandoning me again on an island provisioned and fitted as is this  its not so sartain sir that you fall into his hands at all put in jack the men of the brig will never come here of their own accord depend on that for sailors dont like graves spike has come in here ater the schooners chain that he dropped into the water when he made sail from the sloopofwar at the time he was here afore and is not expectin to find us here nonohe thinks we are beatin up toward key west this very minute if indeed he has missed us at all t is possible he believes the boat has got adrift by accident and has no thought of our bein out of the brig  that is impossible jack do you suppose he is ignorant that rose is missing  sartain of it maty if mrs budd has read the letter well that miss rose left for her and biddy has obeyed orders if theyve followed instructions miss rose is thought to be in her stateroom mournin for a young man who was abandoned on a naked rock and jack tier havin eat somethin that has disagreed with him is in his berth recollect spike will not be apt to look into miss roses stateroom or my berth to see if all this is true the cook and josh are both in my secret and know i mean to come back and when the fit is over i have only to return to duty like any other hand it is my calculation that spike believes both miss rose and myself on board the molly at this very moment  and the boatwhat can he suppose has become of the boat  sartainly the boat makes the only chance agin us but the boat was ridin by its painter astarn and accidents sometimes happen to such craft then we two are the wery last he will suspect of havin made off in the boat by ourselves therell be mrs budd and biddy as a sort of pledge that miss rose is aboard and as for jack tier he is too insignificant to occupy the captains thoughts just now he will probably muster the people forard when he finds the boat is gone but i do not think hell trouble the cabins or staterooms  mulford admitted that this was possible though it scarcely seemed probable to him there was no help however for the actual state of things and they all now turned their attention to the brig and to the movements of those on board her jack tier had swungto the outerdoor of the house as soon as the swash came in view through it and fortunately none of the windows on that side of the building had been opened at all the air entered to windward which was on the rear of the dwelling so that it was possible to be comfortable and yet leave the front in view from the vessel with its deserted air as for the brig she had already anchored and got both her boats into the water the yawl was hauled alongside in readiness for any service that might be required of it while the launch had been manned at once and was already weighing the anchor and securing the chain to which tier had alluded all this served very much to lessen the uneasiness of mulford and rose as it went far to prove that spike had not come to the dry tortugas in quest of them as at first both had very naturally supposed it might indeed turn out that his sole object was to obtain this anchor and chain with a view to use them in raising the illfated vessel that had now twice gone to the bottom  i wish an explanation with you jack on one other point said the mate after all three had been for sometime observing the movements on board and around the swash do you actually intend to get on board the brig  if its to be done maty my vyge is up with you and miss rose i may be said to have shipped for key west and a market and the markets found at this port  you will hardly leave us yet jack said rose with a manner and emphasis that did not fail to strike her betrothed lover though he could in no way account for either that rose should not wish to be left alone with him in that solitary place was natural enough or might rather be referred to education and the peculiar notions of her sex but he could not understand why so much importance should be attached to the presence of a being of jack tiers mould and character it was true that there was little choice under present circumstances but it occurred to mulford that rose had manifested the same strange predilection when there might have been something nearer to a selection the moment however was not one for much reflection on the subject  you will hardly leave us yet jack said rose in the manner related  its now or never miss rose if the brig once gets away from this anchorage without me i may never lay eyes on her agin her time is nearly up for wood and iron wont hold together always any more than flesh and blood consider how many years ive been busy in huntin her up and how hard t will be to lose that which has given me so many weary days and sleepless nights to find  rose said no more if not convinced she was evidently silenced while harry was left to wonder and surmise as best he might both quitted the subject to watch the people of the brig by this time the anchor had been lifted and the chain was heaving in on board the vessel by means of a line that had been got around its bight the work went on rapidly and mulford observed to rose that he did not think it was the intention of spike to remain long at the tortugas inasmuch as his brig was riding by a very short range of cable this opinion was confirmed half an hour later when it was seen that the launch was hooked on and hoisted in again as soon as the chain and anchor of the schooner were secured  jack tier watched every movement with palpable uneasiness his apprehensions that spike would obtain all he wanted and be off before he could rejoin him increased at each instant and he did not scruple to announce an intention to take the boat and go alongside of the swash at every hazard rather than be left  you do not reflect on what you say jack answered harry unless indeed it be your intention to betray us how could you appear in the boat at this place without letting it be known that we must be hard by  that dont follow at all maty answered jack suppose i go alongside the brig and own to the captain that i took the boat last night with the hope of findin you and that failin to succeed i bore up for this port to look for provisions and water miss rose he thinks on board at this moment and in my judgment he would take me at my word give me a good cursing and think no more about it  it would never do jack interposed rose instantly it would cause the destruction of harry as spike would not believe you had not found him without an examination of this house  what are they about with the yawl mr mulford asked jack whose eye was never off the vessel for a single moment its gettin to be so dark that one can hardly see the boat but it seems as if theyre about to man the yawl  they are and there goes a lantern into it and that is spike himself coming down the brigs side this instant  they can only bring a lantern to search this house exclaimed rose oh harry you are lost  i rather think the lantern is for the lighthouse answered mulford whose coolness at what was certainly a most trying moment did not desert him spike may wish to keep the light burning for once before you will remember he had it kindled after the keeper was removed as for his sailing he would not be apt to sail until the moon rises and in beating back to the wreck the light may serve to let him know the bearings and position of the reef  there they come whispered rose half breathless with alarm the boat has left the brig and is coming directly hither  all this was true enough the yawl had shoved off and with two men to row it was pulling for the wharf in front of the house and among the timbers of which lay the boat pretty well concealed beneath a sort of bridge mulford would not retreat though he looked to the fastenings of the door as a means of increasing his chances of defence in the sternsheets of the boat sat two men though it was not easy to ascertain who they were by the fading light one was known to be spike however and the other it was conjectured must be don juan montefalderon from the circumstance of his being in the place of honour three minutes solved this question the boat reaching the wharf by that time it was instantly secured and all four of the men left it spike was now plainly to be discerned by means of the lantern which he carried in his own hands he gave some orders in his customary authoritative way and in a high key after which he led the way from the wharf walking side by side with the señor montefalderon these two last came up within a yard of the door of the house where they paused enabling those within not only to see their persons and the working of their countenances but to hear all that was said this last the more especially since spike never thought it necessary to keep his powerful voice within moderate limits  its hardly worth while don wan for you to go into the lighthouse said spike t is but a greasy dirty place at the best and ones clothes are never the better for dealin with ile here bill take the lantern and get a filled can that we may go up and trim and fill the lamp and make a blaze bear a hand lads and ill be ater ye afore you reach the lantern be careful with the flame about the ile for seamen ought never to wish to see a lighthouse destroyed  what do you expect to gain by lighting the lamps above don esteban demanded the mexican when the sailors had disappeared in the lighthouse taking their own lantern with them  its wisest to keep things reglar about this spot don wan which will prevent unnecessary suspicions but as the brig stretches in toward the reef tonight on our way back the light will be a great assistance i am short of officers you know and want all the help of this sort i can get  to be sincere with you don esteban i greatly regret you are so short of officers and do not yet despair of inducing you to go and take off the mate whom i hear you have left on a barren rock he was a fine young fellow señor spike and the deed was not one that you will wish to remember a few years hence  the fellow run and i took him at his word don wan im not obliged to receive back a deserter unless it suits me  we are all obliged to see we do not cause a fellow creature the loss of life this will prove the death of the charming young woman who is so much attached to him unless you relent and are merciful  women have tender looks but tough hearts answered spike carelessly though mulford felt certain by the tone of his voice that great bitterness of feeling lay smothered beneath the affected indifference of his manner few die of love  the young lady has not been on deck all day and the irish woman tells me that she does nothing but drink waterthe certain proof of a high fever  ay ay she keeps her room if you will don wan but she is not about to make a dupe of me by any such tricks i must go and look to the lamps however and you will find the graves you seek in the rear of this house about thirty yards behind it youll remember thats a very pretty cross youve made señor and the skipper of the schooners soul will be all the better for settin it up at the head of his grave  it will serve to let those who come after us know that a christian sleeps beneath the sand don esteban answered the mexican mildly i have no other expectation from this sacred symbol  the two now separated spike going into the lighthouse little in a hurry while don juan montefalderon walked round the building to its rear in quest of the grave mulford waited a moment for spike to get a short distance up the stairs of the high tower he had to ascend when placing the arm of rose within his own he opened the door in the rear of the house and walked boldly toward the mexican don juan was actually forcing the pointed end of his little cross into the sand at the head of his countrymans grave when mulford and his trembling companion reached the spot although night had shut in it was not so dark that persons could not be recognised at small distances the señor montefalderon was startled at an apparition so sudden and unexpected when mulford saluted him by name but recognising first the voice of harry and then the persons of himself and his companion surprise rather than alarm became the emotion that was uppermost notwithstanding the strength of the first of these feelings he instantly saluted the young couple with the polished ease that marked his manner which had much of the courtesy of a castilian in it tempered a little perhaps by the greater flexibility of a southern american  i see you exclaimed don juan and must believe my eyes without their evidence however i could scarce believe it can be you two one of whom i thought on board the brig and the other suffering a most miserable death on a naked rock  i am aware of your kind feelings in our behalf don juan said mulford and it is the reason i now confide in you i was taken off that rock by means of the boat which you doubtless have missed and this is the gentle being who has been the means of saving my life to her and jack tier who is yonder under the shadows of the house i owe my not being the victim of spikes cruelty  i now comprehend the whole matter don henriquez jack tier has managed the boat for the señorita and those whom we were told were too ill to be seen on deck have been really out of the brig  such are the facts señor and from you there is no wish to conceal them we are then to understand that the absence of rose and jack from the brig is not known to spike  i believe not señor he has alluded to both once or twice today as being ill below but would you not do well to retire within the shade of the dwelling lest a glance from the lantern might let those in it know that i am not alone  there is little danger don juan as they who stand near a light cannot well see those who are in the darkness beside they are high in the air while we are on the ground which will greatly add to the obscurity down here we can retire nevertheless as i have a few questions to ask which may as well be put in perfect security as put where there is any risk  the three now drew near the house rose actually stepping within its door though harry remained on its exterior in order to watch the proceedings of those in the lighthouse here the señor montefalderon entered into a more detailed explanation of what had occurred on board the brig since the appearance of day that very morning according to his account of the matter spike had immediately called upon the people to explain the loss of the boat tier was not interrogated on this occasion it being understood he had gone below and turned in after having the lookout for fully half the night as no one could or would give an account of the manner in which the boat was missing josh was ordered to go below and question jack on the subject whether it was from consciousness of his connection with the escape of jack and apprehensions of the consequences or from innate goodnature and a desire to befriend the lovers this black now admitted that jack confessed to him that the boat had got away from him while endeavouring to shift the turns of its painter from a cleet where they ought not to be to their proper place this occurred early in jacks watch according to joshs story and had not been reported as the boat did not properly belong to the brig and was an incumbrance rather than an advantage the mate admired the negros cunning as don juan related this part of his story which put him in a situation to throw all the blame on jacks mendacity in the event of a discovery while it had the effect to allow the fugitives more time for their escape the result was that spike bestowed a few hearty curses as usual on the clumsiness of jack tier and seemed to forget all about the matter it is probable he connected jacks abstaining from showing himself on deck and his alleged indisposition with his supposed delinquency in this matter of the boat from that moment the captain appeared to give himself no further concern on the subject the boat having been in truth an incumbrance rather than a benefit as stated  as for rose her keeping her room under the circumstances was so very natural that the señor montefalderon had been completely deceived as from his tranquillity on this point there was no question was the case with spike also biddy appeared on deck though the widow did not and the irish woman shook her head anxiously when questioned about her young mistress giving the spectators reason to suppose that the latter was in a very bad way  as respects the brig and her movements spike had got under way as soon as there was light enough to find his course and had run through the passage it is probable that the boat was seen for something that was taken for a small sail had just been made out for a single instant and then became lost again this little sail was made if made at all in the direction of the dry tortugas but so completely was all suspicion at rest in the minds of those on the quarterdeck of the swash that neither spike nor the mexican had the least idea what it was when the circumstance was reported to the former he answered that it was probably some small wrecker of which many were hovering about the reef and added laughingly though in a way to prove how little he thought seriously on the subject at all who knows but the lighthouse boat has fallen into their hands and that theyve made sail on her if they have my word for it that she goes hull spars rigging canvas and cargo all in a lump for salvage  as the brig came out of the passage in broad day the heads of the schooners masts were seen as a matter of course this induced spike to heaveto lower a boat and to go in person to examine the condition of the wreck it will be seen that jacks presence could now be all the better dispensed with the examination with the soundings and other calculations connected with raising the vessel occupied hours when they were completed spike returned on board run up his boat and squared away for the dry tortugas señor montefalderon confirmed the justice of jack tiers surmises as to the object of this unexpected visit the brig had come solely for the chain and anchor mentioned and having secured them it was spikes intention to get under way and beat up to the wreck again as soon as the moon rose as for the sloopofwar he believed she had given him up for by this time she must know that she had no chance with the brig so long as the latter kept near the reef and that she ran the constant hazard of shipwreck while playing so near the dangers herself  before the señor montefalderon exhausted all he had to communicate he was interrupted by jack tier with a singular proposition jacks great desire was to get on board the swash and he now begged the mexican to let mulford take the yawl and scull him off to the brig and return to the islet before spike and his companions should descend from the lantern of the lighthouse the little fellow insisted there was sufficient time for such a purpose as the three in the lantern had not yet succeeded in filling the lamps with the oil necessary to their burning for a nighta duty that usually occupied the regular keeper for an hour five or six minutes would suffice for him and if he were seen going up the brigs side it would be easy for him to maintain that he had come ashore in the boat no one took such precise note of what was going on as to be able to contradict him and as to spike and the men with him they would probably never hear anything about it  don juan montefalderon was struck with the boldness of jack tiers plan but refused his assent to it he deemed it too hazardous but substituted a project of his own the moon would not rise until near eleven and it wanted several hours before the time of sailing when they returned to the brig he would procure his cloak and scull himself ashore being perfectly used to managing a boat in this way under the pretence of wishing to pass an hour longer near the grave of his countryman at the expiration of that hour he would take jack off concealed beneath his cloakan exploit of no great difficulty in the darkness especially as no one would be on deck but a hand or two keeping the anchorwatch with this arrangement therefore jack tier was obliged to be content  some fifteen or twenty minutes more passed during which the mexican again alluded to his country and his regrets at her deplorable situation the battles of the 8th and 9th of may two combats that ought to and which will reflect high honour on the little army that won them as well as on that hardly worked and in some respects hardly used service to which they belong had been just fought don juan mentioned these events without reserve and frankly admitted that success had fallen to the portion of much the weaker party he ascribed the victory to the great superiority of the american officers of inferior rank it being well known that in the service of the republic of the north as he termed america men who had been regularly educated at the military academy and who had reached the period of middle life were serving in the stations of captains and sometimes in that of lieutenants men who in many cases were fitted to command regiments and brigades having been kept in these lower stations by the tardiness with which promotion comes in an army like that of this country  don juan montefalderon was not sufficiently conversant with the subject perhaps else he might have added that when occasions do offer to bestow on these gentlemen the preferment they have so hardly and patiently earned they are too often neglected in order to extend the circle of vulgar political patronage he did not know that when a new regiment of dragoons was raised one permanent in its character and intended to be identified with the army in all future time that instead of giving its commissions to those who had fairly earned them by long privations and faithful service they were given with one or two exceptions to strangers  no government trifles more with its army and navy than our own so niggardly are the masterspirits at washington of the honours justly earned by military men that we have fleets still commanded by captains and armies by officers whose regular duty it would be to command brigades the world is edified with the sight of forces sufficient in numbers and every other military requisite to make one of napoleons corps de armée led by one whose commission would place him properly at the head of a brigade and nobly led too here when so favourable an occasion offers to add a regiment or two to the old permanent line of the army and thus infuse new life into its hope deferred the opportunity is overlooked and the rank and file are to be obtained by cramming instead of by a generous regard to the interests of the gallant gentlemen who have done so much for the honour of the american name and unhappily so little for themselves the extrapatriots of the nation and they form a legion large enough to trample the halls of the montezumas under their feet tell us that the reward of those other patriots beneath the shadows of the sierra madre is to be in the love and approbation of their fellow citizens at the very moment when they are giving the palpable proof of the value of this esteem and of the inconstancy of popular applause by pointing their fingers on account of an inadvertent expression in a letter at the gallant soldier who taught in our own times the troops of this country to stand up to the best appointed regiments of england and to carry off victory from the pride of europe in fair fieldfights alas alas it is true of nations as well as of men in their simplest and earliest forms of association that there are secrets in all families and it will no more do to dwell on our own than it would edify us to expose those of poor mexico  the discourse between the señor montefalderon and mulford was interesting as it ever has been when the former spoke of his unfortunate country on the subject of the battles of may he was candid and admitted his deep mortification and regrets he had expected more from the force collected on the rio grande though understanding the northern character better than most of his countrymen he had not been as much taken by surprise as the great bulk of his own nation  nevertheless don henrique he concluded for the voice of spike was just then heard as he was descending the stairs of the lighthouse nevertheless don henrique there is one thing that your people brave energetic and powerful as i acknowledge them to be would do well to remember and it is thisno nation of the numbers of ours can be or ever was conquered unless by the force of political combinations in a certain state of society a government may be overturned or a capital taken and carry a whole country along with it but our condition is one not likely to bring about such a result we are of a race different from the anglosaxon and it will not be easy either to assimilate us to your own or wholly to subdue us in those parts of the country where the population is small in time no doubt the spanish race might be absorbed and your sway established but ages of war would be necessary entirely to obliterate our usages our language and our religion from the peopled portions of mexico  it might be well for some among us to reflect on these matters the opinions of don juan in our judgment being entitled to the consideration of all prudent and considerate men  as spike descended to the door of the lighthouse harry rose and jack tier retired within that of the dwelling presently the voice of the captain was heard hailing the mexican and together they walked to the wharf the former boasting to the latter of his success in making a brilliant light brilliant it was indeed so brilliant as to give mulford many misgivings on the subject of the boat the light from the lantern fell upon the wharf and he could see the boat from the window where he stood with spike standing nearly over it waiting for the men to get his own yawl ready it is true the captains back was toward the dangerous object and the planks of the bridge were partly between him and it but there was a serious danger that was solely averted by the circumstance that spike was so earnestly dilating on some subject to don juan as to look only at that gentlemans face a minute later they were all in the yawl which pulled rapidly toward the brig  don juan montefalderon was not long absent ten minutes sufficed for the boat to reach the swash for him to obtain his cloak and to return to the islet alone no one in the vessel feeling a desire to interfere with his imaginary prayers as for the people it was not probable that one in the brig could have been induced to accompany him to the graves at that hour though everybody but josh had turnedin as he informed mulford to catch short naps previously to the hour of getting the brig under way as for the steward he had been placed on the lookout as the greatest idler on board all this was exceedingly favourable to jack tiers project since josh was already in the secret of his absence and would not be likely to betray his return after a brief consultation it was agreed to wait half an hour or an hour in order to let the sleepers lose all consciousness when don juan proposed returning to the vessel with his new companion  the thirty or forty minutes that succeeded were passed in general conversation on this occasion the señor montefalderon spoke more freely than he had yet done of recent events he let it be plainly seen how much he despised spike and how irksome to him was the intercourse he was obliged to maintain and to which he only submitted through a sense of duty the money known to be in the schooner was of a larger amount than had been supposed and every dollar was so important to mexico at that moment that he did not like to abandon it else did he declare that he would quit the brig at once and share in the fortunes of harry and rose he courteously expressed his best wishes for the happiness of the young couple and delicately intimated that under the circumstances he supposed that they would be united as soon as they could reach a place where the marriage rite could be celebrated this was said in the most judicious way possible so delicately as not to wound any ones feelings and in a way to cause it to resemble the announcement of an expectation rather than the piece of paternal advice for which it was really intended harry was delighted with this suggestion of his mexican friendthe most loyal american may still have a sincere friend of mexican birth and mexican feelings toosince it favoured not only his secret wishes but his secret expectations also  at the appointed moment don juan montefalderon and jack tier took their leave of the two they left behind them rose manifested what to harry seemed a strange reluctance to part with the little steward but tier was bent on profiting by this excellent opportunity to get back to the brig they went accordingly and the anxious listeners who watched the slightest movement of the yawl from the shore had reason to believe that jack was smuggled in without detection they heard the familiar sound of the oar falling in the boat and mulford said that joshs voice might be distinguished answering to a call from don juan no noise or clamour was heard such as spike would certainly have made had he detected the deception that had been practised on himself  harry and rose were now alone the former suggested that the latter should take possession of one of the little bedrooms that are usually to be found in american dwellings of the dimensions and humble character of the lighthouse abode while he kept watch until the brig should sail until spike was fairly off he would not trust himself to sleep but there was no sufficient reason why rose should not endeavour to repair the evil of a broken nights rest like that which had been passed in the boat with this understanding then our heroine took possession of her little apartment where she threw herself on the bed in her clothes while mulford walked out into the air as the most effective means of helping to keep his eyes open  it was now some time past ten and before eleven the moon would rise the mate consequently knew that his watch could not be long before spike would quit the neighbourhooda circumstance pregnant with immense relief to him at least so long as that unscrupulous and now nearly desperate man remained anywhere near rose he felt that she could not be safe and as he paced the sands on the off or outer side of the islet in order to be beyond the influence of the light in the lantern his eye was scarcely a moment taken away from the swash so impatiently and anxiously did he wait for the signs of some movement on board her  the moon rose and mulford heard the wellknown raps on the boobyhatch which precedes the call of all hands on board a merchantman all hands up anchor ahoy succeeded and in less than five minutes the bustle on board the brig announced the fact that her people were getting the anchor by this time it had got to be so light that the mate deemed it prudent to return to the house in order that he might conceal his person within its shadows awake rose he would not though he knew she would witness the departure of the swash with a satisfaction little short of his own he thought he would wait that when he did speak to her at all it might be to announce their entire safety as regarded the aunt rose was much relieved on her account by the knowledge that jack tier would not fail to let mrs budd know everything connected with her own situation and prospects the desertion of jack after coming so far with her had pained our heroine in a way we cannot at present explain but go he would probably feeling assured there was no longer any necessity for his continuance with the lovers in order to prevail on rose to escape from spike  the swash was not long in getting her groundtackle and the brig was soon seen with her topsail aback waiting to cat the anchor this done the yards swung round and the topsail filled it was blowing just a good breeze for such a craft to carry whole sail on a bowline with and away the light and active craft started like the racer that is galloping for daily exercise of course there were several passages by which a vessel might quit the group of islets some being larger and some smaller but all having sufficient water for a brigantine of the mollys draught determined not to lose an inch of distance unnecessarily spike luffed close up to the wind making an effort to pass out to windward of the light in order to do this however it became necessary for him to make two short tacks within the haven which brought him far enough to the southward and eastward to effect his purpose while this was doing the mate who perfectly understood the object of the manoeuvres passed to the side of the lighthouse that was opposite to that on which the dwelling was placed with a view to get a better sight of the vessel as she stood out to sea in order to do this however it was necessary for the young man to pass through a broad bit of moonlight but he trusted for his not being seen to the active manner in which all hands were employed on board the vessel it would seem that in this respect mulford trusted without his host for as the vessel drew near he perceived that six or eight figures were on the guns of the swash or in her rigging gesticulating eagerly and seemingly pointing to the very spot where he stood when the brig got fairly abeam of the light she would not be a hundred yards distant from it and fearful to complete the exposure of his person which he had so inadvertently and unexpectedly commenced our mate drew up close to the wall of the lighthouse against which he sustained himself in a position as immovable as possible this movement had been seen by a single seaman on board the swash and the man happened to be one of those who had landed with spike only two hours before his name was barlow  captain spike sir called out barlow who was coiling up rigging on the forecastle and was consequently obliged to call out so loud as to be heard by all on board yonder is a man at the foot of the lighthouse  by this time the moon coming out bright through an opening in the clouds mulford had become conscious of the risk he ran and was drawn up as immovable as the pile itself against the stones of the lighthouse such an announcement brought everybody to leeward and every head over the bulwarks spike himself sprang into the lee mainchains where his view was unobstructed and where mulford saw and recognised him even better than he was seen and recognised in his own person all this time the brig was moving ahead  a man barlow exclaimed spike in the way one a little bewildered by an announcement expresses his surprise a man that can never be there is no one at the lighthouse you know  there he stands sir with his back to the tower and his face this way his dark figure against the whitewashed stones is plain enough to be seen living or dead sir that is the mate  living it cannot be answered spike though he gulped at the words the next moment  a general exclamation now showed that everybody recognised the mate whose figure stature dress and even features were by this time all tolerably distinct the fixed attitude however the immovable statuelike rigidity of the form and all the other known circumstances of harrys case united to produce a common and simultaneous impression among the superstitious mariners that what they saw was but the ghostly shadow of one lately departed to the world of spirits even spike was not free from this illusion and his knees shook beneath him there where he stood in the channels of a vessel that he had handled like a top in so many gales and tempests with him however the illusion was neither absolute nor lasting a second thought told him it could scarcely be so and then he found his voice by this time the brig was nearly abreast of where harry stood  you josh called out spike in a voice of thunder loud enough to startle even mrs budd and biddy in their berths  lor help us all answered the negro what will come next ting aboard dis wessel here i be sir  pass the fowlingpiece out of my stateroom both barrels are loaded with ball ill try him though the bullets are only lead  a common exclamation of dissatisfaction escaped the men while josh was obeying the order its no use  you never can hurt one of them things something will befall the brig on account of this and its the mates sperit and sperits cant be harmed by lead or iron were the sort of remarks made by the seamen during the short interval between the issuing the order for the fowlingpiece and its execution  there t is capin spike said josh passing the piece up through the rigging but t will no more shoot that thing than one of our carronades would blow up gibraltar  by this time spike was very determined his lips being compressed and his teeth set as he took the gun and cocked it then he hailed as all that passed occurred as it might be at once the brig even at that moment was little more than abreast of the immovable mate and about eighty yards from him  lighthouse there cried spikeliving or dead answer or i fire  no answer came and no motion appeared in the dark figure that was now very plainly visible under a bright moon drawn in high relief against the glittering white of the tower spike dropped the muzzle to its aim and fired  so intense was the attention of all in the swash that a wink of harrys could almost have been seen had he betrayed even that slight sign of human infirmity at the flash and the report the ball was flattened against a stone of the building within a foot of the mates body but he did not stir all depended now on his perfect immovability as he well knew and he so far commanded himself as to remain rigid as if of stone himself  there one can see how it isno life in that being said one i knowd how it would end added another nothing but silver and that cast on purpose will ever lay it continued a third but spike disregarded all this time he was resolved that his aim should be better and he was inveterately deliberate in getting it just as he pulled the trigger however don juan montefalderon touched his elbow the piece was fired and there stood the immovable figure as before fixed against the tower spike was turning angrily to chide his mexican friend for deranging his aim when the report of an answering musket came back like an echo every eye was turned toward the figure but it moved not then the humming sound of an advancing ball was heard and a bullet passed whistling hoarsely through the rigging and fell some distance to windward every head disappeared below the bulwarks even spike was so far astonished as to spring in upon deck and for a single instant not a man was to be seen above the monkeyrail of the brig then spike recovered himself and jumped upon a gun his first look was toward the lighthouse now on the vessels leequarter but the spot where had so lately been seen the form of mulford showed nothing but the glittering brightness of the whitewashed stones  the reader will not be surprised to learn that all these events produced a strange and deep impression on board the molly swash the few who might have thrown a little light on the matter were discreetly silent while all that portion of the crew which was in the dark firmly believed that the spirit of the murdered mate was visiting them in order to avenge the wrongs inflicted on it in the flesh the superstition of sailors is as deep as it is general all those of the molly too were salts of the old school seadogs of a past generation properly speaking and mariners who had got their notions in the early part of the century when the spirit of progress was less active than it is at present  spike himself might have had other misgivings and believed that he had seen the living form of his intended victim but for the extraordinary and ghostlike echo of his last discharge there was nothing visible or intelligible from which that fire could have come and he was perfectly bewildered by the whole occurrence an intention to roundto as soon as through the passage down boat and land which had been promptly conceived when he found that his first aim had failed was as suddenly abandoned and he gave the command to board foretack immediately after his call was to pack on the brig and not without a little tremour in his voice as soon as he perceived that the figure had vanished the crew was not slow to obey these orders and in ten minutes the swash was a mile from the light standing to the northward and eastward under a press of canvas and with a freshening breeze  to return to the islets harry from the first had seen that everything depended on his remaining motionless as the people of the brig were partly in shadow he could not and did not fully understand how completely he was himself exposed in consequence of the brightness of all around him and he had at first hoped to be mistaken for some accidental resemblance to a man his nerves were well tried by the use of the fowlingpiece but they proved equal to the necessities of the occasion but when an answering report came from the rear or from the opposite side of the islet he darted round the tower as much taken by surprise and overcome by wonder as any one else who heard it it was this rapid movement which caused his flight to be unnoticed all the men of the brig dodging below their own bulwarks at that precise instant  as the lighthouse was now between the mate and the brig he had no longer any motive for trying to conceal himself his first thought was of rose and strange as it may seem for some little time he fancied that she had found a musket in the dwelling and discharged it in order to aid his escape the events had passed so swiftly that there was no time for the cool consideration of anything and it is not surprising that some extravagances mingled with the first surmises of all these  on reaching the door of the house therefore harry was by no means surprised at seeing rose standing in it gazing at the swiftly receding brigantine he even looked for the musket expecting to see it lying at her feet or leaning against the wall of the building rose however was entirely unarmed and as dependent on him for support as when he had parted from her an hour or two before  where did you find that musket rose and what have you done with it inquired harry as soon as he had looked in every place he thought likely to hold such an implement  musket harry i have had no musket though the report of firearms near by awoke me from a sweet sleep  is this possible i had imprudently trusted myself on the other side of the lighthouse while the moon was behind clouds and when they broke suddenly away its light betrayed me to those on board the brig spike fired at me twice without injuring me when to my astonishment an answering report was heard from the islet what is more the piece was charged with a ballcartridge for i heard the whistling of the bullet as it passed on its way to the brig  and you supposed i had fired that musket  whom else could i suppose had done it you are not a very likely person to do such a thing i will own my love but there are none but us two here  it must be jack tier exclaimed rose suddenly  that is impossible since he has left us  one never knows jack understood how anxious i was to retain him with us and he is so capricious and full of schemes that he may have contrived to get out of the brig as artfully as he got on board her  if jack tier be actually on this islet i shall set him down as little else than a conjuror  hist interrupted rose what noise is that in the direction of the wharf it sounds like an oar falling in a boat  mulford heard that wellknown sound as well as his companion and followed by rose he passed swiftly through the house coming out at the front next the wharf the moon was still shining bright and the mystery of the echoing report and answering shot was immediately explained a large boat one that pulled ten oars at least was just coming up to the end of the wharf and the manner in which its oars were unshipped and tossed announced to the mate that the crew were manofwars men he walked hastily forward to meet them  three officers first left the boat together the gold bands of their caps showed that they belonged to the quarterdeck a fact that the light of the moon made apparent at once though it was not strong enough to render features distinct as mulford continued to advance however the three officers saluted him  i see you have got the light under way once more observed the leader of the party last night it was as dark as erebus in your lantern  the lighthouse keeper and his assistant have both been drowned answered mulford the lamps have been lit tonight by the people of the brig which has just gone out  pray sir what brig may that be  the molly swash of new york a craft that i lately belonged to myself but which i have left on account of her evil doings  the molly swash stephen spike master and owner bound to key west and a market with a cargo of eight hundred barrels of flour and that of a quality so lively and pungent that it explodes like gunpowder i beg your pardon mr mate for not recognising you sooner have you forgotten the poughkeepsie captain mull and her farreaching paixhans  i ought to ask your pardon mr wallace for not recognising you sooner too but one does not distinguish well by moonlight i am delighted to see you sir and now hope that with my assistance a stop can be put to the career of the brig  what mr mate do you turn against your craft said wallace under the impulsive feeling which induces all loyal men to have a distaste for treachery of every sort the seaman should love the very planks of his vessel  i fully understand you mr wallace and will own that for a long time i was tied to rascality by the opinions to which you allude but when you come to hear my explanation i do not fear your judgment in the least  mulford now led the way into the house whither rose had already retreated and where she had lighted candles and made other womanly arrangements for receiving her guests at harrys suggestion some of the soup was placed over coals to warm up for the party and our heroine made her preparations to comfort them also with a cup of tea while she was thus employed mulford gave the whole history of his connection with the brig his indisposition to quit the latter the full exposure of spikes treason his own desertion if desertion it could be called the loss of the schooner and his abandonment on the rock and the manner in which he had been finally relieved it was scarcely possible to relate all these matters and altogether avoid allusions to the schemes of spike in connection with rose and the relation in which our young man himself stood toward her although mulford touched on these points with great delicacy it was as a seaman talking to seamen and he could not entirely throw aside the frankness of the profession ashore men live in the privacy of their own domestic circles and their secrets and secret thoughts are family secrets of which it has passed into a proverb to say that there are always some even in the best of these communities on shipboard or in the camp it is very different the close contact in which men are brought with each other the necessity that exists for opening the heart and expanding the charities gets in time to influence the whole character and a certain degree of frankness and simplicity takes the place of the reserve and acting that might have been quickened in the same individual under a different system of schooling but mulford was frank by nature as well as by his seaeducation and his companions on this occasion were pretty well possessed of all his wishes and plans in reference to rose even to his hope of falling in with the chaplain of the poughkeepsie by the time his story was all told the fact that rose was occupied in another room most of the time had made these explanations all the easier and spared her many a blush as for the manofwars men they listened to the tale with manly interest and a generous sympathy  i am glad to hear your explanation mr mate said wallace cordially as soon as harry had done and theres my hand in proof that i approve of your course i own to a radical dislike of a turncoat or a traitor to his craft brother hollinslooking at the elder of his two companions one of whom was the midshipman who had originally accompanied him on board the swashand am glad to find that our friend mulford here is neither a truehearted sailor can be excused for deserting even his own ship under such circumstances  i am glad to hear even this little concession from you wallace answered hollins goodnaturedly and speaking with a mild expression of benevolence on a very calm and thoughtful countenance your mess is as heteredox as any i ever sailed with on the subject of our duties in this respect  i hold it to be a sailors duty to stick by his ship reverend and dear sir  this mode of address which was used by the ships gentleman in the cant of the wardroom as a pleasantry of an old shipmate for the two had long sailed together in other vessels at once announced to harry that he saw the very chaplain for whose presence he had been so anxiously wishing the reverend and dear sir smiled at the sally of his friend a sort of thing to which he was very well accustomed but he answered with a gravity and point that it is to be presumed he thought befitting his holy office  it may be well to remark here that the rev mr hollins was not one of the lunchd chaplains that used to do discredit to the navy of this country or a layman dubbed with such a title and rated that he might get the pay and become a boon companion of the captain at the table and in his frolics ashore those days are gone by and ministers of the gospel are now really employed to care for the souls of the poor sailors who so long have been treated by others and have treated themselves indeed as if they were beings without souls altogether in these particulars the world has certainly advanced though the wise and the good in looking around them may feel more cause for astonishment in contemplating what it once was than to rejoice in what it actually is but intellect has certainly improved in the aggregate if not in its especial dispensations and men will not now submit to abuses that within the recollections of a generation they even cherished in reference to the more intellectual appointments of a ship of war the commander excepted for we contend he who directs all ought to possess the most capacity but in reference to what are ordinarily believed to be the more intellectual appointments of a vessel of war the surgeon and the chaplain we well recollect opinions that were expressed to us many years since by two officers of the highest rank known to the service when i first entered the navy said one of these old benbows if i had occasion for the amputation of a leg and the question lay between the carpenter and the doctor de but i would have tried the carpenter first for i felt pretty certain he would have been the most likely to get through with the job in old times said the other when a chaplain joined a ship the question immediately arose whether the mess were to convert the chaplain or the chaplain the mess and the mess generally got the best of it there was very little exaggeration in either of these opinions but happily all this is changed vastly for the better and a navysurgeon is necessarily a man of education and experience in very many instances men of high talents are to be found among them while chaplains can do something better than play at backgammon eat terrapins when in what may be called terrapinports and drink brandy and water or pure bob smith1  it is a great mistake wallace to fancy that the highest duty a man owes is either to his ship or to his country observed the rey mr hollins quietly the highest duty of each and all of us is to god and whatever conflicts with that duty must be avoided as a transgression of his laws and consequently as sin  you surprise me reverend and dear sir i do not remember ever to have heard you broach such opinions before which might be interpreted to mean that a fellow might be disloyal to his flag  because the opinion might be liable to misinterpretation still i do not go as far as many of my friends on this subject if decatur ever really said our country right or wrong he said what might be just enough and creditable enough in certain cases and taken with the fair limitations that he probably intended should accompany the sentiment but if he meant it as an absolute and controlling principle it was not possible to be more in error in this last sense such a rule of conduct might and in old times often would have justified idolatry nay it is a species of idolatry in itself since it is putting country before god sailors may not always be able to make the just distinctions in these cases but the quarterdeck should be so irreverend and dear sir  wallace laughed and then he turned the discourse to the subject more properly before them  i understand you to say mr mulford he remarked that in your opinion the swash has gone to try to raise the unfortunate mexican schooner a second time from the depths of the ocean  from the rock on which she lies under the circumstances i hardly think he would have come hither for the chain and cable unless with some such object we know moreover thut such was his intention when we left the brig  and you can take us to the very spot where that wreck lies  without any difficulty her masts are partly out of water and we hung on to them in our boat no later than last night or this morning rather  so far well your conduct in all this affair will be duly appreciated and captain mull will not fail to represent it in a right point of view to the government  where is the ship sir i looked for her most anxiously without success last evening nor had jack tier the little fellow i have named to you any better luck though i sent him aloft as high as the lantern in the lighthouse for that purpose  the ship is off here to the northward and westward some six leagues or so at sunset she may have been a little further we have supposed that the swash would be coming back hither and had laid a trap for her which came very near taking her alive  what is the trap you mean sirthough taking stephen spike alive is sooner said than done  our plan has been to catch him with our boats with the greater draft of water of the poughkeepsie and the heels of your brig sir a regular chase about these reefs as we knew from experience would be almost hopeless it was therefore necessary to use headwork and some manofwar traverses in order to lay hold of him yesterday afternoon we hoisted out three cutters manned them and made sail in them all under our luggs working up against the trades each boat took its own course one going off the west end of the reef one going more to the eastward while i came this way to look in at the dry tortugas spike will be lucky if he do not fall in with our third cutter which is under the fourth lieutenant should he stand on far on the same tack as that on which he left this place let him try his fortune however as for our boat as soon as i saw the lamps burning in the lantern i made the best of my way hither and got sight of the brig just as she loosened her sails then i took in my own luggs and came on with the oars had we continued under our canvas with this breeze i almost think we might have overhauled the rascal  it would have been impossible sir the moment he got a sight of your sails he would have been off in a contrary direction and that brig really seems to fly whenever there is a pressing occasion for her to move you did the wisest thing you could have done and barely missed him as it was he has not seen you at all as it is and will be all the less on his guard against the next visit from the ship  not seen me why sir the fellow fired at us twice with a musket why he did not use a carronade is more than i can tell  excuse me mr wallace those two shots were intended for me though i now fully comprehend why you answered them  answered them yes indeed who would not answer such a salute and gun for gun if he had a chance i certainly thought he was firing at us and having a musket between my legs i let fly in return and even the chaplain here will allow that was returning good for evil but explain your meaning  mulford now went into the details of the incidents connected with his coming into the moonlight at the foot of the lighthouse that he was not mistaken as to the party for whom the shots were intended was plain enough to him from the words that passed aloud among the people of the swash as well as from the circumstance that both balls struck the stones of the tower quite near him this statement explained everything to wallace who now fully comprehended the cause and motive of each incident  it was now near eleven and rose had prepared the table for supper the gentlemen of the poughkeepsie manifested great interest in the movements of the hebelike little attendant who was caring for their wants when the cloth was to be laid the midshipman offered his assistance but his superior directed him to send a hand or two up from the wharf where the crew of the cutter were lounging or sleeping after their cruise these men had been thought of too and a vessel filled with smoking soup was taken to them by one of their own number  the supper was as cheerful as it was excellent the dry humour of wallace the mild intelligence of the chaplain the good sense of harry and the spirited information of rose contributed each in its particular way to make the meal memorable in more senses than one the laugh came easily at that table and it was twelve oclock before the party thought of breaking up  the dispositions for the night were soon made rose returned to her little room where she could now sleep in comfort and without apprehension the gentlemen made the disposition of their persons that circumstances allowed each finding something on which to repose that was preferable to a plank as for the men they were accustomed to hard fare and enjoyed their present goodluck to the top of their bent it was quite late before they had done spinning their yarns and cracking their jokes around the pot of turtlesoup and the can of grog that succeeded it by halfpast twelve however everybody was asleep  mulford was the first person afoot the following morning he left the house just as the sun rose and perceiving that the coast was clear of sharks he threw off his light attire and plunged into the sea refreshed with this indulgence he was returning toward the building when he met the chaplain coming in quest of him this gentleman a man of real piety and of great discretion had been singularly struck on the preceding night with the narrative of our young mate and he had not failed to note the allusions slight as they were and delicately put as they had been to himself he saw at once the propriety of marrying a couple so situated and now sought harry with a view to bring about so desirable an event by intimating his entire willingness to officiate it is scarcely necessary to say that very few words were wanting to persuade the young man to fall into his views and as to rose he had handed her a short note on the same subject which he was of opinion would be likely to bring her to the same way of thinking  an hour later all the officers harry and rose were assembled in what might be termed the lighthouse parlour the rev mr hollins had neither band gown nor surplice but he had what was far better feeling and piety without a prayerbook he never moved and he read the marriage ceremony with a solemnity that was communicated to all present the ring was that which had been used at the marriage of roses parents and which she wore habitually though not on the left hand in a word harry and rose were as firmly and legally united on that solitary and almost unknown islet as could have been the case had they stood up before the altar of mother trinity itself with a bishop to officiate and a legion of attendants after the compliments which succeeded the ceremony the whole party sat down to breakfast  if the supper had been agreeable the morning meal was not less so rose was timid and blushing as became a bride though she could not but feel how much more respectable her position became under the protection of harry as his wife than it had been while she was only his betrothed the most delicate deportment on the part of her companions soon relieved her embarrassment however and the breakfast passed off without cause for an unhappy moment  the ships standing in toward the light sir reported the cockswain of the cutter as the party was still lingering around the table as if unwilling to bring so pleasant a meal to a close since the mist has broke away we see her sir even to her ports and deadeyes  in that case sam she cant be very far off answered wallace ay there goes a gun from her at this moment as much as to say what has become of all of my boats run down and let off a musket perhaps she will make out to hear that as we must be rather to windward if anything  the signal was given and understood a quarter of an hour later the poughkeepsie began to shorten sail then wallace stationed himself in the cutter in the centre of one of the passages signalling the ship to come on ten minutes later still the noble craft came into the haven passing the still burning light with her topsails just lifting and making a graceful sweep under very reduced sail she came to the wind very near the spot where the swash had lain only ten hours before and dropped an anchor  1 in the palmy days of the service when robert smith was so long secretary of the navy the ships whisky went by this familiar sobriquet  chapter v    the gull has found her place on shore   the sun gone down again to rest   and all is still but oceans roar   there stands the man unblessd   but see he moveshe turns as asking where   his mates why looks he with that piteous stare  dana  superstition would seem to be a consequence of a state of being in which so much is shadowed forth while so little is accurately known our farreaching thoughts range over the vast fields of created things without penetrating to the secret cause of the existence of even a blade of grass we can analyze all substances that are brought into our crucibles tell their combinations and tendencies give a scientific history of their formation so far as it is connected with secondary facts their properties and their uses but in each and all there is a latent natural cause that baffles all our inquiries and tells us that we are merely men this is just as true in morals as in physicsno man living being equal to attaining the very faith that is necessary to his salvation without the special aid of the spirit of the godhead and even with that mighty support trusting implicitly for all that is connected with a future that we are taught to believe is eternal to the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things unseen in a word this earthly probation of ours was intended for finite beings in the sense of our present existence leaving far more to be conjectured than is understood  ignorance and superstition ever bear a close and even a mathematical relation to each other the degrees of the one are regulated by the degrees of the other he who knows the least believes the most while he who has seen the most without the intelligence to comprehend that which he has seen feels perhaps the strongest inclination to refer those things which to him are mysteries to the supernatural and marvellous sailors have been from time immemorial more disposed than men of their class on the land to indulge in this weakness which is probably heightened by the circumstance of their living constantly and vividly in the presence of powers that menace equally their lives and their means without being in any manner subject to their control  spike for a seaman of his degree of education was not particularly addicted to the weakness to which we have just alluded nevertheless he was not altogether free from it and recent circumstances contributed to dispose him so much the more to admit a feeling which like sin itself is ever the most apt to insinuate itself at moments of extraordinary moral imbecility and through the openings left by previous transgression as his brig stood off from the light the captain paced the deck greatly disturbed by what had just passed and unable to account for it the boat of the poughkeepsie was entirely concealed by the islet and there existing no obvious motive for wishing to return in order to come at the truth not a thought to that effect for one moment crossed the mind of the smuggler so far from this indeed were his wishes that the molly did not seem to him to go half as fast as usual in his keen desire to get further and further from a spot where such strange incidents had occurred  as for the men forward no argument was wanting to make them believe that something supernatural had just passed before their eyes it was known to them all that mulford had been left on a naked rock some thirty miles from that spot and it was not easy to understand how he could now be at the dry tortugas planted as it might be on purpose to show himself to the brig against the tower in the bright moonlight like a pictur hung up for his old shipmates to look at  sombre were the tales that were related that night among them many of which related to the sufferings of men abandoned on desert islands and all of which bordered more or less on the supernatural the crew connected the disappearance of the boat with mulfords apparition though the logical inference would have been that the body which required planks to transport it could scarcely be classed with anything of the world of spirits the links in arguments however are seldom respected by the illiterate and vulgar who jump to their conclusions in cases of the marvellous much as politicians find an expression of the common mind in the prepared opinions of the few who speak for them totally disregarding the dissenting silence of the million while the men were first comparing their opinions on that which to them seemed to be so extraordinary the señor montefalderon joined the captain in his walk and dropped into a discourse touching the events which had attended their departure from the haven of the dry tortugas in this conversation don juan most admirably preserved his countenance as well as his selfcommand effectually preventing the suspicion of any knowledge on his part that was not common to them both  you did leave the port with the salutes observed the mexican commenced with the slightest accent of a foreigner or just enough to show that he was not speaking in his mother tongue salutes paid and returned  do you call that saluting don wan to me that infernal shot sounded more like an echo than anything else  and to what do you ascribe it don esteban  i wish i could answer that question sometimes i begin to wish i had not left my mate on that naked rock  there is still time to repair the last wrong we shall go within a few miles of the place where the señor enrique was left and i can take the yawl with two men and go in search of him while you are at work on the wreck  do you believe it possible that he can be still there demanded spike looking suddenly and intently at his companion while his mind was strangely agitated between hatred and dread if he is there who and what was he that we all saw so plainly at the foot of the lighthouse  how should he have left the rock he was without food or water and no man in all his vigour could swim this distance i see no means of his getting here  unless some wrecker or turtler fell in with him and took him off ay ay don wan i left him that much of a chance at least no man can say i murdered my mate  i am not aware don esteban that any one has said so hard a thing of you still we have seen neither wrecker nor turtler since we have been here and that lessens the excellent chance you left don enrique  there is no occasion señor to be so particular growled spike a little sullenly in reply the chance i say was a good one when you consider how many of them devils of wreckers hang about these reefs let this brig only get fast on a rock and they would turn up like sharks all around us each with his maw open for salvage but this is neither here nor there what puzzles me was what we saw at the light half an hour since and the musket that was fired back at us i know that the figure at the foot of the tower did not fire for my eye was on him from first to last and he had no arms you were on the island a good bit and must have known if the lighthouse keeper was there or not don wan  the lighthouse keeper was there don estebanbut he was in his grave  ay ay one i know was drowned and buried with the rest of them there might however have been more than one you saw none of the people that had gone to key west in or about the house don wan  none if any persons have left the tortugas to go to key west within a few days not one of them has yet returned  so i supposed no it can be none of them then i saw his face as plainly as ever i saw it by moonlight from aft forard what is your opinion about seeing the dead walk on the arth don wan  that i have never seen any such thing myself don esteban and consequently know nothing about it  so i supposed i find it hard to believe it i do it may be a warning to keep us fromcoming any more to the dry tortugas and i must say i have little heart for returning to this place after all that has fell out here we can go to the wreck fish up the doubloons and be off for yucatan once in one of your ports i make no question that the merits of the molly will make themselves understood and that we shall soon agree on a price  what use could we put the brig to don esteban if we had her all ready for sea  that is a strange question to ask in time of war give me such a craft as the molly with sixty or eighty men on board her in a war like this and her arnins should not fall short of half a million within a twelvemonth  could we engage you to take charge of her don esteban  that would be ticklish work don wan but we can see no one knows what he will do until he is tried in for a penny in for a pound a fellow never knows ha ha ha don wan we live in a strange worldyes in a strange world  we live in strange times don esteban as the situation of my poor country proves but let us talk this matter over a little more in confidence  and they did thus discuss the subject it was a singular spectacle to see an honourable man one full of zeal of the purest nature in behalf of his own country sounding a traitor as to the terms on which he might be induced to do all the harm he could to those who claimed his allegiance such sights however are often seen our own especial objects too frequently blinding us to the obligations that we owe morality so far as not to be instrumental in effecting even what we conceive to be good by questionable agencies but the señor montefalderon kept in view principally his desire to be useful to mexico blended a little too strongly perhaps with the wishes of a man who was born near the sun to avenge his wrongs real or fancied  while this dialogue was going on between spike and his passenger as they paced the quarterdeck one quite as characteristic occurred in the galley within twenty feet of themsimon the cook and josh the steward being the interlocutors as they talked secrets they conferred together with closed doors though few were ever disposed to encounter the smoke grease and fumes of their narrow domains unless called thither by hunger  what you tink of dis matter josh demanded simon whose skull having the wellknown density of his race did not let internal ideas out or external ideas in as readily as most mens our young mate was at de lighthouse beyond all controwersy and how can he be den on dat rock over yonder too  dat is imposserbul answered josh derefore i says it is nt true i surposes you know dat what is imposserbul is nt true simon nobody cant be out yonder and down here at de same time dat is imposserble simon but what i wants to intermate to you will explain all dis difficulty and it do show de raal superority of a coloured man over de white poperlation now you mark my words cook and be full of admiration jack tier came back along wid de mexican gentleem in my anchorwatch dis very night you see in de first place ebbery ting come to pass in niggers watch  here the two darkskinned worthies hawhawd to their hearts content laughing very much as a magistrate or a minister of the gospel might be fancied to laugh the first time he saw a clown at a circus the merriment of a negro will have its course in spite of ghosts or of anything else and neither the cook nor the steward dreamed of puting in another syllable until their laugh was fairly and duly ended then the cook made his remarks  how jack tier comin back explain der differculty josh asked simon  did nt jack go away wid miss rose and de mate in de boat dat got adrift you know in jacks watch on deck  here the negroes laughed again their imaginations happening to picture to each at the same instant the mystification about the boat biddy having told josh in confidence the manner in which the party had returned to the brig while he and simon were asleep which fact the steward had already communicated to the cook to these two beings of an order in nature different from all around them and of a simplicity and of habits that scarce placed them on a level with the intelligence of the humblest white man all these circumstances had a sort of mysterious connection out of which peeped much the most conspicuously to their faculties the absurdity of the captains imagining that a boat had got adrift which had in truth been taken away by human hands accordingly they laughed it out and when they had done laughing they returned again to the matter before them with renewed interest in the subject  well how all dat explain dis differculty repeated simon  in dis wery manner cook returned the steward with a little dignity in his manner ebbery ting depend on understandin i spose you know if mr mulford got taken off dat rock by miss rose and jack tier wid de boat and den dey comes here altogedder and den jack tier he get on board and tell biddy all dis matter and den biddy tell josh and den josh tell de cookwhat for you surprise you black debbil one bit  dat all exclaimed simon  dat just alldat ebbery bit of it do nt i say  here simon burst into such a fit of loud laughter that it induced spike himself to shove aside the galleydoor and thrust his own frowning visage into the dark hole within to inquire the cause  whats the meaning of this uproar demanded the captain all the more excited because he felt that things had reached a pass that would not permit him to laugh himself do you fancy yourself on the hook or at the five points  the hook and the five points are two pieces of tabooed territory within the limits of the good town of manhattan that are getting to be renowned for their rascality and orgies they probably want nothing but the proclamation of a governor in vindication of their principles annexed to a pardon of some of their unfortunate children to render both classical if we continue to make much further progress in political logic and in the same direction as that in which we have already proceeded so far neither will probably long be in want of this illustration votes can be given by the virtuous citizens of both these purlieus as well as by the virtuous citizens of the antirent districts and votes contain the essence of all such principles as well as of their glorification  do you fancy yourselves on the hook or at the five points demanded spike angrily  lor no sir answered simon laughing at each pause with all his heart only laughs a little at ghostdat all sir  laugh at ghost is that a subject to laugh at have a care you black rascal or he will visit you in your galley here when you will least want to see him  no care much for him sir returned simon laughing away as hard as ever sich a ghost ought nt to skear little baby  such a ghost and what do you know of this ghost more than any other  well i seed him capin spike and what a body sees he is acquainted wid  you saw an image that looked as much like mr mulford my late mate as one timberhead in this brig is like another  yes sir he like enoughmust say datso wery like could nt see any difference  as simon concluded this remark he burst out into another fit of laughter in which josh joined him heart and soul as it might be the uninitiated reader is not to imagine the laughter of those blacks to be very noisy or to be raised on a sharp high key they could make the welkin ring in sudden bursts of merriment on occasion but at a time like this they rather caused their diversion to be developed by sounds that came from the depths of their chests a gleam of suspicion that these blacks were acquainted with some fact that it might be well for him to know shot across the mind of spike but he was turned from further inquiry by a remark of don juan who intimated that the mirth of such persons never had much meaning to it expressing at the same time a desire to pursue the more important subject in which they were engaged admonishing the blacks to be more guarded in their manifestations of merriment the captain closed the door on them and resumed his walk up and down the quarterdeck as soon as left to themselves the blacks broke out afresh though in a way so guarded as to confine their mirth to the galley  capin spike tink dat a ghost exclaimed simon with contempt  guess if he see raal ghost he find e difference answered josh one look at raal sperit wort two at dis object  simons eyes now opened like two saucers and they gleamed by the light of the lamp they had like dark balls of condensed curiosity blended with awe on his companion  you ebber see him josh he asked glancing over each shoulder hurriedly as it might be to make sure that he could not see him too  how you tink i get so far down the wale of life simon and nebber see sich a ting i seed tree of the crew of the maria sheffington that was drowned by deir boats capsizin when we lay at gibraltar jest as plain as i see you now then  but it is unnecessary to repeat joshs experiences in this way with which he continued to entertain and terrify simon for the next halfhour this is just the difference between ignorance and knowledge while spike himself and every man in his brig who belonged forward had strong misgivings as to the earthly character of the figure they had seen at the foot of the lighthouse these negroes laughed at their delusion because they happened to be in the secret of mulfords escape from the rock and of that of his actual presence at the tortugas when however the same superstitious feeling was brought to bear on circumstances that lay without the sphere of their exact information they became just as dependent and helpless as all around them more so indeed inasmuch as their previous habits and opinions disposed them to a more profound credulity  it was midnight before any of the crew of the swash sought their rest that night the captain had to remind them that a day of extraordinary toil was before them ere he could get one even to quit the deck and when they did go below it was to continue to discuss the subject of what they had seen at the dry tortugas it appeared to be the prevalent opinion among the people that the late event foreboded evil to the swash and long as most of these men had served in the brig and much as they had become attached to her had she gone into port that night nearly every man forward would have run before morning but fatigue and wonder at length produced their effect and the vessel was silent as was usual at that hour spike himself lay down in his clothes as he had done ever since mulford had left him and the brig continued to toss the spray from her bows as she bore gallantly up against the trades working her way to windward the light was found to be of great service as it indicated the position of the reef though it gradually sunk in the western horizon until near morning it fell entirely below it  at this hour spike appeared on deck again where for the first time since their interview on the morning of harrys and roses escape he laid his eyes on jack tier the little dumplinglooking fellow was standing in the waist with his arms folded sailorfashion as composedly as if nothing had occurred to render his meeting with the captain any way of a doubtful character spike approached near the person of the steward whom he surveyed from head to foot with a sort of contemptuous superiority ere he spoke  so master tier at length the captain commenced you have deigned to turn out at last have you i hope the days duty youve forgotten will help to pay for the lighthouse boat that i understand youve lost for me also  what signifies a great clumsy boat that the brig could nt hoist in nor tow answered jack coolly turning short round at the same time but not condescending to uncoil his arms as he did so a mark of indifference that would probably have helped to mystify the captain had he even actually suspected that anything was wrong beyond the supposed accident to the boat in question if you had had the boat astarn captain spike an order would have been given to cut it adrift the first time the brig made sail on the wind  nobody knows jack that boat would have been very useful to us while at work about the wreck you never even turned out this morning to let me know where that craft lay as you promised to do but left us to find it out by our wits  there was no occasion for my tellin you anything about it sir when the mastheads was to be seen above water as soon as i heard that them ere mastheads was out of water i turned over and went to sleep upon it a man cant be on the doctors list and on duty at the same time  spike looked hard at the little steward but he made no further allusion to his being off duty or to his failing to stand pilot to the brig as she came through the passage in quest of the schooners remains the fact was that he had discovered the mastheads himself just as he was on the point of ordering jack to be called having allowed him to remain in his berth to the last moment after his watch according to a species of implied faith that is seldom disregarded among seamen once busied on the wreck jack was forgotten having little to do in common with any one on board but that which the captain termed the womens mess  come aft jack resumed spike after a considerable pause during the whole of which he had stood regarding the little steward as if studying his person and through that his character come aft to the trunk i wish to catechise you a bit  catechise repeated tier in an under tone as he followed the captain to the place mentioned its a long time since ive done anything at that  ay come hither resumed spike seating himself at his ease on the trunk while jack stood near by his arms still folded and his rotund little form as immovable under the plunges that the lively brig made into the headseas that she was obliged to meet as if a timberhead in the vessel itself you keep your sealegs well jack short as they are  no wonder for that captain spike for the last twenty years ive scarce passed a twelvemonth ashore and what i did before that no one can better tell than yourself since we was ten good years shipmates  so you say jack though i do not remember you as well as you seem to remember me do you not make the time too long  not a day sir ten good and happy years did we sail together captain spike and all that time in this very  hushhush man hush there is no need of telling the mollys age to everybody i may wish to sell her some day and then her great experience will be no recommendation you should recollect that the molly is a female and the ladies do not like to hear of their ages after fiveandtwenty  jack made no answer but he dropped his arms to their natural position seeming to wait the captains communication first referring to his tobaccobox and taking a fresh quid  if you was with me in the brig jack at the time you mention continued spike after another long and thoughtful pause you must remember many little things that i do nt wish to have known especially while mrs budd and her handsome niece is aboard here  i understand you captain spike the ladies shall larn no more from me than they know already  thank e for that jackthank e with all my heart shipmates of our standing ought to be fast friends and so youll find me if youll only sail under the true colours my man  at that moment jack longed to let the captain know how strenuously he had insisted that very night on rejoining his vessel and this at a time too when the brig was falling into disrepute but this he could not do without betraying the secret of the loversso he chose to say nothing  there is no use in blabbing all a man knows and the galley is a sad place for talking galley news is poor news i suppose you know jack  ive hearn say as much on board o manofwar its a great place for the officers to meet and talk and smoke in uncle sams crafts and what a body hears in such places is pretty much newspaper stuff i do suppose  ay ay thats it not to be thought of halfanhour after it has been spoken heres a doubloon for you jack and all for the sake of old times now tell me my litle fellow how do the ladies come on does nt miss rose get over her mourning on account of the mate ar nt we to have the pleasure of seein her on deck soon  i cant answer for the minds and fancies of young women captain spike they are difficult to understand and i would rather not meddle with what i cant understand  poh poh man you must get over that you might be of great use to me jack in a very delicate affairfor you know how it is with women they must be handled as a man would handle this brig among breakers rose in particlar is as skittish as a colt  stephen spike said jack solemnly but on so low a key that it entirely changed his usually harsh and cracked voice to one that sounded soft if not absolutely pleasant do you never think of hereafter your days are almost run a very few years in your calling it may be a very few weeks or a few hours and time will be done with you and etarnity will commencedo you never think of a hereafter  spike started to his feet gazing at jack intently then he wiped the perspiration from his face and began to pace the deck rapidly muttering to himselfthis has been a most accursed night first the mate and now this blast me but i thought it was a voice from the grave graves cant they keep those that belong to them or have rocks and waves no graves  what more passed through the mind of the captain must remain a secret for he kept it to himself nor did he take any further notice of his companion jack finding that he was unobserved passed quietly below and took the place in his berth which he had only temporarily abandoned  just as the day dawned the swash reached the vicinity of the wreck again sail was shortened and the brig stood in until near enough for the purpose of her commander when she was hoveto so near the mastheads that by lowering the yawl a line was sent out to the foremast and the brig was hauled close alongside the direction of the reef at that point formed a lee and the vessel lay in water sufficiently smooth for her object  this was done soon after the sun had risen and spike now ordered all hands called and began his operations in earnest by sounding carefully around the schooner when last here he had ascertained her situation to his entire satisfaction she had settled on a shelf of the reef in such a position that her bows lay in a sort of cradle while her stern was several feet nearer to the surface than the opposite extremity this last fact was apparent indeed by the masts themselves the lower mast aft being several feet out of water while the foremast was entirely buried leaving nothing but the foretopmast exposed on these great premises spike had laid the foundation of the practical problem he intended to solve  no expectation existed of ever getting the schooner afloat again all that spike and the señor montefalderon now aimed at was to obtain the doubloons which the former thought could be got at in the following manner he knew that it would be much easier handling the wreck so far as its gravity was concerned while the hull continued submerged he also knew that one end could be raised with a comparatively trifling effort so long as the other rested on the rock under these circumstances therefore he proposed merely to get slings around the after body of the schooner as near her sternpost indeed as would be safe and to raise that extremity of the vessel to the surface leaving most of the weight of the craft to rest on the bows the difference between the power necessary to effect this much and that which would be required to raise the whole wreck would be like the difference in power necessary to turn over a log with one end resting on the ground and turning the same log by lifting it bodily in the arms and turning it in the air with the stern once above water it would be easy to come at the bag of doubloons which jack tier had placed in a locker above the transoms  the first thing was to secure the brig properly in order that she might bear the necessary strain this was done very much as has been described already in the account of the manner in which she was secured and supported in order to raise the schooner at the dry tortugas an anchor was laid abreast and to windward and purchases were brought to the masts as before then the bight of the chain brought from the tortugas was brought under the schooners keel and counterpurchases leading from both the foremast and mainmast of the brig were brought to it and set taut spike now carefully examined all his fastenings looking to his cables as well as his mechanical power aloft heaving in upon this and veering out upon that in order to bring the molly square to her work after which he ordered the people to knockoff for their dinners by that time it was high noon  while stephen spike was thus employed on the wreck matters and things were not neglected at the tortugas the poughkeepsie had no sooner anchored than wallace went on board and made his report capt mull then sent for mulford with whom he had a long personal conference this officer was getting grey and consequently he had acquired experience it was evident to harry at first that he was regarded as one who had been willingly engaged in an unlawful pursuit but who had abandoned it to push dearer interests in another quarter it was some time before the commander of the sloopofwar could divest himself of this opinion though it gradually gave way before the frankness of the mates manner and the manliness simplicity and justice of his sentiments perhaps rose had some influence also in bringing about this favourable change  wallace did not fail to let it be known that turtlesoup was to be had ashore and many was the guest our heroine had to supply with that agreeable compound in the course of the morning jack tier had manifested so much skill in the preparation of the dish that its reputation soon extended to the cabin and the captain was induced to land in order to ascertain how far rumour was or was not a liar on this interesting occasion so ample was the custom indeed that wallace had the consideration to send one of the wardroom servants to the lighthouse in order to relieve rose from a duty that was getting to be a little irksome she was seeing company as a bride in a novel and rather unpleasant manner and it was in consequence of a suggestion of the ships gentleman that the remains of the turtle were transferred to the vessel and were put into the coppers secundum artem by the regular cooks  it was after tickling his palate with a bowl of the soup and enjoying a halfhours conversation with rose that capt mull summoned harry to a final consultation on the subject of their future proceedings by this time the commander of the poughkeepsie was in a better humour with his new acquaintance more disposed to believe him and infinitely more inclined to listen to his suggestions and advice than he had been in their previous interviews wallace was present in his character of ships gentleman or as having nothing to do while his senior the first lieutenant was working like a horse on board the vessel in the execution of his round of daily duties  at this consultation the parties came into a right understanding of each others views and characters capt mull was slow to yield his confidence but when he did bestow it he bestowed it sailorfashion or with all his heart satisfied at last that he had to do with a young man of honour and one who was true to the flag he consulted freely with our mate asked his advice and was greatly influenced in the formation of his final decision by the opinions that harry modestly advanced maintaining them however with solid arguments and reasons that every seaman could comprehend  mulford knew the plans of spike by means of his own communications with the señor montefalderon once acquainted with the projects of his old commander it was easy for him to calculate the time it would require to put them in execution with the means that were to be found on board the swash it will take the brig until near morning he said to beat up to the place where the wreck lies spike will wait for light to commence operations and several hours will be necessary to moor the brig and get out the anchors with which he will think it necessary to stay his masts then he will hook on and he may partly raise the hull before night return more than this he can never do and it would not surprise me were he merely to get everything ready for heaving on his purchases tomorrow and suspend further proceedings until the next day in preference to having so heavy a strain on his spars all night he has not the force however to carry on such duty to a very late hour and you may count with perfect security captain mull on his being found alongside of the wreck at sunrise the next day after tomorrow in all probability with his anchors down and fast to the wreck by timing your own arrival well nothing will be easier than to get him fairly under your guns and once under your guns the brig must give up when you chased her out of this very port a few days since you would have brought her up could you have kept her within range of those terrible shells ten minutes longer  you would then advise my not sailing from this place immediately said mull  it will be quite time enough to get under way late in the afternoon and then under short canvas ten hours will be ample time for this ship to beat up to that passage in and it will be imprudent to arrive too soon nor do i suppose you will wish to be playing round the reef in the dark  to the justice of all this capt mull assented and the plan of proceedings was deliberately and intelligently formed as it was necessary for mulford to go in the ship in order to act as pilot no one else on board knowing exactly where to find the wreck the commander of the poughkeepsie had the civility to offer the young couple the hospitalities of his own cabin with one of his staterooms this offer harry gratefully accepted it being understood that the ship would land them at key west as soon as the contemplated duty was executed rose felt so much anxiety about her aunt that any other arrangement would scarcely have pacified her fears  in consequence of these arrangements the poughkeepsie lay quietly at her anchors until near sunset in the interval her boats were out in all directions parties of the officers visiting the islet where the powder had exploded and the islet where the tent erected for the use of the females was still standing as for the lighthouse island an order of capt mulls prevented it from being crowded in a manner unpleasant to rose as might otherwise have been the case the few officers who did land there however appeared much struck with the ingenuous simplicity and beauty of the bride and a manly interest in her welfare was created among them all principally by means of the representations of the second lieutenant and the chaplain about five oclock she went off to the ship accompanied by harry and was hoisted on board in the manner usually practised by vessels of war which have no accommodationladder rigged rose was immediately installed in her stateroom where she found every convenience necessary to a comfortable though small apartment  it was quite late in the afternoon when the boatswain and his mate piped all hands up anchor harry hastened into the stateroom for his charming bride anxious to show her the movements of a vessel of war on such an occasion much as she had seen of the ocean and of a vessel within the last few weeks rose now found that she had yet a great deal to learn and that a ship of war had many points to distinguish her from a vessel engaged in commerce  the poughkeepsie was only a sloopofwar or a corvette in construction number of her guns and rate but she was a ship of the dimensions of an oldfashioned frigate measuring about one thousand tons the frigates of which we read half a century since were seldom ever as large as this though they were differently built in having a regular gundeck or one armed deck that was entirely covered with another above it and on the quarterdeck and forecastle of the last of which were also batteries of lighter guns to the contrary of all this the poughkeepsie had but one armed deck and on that only twenty guns these pieces however were of unusually heavy calibre throwing thirtytwo pound shot with the exception of the paixhans or columbiads which throw shot of even twice that weight the vessel had a crew of two hundred souls all told and she had the spars anchors and other equipments of a light frigate  in another great particular did the poughkeepsie differ from the corvettebuilt vessels that were so much in favour at the beginning of the century a species of craft obtained from the french who have taught the world so much in connection with naval science and who after building some of the best vessels that ever floated have failed in knowing how to handle them though not always in that the poughkeepsie while she had no spar or upper deck properly speaking had a poop and a topgallantforecastle within the last were the cabins and other accommodations of the captain an arrangement that was necessary for a craft of her construction that carried so many officers and so large a crew without it sufficient space would not be had for the uses of the last one gun of a side was in the main cabin there being a very neat and amply spacious aftercabin between the staterooms as is ordinarily the case in all vessels from the size of frigates up to that of threedeckers it may be well to explain here while on this subject of construction that in naval parlance a ship is called a singledecked vessel a twodecker or a three decker not from the number of decks she actually possesses but from the number of gundecks that she has or of those that are fully armed thus a frigate has four decks the spar gun berth and orlop or haulup decks but she is called a singledecked ship from the circumstance that only one of these four decks has a complete range of batteries the twodecker has two of these fully armed decks and the threedeckers three though in fact the twodecker has five and the threedecker six decks asking pardon for this little digression which we trust will be found useful to a portion of our readers we return to the narrative  harry conducted rose to the poop of the poughkeepsie where she might enjoy the best view of the operation of getting so large a craft under way manofwar fashion the details were mysteries of course and rose knew no more of the process by which the chain was brought to the capstan by the intervention of what is called a messenger than if she had not been present she saw two hundred men distributed about the vessel some at the capstan some on the forecastle some in the tops and others in the waist and she heard the order to heave round then the shrill fife commenced the lively air of the girl i left behind me rather more from a habit in the fifer than from any great regrets for the girls left at the dry tortugas as was betrayed to mulford by the smiles of the officers and the glances they cast at rose as for the latter she knew nothing of the air and was quite unconscious of the sort of parody that the gentlemen of the quarterdeck fancied it conveyed on her own situation  rose was principally struck with the quiet that prevailed in the ship captain mull being a silent man himself and insisting on having a quiet vessel the first lieutenant was not a noisy officer and from these two everybody else on board received their cues a simple all ready sir uttered by the first to the captain in a common tone of voice answered by a very well sir get your anchor in the same tone set everything in motion stamp and go soon followed and taking the whole scene together rose felt a strange excitement come over her there were the shrill animating music of the fife the stamping time of the men at the bars the perceptible motion of the ship as she drew ahead to her anchor and now and then the call between wallace who stood between the knightheads as commanderinchief on the forecastle the second lieutenants station when the captain does not take the trumpet as very rarely happens and the executive officer aft was carrying on duty all conspiring to produce this effect at length and it was but a minute or two from the time when the stamp and go commenced wallace called out a short staypeak sir heave and pull followed and the men left their bars  the process of making sail succeeded there was no letting fall a foretopsail here as on board a merchantman but all the canvas dropped from the yards into festoons at the same instant then the three topsails were sheeted home and hoisted all at once and all in a single minute of time the yards were counterbraced and the capstanbars were again manned in two more minutes it was heave and shes up and down then heave and in sight and heave and pull again the catfall was ready and it was hook on when the fife seemed to turn its attention to another subject as the men catted the anchor literally all this was done in less time than we have taken to write it down in and in very little more time than the reader has wasted in perusing what we have here written  the poughkeepsie was now free of bottom as it is called with her anchor catted and fished and her position maintained in the basin where she lay by the counterbracing of her yards and the counteracting force of the wind on her sails it only remained to fill away by bracing her headyards sharp up when the vast mass overcame its inertia and began to move through the water as this was done the jib and spanker were set the two most beautiful things with which we are acquainted are a graceful and highbred woman entering or quitting a drawingroom more particularly the last and a manofwar leaving her anchorage in a moderate breeze and when not hurried for time on the present occasion captain mull was in no haste and the ship passed out to windward of the light as the swash had done the previous night under her three topsails spanker and jib with the light sails loose and flowing and the courses hanging in the brails  a great deal is said concerning the defective construction of the light cruisers of the navy of late years and complaints are made that they will not sail as american cruisers ought to sail and were wont to sail in old times that there has been some ground for these complaints we believe though the evil has been greatly exaggerated and some explanation may be given we think even in the cases in which the strictures are not altogether without justification the trim of a light sharp vessel is easily deranged and officers in their desire to command as much as possible often get their vessels of this class too deep they are generally for the sort of cruiser oversparred overmanned and overprovisioned consequently too deep we recollect a case in which one of these delicate craft a halfrigged brig was much abused for having lost her sailing she did indeed lose her foreyard and after that she sailed like a witch until she got a new one if the facts were inquired into in the spirit which ought to govern such inquiries it would be found that even most of the muchabused ten sloops proved to be better vessels than common the st louis the vincennes the concord the fairfield the boston and the falmouth are instances of what we mean in behalf of the warren and the lexington we believe no discreet man was ever heard to utter one syllable except as wholesome crafts but the poughkeepsie was a very different sort of vessel from any of the ten sloops she was every way a good ship and as jack expressed it was a good goer the most severe nautical critic could scarcely have found a fault in her as she passed out between the islets on the evening of the day mentioned in the sort of undress we have described the whole scene indeed was impressive and of singular maritime characteristics  the little islets scattered about low sandy and untenanted were the only land in sightall else was the boundless waste of waters the solitary light rose like an aquatic monument as if purposely to give its character to the view captain mull had caused its lamps to be trimmed and lighted for the very reason that had induced spike to do the same thing and the dim star they presented was just struggling into existence as it might be as the briliance left by the setting sun was gradually diminished and finally disappeared as for the ship the hull appeared dark glossy and graceful as is usual with a vessel of war her sails were in soft contrast to the colour of the hull and they offered the variety and divergence from straight lines which are thought necessary to perfect beauty those that were set presented the symmetry in their trim the flatness in their hoist and the breadth that distinguish a manofwar while those that were loose floated in the air in every wave and cloudlike swell that we so often see in light canvas that is released from the yards in a fresh breeze the ship had an undress look from this circumstance but it was such an undress as denotes the man or woman of the world this undress appearance was increased by the piping down of the hammocks which left the nettings loose and with a negligent but still knowing look about them  when half a mile from the islets the mainyard was braced aback and the maintopsail was laid to the mast as soon as the ship had lost her way two or three boats that had been towing astern each with its boatsitter or keeper in it were hauled up alongside or to the quarters were hooked on and run up to the whistling of the call all was done at once and all was done in a couple of minutes as soon as effected the maintopsail was again filled and away the ship glided  captain mull was not in the habit of holding many consultations with his officers if there be wisdom in a multitude of counsellors he was of opinion it was not on board a manofwar napoleon is reported to have said that one bad general was better than two good ones meaning that one head to an army though of inferior quality is better than a hydra of solomons or cæsars captain mull was much of the same way of thinking seldom troubling his subordinates with anything but orders he interfered very little with working willy though he saw effectually that he did his duty the ships gentleman might enjoy his joke as much as he pleased so long as he chose his time and place with discretion but in the captains presence joking was not tolerated unless it were after dinner at his own table and in his own cabin even there it was not precisely such joking as took place daily not to say hourly in the midshipmens messes  in making up his mind as to the mode of proceeding on the present occasion therefore captain mull while he had heard all that mulford had to tell him and had even encouraged wallace to give his opinions made up his decision for himself after learning all that harry had to communicate he made his own calculations as to time and distance and quietly determined to carry whole sail on the ship for the next four hours this he did as the wisest course of making sure of getting to windward while he could and knowing that the vessel could be brought under short canvas at any moment when it might be deemed necessary the light was a beacon to let him know his distance with almost mathematical precision it could be seen so many miles at sea each mile being estimated by so many feet of elevation and having taken that elevation he was sure of his distance from the glittering object so long as it could be seen from his own poop it was also of use by letting him know the range of the reef though captain mull unlike spike had determined to make one leg off to the northward and eastward until he had brought the light nearly to the horizon and then to make another to the southward and eastward believing that the last stretch would bring him to the reef almost as far to windward as he desired to be in furtherance of this plan the sheets of the different sails were drawn home as soon as the boats were in and the poughkeepsie bending a little to the breeze gallantly dashed the waves aside as she went through and over them at a rate of not less than ten good knots in the hour as soon as all these arrangements were made the watch went below and from that time throughout the night the ship offered nothing but the quiet manner in which ordinary duty is carried on in a wellregulated vessel of war at sea between the hours of sun and sun leaving the good craft to pursue her way with speed and certainty we must now return to the swash  captain spike had found the mooring of his brig a much more difficult task on this occasion than on that of his former attempt to raise the schooner then he had to lift the wreck bodily and he knew that laying the swash a few feet further ahead or astern could be of no great moment inasmuch as the moment the schooner was off the bottom she would swing in perpendicularly to the purchases but now one end of the schooner her bows was to remain fast and it became of importance to be certain that the purchases were so placed as to bring the least strain on the masts while they acted most directly on the after body of the vessel to be lifted this point gave spike more trouble than he had anticipated fully one half of the remainder of the day even after he had begun to heave upon his purchases was spent in rectifying mistakes in connection with this matter and in getting up additional securities to his masts  in one respect spike had from the first made a good disposition the masts of the brig raked materially and by bringing the head of the swash in the direction of the schooner he converted this fact which might otherwise have been of great disadvantage into a circumstance that was favourable in consequence of the brigs having been thus moored the strain which necessarily led forward came nearly in a line with the masts and the latter were much better able to support it notwithstanding this advantage however it was found expedient to get up preventerstays and to give the spars all the additional support could be conveniently bestowed hours were passed in making these preliminary or it might be better to say secondary arrangements  it was past five in the afternoon when the people of the swash began to heave on their purchases as finally disposed after much creaking and the settling of straps and lashings into their places it was found that everything stood and the work went on in ten minutes spike found he had the weight of the schooner so far as he should be obliged to sustain it at all until the stern rose above the surface and he felt reasonably secure of the doubloons further than this he did not intend to make any experiment on her the señor montefalderon having abandoned all idea of recovering the vessel itself now so much of the cargo was lost the powder was mostly consumed and that which remained in the hull must by this time be injured by dampness if not ruined so reasoned don juan at least  as the utmost care was necessary the capstan and windlass were made to do their several duties with great caution as inch by inch was gained the extra supports of the masts were examined and it was found that a much heavier strain now came on the masts than when the schooner was raised before this was altogether owing to the direction in which it came and to the fact that the anchor planted off abeam was not of as much use as on the former occasion in consequence of its not lying so much in a straight line with the direction of the purchases spike began to have misgivings on account of his masts and this so much the more because the wind appeared to haul a little further to the northward and the weather to look unsettled should a swell roll into the bight of the reef where the brig lay by raising the hull a little too rudely there would be the imminent danger of at least springing if not of absolutely carrying away both the principal spars it was therefore necessary to resort to extraordinary precautions in order to obviate this danger  the captain was indebted to his boatswain who was now in fact acting as his mate for the suggestion of the plan next adopted two of the largest spare spars of the brig were got out with their heads securely lashed to the links of the chain by which the wreck was suspended one on each side of the schooner pigiron and shot were lashed to the heels of these spars which carried them to the bottom as the spars were of a greater length than was necessary to reach the rock they necessarily lay at an inclination which was lessened every inch the after body of the wreck was raised thus forming props to the hull of the schooner  spike was delighted with the success of this scheme of which he was assured by a single experiment in heaving after getting the spars well planted at their heels he even ordered the men to slacken the purchases a little and found that he could actually relieve the brig from the strain by causing the wreck to be supported altogether by these shores this was a vast relief from the cares of the approaching night and indeed alone prevented the necessity of the works going on without interruption or rest until the end was obtained  the people of the swash were just assured of the comfortable fact related as the poughkeepsie was passing out from among the islets of the dry tortugas they imagined themselves happy in having thus made a sufficient provision against the most formidable of all the dangers that beset them at the very moment when the best laid plan for their destruction was on the point of being executed in this respect they resembled millions of others of their fellows who hang suspended over the vast abyss of eternity totally unconscious of the irretrievable character of the fall that is so soon to occur spike as has been just stated was highly pleased with his own expedient and he pointed it out with exultation to the señor montefalderon as soon as it was completed  a nicer fit was never made by a lunnun legmaker don wan the captain cried after going over the explanations connected with the shoresthere she stands at an angle of fifty with two as good limbs under her as a body could wish i could now cast off everything and leave the wreck in what they call statu quo which i suppose means on its pins like a statue the tafferel is not six inches below the surface of the water and half an hour of heaving will bring the starn in sight  your work seems ingeniously contrived to get up one extremity of the vessel don esteban returned the mexican but are you quite certain that the doubloons are in her  this question was put because the functionary of a government in which money was very apt to stick in passing from hand to hand was naturally suspicious and he found it difficult to believe that mulford jack tier and even biddy under all the circumstances had not paid special attention to their own interests  the bag was placed in one of the transomlockers before the schooner capsized returned the captain as jack tier informs me if so it remains there still even the sharks will not touch gold don wan  would it not be well to call jack and hear his account of the matter once more now we appear to be so near the eldorado of our wishes  spike assented and jack was summoned to the quarterdeck the little fellow had scarce showed himself throughout the day and he now made his appearance with a slow step and reluctantly  youve made no mistake about them ere doubloons i take it master tier said spike in a very nautical sort of style of addressing an inferior you know them to be in one of the transomlockers  jack mounted on the breech of one of the guns and looked over the bulwarks at the dispositions that had been made about the wreck the tafferel of the schooner actually came in sight when a little swell passed over it leaving it for an instant in the trough the steward thus caught a glimpse again of the craft on board which he had seen so much hazard and he shook his head and seemed to be thinking of anything but the question which had just been put to him  well about that gold asked spike impatiently  the sight of that craft has brought other thoughts than gold into my mind captain spike answered jack gravely and it would be well for all us mariners if we thought less of gold and more of the dangers we run for hours and hours did i stand over etarnity on the bottom of that schooner don wan holdin my life as it might be at the marcy of a few bubbles of air  what has all that to do with the gold have you deceived me about that locker little rascal  no sir ive not deceived youno captain spike no the bag is in the upper transomlocker on the starboard side there i put it with my own hands and a good lift it was and there youll find it if youll cut through the quarterdeck at the spot i can pint out to you  this information seemed to give a renewed energy to all the native cupidity of the captain who called the men from their suppers and ordered them to commence heaving anew the word was passed to the crew that it was now for doubloons and they went to the bars and handspikes notwithstanding the sun had set cheerfully and cheering  all spikes expedients admirably answered the intended purposes the stern of the schooner rose gradually and at each lift the heels of the shores dropped in more perpendicularly carried by the weights attached to them and the spars stood as firm props to secure all that was gained in a quarter of an hour most of that part of the stern which was within five or six feet of the tafferel rose above the water coming fairly in view  spike now shouted to the men to pall then he directed the falls to be very gradually eased off in order to ascertain if the shores would still do their duty the experiment was successful and presently the wreck stood in its upright position sustained entirely by the two spars as the last were now nearly perpendicular they were capable of bearing a very heavy weight and spike was so anxious to relieve his own brig from the strain she had been enduring that he ordered the lashings of the blocks to be loosened trusting to his shores to do their duty against this confidence the boatswain ventured a remonstrance but the gold was too near to allow the captain to listen or reply the carpenter was ordered over on the wreck with his tools while spike the señor montefalderon and two men to row the boat and keep it steady went in the yawl to watch the progress of the work jack tier was ordered to stand in the chains and to point out as nearly as possible the place where the carpenter was to cut  when all was ready spike gave the word and the chips began to fly by the use of the saw and the axe a hole large enough to admit two or three men at a time was soon made in the deck and the sounding for the muchcoveted locker commenced by this time it was quite dark and a lantern was passed down from the brig in order to enable those who searched for the locker to see spike had breasted the yawl close up to the hole where it was held by the men while the captain himself passed the lantern and his own head into the opening to reconnoitre  ay its all right cried the voice of the captain from within his celllike cavity i can just see the lid of the locker that jack means and we shall soon have what we are ater carpenter you may as well slip off your clothes at once and go inside i will point out to you the place where to find the locker youre certain jack it was the starboard locker  ay ay sir the starboard locker and no other  the carpenter had soon got into the hole as naked as when he was born it was a gloomylooking place for a man to descend into at that hour the light from the lantern being no great matter and half the time it was shaded by the manner in which spike was compelled to hold it  take care and get a good footing carpenter said the captain in a kinder tone than common before you let go with your hands but i suppose you can swim as a matter of course  no sir not a strokei never could make out in the water at all  have the more care then had i known as much i would have sent another hand down but mind your footing more to the left manmore to the left that is the lid of the lockeryour hand is on it why do you not open it  it is swelled by the water sir and will need a chisel or some tool of that sort just call out to one of the men sir if you please to pass me a chisel from my toolchest a good stout one will be best  this order was given and during the delay it caused spike encouraged the carpenter to be cool and above all to mind his footing his own eagerness to get at the gold was so great that he kept his head in at the hole completely cutting off the man within from all communication with the outer world  whats the matter with you demanded spike a little sternly you shiver and yet the water cannot be cold in this latitude no my hand makes it just the right warmth to be pleasant  its not the water captain spikei wish they would come with the chisel did you hear nothing sir im certain i did  hearwhat is there here to be heard unless there may be some fish inside thrashing about to get out of the vessels hold  i am sure i heard something like a groan captain spike i wish you would let me come out sir and ill go for the chisel myself them men will never find it  stay where you are coward are you afraid of dead men standing against walls stay where you are ah here is the chiselnow let us see what you can do with it  i am certain i heard another groan captain spike i cannot work sir im of no use heredo let me come out sir and send a hand down that can swim  spike uttered a terrible malediction on the miserable carpenter one we do not care to repeat then he cast the light of the lantern full in the mans face the quivering flesh the pallid face and the whole countenance wrought up almost to a frenzy of terror astonished as well as alarmed him  what ails you man said the captain in a voice of thunder clap in the chisel or ill hurl you off into the water there is nothing here dead or alive to harm ye  the groan siri hear it again do let me come out captain spike  spike himself this time heard what even he took for a groan it came from the depths of the vessel apparently and was sufficiently distinct and audible astonished yet appalled he thrust his shoulders into the aperture as if to dare the demon that tormented him and was met by the carpenter endeavouring to escape in the struggle that ensued the lantern was dropped into the water leaving the halffrenzied combatants contending in the dark the groan was renewed when the truth flashed on the minds of both  the shores the shores exclaimed the carpenter from within the shores repeated spike throwing himself back into the boat and shouting to his men to see all clear of the wreck the grating of one of the shores on the coral beneath was now heard plainer than ever and the lower extremity slipped outward not astern as had been apprehended letting the wreck slowly settle to the bottom again one piercing shriek arose from the narrow cavity within then the gurgling of water into the aperture was heard when naught of sound could be distinguished but the sullen and steady wash of the waves of the gulf over the rocks of the reef  the impression made by this accident was most profound a fatality appeared to attend the brig and most of the men connected the sad occurrence of this night with the strange appearance of the previous evening even the señor montefalderon was disposed to abandon the doubloons and he urged spike to make the best of his way for yucatan to seek a friendly harbour the captain wavered but avarice was too strong a passion in him to be easily diverted from its object and he refused to give up his purpose  as the wreck was entirely free from the brig when it went down for the third time no injury was sustained by the last on this occasion by renewing the lashings everything would be ready to begin the work anewand this spike was resolved to attempt in the morning the men were too much fatigued and it was too dark to think of pushing matters any further that night and it was very questionable whether they could have been got to work orders were consequently given for all hands to turn in the captain relieved by don juan and jack tier having arranged to keep the watches of the night  this is a sad accident don esteban observed the mexican as he and spike paced the quarterdeck together just before the last turned in a sad accident my miserable schooner seems to be deserted by its patron saint then your poor carpenter  yes he was a good fellow enough with a saw or an adze answered spike yawning but we get used to such things at sea its neither more nor less than a carpenter expended good night señor don wan in the morning well be at that gold agin  chapter vi    shes in a scene of natures war   the winds and waters are at strife   and both with her contending for   the brittle thread of human life  miss gould  spike was sleeping hard in his berth quite early on the following morning before the return of light indeed when he suddenly started up rubbed his eyes and sprang upon deck like a man alarmed he had heard or fancied he had heard a cry a voice once well known and listened to seemed to call him in the very portals of his ear at first he had listened to its words in wonder entranced like the bird by the snake the tones recalling scenes and persons that had once possessed a strong control over his rude feelings presently the voice became harsher in its utterance and it said  stephen spike awake the hour is getting late and you have enemies nearer to you than you imagine awake stephen awake  when the captain was on his feet and had plunged his head into a basin of water that stood ready for him in the stateroom he could not have told for his life whether he had been dreaming or waking whether what he had heard was the result of a feverish imagination or of the laws of nature the call haunted him all that morning or until events of importance so pressed upon him as to draw his undivided attention to them alone  it was not yet day the men were still in heavy sleep lying about the decks for they avoided the small and crowded forecastle in that warm climate and the night was apparently at its deepest hour spike walked forward to look for the man charged with the anchorwatch it proved to be jack tier who was standing near the galley his arms folded as usual apparently watching the few signs of approaching day that were beginning to be apparent in the western sky the captain was in none of the best humours with the stewards assistant but jack had unaccountably got an ascendency over his commander which it was certainly very unusual for any subordinate in the swash to obtain spike had deferred more to mulford than to any mate he had ever before employed but this was the deference due to superior information manners and origin it was commonplace if not vulgar whereas the ascendency obtained by little jack tier was even to its subject entirely inexplicable he was unwilling to admit it to himself in the most secret manner though he had begun to feel it on all occasions which brought them in contact and to submit to it as a thing not to be averted  jack tier demanded the captain now that he found himself once more alone with the other desirous of obtaining his opinion on a point that harassed him though he knew not why jack tier answer me one thing do you believe that we saw the form of a dead or of a living man at the foot of the lighthouse  the dead are never seen leaning against walls in that manner stephen spike answered jack coolly not even taking the trouble to uncoil his arms what you saw was a living man and you would do well to be on your guard against him harry mulford is not your friendand there is reason for it  harry mulford and living how can that be jack you know the port in which he chose to run  i know the rock on which you chose to abandon him captain spike  if so how could he be living and at the dry tortugas the thing is impossible  the thing is so you saw harry mulford living and well and ready to hunt you to the gallows beware of him then and beware of his handsome wife  wife the fellow has no wifehe has always professed to be a single man  the man is marriedand i bid you beware of his handsome wife she too will be a witness agin you  this will be news then for rose budd i shall delight in telling it to her at least  t will be no news to rose budd she was present at the wedding and will not be taken by surprise rose loves harry too well to let him marry and she not present at the wedding  jack you talk strangely what is the meaning of all this i am captain of this craft and will not be trifled withtell me at once your meaning fellow  my meaning is simple enough and easily told rose budd is the wife of harry mulford  youre dreaming fellow or are wishing to trifle with me  it may be a dream but it is one that will turn out to be true if they have found the poughkeepsie sloopofwar as i make no doubt they have by this time mulford and rose are man and wife  fool you know not what you say rose is at this moment in her berth sick at heart on account of the young gentleman who preferred to live on the florida reef rather than to sail in the molly  rose is not in her berth sick or well neither is she on board this brig at all she went off in the lighthouse boat to deliver her lover from the naked rockand well did she succeed in so doing god was of her side stephen spike and a body seldom fails with such a friend to support one  spike was astounded at these words and not less so at the cool and confident manner with which they were pronounced jack spoke in a certain dogmatical oracular manner it is true one that might have lessened his authority with a person over whom he had less influence but this in no degree diminished its effect on spike on the contrary it even disposed the captain to yield an implicit faith to what he heard and all so much the more because the facts he was told appeared of themselves to be nearly impossible it was half a minute before he had sufficiently recovered from his surprise to continue the discourse  the lighthouse boat spike then slowly repeated why fellow you told me the lighthouse boat went adrift from your own hands  so it did answered jack coolly since i cast off the painterand what is more went in it  you this is impossible you are telling me a fabricated lie if you had gone away in that boat how could you now be here no noit is a miserable lie and rose is below  go and look into her stateroom and satisfy yourself with your own eyes  spike did as was suggested he went below took a lamp that was always suspended lighted in the main cabin and without ceremony proceeded to roses stateroom where he soon found that the bird had really flown a direful execration followed this discovery one so loud as to awaken mrs budd and biddy determined not to do things by halves he broke open the door of the widows stateroom and ascertained that the person he sought was not there a fierce explosion of oaths and denunciations followed which produced an answer in the customary screams in the midst of this violent scene however questions were put and answers obtained that not only served to let the captain know that jack had told him nothing but truth but to put an end to everything like amicable relations between himself and the relict of his old commander until this explosion appearances had been observed between them but from that moment there must necessarily be an end of all professions of even civility spike was never particularly refined in his intercourse with females but he now threw aside even its pretension his rage was so great that he totally forgot his manhood and lavished on both mrs budd and biddy epithets that were altogether inexcusable and many of which it will not do to repeat weak and silly as was the widow she was not without spirit and on this occasion she was indisposed to submit to all this unmerited abuse in silence biddy as usual took her cue from her mistress and between the two their part of the wordy conflict was kept up with a very respectable degree of animation  i know youi know you now screamed the widow at the tope of her voice and you can no longer deceive me unworthy son of neptune as you are you are unfit to be a lubber and would be logbooked for an ornary by every gentleman on board ship you a fulljiggered seaman no you are not even halfjiggered sir and i tell you so to your face  yes and it is nt half that might be tould the likes of yees put in biddy as her mistress stopped to breathe and its miss rose youd have for a wife when biddy noon would be too good for ye we knows ye and all about ye and can give yer history as complate from the day ye was born down to the prisent moment and not find a good word to say in yer favour in all that timeand a precious time it is too for a gentleman that would marry pretthy young miss rose och i scorn to look at ye yer so ugly  and trying to persuade me you were a friend of my poor dear mr budd whose shoe you are unworthy to touch and who had the heart and soul for the noble profession you disgrace cut in the widow the moment biddy gave her a chance by pausing to make a wry face as she pronounced the word ugly i now believe you capasided them poor mexicans in order to get their money and the moment we cast anchor in a roadside ill go ashore and complain of you for murder i will  do missus dear and ill be your bail will i and swear to all that happened and more too och yer a wretch to wish to be the husband of miss rose and she so young and pretthy and you so ould and ugly  come awaycome away stephen spike and do not stand wrangling with women when you and your brig and all that belongs to you are in danger called out jack tier from the companionway day is come and what is much worse for you your most dangerous enemy is coming with it  spike was almost livid with rage and ready to burst out in awful maledictions but at this summons he sprang to the ladder and was on deck in a moment at first he felt a strong disposition to wreak his vengeance on tier but fortunately for the latter as the captains foot touched the quarterdeck his eye fell on the poughkeepsie then within half a league of the swash standing in toward the reef though fully half a mile to leeward this spectre drove all other subjects from his mind leaving the captain of the swash in the only character in which he could be said to be respectable or that of a seaman almost instinctively he called all hands then he gave one brief minute to a survey of his situation  it was indeed time for the swash to be moving there she lay with three anchors down including that of the schooner all she had in fact with the exception of her best bower and one kedge with the purchases aloft in readiness for hooking on to the wreck and all the extra securities up that had been given to the masts as for the sloopofwar she was under the very same canvas as that with which she had come out from the dry tortugas or her three topsails spanker and jib but most of her other sails were loose even to her royals and flyingjibs though closely gathered into their spars by means of the running gear in a word every sailor would know at a glance that the ship was merely waiting for the proper moment to spread her wings when she would be flying through the water at the top of her speed the weather looked dirty and the wind was gradually increasing threatening to blow heavily as the day advanced  unshackle unshackle shouted spike to the boatswain who was the first man that appeared on deck the bloody sloopofwar is upon us and there is not a moment to lose we must get the brig clear of the ground in the shortest way we can and abandon everything unshackle and cast off forard and aft men  a few minutes of almost desperate exertion succeeded no men work like sailors when the last are in a hurry their efforts being directed to counteracting squalls and avoiding emergencies of the most pressing character thus was it now with the crew of the swash the clanking of chains lasted but a minute when the parts attached to the anchors were thrust through the hawseholes or were dropped into the water from other parts of the brig this at once released the vessel though a great deal remained to be done to clear her for working and to put her in the best trim  away with this outhauler again shouted spike casting loose the mainbrails as he did so loose the jibs  all went on at once and the swash moved away from the grave of the poor carpenter with the ease and facility of motion that marked all her evolutions then the topsail was let fall and presently all the upper squaresails were sheeted home and hoisted and the foretack was hauled aboard the molly was soon alive and jumping into the seas that met her with more power than was common as she drew out from under the shelter of the reef into rough water from the time when spike gave his first order to that when all his canvas was spread was just seven minutes  the poughkeepsie with her vastly superior crew was not idle the while although the watch below was not disturbed she tacked beautifully and stood off the reef in a line parallel to the course of the brig and distant from her about half a mile then sail was made her tacks having been boarded in stays spike knew the play of his craft was short legs for she was so nimble in her movements that he believed she could go about in half the time that would be required for a vessel of the poughkeepsies length ready about was his cry therefore when less than a mile distant from the reefready about and let her go round round the molly did go like a top being full on the other tack in just fiftysix seconds the movement of the corvette was more stately and somewhat more deliberate still she stayed beautifully and both spike and the boatswain shook their heads as they saw her coming into the wind with her sails all lifting and the sheets flowing  that fellow will forereach a cables length before he gets about exclaimed spike he will prove too much for us at this sport keep her away my mankeep the brig away for the passage we must run through the reef instead of trusting ourselves to our heels in open water  the brig was kept away accordingly and sheets were eased off and braces just touched to meet the new line of sailing as the wind stood it was possible to lay through the passage on an easy bowline though the breeze which was getting to be fresher than spike wished it to be promised to haul more to the southward of east as the day advanced nevertheless this was the swashs best point of sailing and all on board of her had strong hopes of her being too much for her pursuer could she maintain it until this feeling began to diffuse itself in the brig not a countenance was to be seen on her decks that did not betray intense anxiety but now something like grim smiles passed among the crew as their craft seemed rather to fly than force her way through the water toward the entrance of the passage so often adverted to in this narrative  on the other hand the poughkeepsie was admirably sailed and handled everybody was now on deck and the first lieutenant had taken the trumpet captain mull was a man of method and a thorough manofwars man whatever he did was done according to rule and with great system just as the swash was about to enter the passage the drum of the poughkeepsie beat to quarters no sooner were the men mustered in the leeward or the starboard batteries than orders were sent to cast loose the guns and to get them ready for service owing to the more leeward position of his vessel and to the fact that she always headreached so much in stays captain mull knew that she would not lose much by luffing into the wind or by making halfboards while he might gain everything by one welldirected shot  the strife commenced by the sloopofwar firing her weather bowgun singleshotted at the swash no damage was done though the foreyard of the brig had a very narrow escape this experiment was repeated three times without even a ropeyarn being carried away though the gun was pointed by wallace himself and well pointed too but it is possible for a shot to come very near its object and still to do no injury such was the fact on this occasion though the ships gentleman was a good deal mortified by the result men look so much at success as the test of merit that few pause to inquire into the reasons of failures though it frequently happens that adventures prosper by means of their very blunders captain mull now determined on a halfboard for his ship was more to leeward than he desired directions were given to the officers in the batteries to be deliberate and the helm was put down as the ship shot into the wind each gun was fired as it could be brought to bear until the last of them all was discharged then the course of the vessel was changed the helm being righted before the ship had lost her way and the sloopofwar fell off again to her course  all this was done in such a short period of time as scarcely to cause the poughkeepsie to lose anything while it did the swash the most serious injury the guns had been directed at the brigs spars and sails captain mull desiring no more than to capture his chase and the destruction they produced aloft was such as to induce spike and his men at first to imagine that the whole hamper above their heads was about to come clattering down on deck one shot carried away all the weather foretopmast rigging of the brig and would no doubt have brought about the loss of the mast if another that almost instantly succeeded it had not cut the spar itself in two bringing down as a matter of course everything above it nearly half of the mainmast was gouged out of that spar and the gaff was taken fairly out of its jaws the foreyard was cut in the slings and various important ropes were carried away in different parts of the vessel  flight under such circumstances was impossible unless some extraordinary external assistance was to be obtained this spike saw at once and he had recourse to the only expedient that remained which might possibly yet save him the guns were still belching forth their smoke and flames when he shouted out the order to put the helm hard up the width of the passage in which the vessels were was not so great but that he might hope to pass across it and to enter a channel among the rocks which was favourably placed for such a purpose ere the sloopofwar could overtake him whither that channel led what water it possessed or whether it were not a shallow cul de sac were all facts of which spike was ignorant the circumstances however would not admit of an alternative  happily for the execution of spikes present design nothing from aloft had fallen into the water to impede the brigs way forward in particular she seemed all wreck her foreyard having come down altogether so as to encumber the forecastle while her topmast with its dependent spars and gear was suspended but a short distance above still nothing had gone over the side so as actually to touch the water and the craft obeyed her helm as usual away she went then for the lateral opening in the reef just mentioned driven ahead by the pressure of a strong breeze on her sails which still offered large surfaces to the wind at a rapid rate instead of keeping away to follow the poughkeepsie maintained her luff and just as the swash entered the unknown passage into which she was blindly plunging the sloopofwar was about a quarter of a mile to windward and standing directly across her stern nothing would have been easier now than for captain mull to destroy his chase but humanity prevented his firing he knew that her career must be short and he fully expected to see her anchor when it would be easy for him to take possession with his boats with this expectation indeed he shortened sail furling topgallantsails and hauling up his courage by this time the wind had so much freshened as to induce him to think of putting in a reef and the step now taken had a double object in view  to the surprise of all on board the manofwar the brig continued on until she was fully a mile distant finding her way deeper and deeper among the mazes of the reef without meeting with any impediment this fact induced captain mull to order his paixhans to throw their shells beyond her by way of a hint to anchor while the guns were getting ready spike stood on boldly knowing it was neck or nothing and beginning to feel a faint revival of hope as he found himself getting further and further from his pursuers and the rocks not fetching him up even the men who had begun to murmur at what seemed to them to be risking too much partook in a slight degree of the same feeling and began to execute the order they had received to try to get the launch into the water with some appearance of an intention to succeed previously the work could scarcely be said to go on at all but two or three of the older seamen now bestirred themselves and suggestions were made and attended to that promised results but it was no easy thing to get the launch out of a halfrigged brig that had lost her foreyard and which carried nothing square abaft a derrick was used in common to lift the stern of the boat but a derrick would now be useless aft without an assistant forward while these things were in discussion under the superintendence of the boatswain and spike was standing between the knightheads conning the craft the sloopofwar let fly the first of her hollow shot down came the hurtling mass upon the swash keeping every head elevated and all eyes looking for the dark object as it went booming through the air above their heads the shot passed fully a mile to leeward where it exploded this great range had been given to the first shot with a view to admonish the captain how long he must continue under the guns of the ship and as advice to come to the second gun followed immediately its shot was seem to ricochet directly in a line with the brig making leaps of about half a mile in length it struck the water about fifty yards astern of the vessel bounded directly over her decks passing through the mainsail and some of the fallen hamper forward and exploded about a hundred yards ahead as usually happens with such projectiles most of the fragments were either scattered laterally or went on impelled by the original momentum  the effect of this last gun on the crew of the swash was instantaneous and deep the faint gleamings of hope vanished at once and a lively consciousness of the desperate nature of their condition succeeded in every mind the launch was forgotten and after conferring together for a moment the men went in a body with the boatswain at their head to the forecastle and offered a remonstrance to their commander on the subject of holding out any longer under circumstances so very hazardous and which menaced their lives in so many different ways spike listened to them with eyes that fairly glared with fury he ordered them back to their duty in a voice of thunder tapping the breast of his jacket where he was known to carry revolvers with a significance that could convey but one meaning  it is wonderful the ascendency that men sometimes obtain over their fellows by means of character the habits of command and obedience and intimidation spike was a stern disciplinarian relying on that and ample pay for the unlimited control he often found it necessary to exercise over his crew on the present occasion his people were profoundly alarmed but habitual deference and submission to their leader counteracted the feeling and held them in suspense they were fully aware of the nature of the position they occupied in a legal sense and were deeply reluctant to increase the appearances of crime but most of them had been extricated from so many grave difficulties in former instances by the coolness nerve and readiness of the captain that a latent ray of hope was perhaps dimly shining in the rude breast of every old seadog among them as a consequence of these several causes they abandoned their remonstrance for the moment at least and made a show of returning to their duty though it was in a sullen and moody manner  it was easier however to make a show of hoisting out the launch than to effect the object this was soon made apparent on trial and spike himself gave the matter up he ordered the yawl to be lowered got alongside and to be prepared for the reception of the crew by putting into it a small provision of food and water all this time the brig was rushing madly to leeward among rocks and breakers without any other guide than that which the visible dangers afforded spike knew no more where he was going than the meanest man in his vessel his sole aim was to get away from his pursuers and to save his neck from the rope he magnified the danger of punishment that he really ran for he best knew the extent and nature of his crimes of which the few that have been laid before the reader while they might have been amongst the most prominent as viewed through the statutes and international law were far from the gravest he had committed in the eyes of morals  about this time the señor montefalderon went forward to confer with spike the calmness of this gentlemans demeanour the simplicity and coolness of his movements denoted a conscience that saw no particular ground for alarm he wished to escape captivity that he might continue to serve his country but no other apprehension troubled him  do you intend to trust yourself in the yawl don esteban demanded the mexican quietly if so is she not too small to contain so many as we shall make altogether  spikes answer was given in a low voice and it evidently came from a very husky throat  speak lower don wan he said the boat would be greatly overloaded with all hands in it especially among the breakers and blowing as it does but we may leave some of the party behind  the brig must go on the rocks sooner or later don esteban when she does she will go to pieces in an hour  i expect to hear her strike every minute señor the moment she does we must be off i have had my eye on that ship for some time expecting to see her lower her cutters and gigs to board us you will not be out of the way don wan but there is no need of being talkative on the subject of our escape  spike now turned his back on the mexican looking anxiously ahead with the desire to get as far into the reef as possible with his brig which he conned with great skill and coolness the señor montefalderon left him with the chivalry and consideration of a man and a gentleman he went in quest of mrs budd and biddy a hint sufficed for them and gathering together a few necessaries they were in the yawl in the next three minutes this movement was unseen by spike or he might have prevented it his eyes were now riveted on the channel ahead it had been fully his original intention to make off in the boat the instant the brig struck abandoning not only don juan with mrs budd and biddy to their fates but most of the crew a private order had been given to the boatswain and three of the ablestbodied among the seamen each and all of whom kept the secret with religious fidelity as it was believed their own personal safety might be connected with the success of this plan  nothing is so contagious as alarm it requires not only great natural steadiness of nerve but much acquired firmness to remain unmoved when sudden terror has seized on the minds of those around us habitual respect had prevented the crew from interfering with the movements of the mexican who not only descended into the boat with his female companions uninterrupted but also took with him the little bag of doubloons which fell to his share from the first raising of the schooner josh and jack tier assisted in getting mrs budd and biddy over the side and both took their own places in the yawl as soon as this pious duty was discharged this served as a hint to others near at hand and man after man left his work to steal into the yawl until every living being had disappeared from the deck of the swash spike himself excepted the man at the wheel had been the last to desert his post nor would he have done so then but for a signal from the boatswain with whom he was a favourite  it is certain there was a secret desire among the people of the swash who were now crowded into a boat not large enough to contain more than half their number with safety to push off from the brigs side and abandon her commander and owner to his fate all had passed so soon however and events succeeded each other with so much rapidity that little time was given for consultation habit kept them in their places though the appearances around them were strong motives for taking care of themselves  notwithstanding the time necessary to relate the foregoing events a quarter of an hour had not elapsed from the moment when the swash entered this unknown channel among the rocks ere she struck no sooner was her helm deserted than she broachedto and spike was in the act of denouncing the steerage ignorant of its cause when the brig was thrown broadsideto on a sharp angular bed of rocks it was fortunate for the boat and all in it that it was brought to leeward by the broachingto of the vessel and that the water was still sufficiently deep around them to prevent the waves from breaking breakers there were however in thousands on every side and the seamen understood that their situation was almost desperately perilous without shipwreck coming to increase the danger  the storm itself was scarcely more noisy and boisterous than was spike when he ascertained the manner in which his people had behaved at first he believed it was their plan to abandon him to his fate but on rushing to the leegangway don juan montefalderon assured him that no such intention existed and that he would not allow the boat to be cast off until the captain was received on board this brief respite gave spike a moment to care for his portion of the doubloons and he rushed to his stateroom to secure them together with his quadrant  the grinding of the brigs bottom on the coral announced a speedy breaking up of the craft while her commander was thus employed so violent were some of the shocks with which she came down on the hard bed in which she was now cradled that spike expected to see her burst asunder while he was yet on her decks the cracking of timbers told him that all was over with the swash nor had he got back as far as the gangway with his prize before he saw plainly that the vessel had broken her back as it is termed and that her planksheer was opening in a way that threatened to permit a separation of the craft into two sections one forward and the other aft notwithstanding all these portentous proofs that the minutes of the molly were numbered and the danger that existed of his being abandoned by his crew spike paused a moment ere he went over the vessels side to take a hasty survey of the reef his object was to get a general idea of the position of the breakers with a view to avoid them as much of the interest of that which is to succeed is connected with these particular dangers it may be well to explain their character along with a few other points of a similar bearing  the brig had gone ashore fully two miles within the passage she had entered and which indeed terminated at the very spot where she had struck the poughkeepsie was standing off and on in the main channel with her boats in the water evidently preparing to carry the brig in that mode as for the breakers they whitened the surface of the ocean in all directions around the wreck far as the eye could reach but in two the passage in which the poughkeepsie was standing to and fro was clear of them of course and about a mile and a half to the northward spike saw that he should be in open water or altogether on the northern side of the reef could he only get there the gravest dangers would exist in the passage which led among breakers on all sides and very possibly among rocks so near the surface as absolutely to obstruct the way in one sense however the breakers were useful by avoiding them as much as possible and by keeping in the unbroken water the boat would be running in the channels of the reef and consequently would be the safer the result of the survey short as it was and it did not last a minute was to give spike something like a plan and when he went over the side and got into the boat it was with a determination to work his way out of the reef to its northern edge as soon as possible and then to skirt it as near as he could in his flight toward the dry tortugas  chapter vii    the screams of rage the groan the strife   the blow the grasp the horrid cry   the panting throttled prayer for life   the dyings heaving sigh   the murderers curse the dead mans fixed still glare   and fears and deaths cold sweatthey all are there  matthew lee  it was high time that captain spike should arrive when his foot touched the bottom of the yawl the men were getting impatient and anxious to the last degree and the power of señor montefalderon to control them was lessening each instant they heard the rending of timber and the grinding on the coral even more distinctly than the captain himself and feared that the brig would break up while they lay alongside of her and crush them amid the ruins then the spray of the seas that broke over the weather side of the brig fell like rain upon them and everybody in the boat was already as wet as if exposed to a violent shower it was well therefore for spike that he descended into the boat as he did for another minutes delay might have brought about his own destruction  spike felt a chill at his heart when he looked about him and saw the condition of the yawl so crowded were the sternsheets into which he had descended that it was with difficulty he found room to place his feet it being his intention to steer jack was ordered to get into the eyes of the boat in order to give him a seat the thwarts were crowded and three or four of the people had placed themselves in the very bottom of the little craft in order to be as much as possible out of the way as well as in readiness to bail out water so seriously indeed were all the seamen impressed with the gravity of this last duty that nearly every man had taken with him some vessel fit for such a purpose rowing was entirely out of the question there being no space for the movement of the arms the yawl was too low in the water moreover for such an operation in so heavy a sea in all eighteen persons were squeezed into a little craft that would have been sufficiently loaded for moderate weather at sea with its four oarsmen and as many sitters in the sternsheets with perhaps one in the eyes to bring her more on an even keel in other words she had twice the weight in her in living freight that it would have been thought prudent to receive in so small a craft in an ordinary time in or out of a port in addition to the human beings enumerated there was a good deal of baggage nearly every individual having had the forethought to provide a few clothes for a change the food and water did not amount to much no more having been provided than enough for the purposes of the captain together with the four men with whom it had been his intention to abandon the brig the effect of all this cargo was to bring the yawl quite low in the water and every seafaring man in her had the greatest apprehensions about her being able to float at all when she got out from under the lee of the swash or into the troubled water try it she must however and spike in a reluctant and hesitating manner gave the final order to shove off  the yawl carried a lugg as is usually the case with boats at sea and the first blast of the breeze upon it satisfied spike that his present enterprise was one of the most dangerous of any in which he had ever been engaged the puffs of wind were quite as much as the boat would bear but this he did not mind as he was running off before it and there was little danger of the yawl capsizing with such a weight in her it was also an advantage to have swift way on to prevent the combing waves from shooting into the boat though the wind itself scarce outstrips the send of the sea in a stiff blow as the yawl cleared the brig and began to feel the united power of the wind and waves the following short dialogue occurred between the boatswain and spike  i dare not keep my eyes off the breakers ahead the captain commenced and must trust to you strand to report what is going on among the manofwars men what is the ship about  reefing her topsails just now sir all three are on the caps and the vessel is layingto in a manner  and her boats  i see none siray ay there they come from alongside of her in a little fleet there are four of them sir and all are coming down before the wind wing and wing carrying their luggs reefed  ours ought to be reefed by rights too but we dare not stop to do it and these infernal combing seas seem ready to glance aboard us with all the way we can gather stand by to bail men we must pass through a strip of white waterthere is no help for it god send that we go clear of the rocks  all this was fearfully true the adventurers were not yet more than a cables length from the brig and they found themselves so completely environed with the breakers as to be compelled to go through them no man in his senses would ever have come into such a place at all except in the most unavoidable circumstances and it was with a species of despair that the seamen of the yawl now saw their little craft go plunging into the foam  but spike neglected no precaution that experience or skill could suggest he had chosen his spot with coolness and judgment as the boat rose on the seas he looked eagerly ahead and by giving it a timely sheer he hit a sort of channel where there was sufficient water to carry them clear of the rock and where the breakers were less dangerous than in the shoaler places the passage lasted about a minute and so serious was it that scarce an individual breathed until it was effected no human skill could prevent the water from combing in over the gunwales and when the danger was passed the yawl was a third filled with water there was no time or place to pause but on the little craft was dragged almost gunwale to the breeze coming against the lugg in puffs that threatened to take the mast out of her all hands were bailing and even biddy used her hands to aid in throwing out the water  this is no time to hesitate men said spike sternly everything must go overboard but the food and water away with them at once and with a will  it was a proof how completely all hands were alarmed by this the first experiment in the breakers that not a man stayed his hand a single moment but each threw into the sea without an instant of hesitation every article he had brought with him and had hoped to save biddy parted with the carpetbag and señor montefalderon feeling the importance of example committed to the deep a small writingdesk that he had placed on his knees the doubloons alone remained safe in a little locker where spike had deposited them along with his own  what news astern boatswain demanded the captain as soon as this imminent danger was passed absolutely afraid to turn his eyes off the dangers ahead for a single instant how come on the manofwars men  they are running down in a body toward the wreck though one of their boats does seem to be sheering out of the line as if getting into our wake it is hard to say sir for they are still a good bit to windward of the wreck  and the molly strand  why sir the molly seems to be breaking up fast as well as i can see she has broke in two just abaft the forechains and cannot hold together in any shape at all many minutes longer  this information drew a deep groan from spike and the eye of every seaman in the boat was turned in melancholy on the object they were so fast leaving behind them the yawl could not be said to be sailing very rapidly considering the power of the wind which was a little gale for she was much too deep for that but she left the wreck so fast as already to render objects on board her indistinct everybody saw that like an overburthened steed she had more to get along with than she could well bear and dependent as seamen usually are on the judgment and orders of their superiors even in the direst emergencies the least experienced man in her saw that their chances of final escape from drowning were of the most doubtful nature the men looked at each other in a way to express their feelings and the moment seemed favourable to spike to confer with his confidential seadogs in private but more white water was also ahead and it was necessary to pass through it since no opening was visible by which to avoid it he deferred his purpose consequently until this danger was escaped  on this occasion spike saw but little opportunity to select a place to get through the breakers though the spot as a whole was not of the most dangerous kind the reader will understand that the preservation of the boat at all in white water was owing to the circumstance that the rocks all around it lay so near the surface of the sea as to prevent the possibility of agitating the element very seriously and to the fact that she was near the lee side of the reef had the breakers been of the magnitude of those which are seen where the deep rolling billows of the ocean first meet the weather side of shoals or rocks a craft of that size and so loaded could not possibly have passed the first line of white water without filling as it was however the breakers she had to contend with were sufficiently formidable and they brought with them the certainty that the boat was in imminent danger of striking the bottom at any moment places like those in which mulford had waded on the reef while it was calm would now have proved fatal to the strongest frame since human powers were insufficient long to withstand the force of such waves as did glance over even these shallows  look out cried spike as the boat again plunged in among the white water keep bailing menkeep bailing  the men did bail and the danger was over almost as soon as encountered something like a cheer burst out of the chest of spike when he saw deeper water around him and fancied he could now trace a channel that would carry him quite beyond the extent of the reef it was arrested only half uttered however by a communication from the boatswain who sat on a midship thwart his arms folded and his eye on the brig and the boats  there goes the mollys masts sir both have gone together and as good sticks was they before them bombshells passed through our rigging as was ever stepped in a keelson  the cheer was changed to something like a groan while a murmur of regret passed through the boat  what news from the manofwars men boatswain do they still stand down on a mere wreck  no sir they seem to give it up and are getting out their oars to pull back to their ship a pretty time theyll have of it too the cutter that gets to windward half a mile in an hour agin such a sea and such a breeze must be well pulled and better steered one chap however sir seems to hold on  spike now ventured to look behind him commanding an experienced hand to take the helm in order to do this he was obliged to change places with the man he had selected to come aft which brought him on a thwart alongside of the boatswain and one or two other of his confidants here a whispered conference took place which lasted several minutes spike appearing to be giving instructions to the men  by this time the yawl was more than a mile from the wreck all the manofwar boats but one had lowered their sails and were pulling slowly and with great labour back toward the ship the cutter that kept on evidently laying her course after the yawl instead of standing on toward the wreck the brig was breaking up fast with every probability that nothing would be left of her in a few more minutes as for the yawl while clear of the white water it got along without receiving many seas aboard though the men in its bottom were kept bailing without intermission it appeared to spike that so long as they remained on the reef and could keep clear of breakersa most difficult thing howeverthey should fare better than if in deeper water where the swell of the sea and the combing of the waves menaced so small and so deeploaded a craft with serious danger as it was two or three men could barely keep the boat clear working incessantly and much of the time with a foot or two of water in her  josh and simon had taken their seats side by side with that sort of dependence and submission that causes the american black to abstain from mingling with the whites more than might appear seemly they were squeezed on to one end of the thwart by a couple of robust old seadogs who were two of the very men with whom spike had been in consultation beneath that very thwart was stowed another confidant to whom communications had also been made these men had sailed long in the swash and having been picked up in various ports from time to time as the brig had wanted hands they were of nearly as many different nations as they were persons spike had obtained a great ascendency over them by habit and authority and his suggestions were now received as a sort of law as soon as the conference was ended the captain returned to the helm  a minute more passed during which the captain was anxiously surveying the reef ahead and the state of things astern ahead was more white waterthe last before they should get clear of the reef and astern it was now settled that the cutter that held on through the dangers of the place was in chase of the yawl that mulford was in her spike made no doubt and the thought embittered even his present calamities but the moment had arrived for something decided the white water ahead was much more formidable than any they had passed and the boldest seamen there gazed at it with dread spike made a sign to the boatswain and commenced the execution of his dire project  i say you josh called out the captain in the authoritative tones that are so familiar to all on board a ship pull in that fender that is dragging alongside  josh leaned over the gunwale and reported that there was no fender out a malediction followed also so familiar to those acquainted with ships and the black was told to look again this time as had been expected the negro leaned with his head and body far over the side of the yawl to look for that which had no existence when two of the men beneath the thwart shoved his legs after them josh screamed as he found himself going into the water with a sort of confused consciousness of the truth and spike called out to simon to catch hold of his brothernigger the cook bent forward to obey when a similar assault on his legs from beneath the thwart sent him headlong after josh one of the younger seamen who was not in the secret sprang up to rescue simon who grasped his extended hand when the too generous fellow was pitched headlong from the boat  all this occurred in less than ten seconds of time and so unexpectedly and naturally that not a soul beyond those who were in the secret had the least suspicion it was anything but an accident some water was shipped of necessity but the boat was soon bailed free as for the victims of this vile conspiracy they disappeared amid the troubled waters of the reef struggling with each other each and all met the common fate so much the sooner from the manner in which they impeded their own efforts  the yawl was now relieved from about five hundred pounds of the weight it had carriedsimon weighing two hundred alone and the youngish seaman being large and full so intense does human selfishness get to be in moments of great emergency that it is to be feared most of those who remained secretly rejoiced that they were so far benefited by the loss of their fellows the señor montefalderon was seated on the aftermost thwart with his legs in the sternsheets and consequently with his back toward the negroes and he fully believed that what had happened was purely accidental  let us lower our sail don esteban he cried eagerly and save the poor fellows  something very like a sneer gleamed on the dark countenance of the captain but it suddenly changed to a look of assent  good he said hastilyspring forward don wan and lower the sailstand by the oars men  without pausing to reflect the generoushearted mexican stepped on a thwart and began to walk rapidly forward steadying himself by placing his hands on the heads of the men he was suffered to get as far as the second thwart or past most of the conspirators when his legs were seized from behind the truth now flashed on him and grasping two of the men in his front who knew nothing of spikes dire scheme he endeavoured to save himself by holding to their jackets thus assailed those men seized others with like intent and an awful struggle filled all that part of the craft at this dread instant the boat glanced into the white water shipping so much of the element as nearly to swamp her and taking so wild a sheer as nearly to broachto this last circumstance probably saved her fearful as was the danger for the moment everybody in the middle of the yawl was rendered desperate by the amount and nature of the danger incurred and the men from the bottom rose in their might underneath the combatants when a common plunge was made by all who stood erect one dragging overboard another each a good deal hastened by the assault from beneath until no less than five were gone spike got his helm up the boat fell off and away from the spot it flew clearing the breakers and reaching the northern walllike margin of the reef at the next instant there was now a moment when those who remained could breathe and dared to look behind them  the great plunge had been made in water so shoal that the boat had barely escaped being dashed to pieces on the coral had it not been so suddenly relieved from the pressure of near a thousand pounds in weight it is probable that this calamity would have befallen it the water received on board contributing so much to weight it down the struggle between these victims ceased however the moment they went over finding bottom for their feet they released each other in a desperate hope of prolonging life by wading two or three held out their arms and shouted to spike to return and pick them up this dreadful scene lasted but a single instant for the waves dashed one after another from his feet continually forcing them all as they occasionally regained their footing toward the margin of the reef and finally washing them off it into deep water no human power could enable a man to swim back to the rocks once to leeward of them in the face of such seas and so heavy a blow and the miserable wretches disappeared in succession as their strength became exhausted in the depths of the gulf  not a word had been uttered while this terrific scene was in the course of occurrence not a word was uttered for some time afterward gleams of grim satisfaction had been seen on the countenances of the boatswain and his associates when the success of their nefarious project was first assured but they soon disappeared in looks of horror as they witnessed the struggles of the drowning men nevertheless human selfishness was strong within them all and none there was so ignorant as not to perceive how much better were the chances of the yawl now than it had been on quitting the wreck the weight of a large ox had been taken from it counting that of all the eight men drowned and as for the water shipped it was soon bailed back again into the sea not only therefore was the yawl in a better condition to resist the waves but it sailed materially faster than it had done before ten persons still remained in it however which brought it down in the water below its proper loadline and the speed of a craft so small was necessarily a good deal lessened by the least deviation from its best sailing or rowing trim but spikes projects were not yet completed  all this time the manofwars cutter had been rushing as madly through the breakers in chase as the yawl had done in the attempt to escape mulford was in fact on board it and his now fast friend wallace was in command the latter wished to seize a traitor the former to save the aunt of his weeping bride both believed that they might follow wherever spike dared to lead this reasoning was more bold than judicious notwithstanding since the cutter was much larger and drew twice as much water as the yawl on it came nevertheless faring much better in the white water than the little craft it pursued but necessarily running a much more considerable risk of hitting the coral over which it was glancing almost as swiftly as the waves themselves still it had thus far escapedand little did any in it think of the danger this cutter pulled ten oars was an excellent sea boat had four armed marines in it in addition to its crew but carried all through the breakers receiving scarcely a drop of water on board on account of the height of its washboards and the general qualities of the craft it may be well to add here that the poughkeepsie had shaken out her reefs and was betraying the impatience of captain mull to make sail in chase by firing signalguns to his boats to bear a hand and return these signals the three boats under their oars were endeavouring to obey but wallace had got so far to leeward as now to render the course he was pursuing the wisest  mrs budd and biddy had seen the struggle in which the señor montefalderon had been lost in a sort of stupid horror both had screamed as was their wont though neither probably suspected the truth but the fell designs of spike extended to them as well as to those whom he had already destroyed now the boat was in deep water running along the margin of the reef the waves were much increased in magnitude and the comb of the sea was far more menacing to the boat this would not have been the case had the rocks formed a lee but they did not running too near the direction of the trades to prevent the billows that got up a mile or so in the offing from sending their swell quite home to the reef it was this swell indeed which caused the line of white water along the northern margin of the coral washing on the rocks by a sort of lateral effort and breaking as a matter of course in many places no boat could have lived to pass through it  another consideration influenced spike to persevere the cutter had been overhauling him hand over hand but since the yawl was relieved of the weight of no less than eight men the difference in the rate of sailing was manifestly diminished the manofwars boat drew nearer but by no means as fast as it had previously done a point was now reached in the trim of the yawl when a very few hundreds in weight might make the most important change in her favour and this change the captain was determined to produce by this time the cutter was in deep water as well as himself safe through all the dangers of the reef and she was less than a quarter of a mile astern on the whole she was gaining though so slowly as to require the most experienced eye to ascertain the fact  madame budd said spike in a hypocritical tone we are in great danger and i shall have to ask you to change your seat the boat is too much by the starn now weve got into deep water and your weight amidships would be a great relief to us just give your hand to the boatswain and he will help you to step from thwart to thwart until you reach the right place when biddy shall follow  now mrs budd had witnessed the tremendous struggle in which so many had gone overboard but so dull was she of apprehension and so little disposed to suspect anything onehalf so monstrous as the truth that she did not hesitate to comply she was profoundly awed by the horrors of the scene through which she was passing the raging billows of the gulf as seen from so small a craft producing a deep impression on her still a lingering of her most inveterate affectation was to be found in her air and language which presented a strange medley of besetting weakness and strong natural womanly affection  certainly captain spike she answered rising a craft should never go astern and i am quite willing to ballast the boat we have seen such terrible accidents today that all should lend their aid in endeavouring to get under way and in averting all possible hamper only take me to my poor dear rosy captain spike and everything shall be forgotten that has passed between us this is not a moment to bear malice and i freely pardon you all and everything the fate of our unfortunate friend mr montefalderon should teach us charity and cause us to prepare for untimely ends  all the time the good widow was making this speech which she uttered in a solemn and oracular sort of manner she was moving slowly toward the seat the men had prepared for her in the middle of the boat assisted with the greatest care and attention by the boatswain and another of spikes confidants when on the second thwart from aft and about to take her seat the boatswain cast a look behind him and spike put the helm down the boat luffed and lurched of course and mrs budd would probably have gone overboard to leeward by so sudden and violent a change had not the impetus thus received been aided by the arms of the men who held her two hands the plunge she made into the water was deep for she was a woman of great weight for her stature still she was not immediately gotten rid of even at that dread instant it is probable that the miserable woman did not suspect the truth for she grasped the hand of the boatswain with the tenacity of a vice and thus dragged on the surface of the boiling surges she screamed aloud for spike to save her of all who had yet been sacrificed to the captains selfish wish to save himself this was the first instance in which any had been heard to utter a sound after falling into the sea the appeal shocked even the rude beings around her and biddy chiming in with a powerful appeal to save the missus added to the piteous nature of the scene  cast off her hand said spike reproachfully shell swamp the boat by her strugglesget rid of her at once cut her fingers off if she wont let go  the instant these brutal orders were given and that in a fierce impatient tone the voice of biddy was heard no more the truth forced itself on her dull imagination and she sat a witness of the terrible scene in mute despair the struggle did not last long the boatswain drew his knife across the wrist of the hand that grasped his own one shriek was heard and the boat plunged into the trough of a sea leaving the form of poor mrs budd struggling with the wave on its summit and amid the foam of its crest this was the last that was ever seen of the unfortunate relict  the boat has gained a good deal by that last discharge of cargo said spike to the boatswain a minute after they had gotten rid of the struggling womanshe is much more lively and is getting nearer to her loadline if we can bring her to that i shall have no fear of the manofwars men for this yawl is one of the fastest boats that ever floated  a very little now sir would bring us to our true trim  ay we must get rid of more cargo come good woman turning to biddy with whom he did not think it worth his while to use much circumlocution your turn is next its the maids duty to follow her mistress  i knowd it must come said biddy meekly if there was no mercy for the missus little could i look for but yell not take the life of a christian woman widout giving her so much as one minute to say her prayers  ay pray away answered spike his throat becoming dry and husky for strange to say the submissive quiet of the irish woman so different from the struggle he had anticipated with her rendered him more reluctant to proceed than he had hitherto been in all of that terrible day as biddy kneeled in the bottom of the sternsheets spike looked behind him for the double purpose of escaping the painful spectacle at his feet and that of ascertaining how his pursuers came on the last still gained though very slowly and doubts began to come over the captains mind whether he could escape such enemies at all he was too deeply committed however to recede and it was most desirable to get rid of poor biddy if it were for no other motive than to shut her mouth spike even fancied that some idea of what had passed was entertained by those in the cutter there was evidently a stir in that boat and two forms that he had no difficulty now in recognizing as those of wallace and mulford were standing on the grating in the eyes of the cutter or forward of the foresail the former appeared to have a musket in his hand and the other a glass the last circumstance admonished him that all that was now done would be done before dangerous witnesses it was too late to draw back however and the captain turned to look for the irish woman  biddy arose from her knees just as spike withdrew his eyes from his pursuers the boatswain and another confidant were in readiness to cast the poor creature into the sea the moment their leader gave the signal the intended victim saw and understood the arrangement and she spoke earnestly and piteously to her murderers  its not wanting will be violence said biddy in a quiet tone but with a saddened countenance i know its my turn and i will save yer sowls from a part of the burden of this great sin god and his divine son and the blessed mother of jesus have mercy on me if it be wrong but i would far radder jump into the saa widout having the rude hands of man on me than have the dreadful sight of the missus done over agin its a fearful thing is wather and sometimes we have too little of it and sometimes more than we want  bear a hand bear a hand good woman interrupted the boatswain impatiently we must clear the boat of you and the sooner it is done the better it will be for all of us  dont grudge a poor morthal half a minute of life at the last moment answered biddy its not long that ill throuble ye and so no more need be said  the poor creature then got on the quarter of the boat without any ones touching her there she placed herself with her legs outboard while she sat on the gunwale she gave one moment to the thought of arranging her clothes with womanly decency and then she paused to gaze with a fixed eye and pallid cheek on the foaming wake that marked the rapid course of the boat the troughs of the sea seemed less terrible to her than their combing crests and she waited for the boat to descend into the next  god forgive ye all this deed as i do said biddy earnestly and bending her person forward she fell as it might be without hands into the gulf of eternity though all strained their eyes none of the men jack tier excepted ever saw more of biddy noon nor did jack see much he got a frightful glimpse of an arm however on the summit of a wave but the motion of the boat was too swift and the water of the ocean too troubled to admit of aught else  a long pause succeeded this event biddys quiet submission to her fate had produced more impression on her murderers than the desperate but unavailing struggles of those who had preceded her thus it is ever with men when opposed the demon within blinds them to consequences as well as to their duties but unresisted the silent influence of the image of god makes itself felt and a better spirit begins to prevail there was not one in that boat who did not for a brief space wish that poor biddy had been spared with most that feeling the last of human kindness they ever knew lingered until the occurrence of the dread catastrophe which so shortly after closed the scene of this state of being on their eyes  jack tier called out spike some five minutes after biddy was drowned but not until another observation had made it plainly apparent to him that the manofwars men still continued to draw nearer being now not more than fair musketshot astern  ay ay sir answered jack coming quietly out of his hole from forward of the mast and moving aft as if indifferent to the danger by stepping lightly from thwart to thwart until he reached the sternsheets  it is your turn little jack said spike as if in a sort of sorrowful submission to a necessity that knew no law we cannot spare you the room  i have expected this and am ready let me have my own way and i will cause you no trouble poor biddy has taught me how to die before i go however stephen spike i must leave you this letter it is written by myself and addressed to you when i am gone read it and think well of what it contains and now may a merciful god pardon the sins of both through love for his divine son i forgive you stephen and should you live to escape from those who are now bent on hunting you to the death let this day cause you no grief on my account give me but a moment of time and i will cause you no trouble  jack now stood upon the seat of the sternsheets balancing himself with one foot on the stern of the boat he waited until the yawl had risen to the summit of a wave when he looked eagerly for the manofwars cutter at that moment she was lost to view in the trough of the sea instead of springing overboard as all expected he asked another instant of delay the yawl sank into the trough itself and rose on the succeeding billow then he saw the cutter and wallace and mulford standing in its bows he waved his hat to them and sprang high into the air with the intent to make himself seen when he came down the boat had shot her length away from the place leaving him to buffet with the waves jack now managed admirably swimming lightly and easily but keeping his eyes on the crests of the waves with a view to meet the cutter spike now saw this wellplanned project to avoid death and regretted his own remissness in not making sure of jack everybody in the yawl was eagerly looking after the form of tier  there he is on the comb of that sea rolling over like a keg cried the boatswain  he s through it answered spike and swimming with great strength and coolness  several of the men started up involuntarily and simultaneously to look hitting their shoulders and bodies together distrust was at its most painful height and bulldogs do not spring at the oxs muzzle more fiercely than those six men throttled each other oaths curses and appeals for help succeeded each man endeavouring in his frenzied efforts to throw all the others overboard as the only means of saving himself plunge succeeded plunge and when that combat of demons ended no one remained of them all but the boatswain spike had taken no share in the struggle looking on in grim satisfaction as the father of lies may be supposed to regard all human strife hoping good to himself let the result be what it might to others of the five men who thus went overboard not one escaped they drowned each other by continuing their maddened conflict in an element unsuited to their natures  not so with jack tier his leap had been seen and a dozen eyes in the cutter watched for his person as that boat came foaming down before the wind a shout of there he is from mulford succeeded and the little fellow was caught by the hair secured and then hauled into the boat by the second lieutenant of the poughkeepsie and our young mate  others in the cutter had noted the incident of the hellish fight the fact was communicated to wallace and mulford said that yawl will outsail this loaded cutter with only two men in it  then it is time to try what virtue there is in lead answered wallace marines come forward and give the rascal a volley  the volley was fired one ball passed through the head of the boatswain killing him dead on the spot another went through the body of spike the captain fell in the sternsheets and the boat instantly broachedto  the water that came on board apprised spike fully of the state in which he was now placed and by a desperate effort he clutched the tiller and got the yawl again before the wind this could not last however little by little his hold relaxed until his hand relinquished its grasp altogether and the wounded man sank into the bottom of the sternsheets unable to raise even his head again the boat broachedto every sea now sent its water aboard and the yawl would soon have filled had not the cutter come glancing down past it and roundingto under its lee secured the prize  chapter viii    man hath a weary pilgrimage   as through the world he wends   on every stage from youth to age   still discontent attends   with heaviness he casts his eye   upon the road before   and still remembers with a sigh   the days that are no more  southey  it has now become necessary to advance the time three entire days and to change the scene to key west as this latter place may not be known to the world at large it may be well to explain that it is a small seaport situate on one of the largest of the many low islands that dot the florida reef that has risen into notice or indeed into existence as a town since the acquisition of the floridas by the american republic for many years it was the resort of few besides wreckers and those who live by the business dependent on the rescuing and repairing of stranded vessels not forgetting the salvages when it is remembered that the greater portion of the vessels that enter the gulf of mexico stand close along this reef before the trades for a distance varying from one to two hundred miles and that nearly everything which quits it is obliged to beat down its rocky coast in the gulf stream for the same distance one is not to be surprised that the wrecks which so constantly occur can supply the wants of a considerable population to live at key west is the next thing to being at sea the place has sea air no other water than such as is preserved in cisterns and no soil or so little as to render even a head of lettuce a rarity turtle is abundant and the business of turtling forms an occupation additional to that of wrecking as might be expected in such circumstances a potato is a far more precious thing than a turtles egg and a sack of the tubers would probably be deemed a sufficient remuneration for enough of the materials of callipash and callipee to feed all the aldermen extant  of late years the government of the united states has turned its attention to the capabilities of the florida reef as an advanced naval station a sort of downs or st helens roads for the west indian seas as yet little has been done beyond making the preliminary surveys but the day is not probably very distant when fleets will lie at anchor among the islets described in our earlier chapters or garnish the fine waters of key west for a long time it was thought that even frigates would have a difficulty in entering and quitting the port of the latter but it is said that recent explorations have discovered channels capable of admitting anything that floats still key west is a town yet in its chrysalis state possessing the promise rather than the fruition of the prosperous days which are in reserve it may be well to add that it lies a very little north of the 24th degree of latitude and in a longitude quite five degrees west from washington until the recent conquests in mexico it was the most southern possession of the american government on the eastern side of the continent cape st lucas at the extremity of lower california however being two degrees farther south  it will give the foreign reader a more accurate notion of the character of key west if we mention a fact of quite recent occurrence a very few weeks after the closing scenes of this tale the town in question was in a great measure washed away a hurricane brought in the sea upon all these islands and reefs water running in swift currents over places that within the memory of man were never before submerged the lower part of key west was converted into a raging sea and everything in that quarter of the place disappeared the foundation being of rock however when the ocean retired the island came into view again and industry and enterprise set to work to repair the injuries  the government has established a small hospital for seamen at key west into one of the rooms of the building thus appropriated our narrative must now conduct the reader it contained but a single patient and that was spike he was on his narrow bed which was to be but the pucursor of a still narrower tenement the grave in the room with the dying man were two females in one of whom our readers will at once recognize the person of rose budd dressed in deep mourning for her aunt at first sight it is probable that a casual spectator would mistake the second female for one of the ordinary nurses of the place her attire was well enough though worn awkwardly and as if its owner were not exactly at ease in it she had the air of one in her best attire who was unaccustomed to be dressed above the most common mode what added to the singularity of her appearance was the fact that while she wore no cap her hair had been cut into short gray bristles instead of being long and turned up as is usual with females to give a sort of climax to this uncouth appearance this strangelooking creature chewed tobacco  the woman in question equivocal as might be her exterior was employed in one of the commonest avocations of her sexthat of sewing she held in her hand a coarse garment one of spikes in fact which she seemed to be intently busy in mending although the work was of a quality that invited the use of the palm and sailneedle rather than that of the thimble and the smaller implement known to seamstresses the woman appeared awkward in her business as if her coarselooking and dark hands refused to lend themselves to an occupation so feminine nevertheless there were touches of a purely womanly character about this extraordinary person and touches that particularly attracted the attention and awakened the sympathy of the gentle rose her companion tears occasionally struggled out from beneath her eyelids crossed her dark sunburnt cheek and fell on the coarse canvas garment that lay in her lap it was after one of these sudden and strong exhibitions of feeling that rose approached her laid her own little fair hand in a friendly way though unheeded on the others shoulder and spoke to her in her kindest and softest tones  i do really think he is reviving jack said rose and that you may yet hope to have an intelligent conversation with him  they all agree he must die answered jack tierfor it was he appearing in the garb of his proper sex after a disguise that had now lasted fully twenty yearsand he will never know who i am and that i forgive him he must think of me in another world though he is nt able to do it in this but it would be a great relief to his soul to know that i forgive him  to be sure a man must like to take a kind leave of his own wife before he closes his eyes for ever and i dare say it would be a great relief to you to tell him that you have forgotten his desertion of you and all the hardships it has brought upon you in searching for him and in earning your own livelihood as a common sailor  i shall not tell him ive forgotten it miss rose that would be untrueand there shall be no more deception between us but i shall tell him that i forgive him as i hope god will one day forgive me all my sins  it is certainly not a light offence to desert a wife in a foreign land and then to seek to deceive another woman quietly observed rose  hes a willian muttered the wifebutbut  you forgive him jackyes im sure you do you are too good a christian to refuse to forgive him  im a woman ater all miss rose and that i believe is the truth of it i suppose i ought to do as you say for the reason you mention but im his wifeand once he loved me though that has long been over when i first knew stephen id the sort of feelins you speak of and was a very different creatur from what you see me today change comes over us all with years and sufferin  rose did not answer but she stood looking intently at the speaker more than a minute change had indeed come over her if she had ever possessed the power to please the fancy of any living man her features had always seemed diminutive and mean for her assumed sex as her voice was small and cracked but making every allowance for the probabilities rose found it difficult to imagine that jack tier had ever possessed even under the high advantages of youth and innocence the attractions so common to her sex her skin had acquired the tanning of the sea the expression of her face had become hard and worldly and her habits contributed to render those natural consequences of exposure and toil even more than usually marked and decided by saying habits however we do not mean that jack had ever drunk to excess as happens with so many seamen for this would have been doing her injustice but she smoked and chewedpractices that intoxicate in another form and lead nearly as many to the grave as excess in drinking thus all the accessories about this singular being partook of the character of her recent life and duties her walk was between a waddle and a seamans roll her hands were discoloured with tar and had got to be full of knuckles and even her feet had degenerated into that flat broadtoed form that perhaps sooner distinguishes caste in connection with outward appearances than any one other physical peculiarity yet this being had once been younghad once been even fair and had once possessed that feminine air and lightness of form that as often belongs to the youthful american of her sex perhaps as to the girl of any other nation on earth rose continued to gaze at her companion for some time when she walked musingly to a window that looked out upon the port  i am not certain whether it would do him good or not to see this sight she said addressing the wife kindly doubtful of the effect of her words even on the latter but here are the sloopofwar and several other vessels  ay she is there but never will his foot be put on board the swash agin when he bought that brig i was still young and agreeable to him and he gave her my maiden name which was mary or molly swash but that is all changed i wonder he did not change the name with his change of feelins  then you did really sail in the brig in former times and knew the seaman whose name you assumed  many years tier with whose name i made free on account of his size and some resemblance to me in form died under my care and his protection fell into my hands which first put the notion into my head of hailing as his representative yes i knew tier in the brig and we were left ashore at the same time i intentionally i make no question he because stephen spike was in a hurry and did not choose to wait for a man the poor fellow caught the yellow fever the very next day and did not live eightandforty hours so the world goes them that wish to live die and them that wants to die live  you have had a hard time for one of your sex poor jackquite twenty years a sailor did you not tell me  every day of it miss roseand bitter years have they been for the whole of that time have i been in chase of my husband keeping my own secret and slaving like a horse for a livelihood  you could not have been old when he leftthat iswhen you parted  call it by its true name and say at once when he desarted me i was under thirty by two or three years and was still like my own sex to look at all that is changed since but i was comely then  why did captain spike abandon you jack you have never told me that  because he fancied another and ever since that time he has been fancying others instead of remembering me had he got you miss rose i think he would have been content for the rest of his days  be certain jack i should never have consented to marry captain spike  youre well out of his hands answered jack sighing heavily which was the most feminine thing she had done during the whole conversation well out of his handsand god be praised it is so he should have died before i would let him carry you off the islandhusband or no husband  it might have exceeded your power to prevent it under other circumstances jack  rose now continued looking out of the window in silence her thoughts reverted to her aunt and biddy and tears rolled down her cheeks as she remembered the love of one and the fidelity of the other their horrible fate had given her a shock that at first menaced her with a severe fit of illness but her strong good sense and excellent constitution both sustained by her piety and harrys manly tenderness had brought her through the danger and left her as the reader now sees her struggling with her own griefs in order to be of use to the still more unhappy woman who had so singularly become her friend and companion  the reader will readily have anticipated that jack tier had early made the females on board the swash her confidants rose had known the outlines of her history from the first few days they were at sea together which is the explanation of the visible intimacy that had caused mulford so much surprise jacks motive in making his revelations might possibly have been tinctured with jealousy but a desire to save one as young and innocent as rose was at its bottom few persons but a wife would have supposed our heroine could have been in any danger from a lover like spike but jack saw him with the eyes of her own youth and of past recollections rather than with those of truth a movement of the wounded man first drew rose from the window drying her eyes hastily she turned toward him fancying she might prove the better nurse of the two notwithstanding jacks greater interest in the patient  what place is thisand why am i here demanded spike with more strength of voice than could have been expected after all that had passed this is not a cabinnot the swashit looks like a hospital  it is a hospital captain spike said rose gently drawing near the bed you have been hurt and have been brought to key west and placed in the hospital i hope you feel better and that you suffer no pain  my head is nt righti do nt knoweverything seems turned round with meperhaps it will all come out as it should i begin to rememberwhere is my brig  she is lost on the rocks the seas have broken her into fragments  thats melancholy news at any rate ah miss rose god bless youive had terrible dreams well its pleasant to be among friendswhat creature is thatwhere does she come from  that is jack tier answered rose steadily she turns out to be a woman and has put on her proper dress in order to attend on you during your illness jack has never left your bedside since we have been here  a long silence succeeded this revelation jacks eyes twinkled and she hitched her body half aside as if to conceal her features where emotions that were unusual were at work with the muscles rose thought it might be well to leave the man and wife aloneand she managed to get out of the room unobserved  spike continued to gaze at the strangelooking female who was now his sole companion gradually his recollection returned and with it the full consciousness of his situation he might not have been fully aware of the absolute certainty of his approaching death but he must have known that his wound was of a very grave character and that the result might early prove fatal still that strange and unknown figure haunted him a figure that was so different from any he had ever seen before and which in spite of its present dress seemed to belong quite as much to one sex as to the other as for jack we call molly or mary swash by her masculine appellation not only because it is more familiar but because the other name seems really out of place as applied to such a personas for jack then she sat with her face half averted thumbing the canvas and endeavouring to ply the needle but perfectly mute she was conscious that spikes eyes were on her and a lingering feeling of her sex told her how much time exposure and circumstances had changed her personand she would gladly have hidden the defects in her appearance  mary swash was the daughter as well as the wife of a shipmaster in her youth as has been said before she had even been pretty and down to the day when her husband deserted her she would have been thought a female of a comely appearance rather than the reverse her hair in particular though slightly coarse perhaps had been rich and abundant and the change from the long dark shining flowing locks which she still possessed in her thirtieth year to the short grey bristles that now stood exposed without a cap or covering of any sort was one very likely to destroy all identity of appearance then jack had passed from what might be called youth to the verge of old age in the interval that she had been separated from her husband her shape had changed entirely her complexion was utterly gone and her features always unmeaning though feminine and suitable to her sex had become hard and slightly coarse still there was something of her former self about jack that bewildered spike and his eyes continued fastened on her for quite a quarter of an hour in profound silence  give me some water said the wounded man i wish some water to drink  jack arose filled a tumbler and brought it to the side of the bed spike took the glass and drank but the whole time his eyes were riveted on the strange nurse when his thirst was appeased he asked  who are you how came you here  i am your nurse it is common to place nurses at the bedsides of the sick  are you man or woman  that is a question i hardly know how to answer sometimes i think myself each sometimes neither  did i ever see you before  often and quite lately i sailed with you in your last voyage  you that cannot be if so what is your name  jack tier  a long pause succeeded this announcement which induced spike to muse as intently as his condition would allow though the truth did not yet flash on his understanding at length the bewildered man again spoke  are you jack tier he said slowly like one who doubted yesi now see the resemblance and it was that which puzzled me are they so rigid in this hospital that you have been obliged to put on womans clothes in order to lend me a helping hand  i am dressed as you see and for good reasons  but jack tier run like that rascal mulforday i remember now you were in the boat when i overhauled you all on the reef  very true i was in the boat but i never run stephen spike it was you who abandoned me on the islet in the gulf and that makes the second time in your life that you left me ashore when it was your duty to carry me to sea  the first time i was in a hurry and could not wait for you this last time you took sides with the women but for your interference i should have got rose and married her and all would now have been well with me  this was an awkward announcement for a man to make to his legal wife but after all jack had endured and all jack had seen during the late voyage she was not to be overcome by this avowal her selfcommand extended so far as to prevent any open manifestation of emotion however much her feelings were excited  i took sides with the women because i am a woman myself she answered speaking at length with decision as if determined to bring matters to a head at once it is natural for us all to take sides with our kind  you a woman jack that is very remarkable since when have you hailed for a woman you have shipped with me twice and each time as a manthough ive never thought you able to do seamans duty  nevertheless i am what you see a woman born and edicated one that never had on mans dress until i knew you you supposed me to be a man when i came off to you in the skiff to the eastward of rikers island but i was then what you now see  i begin to understand matters rejoined the invalid musingly ay ay it opens on me and i now see how it was you made such fair weather with madam budd and pretty pretty rose rose is pretty jack you must admit that though you be a woman  rose is prettyi do admit it and what is better rose is good it required a heavy draft on jacks justice and magnanimity however to make this concession  and you told rose and madam budd about your sex and that was the reason they took to you so on the vyge  i told them who i was and why i went abroad as a man they know my whole story  did rose approve of your sailing under false colours jack  you must ask that of rose herself my story made her my friend but she never said anything for or against my disguise  it was no great disguise ater all jack now youre fitted out in your own clothes youve a sort of halfrigged look one would be as likely to set you down for a man under jurycanvas as for a woman  jack made no answer to this but she sighed very heavily as for spike himself he was silent for some little time not only from exhaustion but because he suffered pain from his wound the needle was diligently but awkwardly plied in this pause  spikes ideas were still a little confused but a silence and rest of a quarter of an hour cleared them materially at the end of that time he again asked for water when he had drunk and jack was once more seated with his sideface toward him at work with the needle the captain gazed long and intently at this strange woman it happened that the profile of jack preserved more of the resemblance to her former self than the full face and it was this resemblance that now attracted spikes attention though not the smallest suspicion of the truth yet gleamed upon him he saw something that was familiar though he could not even tell what that something was much less to what or whom it bore any resemblance at length he spoke  i was told that jack tier was dead he said that he took the fever and was in his grave within eightandforty hours after we sailed that was what they told me of him  and what did they tell you of your own wife stephen spike she that you left ashore at the time jack was left  they said she did not die for three years later i heard of her death at new orleens three years later  and how could you leave her ashoreshe your true and lawful wife  it was a bad thing answered spike who like all other mortals regarded his own past career now that he stood on the edge of the grave very differently from what he had regarded it in the hour of his health and strength yes it was a very bad thing and i wish it was ondone but it is too late now she died of the fever toothats some comfort had she died of a broken heart i could not have forgiven myself molly was not without her faultsgreat faults i considered them but on the whole molly was a good creatur  you liked her then stephen spike  i can truly say that when i married molly and old captain swash put his daghters hand into mine that the woman was nt living who was better in my judgment or handsomer in my eyes  ay aywhen you married her but how was it aterwardswhen you was tired of her and saw another that was fairer in your eyes  i desarted her and god has punished me for the sin do you know jack that luck has never been with me since that day often and often have i bethought me of it and sartain as you sit there no great luck has ever been with me or my craft since i went off leaving my wife ashore what was made in one vyge was lost in the next up and down up and down the whole time for so many many long years that grey hairs set in and old age was beginning to get close aboardand i as poor as ever it has been rub and go with me ever since and i have had as much as i could do to keep the brig in motion as the only means that was left to make the two ends meet  and did not all this make you think of your poor wifeshe whom you had so wronged  i thought of little else until i heard of her death at new orleensand then i gave it up as useless could i have fallen in with molly at any time ater the first six months of my desartion she and i would have come together again and everything would have been forgotten i knowed her very nature which was all forgiveness to me at the bottom though seemingly so spiteful and hard  yet you wanted to have this rose budd who is only too young and handsome and good for you  i was tired of being a widower jack and rose is wonderful pretty she has money too and might make the evening of my days comfortable the brig was old as you must know and has long been off of all the insurance offices books and she could nt hold together much longer but for this sloopofwar i should have put her off on the mexicans and they would have lost her to our people in a month  and was it an honest thing to sell an old and wornout craft to any one stephen spike  spike had a conscience that had become hard as iron by means of trade he who traffics much most especially if his dealings be on so small a scale as to render constant investigations of the minor qualities of things necessary must be a very fortunate man if he preserve his conscience in any better condition when jack made this allusion therefore the dying manfor death was much nearer to spike that even be supposed though he no longer hoped for his own recoverywhen jack made this allusion then the dying man was a good deal at a loss to comprehend it he saw no particular harm in making the best bargain he could nor was it easy for him to understand why he might not dispose of anything he possessed for the highest price that was to be had still he answered in an apologetic sort of way  the brig was old i acknowledge he said but she was strong and might have run a long time i only spoke of her capture as a thing likely to take place soon if the mexicans got her so that her qualities were of no great account unless it might be her speedand that you know was excellent jack  and you regret that brig stephen spike lying as you do on your deathbed more than anything else  not as much as i do pretty rose budd jack rosy is so delightful to look at  the muscles of jacks face twitched a little and she looked deeply mortified for to own the truth she hoped that the conversation had so far turned her delinquent husbands thoughts to the past as to have revived in him some of his former interest in herself it is true he still believed her dead but this was a circumstance jack overlookedso hard is it to hear the praises of a rival and be just she felt the necessity of being more explicit and determined at once to come to the point  stephen spike she said steadily drawing near to the bedside you should be told the truth when you are heard thus extolling the good looks of rose budd with less than eightandforty hours of life remaining mary swash did not die as you have supposed three years ater you desarted her but is living at this moment had you read the letter i gave you in the boat just before you made me jump into the sea that would have told you where she is to be found  spike stared at the speaker intently and when her cracked voice ceased his look was that of a man who was terrified as well as bewildered this did not arise still from any gleamings of the real state of the case but from the soreness with which his conscience pricked him when he heard that his muchwronged wife was alive he fancied with a vivid and rapid glance at the probabilities all that a woman abandoned would be likely to endure in the course of so many long and suffering years  are you sure of what you say jack you would nt take advantage of my situation to tell me an untruth  as certain of it as of my own existence i have seen her quite latelytalked with her of youin short she is now at key west knows your state and has a wifes feelins to come to your bedside  notwithstanding all this and the many gleamings he had had of the facts during their late intercourse on board the brig spike did not guess at the truth he appeared astounded and his terror seemed to increase  i have another thing to tell you continued jack pausing but a moment to collect her own thoughts jack tierthe real jack tierhe who sailed with you of old and whom you left ashore at the same time you desarted your wife did die of the fever as you was told in eightandforty hours ater the brig went to sea  then who in the name of heaven are you how came you to hail by anothers name as well as by another sex  what could a woman do whose husband had desarted her in a strange land  that is remarkable so youve been married i should not have thought that possible and your husband desarted you too well such things do happen  jack now felt a severe pang she could not but see that her ungainlywe had almost said her unearthly appearanceprevented the captain from even yet suspecting the truth and the meaning of his language was not easily to be mistaken that any one should have married her seemed to her husband as improbable as it was probable he would run away from her as soon as it was in his power after the ceremony  stephen spike resumed jack solemnly i am mary swashi am your wife  spike started in his bed then he buried his face in the coverletand he actually groaned in bitterness of spirit the woman turned away and wept her feelings had been blunted by misfortune and the collisions of a selfish world but enough of former self remained to make this the hardest of all the blows she had ever received her husband dying as he was as he must and did know himself to be shrunk from one of her appearance unsexed as she had become by habits and changed by years and suffering  chapter ix    the trusting hearts repose the paradise   of home with all its loves doth fate allow   the crown of glory unto womans brow   mrs hemans  it has again become necessary to advance the time and we shall take the occasion thus offered to make a few explanations touching certain events which have been passed over without notice  the reason why captain mull did not chase the yawl of the brig in the poughkeepsie herself was the necessity of waiting for his own boats that were endeavouring to regain the sloopofwar it would not have done to abandon them inasmuch as the men were so much exhausted by the pull to windward that when they reached the vessel all were relieved from duty for the rest of the day as soon however as the other boats were hoisted in or run up the ship filled away stood out of the passage and ran down to join the cutter of wallace which was endeavouring to keep its position as much as possible by making short tacks under closereefed luggs  spike had been received on board the sloopofwar sent into her sick bay and put under the care of the surgeon and his assistants from the first these gentlemen pronounced the hurt mortal the wounded man was insensible most of the time until the ship had beat up and gone into key west where he was transferred to the regular hospital as has already been mentioned  the wreckers went out the moment the news of the calamity of the swash reached their ears some went in quest of the doubloons of the schooner and others to pick up anything valuable that might be discovered in the neighbourhood of the stranded brig it may be mentioned here that not much was ever obtained from the brigantine with the exception of a few spars the sails and a little rigging but in the end the schooner was raised by means of the chain spike had placed around her the cabin was ransacked and the doubloons were recovered as there was no one to claim the money it was quietly divided among the conscientious citizens present at its revisiting the glimpses of the moon making gold plenty  the doubloons in the yawl would have been lost but for the sagacity of mulford he too well knew the character of spike to believe he would quit the brig without taking the doubloons with him acquainted with the boat he examined the little locker in the sternsheets and found the two bags one of which was probably the lawful property of captain spike while the other in truth belonged to the mexican government the last contained the most gold but the first amounted to a sum that our young mate knew to be very considerable rose had made him acquainted with the sex of jack tier since their own marriage and he at once saw that the claims of this uncouth wife who was so soon to be a widow to the gold in question might prove to be as good in law as they unquestionably were in morals on representing the facts of the case to captain mull and the legal functionaries at key west it was determined to relinquish this money to the heirs of spike as indeed they must have done under process there being no other claimant these doubloons however did not amount to the full price of the flour and powder that composed the cargo of the swash the cargo had been purchased with mexican funds and all that spike or his heirs could claim was the high freight for which he had undertaken the delicate office of transporting those forbidden articles contraband of war to the dry tortugas  mulford by this time was high in the confidence and esteem of all on board the poughkeepsie he had frankly explained his whole connexion with spike not even attempting to conceal the reluctance he had felt to betray the brig after he had fully ascertained the fact of his commanders treason the manly gentlemen with whom he was now brought in contact entered into his feelings and admitted that it was an office no one could desire to turn against the craft in which he sailed it is true they could not and would not be traitors but mulford had stopped far short of this and the distinction between such a character and that of an informer was wide enough to satisfy all their scruples  then rose had the greatest success with the gentlemen of the poughkeepsie her youth beauty and modesty told largely in her favour and the simple womanly affection she unconsciously betrayed in behalf of harry touched the heart of every observer when the intelligence of her aunts fate reached her the sorrow she manifested was so profound and natural that every one sympathized with her grief nor would she be satisfied unless mulford would consent to go in search of the bodies the latter knew the hopelessness of such an excursion but he could not refuse to comply he was absent on that melancholy duty therefore at the moment of the scene related in our last chapter and did not return until after that which we are now about to lay before the reader mrs budd biddy and all of those who perished after the yawl got clear of the reef were drowned in deep water and no more was ever seen of any of them or if wreckers did pass them they did not stop to bury the dead it was different however with those who were first sacrificed to spikes selfishness they were drowned on the reef and harry did actually recover the bodies of the señor montefalderon and of josh the steward they had washed upon a rock that is bare at low water he took them both to the dry tortugas and had them interred along with the other dead at that place don juan was placed side by side with his unfortunate countryman the master of his equally unfortunate schooner  while harry was absent and thus employed rose wept much and prayed more she would have felt herself almost alone in the world but for the youth to whom she had so recently less than a week before plighted her faith in wedlock that new tie it is true was of sufficient importance to counteract many of the ordinary feelings of her situation and she now turned to it as the one which absorbed most of the future duties of her life still she missed the kindness the solicitude even the weaknesses of her aunt and the terrible manner in which mrs budd had perished made her shudder with horror whenever she thought of it poor biddy too came in for her share of the regrets this faithful creature who had been in the relicts service ever since roses infancy had become endeared to her in spite of her uncouth manners and confused ideas by the warmth of her heart and the singular truth of her feelings biddy of all her family had come to america leaving behind her not only brothers and sisters but parents living each year did she remit to the last a moiety of her earnings and many a halfdollar that had come from roses pretty little hand had been converted into gold and forwarded on the same pious errand to the green island of her nativity ireland unhappy country at this moment what are not the dire necessities of thy poor here from the midst of abundance in a land that god has blessed in its productions far beyond the limits of human wants a land in which famine was never known do we at this moment hear thy groans and listen to tales of suffering that to us seem almost incredible in the midst of these chilling narratives our eyes fall on an appeal to the english nation that appears in what it is the fashion of some to term the first journal of europe  in behalf of thy suffering people a worthy appeal to the charity of england seldom fails but it seems to us that one sentiment of this might have been altered if not spared the english are asked to be forgetful of the past and to come forward to the relief of their suffering fellowsubjects we should have written mindful of the past in its stead we say this in charity as well as in truth we come of english blood and if we claim to share in all the ancient renown of that warlike and enlightened people we are equally bound to share in the reproaches that original misgovernment has inflicted on thee in this latter sense then thou hast a right to our sympathies and they are not withheld  as has been already said we now advance the time eightandforty hours and again transfer the scene to that room in the hospital which was occupied by spike the approaches of death during the interval just named had been slow but certain the surgeons had announced that the wounded man could not possibly survive the coming night and he himself had been made sensible that his end was near it is scarcely necessary to add that stephen spike conscious of his vigour and strength in command of his brig and bent on the pursuits of worldly gains or of personal gratification was a very different person from him who now lay stretched on his pallet in the hospital of key west a dying man by the side of his bed still sat his strange nurse less peculiar in appearance however than when last seen by the reader  rose budd had been ministering to the ungainly externals of jack tier she now wore a cap thus concealing the short grey bristles of hair and lending to her countenance a little of that softness which is a requisite of female character some attention had also been paid to the rest of her attire and jack was altogether less repulsive in her exterior than when unaided she had attempted to resume the proper garb of her sex use and association too had contributed a little to revive her womans nature if we may so express it and she had begun in particular to feel the sort of interest in her patient which we all come in time to entertain toward any object of our especial care we do not mean that jack had absolutely ever ceased to love her husband strange as it may seem such had not literally been the case on the contrary her interest in him and in his welfare had never ceased even while she saw his vices and detested his crimes but all we wish to say here is that she was getting in addition to the longenduring feelings of a wife some of the interest of a nurse  during the whole time which had elapsed between jacks revealing her true character and the moment of which we are now writing spike had not once spoken to his wife often had she caught his eyes intently riveted on her when he would turn them away as she feared in distaste and once or twice he groaned deeply more like a man who suffered mental than bodily pain still the patient did not speak once in all the time mentioned we should be representing poor jack as possessing more philosophy or less feeling than the truth would warrant were we to say that she was not hurt at this conduct in her husband  on the contrary she felt it deeply and more than once it had so far subdued her pride as to cause her bitterly to weep this shedding of tears however was of service to jack in one sense for it had the effect of renewing old impressions and in a certain way of reviving the nature of her sex within hera nature which had been sadly weakened by her past life  but the hour had at length come when this long and painful silence was to be broken jack and rose were alone with the patient when the last again spoke to his wife  mollypoor molly said the dying man his voice continuing full and deep to the last what a sad time you must have had of it after i did you that wrong  it is hard upon a woman stephen to turn her out helpless on a cold and selfish world answered jack simply much too honest to affect a reserve she did not feel  it was hard indeed may god forgive me for it as i hope ye do molly  no answer was made to this appeal and the invalid looked anxiously at his wife the last sat at her work which had now got to be less awkward to her with her eyes bent on her needleher countenance rigid and so far as the eye could discern her feelings unmoved  your husband speaks to you jack tier said rose pointedly  may yours never have occasion to speak to you rose budd in the same way was the solemn answer i do not flatter myself that i ever was as comely as you or that yonder poor dying wretch was a harry mulford in his youth but we were young and happy and respected once and loved each other yet you see what its all come to  rose was silenced though she had too much tenderness in behalf of her own youthful and manly bridegroom to dread a fate similar to that which had overtaken poor jack spike now seemed disposed to say something and she went to the side of his bed followed by her companion who kept a little in the background as if unwilling to let the emotion she really felt be seen and perhaps conscious that her ungainly appearance did not aid her in recovering the lost affections of her husband  i have been a very wicked man i fear said spike earnestly  there are none without sin answered rose place your reliance on the mediation of the son of god and sins even far deeper than yours may be pardoned  the captain stared at the beautiful speaker but selfindulgence the incessant pursuit of worldly and selfish objects for forty years and the habits of a life into which the thought of god and the dread hereafter never entered had encased his spiritual being in a sort of brazen armour through which no ordinary blow of conscience could penetrate still he had fearful glimpses of recent events and his soul hanging as it was over the abyss of eternity was troubled  what has become of your aunt half whispered spikemy old captains widow she ought to be here and don wan montezumawhere is he  rose turned aside to conceal her tearsbut no one answered the questions of the dying man then a gleaming of childhood shot into the recollection of spike and clasping his hands he tried to pray but like others who have lived without any communication with their creator through long lives of apathy to his existence and laws thinking only of the present time and daily hourly sacrificing principles and duty to the narrow interests of the moment he now found how hard it is to renew communications with a being who has been so long neglected the fault lay in himself however for a gracious ear was open even over the deathbed of stephen spike could that rude spirit only bring itself to ask for mercy in earnestness and truth as his companions saw his struggles they left him for a few minutes to his own thoughts  molly spike at length uttered in a faint tone the voice of one conscious of being very near his end i hope you will forgive me molly i know you must have a hard hard time of it  it is hard for a woman to unsex herself stephen to throw off her very natur as it might be and to turn man  it has changed you sadlyeven your speech is altered once your voice was soft and womanishmore like that of rose budds than it is now  i speak as them speak among whom ive been forced to live the forecastle and stewards pantry stephen spike are poor schools to send women to larn language in  try and forget it all poor molly say to me so that i can hear you i forget and forgive stephen i am afraid god will not pardon my sins which begin to seem dreadful to me if my own wife refuse to forget and forgive on my dying bed  jack was much mollified by this appeal her interest in her offending husband had never been entirely extinguished she had remembered him and often with womans kindness in all her wanderings and sufferings as the preceding parts of our narrative must show and though resentment had been mingled with the grief and mortification she felt at finding how much he still submitted to roses superior charms in a breast as really generous and humane as that of jack tiers such a feeling was not likely to endure in the midst of a scene like that she was now called to witness the muscles of her countenance twitched the hardlooking tanned face began to lose its sternness and every way she appeared like one profoundly disturbed  turn to him whose goodness and marcy may sarve you stephen she said in a milder and more feminine tone than she had used now for years making her more like herself than either her husband or rose had seen her since the commencement of the late voyage my sayin that i forget and forgive cannot help a man on his deathbed  it will settle my mind molly and leave me freer to turn my thoughts to god  jack was much affected more by the countenance and manner of the sufferer perhaps than by his words she drew nearer to the side of her husbands pallet knelt took his hands and said solemnly  stephen spike from the bottom of my heart i do forgive you and i shall pray to god that he will pardon your sins as freely and more marcifully than i now pardon all and try to forget all that you have done to me  spike clasped his hands and again he tried to pray but the habits of a whole life are not to be thrown off at will and he who endeavours to regain in his extremity the moments that have been lost will find in bitter reality that he has been heaping mountains on his own soul by the mere practice of sin which were never laid there by the original fall of his race jack however had disburthened her spirit of a load that had long oppressed it and burying her face in the rug she wept  i wish molly said the dying man several minutes later i wish i had never seen the brig until i got that craft no thought of wronging human being ever crossed my mind  it was the father of lies that tempts all to do evil stephen and not the brig which caused the sins  i wish i could live a year longeronly one year that is not much to ask for a man who is not yet sixty  it is hopeless poor stephen the surgeons say you cannot live one day  spike groanedfor the past blended fearfully with the future gleamed on his conscience with a brightness that appalled him and what is that future which is to make us happy or miserable through an endless vista of time is it not composed of an existence in which conscience released from the delusions and weaknesses of the body sees all in its true colours appreciates all and punishes all such an existence would make every man the keeper of the record of his own transgressions even to the most minute exactness it would of itself mete out perfect justice since the sin would be seen amid its accompanying facts every aggravating or extenuating circumstance each man would be strictly punished according to his talents as no one is without sin it makes the necessity of an atonement indispensable and in its most rigid interpretation it exhibits the truth of the scheme of salvation in the clearest colours the soul or conscience that can admit the necessary degree of faith in that atonement and in admitting feels its efficacy throws the burthen of its own transgressions away and remains for ever in the condition of its original existence pure and consequently happy  we do not presume to lay down a creed on this mighty and mysterious matter in which all have so deep an interest and concerning which so very small a portion of the human race think much or think with any clearness when it does become the subject of their passing thoughts at all we too well know our own ignorance to venture on dogmas which it has probably been intended that the mind of man should not yet grapple with and comprehend to return to our subject  stephen spike was now made to feel the incubusload which perseverance in sin heaps on the breast of the reckless offender what was the most grievous of all his power to shake off this dead weight was diminished in precisely the same proportion as the burthen was increased the moral force of every man lessening in a very just ratio to the magnitude of his delinquencies bitterly did this deep offender struggle with his conscience and little did his halfunsexed wife know how to console or aid him jack had been superficially instructed in the dogmas of her faith in childhood and youth as most persons are instructed in what are termed christian communitieshad been made to learn the catechism the lords prayer and the creedand had been left to set up for herself on this small capital in the great concern of human existence on her marriage and entrance on the active business of life when the manner in which she had passed the last twenty years is remembered no one can be surprised to learn that jack was of little assistance to her husband in his extremity rose made an effort to administer hope and consolation but the terrible nature of the struggle she witnessed induced her to send for the chaplain of the poughkeepsie this divine prayed with the dying man but even he in the last moments of the sufferer was little more than a passive but shocked witness of remorse suspended over the abyss of eternity in hopeless dread we shall not enter into the details of the revolting scene but simply add that curses blasphemy tremulous cries for mercy agonized entreaties to be advised and sullen defiance were all strangely and fearfully blended in the midst of one of these revolting paroxysms spike breathed his last a few hours later his body was interred in the sands of the shore it may be well to say in this place that the hurricane of 1846 which is known to have occurred only a few months later swept off the frail covering and that the body was washed away to leave its bones among the wrecks and relics of the florida reef  mulford did not return from his fruitless expedition in quest of the remains of mrs budd until after the death and interment of spike as nothing remained to be done at key west he and rose accompanied by jack tier took passage for charleston in the first convenient vessel that offered two days before they sailed the poughkeepsie went out to cruise in the gulf agreeably to her general orders the evening previously captain mull wallace and the chaplain passed with the bridegroom and bride when the matter of the doubloons found in the boat was discussed it was agreed that jack tier should have them and into her hands the bag was now placed on this occasion to oblige the officers jack went into a narrative of all she had seen and suffered from the moment when abandoned by her late husband down to that when she found him again it was a strange account and one filled with surprising adventures in most of the vessels in which she had served jack had acted in the stewards department though she had frequently done duty as a foremast hand in strength and skill she admitted that she had often failed but in courage never having been given reason to think her husband was reduced to serving in a vessel of war she had shipped on board a frigate bound to the mediterranean and had actually made a whole cruise as a wardroom boy on that station while thus employed she had met with two of the gentlemen present captain mull and mr wallace the former was then firstlieutenant of the frigate and the latter a passedmidshipman and in these capacities both had been well known to her as the name she then bore was the same as that under which she now hailed these officers were soon made to recollect her though jack was no longer the light trimbuilt lad he had then appeared to be neither of the gentlemen named had made the whole cruise in the ship but each had been promoted and transferred to another craft after being jacks shipmate rather more than a year this information greatly facilitated the affair of the doubloons  from charleston the travellers came north by railroad harry made several stops by the way in order to divert the thoughts of his beautiful young bride from dwelling too much on the fate of her aunt he knew that home would revive all these recollections painfully and wished to put off the hour of their return until time had a little weakened roses regrets for this reason he passed a whole week in washington though it was a season of the year that the place is not in much request still washington is scarce a town at any season it is much the fashion to deride the american capital and to treat it as a place of very humble performance with very sounding pretensions certainly washington has very few of the peculiarities of a great european capital but few as these are they are more than belong to any other place in this country we now allude to the distinctive characteristics of a capital and not to a mere concentration of houses and shops within a given space in this last respect washington is much behind fifty other american towns even while it is the only place in the whole republic which possesses specimens of architecture on a scale approaching that of the higher classes of the edifices of the old world it is totally deficient in churches and theatres and markets or those it does possess are in an architectural sense not at all above the level of village or countrytown pretensions but one or two of its national edifices do approach the magnificence and grandeur of the old world the new treasury buildings are unquestionably on the score of size embellishments and finish the american edifice that comes nearest to first class architecture on the other side of the atlantic the capitol comes next though it can scarce be ranked relatively as high as for the white house it is every way sufficient for its purposes and the institutions and now that its grounds are finished and the shrubbery and trees begin to tell one sees about it something that is not unworthy of its high uses and origin those grounds which so long lay a reproach to the national taste and liberality are now fast becoming beautiful are already exceedingly pretty and give to a structure that is destined to become historical having already associated with it the names of jefferson madison jackson and quincy adams together with the ci polloi of the later presidents an entourage that is suitable to its past recollections and its present purposes they are not quite on a level with the parks of london it is true or even with the tuileries or luxembourg or the boboli or the villa reale or fifty more grounds and gardens of a similar nature that might be mentioned but seen in the spring and early summer they adorn the building they surround and lend to the whole neighbourhood a character of high civilization that no other place in america can show in precisely the same form or to the same extent  this much have we said on the subject of the white house and its precincts because we took occasion in a former work to berate the narrowminded parsimony which left the grounds of the white house in a condition that was discreditable to the republic how far our philippic may have hastened the improvements which have been made is more than we shall pretend to say but having made the former strictures we are happy to have an occasion to say though nearly twenty years have intervened between the expressions of the two opinions that they are no longer merited  and here we will add another word and that on a subject that is not sufficiently pressed on the attention of a people who by position are unavoidably provincial we invite those whose gorges rise at any stricture on anything american and who fancy it is enough to belong to the great republic to be great in itself to place themselves in front of the state department as it now stands and to examine its dimensions material and form with critical eyes then to look along the adjacent treasury buildings to fancy them completed by a junction with new edifices of a similar construction to contain the department of state next to fancy similar works completed for the two opposite departments after which to compare the past and present with the future as thus finished and remember how recent has been the partial improvement which even now exists if this examination and comparison do not show directly to the sense of sight how much there was and is to criticise as put in contrast with other countries we shall give up the individuals in question as too deeply dyed in the provincial wool ever to be whitened the present trinity church new york certainly not more than a third class european church if as much compared with its villagelike predecessor may supply a practical homily of the same degree of usefulness there may be those among us however who fancy it patriotism to maintain that the old treasury buildings were quite equal to the new and of these intense americans we cry their mercy  rose felt keenly on reaching her late aunts very neat dwelling in fourteenth street new york but the manly tenderness of mulford was a great support to her and a little time brought her to think of that weakminded but wellmeaning and affectionate relative with gentle regret rather than with grief among the connexions of her young husband she found several females of a class in life certainly equal to her own and somewhat superior to the latter in education and habits as for harry he very gladly passed the season with his beautiful bride though a fine ship was laid down for him by means of roses fortune now much increased by her aunts death and he was absent in europe when his son was born an event that occurred only two months since  the swash and the shipment of gunpowder were thought of no more in the good town of manhattan this great emporiumwe beg pardon this great commercial emporiumhas a trick of forgetting condensing all interests into those of the present moment it is much addicted to believing that which never had an existence and of overlooking that which is occurring directly under its nose so marked is this tendency to forgetfulness we should not be surprised to hear some of the manhattanese pretend that our legend is nothing but a fiction and deny the existence of the molly captain spike and even of biddy noon but we know them too well to mind what they say and shall go on and finish our narrative in our own way just as if there were no such raventhroated commentators at all  jack tier still known by that name lives in the family of captain mulford she is fast losing the tan on her face and hands and every day is improving in appearance she now habitually wears her proper attire and is dropping gradually into the feelings and habits of her sex she never can become what she once was any more than the blackamoor can become white or the leopard change his spots but she is no longer revolting she has left off chewing and smoking having found a refuge in snuff her hair is permitted to grow and is already turned up with a comb though constantly concealed beneath a cap the heart of jack alone seems unaltered the strange tigerlike affection that she bore for spike during twenty years of abandonment has disappeared in regrets for his end it is succeeded by a most sincere attachment for rose in which the little boy since his appearance on the scene is becoming a large participator this child jack is beginning to love intensely and the doubloons well invested placing her above the feeling of dependence she is likely to end her life once so errant and disturbed in tranquillity and a homelike happiness  the end
