consecrate with tears   these idylls                 and indeed he seems to me   scarce other than my kings ideal knight   who reverenced his conscience as his king   whose glory was redressing human wrong   who spake no slander no nor listened to it   who loved one only and who clave to her   herover all whose realms to their last isle   commingled with the gloom of imminent war   the shadow of his loss drew like eclipse   darkening the world  we have lost him  he is gone   we know him now  all narrow jealousies   are silent and we see him as he moved   how modest kindly allaccomplished wise   with what sublime repression of himself   and in what limits and how tenderly   not swaying to this faction or to that   not making his high place the lawless perch   of winged ambitions nor a vantageground   for pleasure but through all this tract of years   wearing the white flower of a blameless life   before a thousand peering littlenesses   in that fierce light which beats upon a throne   and blackens every blot  for where is he   who dares foreshadow for an only son   a lovelier life a more unstained than his   or how should england dreaming of his sons   hope more for these than some inheritance   of such a life a heart a mind as thine   thou noble father of her kings to be   laborious for her people and her poor   voice in the rich dawn of an ampler day   farsighted summoner of war and waste   to fruitful strifes and rivalries of peace   sweet nature gilded by the gracious gleam   of letters dear to science dear to art   dear to thy land and ours a prince indeed   beyond all titles and a household name   hereafter through all times albert the good       break not o womansheart but still endure   break not for thou art royal but endure   remembering all the beauty of that star   which shone so close beside thee that ye made   one light together but has past and leaves   the crown a lonely splendour                                 may all love   his love unseen but felt oershadow thee   the love of all thy sons encompass thee   the love of all thy daughters cherish thee   the love of all thy people comfort thee   till gods love set thee at his side again      the coming of arthur    leodogran the king of cameliard   had one fair daughter and none other child   and she was the fairest of all flesh on earth   guinevere and in her his one delight       for many a petty king ere arthur came   ruled in this isle and ever waging war   each upon other wasted all the land   and still from time to time the heathen host   swarmed overseas and harried what was left   and so there grew great tracts of wilderness   wherein the beast was ever more and more   but man was less and less till arthur came   for first aurelius lived and fought and died   and after him king uther fought and died   but either failed to make the kingdom one   and after these king arthur for a space   and through the puissance of his table round   drew all their petty princedoms under him   their king and head and made a realm and reigned       and thus the land of cameliard was waste   thick with wet woods and many a beast therein   and none or few to scare or chase the beast   so that wild dog and wolf and boar and bear   came night and day and rooted in the fields   and wallowed in the gardens of the king   and ever and anon the wolf would steal   the children and devour but now and then   her own brood lost or dead lent her fierce teat   to human sucklings and the children housed   in her foul den there at their meat would growl   and mock their foster mother on four feet   till straightened they grew up to wolflike men   worse than the wolves  and king leodogran   groaned for the roman legions here again   and caesars eagle  then his brother king   urien assailed him  last a heathen horde   reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood   and on the spike that split the mothers heart   spitting the child brake on him till amazed   he knew not whither he should turn for aid       butfor he heard of arthur newly crowned   though not without an uproar made by those   who cried he is not uthers sonthe king   sent to him saying arise and help us thou   for here between the man and beast we die       and arthur yet had done no deed of arms   but heard the call and came  and guinevere   stood by the castle walls to watch him pass   but since he neither wore on helm or shield   the golden symbol of his kinglihood   but rode a simple knight among his knights   and many of these in richer arms than he   she saw him not or marked not if she saw   one among many though his face was bare   but arthur looking downward as he past   felt the light of her eyes into his life   smite on the sudden yet rode on and pitched   his tents beside the forest  then he drave   the heathen after slew the beast and felled   the forest letting in the sun and made   broad pathways for the hunter and the knight   and so returned                    for while he lingered there   a doubt that ever smouldered in the hearts   of those great lords and barons of his realm   flashed forth and into war  for most of these   colleaguing with a score of petty kings   made head against him crying who is he   that he should rule us who hath proven him   king uthers son for lo we look at him   and find nor face nor bearing limbs nor voice   are like to those of uther whom we knew   this is the son of gorlois not the king   this is the son of anton not the king       and arthur passing thence to battle felt   travail and throes and agonies of the life   desiring to be joined with guinevere   and thinking as he rode her father said   that there between the man and beast they die   shall i not lift her from this land of beasts   up to my throne and side by side with me   what happiness to reign a lonely king   vexto ye stars that shudder over me   o earth that soundest hollow under me   vext with waste dreams for saving i be joined   to her that is the fairest under heaven   i seem as nothing in the mighty world   and cannot will my will nor work my work   wholly nor make myself in mine own realm   victor and lord  but were i joined with her   then might we live together as one life   and reigning with one will in everything   have power on this dark land to lighten it   and power on this dead world to make it live       thereafteras he speaks who tells the tale   when arthur reached a fieldofbattle bright   with pitched pavilions of his foe the world   was all so clear about him that he saw   the smallest rock far on the faintest hill   and even in high day the morning star   so when the king had set his banner broad   at once from either side with trumpetblast   and shouts and clarions shrilling unto blood   the longlanced battle let their horses run   and now the barons and the kings prevailed   and now the king as here and there that war   went swaying but the powers who walk the world   made lightnings and great thunders over him   and dazed all eyes till arthur by main might   and mightier of his hands with every blow   and leading all his knighthood threw the kings   carados urien cradlemont of wales   claudias and clariance of northumberland   the king brandagoras of latangor   with anguisant of erin morganore   and lot of orkney  then before a voice   as dreadful as the shout of one who sees   to one who sins and deems himself alone   and all the world asleep they swerved and brake   flying and arthur called to stay the brands   that hacked among the flyers ho they yield   so like a painted battle the war stood   silenced the living quiet as the dead   and in the heart of arthur joy was lord   he laughed upon his warrior whom he loved   and honoured most  thou dost not doubt me king   so well thine arm hath wrought for me today   sir and my liege he cried the fire of god   descends upon thee in the battlefield   i know thee for my king  whereat the two   for each had warded either in the fight   sware on the field of death a deathless love   and arthur said mans word is god in man   let chance what will i trust thee to the death       then quickly from the foughten field he sent   ulfius and brastias and bedivere   his newmade knights to king leodogran   saying if i in aught have served thee well   give me thy daughter guinevere to wife       whom when he heard leodogran in heart   debatinghow should i that am a king   however much he holp me at my need   give my one daughter saving to a king   and a kings sonlifted his voice and called   a hoary man his chamberlain to whom   he trusted all things and of him required   his counsel  knowest thou aught of arthurs birth       then spake the hoary chamberlain and said   sir king there be but two old men that know   and each is twice as old as i and one   is merlin the wise man that ever served   king uther through his magic art and one   is merlins master so they call him bleys   who taught him magic but the scholar ran   before the master and so far that bleys   laid magic by and sat him down and wrote   all things and whatsoever merlin did   in one great annalbook where afteryears   will learn the secret of our arthurs birth       to whom the king leodogran replied   o friend had i been holpen half as well   by this king arthur as by thee today   then beast and man had had their share of me   but summon here before us yet once more   ulfius and brastias and bedivere       then when they came before him the king said   i have seen the cuckoo chased by lesser fowl   and reason in the chase  but wherefore now   do these your lords stir up the heat of war   some calling arthur born of gorlois   others of anton  tell me ye yourselves   hold ye this arthur for king uthers son       and ulfius and brastias answered ay   then bedivere the first of all his knights   knighted by arthur at his crowning spake   for bold in heart and act and word was he   whenever slander breathed against the king       sir there be many rumours on this head   for there be those who hate him in their hearts   call him baseborn and since his ways are sweet   and theirs are bestial hold him less than man   and there be those who deem him more than man   and dream he dropt from heaven  but my belief   in all this matterso ye care to learn   sir for ye know that in king uthers time   the prince and warrior gorlois he that held   tintagil castle by the cornish sea   was wedded with a winsome wife ygerne   and daughters had she borne himone whereof   lots wife the queen of orkney bellicent   hath ever like a loyal sister cleaved   to arthurbut a son she had not borne   and uther cast upon her eyes of love   but she a stainless wife to gorlois   so loathed the bright dishonour of his love   that gorlois and king uther went to war   and overthrown was gorlois and slain   then uther in his wrath and heat besieged   ygerne within tintagil where her men   seeing the mighty swarm about their walls   left her and fled and uther entered in   and there was none to call to but himself   so compassed by the power of the king   enforced was she to wed him in her tears   and with a shameful swiftness  afterward   not many moons king uther died himself   moaning and wailing for an heir to rule   after him lest the realm should go to wrack   and that same night the night of the new year   by reason of the bitterness and grief   that vext his mother all before his time   was arthur born and all as soon as born   delivered at a secret posterngate   to merlin to be holden far apart   until his hour should come because the lords   of that fierce day were as the lords of this   wild beasts and surely would have torn the child   piecemeal among them had they known for each   but sought to rule for his own self and hand   and many hated uther for the sake   of gorlois  wherefore merlin took the child   and gave him to sir anton an old knight   and ancient friend of uther and his wife   nursed the young prince and reared him with her own   and no man knew  and ever since the lords   have foughten like wild beasts among themselves   so that the realm has gone to wrack  but now   this year when merlin for his hour had come   brought arthur forth and set him in the hall   proclaiming here is uthers heir your king   a hundred voices cried away with him   no king of ours a son of gorlois he   or else the child of anton and no king   or else baseborn  yet merlin through his craft   and while the people clamoured for a king   had arthur crowned but after the great lords   banded and so brake out in open war       then while the king debated with himself   if arthur were the child of shamefulness   or born the son of gorlois after death   or uthers son and born before his time   or whether there were truth in anything   said by these three there came to cameliard   with gawain and young modred her two sons   lots wife the queen of orkney bellicent   whom as he could not as he would the king   made feast for saying as they sat at meat       a doubtful throne is ice on summer seas   ye come from arthurs court  victor his men   report him  yea but yethink ye this king   so many those that hate him and so strong   so few his knights however brave they be   hath body enow to hold his foemen down       o king she cried and i will tell thee  few   few but all brave all of one mind with him   for i was near him when the savage yells   of uthers peerage died and arthur sat   crowned on the dais and his warriors cried   be thou the king and we will work thy will   who love thee  then the king in low deep tones   and simple words of great authority   bound them by so strait vows to his own self   that when they rose knighted from kneeling some   were pale as at the passing of a ghost   some flushed and others dazed as one who wakes   halfblinded at the coming of a light       but when he spake and cheered his table round   with large divine and comfortable words   beyond my tongue to tell theei beheld   from eye to eye through all their order flash   a momentary likeness of the king   and ere it left their faces through the cross   and those around it and the crucified   down from the casement over arthur smote   flamecolour vert and azure in three rays   one falling upon each of three fair queens   who stood in silence near his throne the friends   of arthur gazing on him tall with bright   sweet faces who will help him at his need       and there i saw mage merlin whose vast wit   and hundred winters are but as the hands   of loyal vassals toiling for their liege       and near him stood the lady of the lake   who knows a subtler magic than his own   clothed in white samite mystic wonderful   she gave the king his huge crosshilted sword   whereby to drive the heathen out  a mist   of incense curled about her and her face   wellnigh was hidden in the minster gloom   but there was heard among the holy hymns   a voice as of the waters for she dwells   down in a deep calm whatsoever storms   may shake the world and when the surface rolls   hath power to walk the waters like our lord       there likewise i beheld excalibur   before him at his crowning borne the sword   that rose from out the bosom of the lake   and arthur rowed across and took itrich   with jewels elfin urim on the hilt   bewildering heart and eyethe blade so bright   that men are blinded by iton one side   graven in the oldest tongue of all this world   take me but turn the blade and ye shall see   and written in the speech ye speak yourself   cast me away  and sad was arthurs face   taking it but old merlin counselled him   take thou and strike the time to cast away   is yet faroff  so this great brand the king   took and by this will beat his foemen down       thereat leodogran rejoiced but thought   to sift his doubtings to the last and asked   fixing full eyes of question on her face   the swallow and the swift are near akin   but thou art closer to this noble prince   being his own dear sister and she said   daughter of gorlois and ygerne am i   and therefore arthurs sister asked the king   she answered these be secret things and signed   to those two sons to pass and let them be   and gawain went and breaking into song   sprang out and followed by his flying hair   ran like a colt and leapt at all he saw   but modred laid his ear beside the doors   and there halfheard the same that afterward   struck for the throne and striking found his doom       and then the queen made answer what know i   for dark my mother was in eyes and hair   and dark in hair and eyes am i and dark   was gorlois yea and dark was uther too   wellnigh to blackness but this king is fair   beyond the race of britons and of men   moreover always in my mind i hear   a cry from out the dawning of my life   a mother weeping and i hear her say   o that ye had some brother pretty one   to guard thee on the rough ways of the world       ay said the king and hear ye such a cry   but when did arthur chance upon thee first       o king she cried and i will tell thee true   he found me first when yet a little maid   beaten i had been for a little fault   whereof i was not guilty and out i ran   and flung myself down on a bank of heath   and hated this fair world and all therein   and wept and wished that i were dead and he   i know not whether of himself he came   or brought by merlin who they say can walk   unseen at pleasurehe was at my side   and spake sweet words and comforted my heart   and dried my tears being a child with me   and many a time he came and evermore   as i grew greater grew with me and sad   at times he seemed and sad with him was i   stern too at times and then i loved him not   but sweet again and then i loved him well   and now of late i see him less and less   but those first days had golden hours for me   for then i surely thought he would be king       but let me tell thee now another tale   for bleys our merlins master as they say   died but of late and sent his cry to me   to hear him speak before he left his life   shrunk like a fairy changeling lay the mage   and when i entered told me that himself   and merlin ever served about the king   uther before he died and on the night   when uther in tintagil past away   moaning and wailing for an heir the two   left the still king and passing forth to breathe   then from the castle gateway by the chasm   descending through the dismal nighta night   in which the bounds of heaven and earth were lost   beheld so high upon the dreary deeps   it seemed in heaven a ship the shape thereof   a dragon winged and all from stern to stern   bright with a shining people on the decks   and gone as soon as seen  and then the two   dropt to the cove and watched the great sea fall   wave after wave each mightier than the last   till last a ninth one gathering half the deep   and full of voices slowly rose and plunged   roaring and all the wave was in a flame   and down the wave and in the flame was borne   a naked babe and rode to merlins feet   who stoopt and caught the babe and cried the king   here is an heir for uther  and the fringe   of that great breaker sweeping up the strand   lashed at the wizard as he spake the word   and all at once all round him rose in fire   so that the child and he were clothed in fire   and presently thereafter followed calm   free sky and stars  and this the same child he said   is he who reigns nor could i part in peace   till this were told  and saying this the seer   went through the strait and dreadful pass of death   not ever to be questioned any more   save on the further side but when i met   merlin and asked him if these things were truth   the shining dragon and the naked child   descending in the glory of the seas   he laughed as is his wont and answered me   in riddling triplets of old time and said       rain rain and sun a rainbow in the sky   a young man will be wiser by and by   an old mans wit may wander ere he die      rain rain and sun a rainbow on the lea   and truth is this to me and that to thee   and truth or clothed or naked let it be      rain sun and rain and the free blossom blows   sun rain and sun and where is he who knows   from the great deep to the great deep he goes       so merlin riddling angered me but thou   fear not to give this king thy only child   guinevere  so great bards of him will sing   hereafter and dark sayings from of old   ranging and ringing through the minds of men   and echoed by old folk beside their fires   for comfort after their wagework is done   speak of the king and merlin in our time   hath spoken also not in jest and sworn   though men may wound him that he will not die   but pass again to come and then or now   utterly smite the heathen underfoot   till these and all men hail him for their king       she spake and king leodogran rejoiced   but musing shall i answer yea or nay   doubted and drowsed nodded and slept and saw   dreaming a slope of land that ever grew   field after field up to a height the peak   hazehidden and thereon a phantom king   now looming and now lost and on the slope   the sword rose the hind fell the herd was driven   fire glimpsed and all the land from roof and rick   in drifts of smoke before a rolling wind   streamed to the peak and mingled with the haze   and made it thicker while the phantom king   sent out at times a voice and here or there   stood one who pointed toward the voice the rest   slew on and burnt crying no king of ours   no son of uther and no king of ours   till with a wink his dream was changed the haze   descended and the solid earth became   as nothing but the king stood out in heaven   crowned  and leodogran awoke and sent   ulfius and brastias and bedivere   back to the court of arthur answering yea       then arthur charged his warrior whom he loved   and honoured most sir lancelot to ride forth   and bring the queenand watched him from the gates   and lancelot past away among the flowers   for then was latter april and returned   among the flowers in may with guinevere   to whom arrived by dubric the high saint   chief of the church in britain and before   the stateliest of her altarshrines the king   that morn was married while in stainless white   the fair beginners of a nobler time   and glorying in their vows and him his knights   stood around him and rejoicing in his joy   far shone the fields of may through open door   the sacred altar blossomed white with may   the sun of may descended on their king   they gazed on all earths beauty in their queen   rolled incense and there past along the hymns   a voice as of the waters while the two   sware at the shrine of christ a deathless love   and arthur said behold thy doom is mine   let chance what will i love thee to the death   to whom the queen replied with drooping eyes   king and my lord i love thee to the death   and holy dubric spread his hands and spake   reign ye and live and love and make the world   other and may thy queen be one with thee   and all this order of thy table round   fulfil the boundless purpose of their king       so dubric said but when they left the shrine   great lords from rome before the portal stood   in scornful stillness gazing as they past   then while they paced a city all on fire   with sun and cloth of gold the trumpets blew   and arthurs knighthood sang before the king       blow trumpet for the world is white with may   blow trumpet the long night hath rolled away   blow through the living worldlet the king reign       shall rome or heathen rule in arthurs realm   flash brand and lance fall battleaxe upon helm   fall battleaxe and flash brand  let the king reign       strike for the king and live his knights have heard   that god hath told the king a secret word   fall battleaxe and flash brand  let the king reign       blow trumpet he will lift us from the dust   blow trumpet live the strength and die the lust   clang battleaxe and clash brand  let the king reign       strike for the king and die and if thou diest   the king is king and ever wills the highest   clang battleaxe and clash brand  let the king reign       blow for our sun is mighty in his may   blow for our sun is mightier day by day   clang battleaxe and clash brand  let the king reign       the king will follow christ and we the king   in whom high god hath breathed a secret thing   fall battleaxe and flash brand  let the king reign       so sang the knighthood moving to their hall   there at the banquet those great lords from rome   the slowlyfading mistress of the world   strode in and claimed their tribute as of yore   but arthur spake behold for these have sworn   to wage my wars and worship me their king   the old order changeth yielding place to new   and we that fight for our fair father christ   seeing that ye be grown too weak and old   to drive the heathen from your roman wall   no tribute will we pay so those great lords   drew back in wrath and arthur strove with rome       and arthur and his knighthood for a space   were all one will and through that strength the king   drew in the petty princedoms under him   fought and in twelve great battles overcame   the heathen hordes and made a realm and reigned      gareth and lynette    the last tall son of lot and bellicent   and tallest gareth in a showerful spring   stared at the spate  a slendershafted pine   lost footing fell and so was whirled away   how he went down said gareth as a false knight   or evil king before my lance if lance   were mine to useo senseless cataract   bearing all down in thy precipitancy   and yet thou art but swollen with cold snows   and mine is living blood  thou dost his will   the makers and not knowest and i that know   have strength and wit in my good mothers hall   linger with vacillating obedience   prisoned and kept and coaxed and whistled to   since the good mother holds me still a child   good mother is bad mother unto me   a worse were better yet no worse would i   heaven yield her for it but in me put force   to weary her ears with one continuous prayer   until she let me fly discaged to sweep   in everhighering eaglecircles up   to the great sun of glory and thence swoop   down upon all things base and dash them dead   a knight of arthur working out his will   to cleanse the world  why gawain when he came   with modred hither in the summertime   asked me to tilt with him the proven knight   modred for want of worthier was the judge   then i so shook him in the saddle he said   thou hast half prevailed against me said sohe   though modred biting his thin lips was mute   for he is alway sullen  what care i       and gareth went and hovering round her chair   asked mother though ye count me still the child   sweet mother do ye love the child  she laughed   thou art but a wildgoose to question it   then mother an ye love the child he said   being a goose and rather tame than wild   hear the childs story  yea my wellbeloved   an twere but of the goose and golden eggs       and gareth answered her with kindling eyes   nay nay good mother but this egg of mine   was finer gold than any goose can lay   for this an eagle a royal eagle laid   almost beyond eyereach on such a palm   as glitters gilded in thy book of hours   and there was ever haunting round the palm   a lusty youth but poor who often saw   the splendour sparkling from aloft and thought   an i could climb and lay my hand upon it   then were i wealthier than a leash of kings   but ever when he reached a hand to climb   one that had loved him from his childhood caught   and stayed him climb not lest thou break thy neck   i charge thee by my love and so the boy   sweet mother neither clomb nor brake his neck   but brake his very heart in pining for it   and past away                   to whom the mother said   true love sweet son had risked himself and climbed   and handed down the golden treasure to him       and gareth answered her with kindling eyes   gold said i golday then why he or she   or whosoeer it was or half the world   had venturedhad the thing i spake of been   mere goldbut this was all of that true steel   whereof they forged the brand excalibur   and lightnings played about it in the storm   and all the little fowl were flurried at it   and there were cries and clashings in the nest   that sent him from his senses  let me go       then bellicent bemoaned herself and said   hast thou no pity upon my loneliness   lo where thy father lot beside the hearth   lies like a log and all but smouldered out   for ever since when traitor to the king   he fought against him in the barons war   and arthur gave him back his territory   his age hath slowly droopt and now lies there   a yetwarm corpse and yet unburiable   no more nor sees nor hears nor speaks nor knows   and both thy brethren are in arthurs hall   albeit neither loved with that full love   i feel for thee nor worthy such a love   stay therefore thou red berries charm the bird   and thee mine innocent the jousts the wars   who never knewest fingerache nor pang   of wrenched or broken limban often chance   in those brainstunning shocks and tourneyfalls   frights to my heart but stay  follow the deer   by these tall firs and our fastfalling burns   so make thy manhood mightier day by day   sweet is the chase  and i will seek thee out   some comfortable bride and fair to grace   thy climbing life and cherish my prone year   till falling into lots forgetfulness   i know not thee myself nor anything   stay my best son ye are yet more boy than man       then gareth an ye hold me yet for child   hear yet once more the story of the child   for mother there was once a king like ours   the prince his heir when tall and marriageable   asked for a bride and thereupon the king   set two before him  one was fair strong armed   but to be won by forceand many men   desired her one good lack no man desired   and these were the conditions of the king   that save he won the first by force he needs   must wed that other whom no man desired   a redfaced bride who knew herself so vile   that evermore she longed to hide herself   nor fronted man or woman eye to eye   yeasome she cleaved to but they died of her   and onethey called her fame and oneo mother   how can ye keep me tethered to youshame   man am i grown a mans work must i do   follow the deer follow the christ the king   live pure speak true right wrong follow the king   else wherefore born                          to whom the mother said   sweet son for there be many who deem him not   or will not deem him wholly proven king   albeit in mine own heart i knew him king   when i was frequent with him in my youth   and heard him kingly speak and doubted him   no more than he himself but felt him mine   of closest kin to me  yetwilt thou leave   thine easeful biding here and risk thine all   life limbs for one that is not proven king   stay till the cloud that settles round his birth   hath lifted but a little  stay sweet son       and gareth answered quickly not an hour   so that ye yield mei will walk through fire   mother to gain ityour full leave to go   not proven who swept the dust of ruined rome   from off the threshold of the realm and crushed   the idolaters and made the people free   who should be king save him who makes us free       so when the queen who long had sought in vain   to break him from the intent to which he grew   found her sons will unwaveringly one   she answered craftily will ye walk through fire   who walks through fire will hardly heed the smoke   ay go then an ye must  only one proof   before thou ask the king to make thee knight   of thine obedience and thy love to me   thy motheri demand                          and gareth cried   a hard one or a hundred so i go   nayquick the proof to prove me to the quick       but slowly spake the mother looking at him   prince thou shalt go disguised to arthurs hall   and hire thyself to serve for meats and drinks   among the scullions and the kitchenknaves   and those that hand the dish across the bar   nor shalt thou tell thy name to anyone   and thou shalt serve a twelvemonth and a day       for so the queen believed that when her son   beheld his only way to glory lead   low down through villain kitchenvassalage   her own true gareth was too princelyproud   to pass thereby so should he rest with her   closed in her castle from the sound of arms       silent awhile was gareth then replied   the thrall in person may be free in soul   and i shall see the jousts  thy son am i   and since thou art my mother must obey   i therefore yield me freely to thy will   for hence will i disguised and hire myself   to serve with scullions and with kitchenknaves   nor tell my name to anyno not the king       gareth awhile lingered  the mothers eye   full of the wistful fear that he would go   and turning toward him wheresoeer he turned   perplext his outward purpose till an hour   when wakened by the wind which with full voice   swept bellowing through the darkness on to dawn   he rose and out of slumber calling two   that still had tended on him from his birth   before the wakeful mother heard him went       the three were clad like tillers of the soil   southward they set their faces  the birds made   melody on branch and melody in mid air   the damp hillslopes were quickened into green   and the live green had kindled into flowers   for it was past the time of easterday       so when their feet were planted on the plain   that broadened toward the base of camelot   far off they saw the silvermisty morn   rolling her smoke about the royal mount   that rose between the forest and the field   at times the summit of the high city flashed   at times the spires and turrets halfway down   pricked through the mist at times the great gate shone   only that opened on the field below   anon the whole fair city had disappeared       then those who went with gareth were amazed   one crying let us go no further lord   here is a city of enchanters built   by fairy kings  the second echoed him   lord we have heard from our wise man at home   to northward that this king is not the king   but only changeling out of fairyland   who drave the heathen hence by sorcery   and merlins glamour  then the first again   lord there is no such city anywhere   but all a vision                      gareth answered them   with laughter swearing he had glamour enow   in his own blood his princedom youth and hopes   to plunge old merlin in the arabian sea   so pushed them all unwilling toward the gate   and there was no gate like it under heaven   for barefoot on the keystone which was lined   and rippled like an everfleeting wave   the lady of the lake stood  all her dress   wept from her sides as water flowing away   but like the cross her great and goodly arms   stretched under the cornice and upheld   and drops of water fell from either hand   and down from one a sword was hung from one   a censer either worn with wind and storm   and oer her breast floated the sacred fish   and in the space to left of her and right   were arthurs wars in weird devices done   new things and old cotwisted as if time   were nothing so inveterately that men   were giddy gazing there and over all   high on the top were those three queens the friends   of arthur who should help him at his need       then those with gareth for so long a space   stared at the figures that at last it seemed   the dragonboughts and elvish emblemings   began to move seethe twine and curl  they called   to gareth lord the gateway is alive       and gareth likewise on them fixt his eyes   so long that even to him they seemed to move   out of the city a blast of music pealed   back from the gate started the three to whom   from out thereunder came an ancient man   longbearded saying who be ye my sons       then gareth we be tillers of the soil   who leaving share in furrow come to see   the glories of our king  but these my men   your city moved so weirdly in the mist   doubt if the king be king at all or come   from fairyland and whether this be built   by magic and by fairy kings and queens   or whether there be any city at all   or all a vision  and this music now   hath scared them both but tell thou these the truth       then that old seer made answer playing on him   and saying son i have seen the good ship sail   keel upward and mast downward in the heavens   and solid turrets topsyturvy in air   and here is truth but an it please thee not   take thou the truth as thou hast told it me   for truly as thou sayest a fairy king   and fairy queens have built the city son   they came from out a sacred mountaincleft   toward the sunrise each with harp in hand   and built it to the music of their harps   and as thou sayest it is enchanted son   for there is nothing in it as it seems   saving the king though some there be that hold   the king a shadow and the city real   yet take thou heed of him for so thou pass   beneath this archway then wilt thou become   a thrall to his enchantments for the king   will bind thee by such vows as is a shame   a man should not be bound by yet the which   no man can keep but so thou dread to swear   pass not beneath this gateway but abide   without among the cattle of the field   for an ye heard a music like enow   they are building still seeing the city is built   to music therefore never built at all   and therefore built for ever                                  gareth spake   angered old master reverence thine own beard   that looks as white as utter truth and seems   wellnigh as long as thou art statured tall   why mockest thou the stranger that hath been   to thee fairspoken                         but the seer replied   know ye not then the riddling of the bards   confusion and illusion and relation   elusion and occasion and evasion   i mock thee not but as thou mockest me   and all that see thee for thou art not who   thou seemest but i know thee who thou art   and now thou goest up to mock the king   who cannot brook the shadow of any lie       unmockingly the mocker ending here   turned to the right and past along the plain   whom gareth looking after said my men   our one white lie sits like a little ghost   here on the threshold of our enterprise   let love be blamed for it not she nor i   well we will make amends                               with all good cheer   he spake and laughed then entered with his twain   camelot a city of shadowy palaces   and stately rich in emblem and the work   of ancient kings who did their days in stone   which merlins hand the mage at arthurs court   knowing all arts had touched and everywhere   at arthurs ordinance tipt with lessening peak   and pinnacle and had made it spire to heaven   and ever and anon a knight would pass   outward or inward to the hall  his arms   clashed and the sound was good to gareths ear   and out of bower and casement shyly glanced   eyes of pure women wholesome stars of love   and all about a healthful people stept   as in the presence of a gracious king       then into hall gareth ascending heard   a voice the voice of arthur and beheld   far over heads in that longvaulted hall   the splendour of the presence of the king   throned and delivering doomand looked no more   but felt his young heart hammering in his ears   and thought for this halfshadow of a lie   the truthful king will doom me when i speak   yet pressing on though all in fear to find   sir gawain or sir modred saw nor one   nor other but in all the listening eyes   of those tall knights that ranged about the throne   clear honour shining like the dewy star   of dawn and faith in their great king with pure   affection and the light of victory   and glory gained and evermore to gain      then came a widow crying to the king   a boon sir king  thy father uther reft   from my dead lord a field with violence   for howsoeer at first he proffered gold   yet for the field was pleasant in our eyes   we yielded not and then he reft us of it   perforce and left us neither gold nor field       said arthur whether would ye gold or field   to whom the woman weeping nay my lord   the field was pleasant in my husbands eye       and arthur have thy pleasant field again   and thrice the gold for uthers use thereof   according to the years  no boon is here   but justice so thy say be proven true   accursed who from the wrongs his father did   would shape himself a right                                 and while she past   came yet another widow crying to him   a boon sir king  thine enemy king am i   with thine own hand thou slewest my dear lord   a knight of uther in the barons war   when lot and many another rose and fought   against thee saying thou wert basely born   i held with these and loathe to ask thee aught   yet lo my husbands brother had my son   thralled in his castle and hath starved him dead   and standeth seized of that inheritance   which thou that slewest the sire hast left the son   so though i scarce can ask it thee for hate   grant me some knight to do the battle for me   kill the foul thief and wreak me for my son       then strode a good knight forward crying to him   a boon sir king  i am her kinsman i   give me to right her wrong and slay the man       then came sir kay the seneschal and cried   a boon sir king even that thou grant her none   this railer that hath mocked thee in full hall   none or the wholesome boon of gyve and gag       but arthur we sit king to help the wronged   through all our realm  the woman loves her lord   peace to thee woman with thy loves and hates   the kings of old had doomed thee to the flames   aurelius emrys would have scourged thee dead   and uther slit thy tongue  but get thee hence   lest that rough humour of the kings of old   return upon me  thou that art her kin   go likewise lay him low and slay him not   but bring him here that i may judge the right   according to the justice of the king   then be he guilty by that deathless king   who lived and died for men the man shall die       then came in hall the messenger of mark   a name of evil savour in the land   the cornish king  in either hand he bore   what dazzled all and shone faroff as shines   a field of charlock in the sudden sun   between two showers a cloth of palest gold   which down he laid before the throne and knelt   delivering that his lord the vassal king   was even upon his way to camelot   for having heard that arthur of his grace   had made his goodly cousin tristram knight   and for himself was of the greater state   being a king he trusted his liegelord   would yield him this large honour all the more   so prayed him well to accept this cloth of gold   in token of true heart and fealty       then arthur cried to rend the cloth to rend   in pieces and so cast it on the hearth   an oaktree smouldered there  the goodly knight   what shall the shield of mark stand among these   for midway down the side of that long hall   a stately pilewhereof along the front   some blazoned some but carven and some blank   there ran a treble range of stony shields   rose and higharching overbrowed the hearth   and under every shield a knight was named   for this was arthurs custom in his hall   when some good knight had done one noble deed   his arms were carven only but if twain   his arms were blazoned also but if none   the shield was blank and bare without a sign   saving the name beneath and gareth saw   the shield of gawain blazoned rich and bright   and modreds blank as death and arthur cried   to rend the cloth and cast it on the hearth       more like are we to reave him of his crown   than make him knight because men call him king   the kings we found ye know we stayed their hands   from war among themselves but left them kings   of whom were any bounteous merciful   truthspeaking brave good livers them we enrolled   among us and they sit within our hall   but as mark hath tarnished the great name of king   as mark would sully the low state of churl   and seeing he hath sent us cloth of gold   return and meet and hold him from our eyes   lest we should lap him up in cloth of lead   silenced for evercravena man of plots   craft poisonous counsels wayside ambushings   no fault of thine  let kay the seneschal   look to thy wants and send thee satisfied   accursed who strikes nor lets the hand be seen       and many another suppliant crying came   with noise of ravage wrought by beast and man   and evermore a knight would ride away       last gareth leaning both hands heavily   down on the shoulders of the twain his men   approached between them toward the king and asked   a boon sir king his voice was all ashamed   for see ye not how weak and hungerworn   i seemleaning on these grant me to serve   for meat and drink among thy kitchenknaves   a twelvemonth and a day nor seek my name   hereafter i will fight                            to him the king   a goodly youth and worth a goodlier boon   but so thou wilt no goodlier then must kay   the master of the meats and drinks be thine       he rose and past then kay a man of mien   wansallow as the plant that feels itself   rootbitten by white lichen                                lo ye now   this fellow hath broken from some abbey where   god wot he had not beef and brewis enow   however that might chance but an he work   like any pigeon will i cram his crop   and sleeker shall he shine than any hog       then lancelot standing near sir seneschal   sleuthhound thou knowest and gray and all the hounds   a horse thou knowest a man thou dost not know   broad brows and fair a fluent hair and fine   high nose a nostril large and fine and hands   large fair and finesome young lads mystery   but or from sheepcot or kings hall the boy   is noblenatured  treat him with all grace   lest he should come to shame thy judging of him       then kay what murmurest thou of mystery   think ye this fellow will poison the kings dish   nay for he spake too foollike  mystery   tut an the lad were noble he had asked   for horse and armour  fair and fine forsooth   sir fineface sir fairhands but see thou to it   that thine own fineness lancelot some fine day   undo thee notand leave my man to me       so gareth all for glory underwent   the sooty yoke of kitchenvassalage   ate with young lads his portion by the door   and couched at night with grimy kitchenknaves   and lancelot ever spake him pleasantly   but kay the seneschal who loved him not   would hustle and harry him and labour him   beyond his comrade of the hearth and set   to turn the broach draw water or hew wood   or grosser tasks and gareth bowed himself   with all obedience to the king and wrought   all kind of service with a noble ease   that graced the lowliest act in doing it   and when the thralls had talk among themselves   and one would praise the love that linkt the king   and lancelothow the king had saved his life   in battle twice and lancelot once the kings   for lancelot was the first in tournament   but arthur mightiest on the battlefield   gareth was glad  or if some other told   how once the wandering forester at dawn   far over the blue tarns and hazy seas   on caereryris highest found the king   a naked babe of whom the prophet spake   he passes to the isle avilion   he passes and is healed and cannot die   gareth was glad  but if their talk were foul   then would he whistle rapid as any lark   or carol some old roundelay and so loud   that first they mocked but after reverenced him   or gareth telling some prodigious tale   of knights who sliced a red lifebubbling way   through twenty folds of twisted dragon held   all in a gapmouthed circle his good mates   lying or sitting round him idle hands   charmed till sir kay the seneschal would come   blustering upon them like a sudden wind   among dead leaves and drive them all apart   or when the thralls had sport among themselves   so there were any trial of mastery   he by two yards in casting bar or stone   was counted best and if there chanced a joust   so that sir kay nodded him leave to go   would hurry thither and when he saw the knights   clash like the coming and retiring wave   and the spear spring and good horse reel the boy   was half beyond himself for ecstasy       so for a month he wrought among the thralls   but in the weeks that followed the good queen   repentant of the word she made him swear   and saddening in her childless castle sent   between the increscent and decrescent moon   arms for her son and loosed him from his vow       this gareth hearing from a squire of lot   with whom he used to play at tourney once   when both were children and in lonely haunts   would scratch a ragged oval on the sand   and each at either dash from either end   shame never made girl redder than gareth joy   he laughed he sprang  out of the smoke at once   i leap from satans foot to peters knee   these news be mine none othersnay the kings   descend into the city whereon he sought   the king alone and found and told him all       i have staggered thy strong gawain in a tilt   for pastime yea he said it  joust can i   make me thy knightin secret let my name   be hidden and give me the first quest i spring   like flame from ashes                           here the kings calm eye   fell on and checked and made him flush and bow   lowly to kiss his hand who answered him   son the good mother let me know thee here   and sent her wish that i would yield thee thine   make thee my knight my knights are sworn to vows   of utter hardihood utter gentleness   and loving utter faithfulness in love   and uttermost obedience to the king       then gareth lightly springing from his knees   my king for hardihood i can promise thee   for uttermost obedience make demand   of whom ye gave me to the seneschal   no mellow master of the meats and drinks   and as for love god wot i love not yet   but love i shall god willing                                   and the king   make thee my knight in secret yea but he   our noblest brother and our truest man   and one with me in all he needs must know       let lancelot know my king let lancelot know   thy noblest and thy truest                                and the king   but wherefore would ye men should wonder at you   nay rather for the sake of me their king   and the deeds sake my knighthood do the deed   than to be noised of                          merrily gareth asked   have i not earned my cake in baking of it   let be my name until i make my name   my deeds will speak  it is but for a day   so with a kindly hand on gareths arm   smiled the great king and halfunwillingly   loving his lusty youthhood yielded to him   then after summoning lancelot privily   i have given him the first quest  he is not proven   look therefore when he calls for this in hall   thou get to horse and follow him far away   cover the lions on thy shield and see   far as thou mayest he be nor taen nor slain       then that same day there past into the hall   a damsel of high lineage and a brow   mayblossom and a cheek of appleblossom   hawkeyes and lightly was her slender nose   tiptilted like the petal of a flower   she into hall past with her page and cried       o king for thou hast driven the foe without   see to the foe within bridge ford beset   by bandits everyone that owns a tower   the lord for half a league  why sit ye there   rest would i not sir king an i were king   till even the lonest hold were all as free   from cursed bloodshed as thine altarcloth   from that best blood it is a sin to spill       comfort thyself said arthur  i nor mine   rest  so my knighthood keep the vows they swore   the wastest moorland of our realm shall be   safe damsel as the centre of this hall   what is thy name thy need                                my name she said   lynette my name noble my need a knight   to combat for my sister lyonors   a lady of high lineage of great lands   and comely yea and comelier than myself   she lives in castle perilous  a river   runs in three loops about her livingplace   and oer it are three passings and three knights   defend the passings brethren and a fourth   and of that four the mightiest holds her stayed   in her own castle and so besieges her   to break her will and make her wed with him   and but delays his purport till thou send   to do the battle with him thy chief man   sir lancelot whom he trusts to overthrow   then wed with glory  but she will not wed   save whom she loveth or a holy life   now therefore have i come for lancelot       then arthur mindful of sir gareth asked   damsel ye know this order lives to crush   all wrongers of the realm  but say these four   who be they  what the fashion of the men       they be of foolish fashion o sir king   the fashion of that old knighterrantry   who ride abroad and do but what they will   courteous or bestial from the moment such   as have nor law nor king and three of these   proud in their fantasy call themselves the day   morningstar and noonsun and eveningstar   being strong fools and never a whit more wise   the fourth who alway rideth armed in black   a huge manbeast of boundless savagery   he names himself the night and oftener death   and wears a helmet mounted with a skull   and bears a skeleton figured on his arms   to show that who may slay or scape the three   slain by himself shall enter endless night   and all these four be fools but mighty men   and therefore am i come for lancelot       hereat sir gareth called from where he rose   a head with kindling eyes above the throng   a boon sir kingthis quest thenfor he marked   kay near him groaning like a wounded bull   yea king thou knowest thy kitchenknave am i   and mighty through thy meats and drinks am i   and i can topple over a hundred such   thy promise king and arthur glancing at him   brought down a momentary brow  rough sudden   and pardonable worthy to be knight   go therefore and all hearers were amazed       but on the damsels forehead shame pride wrath   slew the maywhite  she lifted either arm   fie on thee king i asked for thy chief knight   and thou hast given me but a kitchenknave   then ere a man in hall could stay her turned   fled down the lane of access to the king   took horse descended the slope street and past   the weird white gate and paused without beside   the field of tourney murmuring kitchenknave       now two great entries opened from the hall   at one end one that gave upon a range   of level pavement where the king would pace   at sunrise gazing over plain and wood   and down from this a lordly stairway sloped   till lost in blowing trees and tops of towers   and out by this main doorway past the king   but one was counter to the hearth and rose   high that the highestcrested helm could ride   therethrough nor graze  and by this entry fled   the damsel in her wrath and on to this   sir gareth strode and saw without the door   king arthurs gift the worth of half a town   a warhorse of the best and near it stood   the two that out of north had followed him   this bare a maiden shield a casque that held   the horse the spear whereat sir gareth loosed   a cloak that dropt from collarbone to heel   a cloth of roughest web and cast it down   and from it like a fuelsmothered fire   that lookt halfdead brake bright and flashed as those   dullcoated things that making slide apart   their dusk wingcases all beneath there burns   a jewelled harness ere they pass and fly   so gareth ere he parted flashed in arms   then as he donned the helm and took the shield   and mounted horse and graspt a spear of grain   stormstrengthened on a windy site and tipt   with trenchant steel around him slowly prest   the people while from out of kitchen came   the thralls in throng and seeing who had worked   lustier than any and whom they could but love   mounted in arms threw up their caps and cried   god bless the king and all his fellowship   and on through lanes of shouting gareth rode   down the slope street and past without the gate       so gareth past with joy but as the cur   pluckt from the cur he fights with ere his cause   be cooled by fighting follows being named   his owner but remembers all and growls   remembering so sir kay beside the door   muttered in scorn of gareth whom he used   to harry and hustle                        bound upon a quest   with horse and armsthe king hath past his time   my scullion knave  thralls to your work again   for an your fire be low ye kindle mine   will there be dawn in west and eve in east   begonemy knavebelike and like enow   some old headblow not heeded in his youth   so shook his wits they wander in his prime   crazed  how the villain lifted up his voice   nor shamed to bawl himself a kitchenknave   tut  he was tame and meek enow with me   till peacocked up with lancelots noticing   welli will after my loud knave and learn   whether he know me for his master yet   out of the smoke he came and so my lance   hold by gods grace he shall into the mire   thence if the king awaken from his craze   into the smoke again                          but lancelot said   kay wherefore wilt thou go against the king   for that did never he whereon ye rail   but ever meekly served the king in thee   abide  take counsel for this lad is great   and lusty and knowing both of lance and sword   tut tell not me said kay ye are overfine   to mar stout knaves with foolish courtesies   then mounted on through silent faces rode   down the slope city and out beyond the gate       but by the field of tourney lingering yet   muttered the damsel wherefore did the king   scorn me for were sir lancelot lackt at least   he might have yielded to me one of those   who tilt for ladys love and glory here   rather thano sweet heaven  o fie upon him   his kitchenknave                       to whom sir gareth drew   and there were none but few goodlier than he   shining in arms damsel the quest is mine   lead and i follow  she thereat as one   that smells a foulfleshed agaric in the holt   and deems it carrion of some woodland thing   or shrew or weasel nipt her slender nose   with petulant thumb and finger shrilling hence   avoid thou smellest all of kitchengrease   and look who comes behind for there was kay   knowest thou not me thy master i am kay   we lack thee by the hearth                                and gareth to him   master no more too well i know thee ay   the most ungentle knight in arthurs hall   have at thee then said kay  they shocked and kay   fell shoulderslipt and gareth cried again   lead and i follow and fast away she fled       but after sod and shingle ceased to fly   behind her and the heart of her good horse   was nigh to burst with violence of the beat   perforce she stayed and overtaken spoke       what doest thou scullion in my fellowship   deemst thou that i accept thee aught the more   or love thee better that by some device   full cowardly or by mere unhappiness   thou hast overthrown and slain thy masterthou   dishwasher and broachturner loonto me   thou smellest all of kitchen as before       damsel sir gareth answered gently say   whateer ye will but whatsoeer ye say   i leave not till i finish this fair quest   or die therefore                      ay wilt thou finish it   sweet lord how like a noble knight he talks   the listening rogue hath caught the manner of it   but knave anon thou shalt be met with knave   and then by such a one that thou for all   the kitchen brewis that was ever supt   shalt not once dare to look him in the face       i shall assay said gareth with a smile   that maddened her and away she flashed again   down the long avenues of a boundless wood   and gareth following was again beknaved       sir kitchenknave i have missed the only way   where arthurs men are set along the wood   the wood is nigh as full of thieves as leaves   if both be slain i am rid of thee but yet   sir scullion canst thou use that spit of thine   fight an thou canst  i have missed the only way       so till the dusk that followed evensong   rode on the two reviler and reviled   then after one long slope was mounted saw   bowlshaped through tops of many thousand pines   a gloomygladed hollow slowly sink   to westwardin the deeps whereof a mere   round as the red eye of an eagleowl   under the halfdead sunset glared and shouts   ascended and there brake a servingman   flying from out of the black wood and crying   they have bound my lord to cast him in the mere   then gareth bound am i to right the wronged   but straitlier bound am i to bide with thee   and when the damsel spake contemptuously   lead and i follow gareth cried again   follow i lead so down among the pines   he plunged and there blackshadowed nigh the mere   and midthighdeep in bulrushes and reed   saw six tall men haling a seventh along   a stone about his neck to drown him in it   three with good blows he quieted but three   fled through the pines and gareth loosed the stone   from off his neck then in the mere beside   tumbled it oilily bubbled up the mere   last gareth loosed his bonds and on free feet   set him a stalwart baron arthurs friend       well that ye came or else these caitiff rogues   had wreaked themselves on me good cause is theirs   to hate me for my wont hath ever been   to catch my thief and then like vermin here   drown him and with a stone about his neck   and under this wan water many of them   lie rotting but at night let go the stone   and rise and flickering in a grimly light   dance on the mere  good now ye have saved a life   worth somewhat as the cleanser of this wood   and fain would i reward thee worshipfully   what guerdon will ye                         gareth sharply spake   none for the deeds sake have i done the deed   in uttermost obedience to the king   but wilt thou yield this damsel harbourage       whereat the baron saying i well believe   you be of arthurs table a light laugh   broke from lynette ay truly of a truth   and in a sort being arthurs kitchenknave   but deem not i accept thee aught the more   scullion for running sharply with thy spit   down on a rout of craven foresters   a thresher with his flail had scattered them   nayfor thou smellest of the kitchen still   but an this lord will yield us harbourage   well          so she spake  a league beyond the wood   all in a fullfair manor and a rich   his towers where that day a feast had been   held in high hall and many a viand left   and many a costly cate received the three   and there they placed a peacock in his pride   before the damsel and the baron set   gareth beside her but at once she rose       meseems that here is much discourtesy   setting this knave lord baron at my side   hear methis morn i stood in arthurs hall   and prayed the king would grant me lancelot   to fight the brotherhood of day and night   the last a monster unsubduable   of any save of him for whom i called   suddenly bawls this frontless kitchenknave   the quest is mine thy kitchenknave am i   and mighty through thy meats and drinks am i   then arthur all at once gone mad replies   go therefore and so gives the quest to him   himherea villain fitter to stick swine   than ride abroad redressing womens wrong   or sit beside a noble gentlewoman       then halfashamed and partamazed the lord   now looked at one and now at other left   the damsel by the peacock in his pride   and seating gareth at another board   sat down beside him ate and then began       friend whether thou be kitchenknave or not   or whether it be the maidens fantasy   and whether she be mad or else the king   or both or neither or thyself be mad   i ask not  but thou strikest a strong stroke   for strong thou art and goodly therewithal   and saver of my life and therefore now   for here be mighty men to joust with weigh   whether thou wilt not with thy damsel back   to crave again sir lancelot of the king   thy pardon i but speak for thine avail   the saver of my life                          and gareth said   full pardon but i follow up the quest   despite of day and night and death and hell       so when next morn the lord whose life he saved   had some brief space conveyed them on their way   and left them with godspeed sir gareth spake   lead and i follow  haughtily she replied       i fly no more  i allow thee for an hour   lion and stout have isled together knave   in time of flood  nay furthermore methinks   some ruth is mine for thee  back wilt thou fool   for hard by here is one will overthrow   and slay thee  then will i to court again   and shame the king for only yielding me   my champion from the ashes of his hearth       to whom sir gareth answered courteously   say thou thy say and i will do my deed   allow me for mine hour and thou wilt find   my fortunes all as fair as hers who lay   among the ashes and wedded the kings son       then to the shore of one of those long loops   wherethrough the serpent river coiled they came   roughthicketed were the banks and steep the stream   full narrow this a bridge of single arc   took at a leap and on the further side   arose a silk pavilion gay with gold   in streaks and rays and all lentlily in hue   save that the dome was purple and above   crimson a slender banneret fluttering   and therebefore the lawless warrior paced   unarmed and calling damsel is this he   the champion thou hast brought from arthurs hall   for whom we let thee pass  nay nay she said   sir morningstar  the king in utter scorn   of thee and thy much folly hath sent thee here   his kitchenknave  and look thou to thyself   see that he fall not on thee suddenly   and slay thee unarmed  he is not knight but knave       then at his call o daughters of the dawn   and servants of the morningstar approach   arm me from out the silken curtainfolds   barefooted and bareheaded three fair girls   in gilt and rosy raiment came  their feet   in dewy grasses glistened and the hair   all over glanced with dewdrop or with gem   like sparkles in the stone avanturine   these armed him in blue arms and gave a shield   blue also and thereon the morning star   and gareth silent gazed upon the knight   who stood a moment ere his horse was brought   glorying and in the stream beneath him shone   immingled with heavens azure waveringly   the gay pavilion and the naked feet   his arms the rosy raiment and the star       then she that watched him wherefore stare ye so   thou shakest in thy fear  there yet is time   flee down the valley before he get to horse   who will cry shame  thou art not knight but knave       said gareth damsel whether knave or knight   far liefer had i fight a score of times   than hear thee so missay me and revile   fair words were best for him who fights for thee   but truly foul are better for they send   that strength of anger through mine arms i know   that i shall overthrow him                                and he that bore   the star when mounted cried from oer the bridge   a kitchenknave and sent in scorn of me   such fight not i but answer scorn with scorn   for this were shame to do him further wrong   than set him on his feet and take his horse   and arms and so return him to the king   come therefore leave thy lady lightly knave   avoid  for it beseemeth not a knave   to ride with such a lady                              dog thou liest   i spring from loftier lineage than thine own   he spake and all at fiery speed the two   shocked on the central bridge and either spear   bent but not brake and either knight at once   hurled as a stone from out of a catapult   beyond his horses crupper and the bridge   fell as if dead but quickly rose and drew   and gareth lashed so fiercely with his brand   he drave his enemy backward down the bridge   the damsel crying wellstricken kitchenknave   till gareths shield was cloven but one stroke   laid him that clove it grovelling on the ground       then cried the fallen take not my life  i yield   and gareth so this damsel ask it of me   goodi accord it easily as a grace   she reddening insolent scullion  i of thee   i bound to thee for any favour asked   then he shall die  and gareth there unlaced   his helmet as to slay him but she shrieked   be not so hardy scullion as to slay   one nobler than thyself  damsel thy charge   is an abounding pleasure to me  knight   thy life is thine at her command  arise   and quickly pass to arthurs hall and say   his kitchenknave hath sent thee  see thou crave   his pardon for thy breaking of his laws   myself when i return will plead for thee   thy shield is minefarewell and damsel thou   lead and i follow                        and fast away she fled   then when he came upon her spake methought   knave when i watched thee striking on the bridge   the savour of thy kitchen came upon me   a little faintlier  but the wind hath changed   i scent it twentyfold  and then she sang   o morning star not that tall felon there   whom thou by sorcery or unhappiness   or some device hast foully overthrown   o morning star that smilest in the blue   o star my morning dream hath proven true   smile sweetly thou my love hath smiled on me       but thou begone take counsel and away   for hard by here is one that guards a ford   the second brother in their fools parable   will pay thee all thy wages and to boot   care not for shame  thou art not knight but knave       to whom sir gareth answered laughingly   parables  hear a parable of the knave   when i was kitchenknave among the rest   fierce was the hearth and one of my comates   owned a rough dog to whom he cast his coat   guard it and there was none to meddle with it   and such a coat art thou and thee the king   gave me to guard and such a dog am i   to worry and not to fleeandknight or knave   the knave that doth thee service as full knight   is all as good meseems as any knight   toward thy sisters freeing                                 ay sir knave   ay knave because thou strikest as a knight   being but knave i hate thee all the more       fair damsel you should worship me the more   that being but knave i throw thine enemies       ay ay she said but thou shalt meet thy match       so when they touched the second riverloop   huge on a huge red horse and all in mail   burnished to blinding shone the noonday sun   beyond a raging shallow  as if the flower   that blows a globe of after arrowlets   ten thousandfold had grown flashed the fierce shield   all sun and gareths eyes had flying blots   before them when he turned from watching him   he from beyond the roaring shallow roared   what doest thou brother in my marches here   and she athwart the shallow shrilled again   here is a kitchenknave from arthurs hall   hath overthrown thy brother and hath his arms   ugh cried the sun and vizoring up a red   and cipher face of rounded foolishness   pushed horse across the foamings of the ford   whom gareth met midstream  no room was there   for lance or tourneyskill  four strokes they struck   with sword and these were mighty the new knight   had fear he might be shamed but as the sun   heaved up a ponderous arm to strike the fifth   the hoof of his horse slipt in the stream the stream   descended and the sun was washed away       then gareth laid his lance athwart the ford   so drew him home but he that fought no more   as being all bonebattered on the rock   yielded and gareth sent him to the king   myself when i return will plead for thee   lead and i follow  quietly she led   hath not the good wind damsel changed again   nay not a point  nor art thou victor here   there lies a ridge of slate across the ford   his horse thereon stumbleday for i saw it       o sun not this strong fool whom thou sir knave   hast overthrown through mere unhappiness   o sun that wakenest all to bliss or pain   o moon that layest all to sleep again   shine sweetly  twice my love hath smiled on me       what knowest thou of lovesong or of love   nay nay god wot so thou wert nobly born   thou hast a pleasant presence  yea perchance       o dewy flowers that open to the sun   o dewy flowers that close when day is done   blow sweetly  twice my love hath smiled on me       what knowest thou of flowers except belike   to garnish meats with hath not our good king   who lent me thee the flower of kitchendom   a foolish love for flowers what stick ye round   the pasty wherewithal deck the boars head   flowers nay the boar hath rosemaries and bay       o birds that warble to the morning sky   o birds that warble as the day goes by   sing sweetly  twice my love hath smiled on me       what knowest thou of birds lark mavis merle   linnet what dream ye when they utter forth   maymusic growing with the growing light   their sweet sunworship these be for the snare   so runs thy fancy these be for the spit   larding and basting  see thou have not now   larded thy last except thou turn and fly   there stands the third fool of their allegory       for there beyond a bridge of treble bow   all in a rosered from the west and all   naked it seemed and glowing in the broad   deepdimpled current underneath the knight   that named himself the star of evening stood       and gareth wherefore waits the madman there   naked in open dayshine  nay she cried   not naked only wrapt in hardened skins   that fit him like his own and so ye cleave   his armour off him these will turn the blade       then the third brother shouted oer the bridge   o brotherstar why shine ye here so low   thy ward is higher up  but have ye slain   the damsels champion and the damsel cried       no star of thine but shot from arthurs heaven   with all disaster unto thine and thee   for both thy younger brethren have gone down   before this youth and so wilt thou sir star   art thou not old                     old damsel old and hard   old with the might and breath of twenty boys   said gareth old and overbold in brag   but that same strength which threw the morning star   can throw the evening                           then that other blew   a hard and deadly note upon the horn   approach and arm me  with slow steps from out   an old stormbeaten russet manystained   pavilion forth a grizzled damsel came   and armed him in old arms and brought a helm   with but a drying evergreen for crest   and gave a shield whereon the star of even   halftarnished and halfbright his emblem shone   but when it glittered oer the saddlebow   they madly hurled together on the bridge   and gareth overthrew him lighted drew   there met him drawn and overthrew him again   but up like fire he started  and as oft   as gareth brought him grovelling on his knees   so many a time he vaulted up again   till gareth panted hard and his great heart   foredooming all his trouble was in vain   laboured within him for he seemed as one   that all in later sadder age begins   to war against ill uses of a life   but these from all his life arise and cry   thou hast made us lords and canst not put us down   he half despairs so gareth seemed to strike   vainly the damsel clamouring all the while   well done knaveknight wellstricken o good knightknave   o knave as noble as any of all the knights   shame me not shame me not  i have prophesied   strike thou art worthy of the table round   his arms are old he trusts the hardened skin   strikestrikethe wind will never change again   and gareth hearing ever stronglier smote   and hewed great pieces of his armour off him   but lashed in vain against the hardened skin   and could not wholly bring him under more   than loud southwesterns rolling ridge on ridge   the buoy that rides at sea and dips and springs   for ever till at length sir gareths brand   clashed his and brake it utterly to the hilt   i have thee now but forth that other sprang   and all unknightlike writhed his wiry arms   around him till he felt despite his mail   strangled but straining even his uttermost   cast and so hurled him headlong oer the bridge   down to the river sink or swim and cried   lead and i follow                         but the damsel said   i lead no longer ride thou at my side   thou art the kingliest of all kitchenknaves       o trefoil sparkling on the rainy plain   o rainbow with three colours after rain   shine sweetly  thrice my love hath smiled on me       sirand good faith i fain had addedknight   but that i heard thee call thyself a knave   shamed am i that i so rebuked reviled   missaid thee noble i am and thought the king   scorned me and mine and now thy pardon friend   for thou hast ever answered courteously   and wholly bold thou art and meek withal   as any of arthurs best but being knave   hast mazed my wit  i marvel what thou art       damsel he said you be not all to blame   saving that you mistrusted our good king   would handle scorn or yield you asking one   not fit to cope your quest  you said your say   mine answer was my deed  good sooth  i hold   he scarce is knight yea but halfman nor meet   to fight for gentle damsel he who lets   his heart be stirred with any foolish heat   at any gentle damsels waywardness   shamed care not thy foul sayings fought for me   and seeing now thy words are fair methinks   there rides no knight not lancelot his great self   hath force to quell me                           nigh upon that hour   when the lone hern forgets his melancholy   lets down his other leg and stretching dreams   of goodly supper in the distant pool   then turned the noble damsel smiling at him   and told him of a cavern hard at hand   where bread and baken meats and good red wine   of southland which the lady lyonors   had sent her coming champion waited him       anon they past a narrow comb wherein   where slabs of rock with figures knights on horse   sculptured and deckt in slowlywaning hues   sir knave my knight a hermit once was here   whose holy hand hath fashioned on the rock   the war of time against the soul of man   and yon four fools have sucked their allegory   from these damp walls and taken but the form   know ye not these and gareth lookt and read   in letters like to those the vexillary   hath left cragcarven oer the streaming gelt   phosphorus then meridieshesperus   noxmors beneath five figures armed men   slab after slab their faces forward all   and running down the soul a shape that fled   with broken wings torn raiment and loose hair   for help and shelter to the hermits cave   follow the faces and we find it  look   who comes behind                      for onedelayed at first   through helping back the dislocated kay   to camelot then by what thereafter chanced   the damsels headlong error through the wood   sir lancelot having swum the riverloops   his blue shieldlions coveredsoftly drew   behind the twain and when he saw the star   gleam on sir gareths turning to him cried   stay felon knight i avenge me for my friend   and gareth crying pricked against the cry   but when they closedin a momentat one touch   of that skilled spear the wonder of the world   went sliding down so easily and fell   that when he found the grass within his hands   he laughed the laughter jarred upon lynette   harshly she asked him shamed and overthrown   and tumbled back into the kitchenknave   why laugh ye that ye blew your boast in vain   nay noble damsel but that i the son   of old king lot and good queen bellicent   and victor of the bridges and the ford   and knight of arthur here lie thrown by whom   i know not all through mere unhappiness   device and sorcery and unhappiness   out sword we are thrown  and lancelot answered prince   o gareththrough the mere unhappiness   of one who came to help thee not to harm   lancelot and all as glad to find thee whole   as on the day when arthur knighted him       then gareth thoulancelotthine the hand   that threw me  an some chance to mar the boast   thy brethren of thee makewhich could not chance   had sent thee down before a lesser spear   shamed had i been and sado lancelotthou       whereat the maiden petulant lancelot   why came ye not when called and wherefore now   come ye not called  i gloried in my knave   who being still rebuked would answer still   courteous as any knightbut now if knight   the marvel dies and leaves me fooled and tricked   and only wondering wherefore played upon   and doubtful whether i and mine be scorned   where should be truth if not in arthurs hall   in arthurs presence  knight knave prince and fool   i hate thee and for ever                              and lancelot said   blessed be thou sir gareth knight art thou   to the kings best wish  o damsel be you wise   to call him shamed who is but overthrown   thrown have i been nor once but many a time   victor from vanquished issues at the last   and overthrower from being overthrown   with sword we have not striven and thy good horse   and thou are weary yet not less i felt   thy manhood through that wearied lance of thine   well hast thou done for all the stream is freed   and thou hast wreaked his justice on his foes   and when reviled hast answered graciously   and makest merry when overthrown  prince knight   hail knight and prince and of our table round       and then when turning to lynette he told   the tale of gareth petulantly she said   ay wellay wellfor worse than being fooled   of others is to fool ones self  a cave   sir lancelot is hard by with meats and drinks   and forage for the horse and flint for fire   but all about it flies a honeysuckle   seek till we find  and when they sought and found   sir gareth drank and ate and all his life   past into sleep on whom the maiden gazed   sound sleep be thine sound cause to sleep hast thou   wake lusty  seem i not as tender to him   as any mother  ay but such a one   as all day long hath rated at her child   and vext his day but blesses him asleep   good lord how sweetly smells the honeysuckle   in the hushed night as if the world were one   of utter peace and love and gentleness   o lancelot lancelotand she clapt her hands   full merry am i to find my goodly knave   is knight and noble  see now sworn have i   else yon black felon had not let me pass   to bring thee back to do the battle with him   thus an thou goest he will fight thee first   who doubts thee victor so will my knightknave   miss the full flower of this accomplishment       said lancelot peradventure he you name   may know my shield  let gareth an he will   change his for mine and take my charger fresh   not to be spurred loving the battle as well   as he that rides him  lancelotlike she said   courteous in this lord lancelot as in all       and gareth wakening fiercely clutched the shield   ramp ye lancesplintering lions on whom all spears   are rotten sticks ye seem agape to roar   yea ramp and roar at leaving of your lord   care not good beasts so well i care for you   o noble lancelot from my hold on these   streams virtuefirethrough one that will not shame   even the shadow of lancelot under shield   hence  let us go                       silent the silent field   they traversed  arthurs harp though summerwan   in counter motion to the clouds allured   the glance of gareth dreaming on his liege   a star shot  lo said gareth the foe falls   an owl whoopt  hark the victor pealing there   suddenly she that rode upon his left   clung to the shield that lancelot lent him crying   yield yield him this again  tis he must fight   i curse the tongue that all through yesterday   reviled thee and hath wrought on lancelot now   to lend thee horse and shield  wonders ye have done   miracles ye cannot  here is glory enow   in having flung the three  i see thee maimed   mangled  i swear thou canst not fling the fourth       and wherefore damsel tell me all ye know   you cannot scare me nor rough face or voice   brute bulk of limb or boundless savagery   appal me from the quest                             nay prince she cried   god wot i never looked upon the face   seeing he never rides abroad by day   but watched him have i like a phantom pass   chilling the night  nor have i heard the voice   always he made his mouthpiece of a page   who came and went and still reported him   as closing in himself the strength of ten   and when his anger tare him massacring   man woman lad and girlyea the soft babe   some hold that he hath swallowed infant flesh   monster  o prince i went for lancelot first   the quest is lancelots  give him back the shield       said gareth laughing an he fight for this   belike he wins it as the better man   thusand not else                        but lancelot on him urged   all the devisings of their chivalry   when one might meet a mightier than himself   how best to manage horse lance sword and shield   and so fill up the gap where force might fail   with skill and fineness  instant were his words       then gareth here be rules  i know but one   to dash against mine enemy and win   yet have i seen thee victor in the joust   and seen thy way  heaven help thee sighed lynette       then for a space and under cloud that grew   to thundergloom palling all stars they rode   in converse till she made her palfrey halt   lifted an arm and softly whispered there   and all the three were silent seeing pitched   beside the castle perilous on flat field   a huge pavilion like a mountain peak   sunder the glooming crimson on the marge   black with black banner and a long black horn   beside it hanging which sir gareth graspt   and so before the two could hinder him   sent all his heart and breath through all the horn   echoed the walls a light twinkled anon   came lights and lights and once again he blew   whereon were hollow tramplings up and down   and muffled voices heard and shadows past   till high above him circled with her maids   the lady lyonors at a window stood   beautiful among lights and waving to him   white hands and courtesy but when the prince   three times had blownafter long hushat last   the huge pavilion slowly yielded up   through those black foldings that which housed therein   high on a nightblack horse in nightblack arms   with white breastbone and barren ribs of death   and crowned with fleshless laughtersome ten steps   in the halflightthrough the dim dawnadvanced   the monster and then paused and spake no word       but gareth spake and all indignantly   fool for thou hast men say the strength of ten   canst thou not trust the limbs thy god hath given   but must to make the terror of thee more   trick thyself out in ghastly imageries   of that which life hath done with and the clod   less dull than thou will hide with mantling flowers   as if for pity  but he spake no word   which set the horror higher  a maiden swooned   the lady lyonors wrung her hands and wept   as doomed to be the bride of night and death   sir gareths head prickled beneath his helm   and even sir lancelot through his warm blood felt   ice strike and all that marked him were aghast       at once sir lancelots charger fiercely neighed   and deaths dark warhorse bounded forward with him   then those that did not blink the terror saw   that death was cast to ground and slowly rose   but with one stroke sir gareth split the skull   half fell to right and half to left and lay   then with a stronger buffet he clove the helm   as throughly as the skull and out from this   issued the bright face of a blooming boy   fresh as a flower newborn and crying knight   slay me not  my three brethren bad me do it   to make a horror all about the house   and stay the world from lady lyonors   they never dreamed the passes would be past   answered sir gareth graciously to one   not many a moon his younger my fair child   what madness made thee challenge the chief knight   of arthurs hall  fair sir they bad me do it   they hate the king and lancelot the kings friend   they hoped to slay him somewhere on the stream   they never dreamed the passes could be past       then sprang the happier day from underground   and lady lyonors and her house with dance   and revel and song made merry over death   as being after all their foolish fears   and horrors only proven a blooming boy   so large mirth lived and gareth won the quest       and he that told the tale in older times   says that sir gareth wedded lyonors   but he that told it later says lynette      the marriage of geraint    the brave geraint a knight of arthurs court   a tributary prince of devon one   of that great order of the table round   had married enid yniols only child   and loved her as he loved the light of heaven   and as the light of heaven varies now   at sunrise now at sunset now by night   with moon and trembling stars so loved geraint   to make her beauty vary day by day   in crimsons and in purples and in gems   and enid but to please her husbands eye   who first had found and loved her in a state   of broken fortunes daily fronted him   in some fresh splendour and the queen herself   grateful to prince geraint for service done   loved her and often with her own white hands   arrayed and decked her as the loveliest   next after her own self in all the court   and enid loved the queen and with true heart   adored her as the stateliest and the best   and loveliest of all women upon earth   and seeing them so tender and so close   long in their common love rejoiced geraint   but when a rumour rose about the queen   touching her guilty love for lancelot   though yet there lived no proof nor yet was heard   the worlds loud whisper breaking into storm   not less geraint believed it and there fell   a horror on him lest his gentle wife   through that great tenderness for guinevere   had suffered or should suffer any taint   in nature  wherefore going to the king   he made this pretext that his princedom lay   close on the borders of a territory   wherein were bandit earls and caitiff knights   assassins and all flyers from the hand   of justice and whatever loathes a law   and therefore till the king himself should please   to cleanse this common sewer of all his realm   he craved a fair permission to depart   and there defend his marches and the king   mused for a little on his plea but last   allowing it the prince and enid rode   and fifty knights rode with them to the shores   of severn and they past to their own land   where thinking that if ever yet was wife   true to her lord mine shall be so to me   he compassed her with sweet observances   and worship never leaving her and grew   forgetful of his promise to the king   forgetful of the falcon and the hunt   forgetful of the tilt and tournament   forgetful of his glory and his name   forgetful of his princedom and its cares   and this forgetfulness was hateful to her   and by and by the people when they met   in twos and threes or fuller companies   began to scoff and jeer and babble of him   as of a prince whose manhood was all gone   and molten down in mere uxoriousness   and this she gathered from the peoples eyes   this too the women who attired her head   to please her dwelling on his boundless love   told enid and they saddened her the more   and day by day she thought to tell geraint   but could not out of bashful delicacy   while he that watched her sadden was the more   suspicious that her nature had a taint       at last it chanced that on a summer morn   they sleeping each by either the new sun   beat through the blindless casement of the room   and heated the strong warrior in his dreams   who moving cast the coverlet aside   and bared the knotted column of his throat   the massive square of his heroic breast   and arms on which the standing muscle sloped   as slopes a wild brook oer a little stone   running too vehemently to break upon it   and enid woke and sat beside the couch   admiring him and thought within herself   was ever man so grandly made as he   then like a shadow past the peoples talk   and accusation of uxoriousness   across her mind and bowing over him   low to her own heart piteously she said       o noble breast and allpuissant arms   am i the cause i the poor cause that men   reproach you saying all your force is gone   i am the cause because i dare not speak   and tell him what i think and what they say   and yet i hate that he should linger here   i cannot love my lord and not his name   far liefer had i gird his harness on him   and ride with him to battle and stand by   and watch his mightful hand striking great blows   at caitiffs and at wrongers of the world   far better were i laid in the dark earth   not hearing any more his noble voice   not to be folded more in these dear arms   and darkened from the high light in his eyes   than that my lord through me should suffer shame   am i so bold and could i so stand by   and see my dear lord wounded in the strife   and maybe pierced to death before mine eyes   and yet not dare to tell him what i think   and how men slur him saying all his force   is melted into mere effeminacy   o me i fear that i am no true wife       half inwardly half audibly she spoke   and the strong passion in her made her weep   true tears upon his broad and naked breast   and these awoke him and by great mischance   he heard but fragments of her later words   and that she feared she was not a true wife   and then he thought in spite of all my care   for all my pains poor man for all my pains   she is not faithful to me and i see her   weeping for some gay knight in arthurs hall   then though he loved and reverenced her too much   to dream she could be guilty of foul act   right through his manful breast darted the pang   that makes a man in the sweet face of her   whom he loves most lonely and miserable   at this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed   and shook his drowsy squire awake and cried   my charger and her palfrey then to her   i will ride forth into the wilderness   for though it seems my spurs are yet to win   i have not fallen so low as some would wish   and thou put on thy worst and meanest dress   and ride with me  and enid asked amazed   if enid errs let enid learn her fault   but he i charge thee ask not but obey   then she bethought her of a faded silk   a faded mantle and a faded veil   and moving toward a cedarn cabinet   wherein she kept them folded reverently   with sprigs of summer laid between the folds   she took them and arrayed herself therein   remembering when first he came on her   drest in that dress and how he loved her in it   and all her foolish fears about the dress   and all his journey to her as himself   had told her and their coming to the court       for arthur on the whitsuntide before   held court at old caerleon upon usk   there on a day he sitting high in hall   before him came a forester of dean   wet from the woods with notice of a hart   taller than all his fellows milkywhite   first seen that day  these things he told the king   then the good king gave order to let blow   his horns for hunting on the morrow morn   and when the king petitioned for his leave   to see the hunt allowed it easily   so with the morning all the court were gone   but guinevere lay late into the morn   lost in sweet dreams and dreaming of her love   for lancelot and forgetful of the hunt   but rose at last a single maiden with her   took horse and forded usk and gained the wood   there on a little knoll beside it stayed   waiting to hear the hounds but heard instead   a sudden sound of hoofs for prince geraint   late also wearing neither huntingdress   nor weapon save a goldenhilted brand   came quickly flashing through the shallow ford   behind them and so galloped up the knoll   a purple scarf at either end whereof   there swung an apple of the purest gold   swayed round about him as he galloped up   to join them glancing like a dragonfly   in summer suit and silks of holiday   low bowed the tributary prince and she   sweet and statelily and with all grace   of womanhood and queenhood answered him   late late sir prince she said later than we   yea noble queen he answered and so late   that i but come like you to see the hunt   not join it  therefore wait with me she said   for on this little knoll if anywhere   there is good chance that we shall hear the hounds   here often they break covert at our feet       and while they listened for the distant hunt   and chiefly for the baying of cavall   king arthurs hound of deepest mouth there rode   full slowly by a knight lady and dwarf   whereof the dwarf lagged latest and the knight   had vizor up and showed a youthful face   imperious and of haughtiest lineaments   and guinevere not mindful of his face   in the kings hall desired his name and sent   her maiden to demand it of the dwarf   who being vicious old and irritable   and doubling all his masters vice of pride   made answer sharply that she should not know   then will i ask it of himself she said   nay by my faith thou shalt not cried the dwarf   thou art not worthy even to speak of him   and when she put her horse toward the knight   struck at her with his whip and she returned   indignant to the queen whereat geraint   exclaiming surely i will learn the name   made sharply to the dwarf and asked it of him   who answered as before and when the prince   had put his horse in motion toward the knight   struck at him with his whip and cut his cheek   the princes blood spirted upon the scarf   dyeing it and his quick instinctive hand   caught at the hilt as to abolish him   but he from his exceeding manfulness   and pure nobility of temperament   wroth to be wroth at such a worm refrained   from even a word and so returning said       i will avenge this insult noble queen   done in your maidens person to yourself   and i will track this vermin to their earths   for though i ride unarmed i do not doubt   to find at some place i shall come at arms   on loan or else for pledge and being found   then will i fight him and will break his pride   and on the third day will again be here   so that i be not fallen in fight  farewell       farewell fair prince answered the stately queen   be prosperous in this journey as in all   and may you light on all things that you love   and live to wed with her whom first you love   but ere you wed with any bring your bride   and i were she the daughter of a king   yea though she were a beggar from the hedge   will clothe her for her bridals like the sun       and prince geraint now thinking that he heard   the noble hart at bay now the far horn   a little vext at losing of the hunt   a little at the vile occasion rode   by ups and downs through many a grassy glade   and valley with fixt eye following the three   at last they issued from the world of wood   and climbed upon a fair and even ridge   and showed themselves against the sky and sank   and thither there came geraint and underneath   beheld the long street of a little town   in a long valley on one side whereof   white from the masons hand a fortress rose   and on one side a castle in decay   beyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine   and out of town and valley came a noise   as of a broad brook oer a shingly bed   brawling or like a clamour of the rooks   at distance ere they settle for the night       and onward to the fortress rode the three   and entered and were lost behind the walls   so thought geraint i have tracked him to his earth   and down the long street riding wearily   found every hostel full and everywhere   was hammer laid to hoof and the hot hiss   and bustling whistle of the youth who scoured   his masters armour and of such a one   he asked what means the tumult in the town   who told him scouring still the sparrowhawk   then riding close behind an ancient churl   who smitten by the dusty sloping beam   went sweating underneath a sack of corn   asked yet once more what meant the hubbub here   who answered gruffly ugh the sparrowhawk   then riding further past an armourers   who with back turned and bowed above his work   sat riveting a helmet on his knee   he put the selfsame query but the man   not turning round nor looking at him said   friend he that labours for the sparrowhawk   has little time for idle questioners   whereat geraint flashed into sudden spleen   a thousand pips eat up your sparrowhawk   tits wrens and all winged nothings peck him dead   ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg   the murmur of the world  what is it to me   o wretched set of sparrows one and all   who pipe of nothing but of sparrowhawks   speak if ye be not like the rest hawkmad   where can i get me harbourage for the night   and arms arms arms to fight my enemy  speak   whereat the armourer turning all amazed   and seeing one so gay in purple silks   came forward with the helmet yet in hand   and answered pardon me o stranger knight   we hold a tourney here tomorrow morn   and there is scantly time for half the work   arms truth i know not  all are wanted here   harbourage truth good truth i know not save   it may be at earl yniols oer the bridge   yonder  he spoke and fell to work again       then rode geraint a little spleenful yet   across the bridge that spanned the dry ravine   there musing sat the hoaryheaded earl   his dress a suit of frayed magnificence   once fit for feasts of ceremony and said   whither fair son to whom geraint replied   o friend i seek a harbourage for the night   then yniol enter therefore and partake   the slender entertainment of a house   once rich now poor but ever opendoored   thanks venerable friend replied geraint   so that ye do not serve me sparrowhawks   for supper i will enter i will eat   with all the passion of a twelve hours fast   then sighed and smiled the hoaryheaded earl   and answered graver cause than yours is mine   to curse this hedgerow thief the sparrowhawk   but in go in for save yourself desire it   we will not touch upon him even in jest       then rode geraint into the castle court   his charger trampling many a prickly star   of sprouted thistle on the broken stones   he looked and saw that all was ruinous   here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern   and here had fallen a great part of a tower   whole like a crag that tumbles from the cliff   and like a crag was gay with wilding flowers   and high above a piece of turret stair   worn by the feet that now were silent wound   bare to the sun and monstrous ivystems   claspt the gray walls with hairyfibred arms   and sucked the joining of the stones and looked   a knot beneath of snakes aloft a grove       and while he waited in the castle court   the voice of enid yniols daughter rang   clear through the open casement of the hall   singing and as the sweet voice of a bird   heard by the lander in a lonely isle   moves him to think what kind of bird it is   that sings so delicately clear and make   conjecture of the plumage and the form   so the sweet voice of enid moved geraint   and made him like a man abroad at morn   when first the liquid note beloved of men   comes flying over many a windy wave   to britain and in april suddenly   breaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red   and he suspends his converse with a friend   or it may be the labour of his hands   to think or say there is the nightingale   so fared it with geraint who thought and said   here by gods grace is the one voice for me       it chanced the song that enid sang was one   of fortune and her wheel and enid sang       turn fortune turn thy wheel and lower the proud   turn thy wild wheel through sunshine storm and cloud   thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate       turn fortune turn thy wheel with smile or frown   with that wild wheel we go not up or down   our hoard is little but our hearts are great       smile and we smile the lords of many lands   frown and we smile the lords of our own hands   for man is man and master of his fate       turn turn thy wheel above the staring crowd   thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud   thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate       hark by the birds song ye may learn the nest   said yniol enter quickly  entering then   right oer a mount of newlyfallen stones   the duskyraftered manycobwebbed hall   he found an ancient dame in dim brocade   and near her like a blossom vermeilwhite   that lightly breaks a faded flowersheath   moved the fair enid all in faded silk   her daughter  in a moment thought geraint   here by gods rood is the one maid for me   but none spake word except the hoary earl   enid the good knights horse stands in the court   take him to stall and give him corn and then   go to the town and buy us flesh and wine   and we will make us merry as we may   our hoard is little but our hearts are great       he spake  the prince as enid past him fain   to follow strode a stride but yniol caught   his purple scarf and held and said forbear   rest the good house though ruined o my son   endures not that her guest should serve himself   and reverencing the custom of the house   geraint from utter courtesy forbore       so enid took his charger to the stall   and after went her way across the bridge   and reached the town and while the prince and earl   yet spoke together came again with one   a youth that following with a costrel bore   the means of goodly welcome flesh and wine   and enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer   and in her veil enfolded manchet bread   and then because their hall must also serve   for kitchen boiled the flesh and spread the board   and stood behind and waited on the three   and seeing her so sweet and serviceable   geraint had longing in him evermore   to stoop and kiss the tender little thumb   that crost the trencher as she laid it down   but after all had eaten then geraint   for now the wine made summer in his veins   let his eye rove in following or rest   on enid at her lowly handmaidwork   now here now there about the dusky hall   then suddenly addrest the hoary earl       fair host and earl i pray your courtesy   this sparrowhawk what is he tell me of him   his name but no good faith i will not have it   for if he be the knight whom late i saw   ride into that new fortress by your town   white from the masons hand then have i sworn   from his own lips to have iti am geraint   of devonfor this morning when the queen   sent her own maiden to demand the name   his dwarf a vicious undershapen thing   struck at her with his whip and she returned   indignant to the queen and then i swore   that i would track this caitiff to his hold   and fight and break his pride and have it of him   and all unarmed i rode and thought to find   arms in your town where all the men are mad   they take the rustic murmur of their bourg   for the great wave that echoes round the world   they would not hear me speak  but if ye know   where i can light on arms or if yourself   should have them tell me seeing i have sworn   that i will break his pride and learn his name   avenging this great insult done the queen       then cried earl yniol art thou he indeed   geraint a name farsounded among men   for noble deeds and truly i when first   i saw you moving by me on the bridge   felt ye were somewhat yea and by your state   and presence might have guessed you one of those   that eat in arthurs hall in camelot   nor speak i now from foolish flattery   for this dear child hath often heard me praise   your feats of arms and often when i paused   hath asked again and ever loved to hear   so grateful is the noise of noble deeds   to noble hearts who see but acts of wrong   o never yet had woman such a pair   of suitors as this maiden  first limours   a creature wholly given to brawls and wine   drunk even when he wooed and be he dead   i know not but he past to the wild land   the second was your foe the sparrowhawk   my curse my nephewi will not let his name   slip from my lips if i can help ithe   when that i knew him fierce and turbulent   refused her to him then his pride awoke   and since the proud man often is the mean   he sowed a slander in the common ear   affirming that his father left him gold   and in my charge which was not rendered to him   bribed with large promises the men who served   about my person the more easily   because my means were somewhat broken into   through open doors and hospitality   raised my own town against me in the night   before my enids birthday sacked my house   from mine own earldom foully ousted me   built that new fort to overawe my friends   for truly there are those who love me yet   and keeps me in this ruinous castle here   where doubtless he would put me soon to death   but that his pride too much despises me   and i myself sometimes despise myself   for i have let men be and have their way   am much too gentle have not used my power   nor know i whether i be very base   or very manful whether very wise   or very foolish only this i know   that whatsoever evil happen to me   i seem to suffer nothing heart or limb   but can endure it all most patiently       well said true heart replied geraint but arms   that if the sparrowhawk this nephew fight   in next days tourney i may break his pride       and yniol answered arms indeed but old   and rusty old and rusty prince geraint   are mine and therefore at thy asking thine   but in this tournament can no man tilt   except the lady he loves best be there   two forks are fixt into the meadow ground   and over these is placed a silver wand   and over that a golden sparrowhawk   the prize of beauty for the fairest there   and this what knight soever be in field   lays claim to for the lady at his side   and tilts with my good nephew thereupon   who being apt at arms and big of bone   has ever won it for the lady with him   and toppling over all antagonism   has earned himself the name of sparrowhawk   but thou that hast no lady canst not fight       to whom geraint with eyes all bright replied   leaning a little toward him thy leave   let me lay lance in rest o noble host   for this dear child because i never saw   though having seen all beauties of our time   nor can see elsewhere anything so fair   and if i fall her name will yet remain   untarnished as before but if i live   so aid me heaven when at mine uttermost   as i will make her truly my true wife       then howsoever patient yniols heart   danced in his bosom seeing better days   and looking round he saw not enid there   who hearing her own name had stolen away   but that old dame to whom full tenderly   and folding all her hand in his he said   mother a maiden is a tender thing   and best by her that bore her understood   go thou to rest but ere thou go to rest   tell her and prove her heart toward the prince       so spake the kindlyhearted earl and she   with frequent smile and nod departing found   half disarrayed as to her rest the girl   whom first she kissed on either cheek and then   on either shining shoulder laid a hand   and kept her off and gazed upon her face   and told them all their converse in the hall   proving her heart  but never light and shade   coursed one another more on open ground   beneath a troubled heaven than red and pale   across the face of enid hearing her   while slowly falling as a scale that falls   when weight is added only grain by grain   sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast   nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word   rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it   so moving without answer to her rest   she found no rest and ever failed to draw   the quiet night into her blood but lay   contemplating her own unworthiness   and when the pale and bloodless east began   to quicken to the sun arose and raised   her mother too and hand in hand they moved   down to the meadow where the jousts were held   and waited there for yniol and geraint       and thither came the twain and when geraint   beheld her first in field awaiting him   he felt were she the prize of bodily force   himself beyond the rest pushing could move   the chair of idris  yniols rusted arms   were on his princely person but through these   princelike his bearing shone and errant knights   and ladies came and by and by the town   flowed in and settling circled all the lists   and there they fixt the forks into the ground   and over these they placed the silver wand   and over that the golden sparrowhawk   then yniols nephew after trumpet blown   spake to the lady with him and proclaimed   advance and take as fairest of the fair   what i these two years past have won for thee   the prize of beauty  loudly spake the prince   forbear  there is a worthier and the knight   with some surprise and thrice as much disdain   turned and beheld the four and all his face   glowed like the heart of a great fire at yule   so burnt he was with passion crying out   do battle for it then no more and thrice   they clashed together and thrice they brake their spears   then each dishorsed and drawing lashed at each   so often and with such blows that all the crowd   wondered and now and then from distant walls   there came a clapping as of phantom hands   so twice they fought and twice they breathed and still   the dew of their great labour and the blood   of their strong bodies flowing drained their force   but eithers force was matched till yniols cry   remember that great insult done the queen   increased geraints who heaved his blade aloft   and cracked the helmet through and bit the bone   and felled him and set foot upon his breast   and said thy name  to whom the fallen man   made answer groaning edyrn son of nudd   ashamed am i that i should tell it thee   my pride is broken  men have seen my fall   then edyrn son of nudd replied geraint   these two things shalt thou do or else thou diest   first thou thyself with damsel and with dwarf   shalt ride to arthurs court and coming there   crave pardon for that insult done the queen   and shalt abide her judgment on it next   thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin   these two things shalt thou do or thou shalt die   and edyrn answered these things will i do   for i have never yet been overthrown   and thou hast overthrown me and my pride   is broken down for enid sees my fall   and rising up he rode to arthurs court   and there the queen forgave him easily   and being young he changed and came to loathe   his crime of traitor slowly drew himself   bright from his old dark life and fell at last   in the great battle fighting for the king       but when the third day from the huntingmorn   made a low splendour in the world and wings   moved in her ivy enid for she lay   with her fair head in the dimyellow light   among the dancing shadows of the birds   woke and bethought her of her promise given   no later than last eve to prince geraint   so bent he seemed on going the third day   he would not leave her till her promise given   to ride with him this morning to the court   and there be made known to the stately queen   and there be wedded with all ceremony   at this she cast her eyes upon her dress   and thought it never yet had looked so mean   for as a leaf in midnovember is   to what it is in midoctober seemed   the dress that now she looked on to the dress   she looked on ere the coming of geraint   and still she looked and still the terror grew   of that strange bright and dreadful thing a court   all staring at her in her faded silk   and softly to her own sweet heart she said       this noble prince who won our earldom back   so splendid in his acts and his attire   sweet heaven how much i shall discredit him   would he could tarry with us here awhile   but being so beholden to the prince   it were but little grace in any of us   bent as he seemed on going this third day   to seek a second favour at his hands   yet if he could but tarry a day or two   myself would work eye dim and finger lame   far liefer than so much discredit him       and enid fell in longing for a dress   all branched and flowered with gold a costly gift   of her good mother given her on the night   before her birthday three sad years ago   that night of fire when edyrn sacked their house   and scattered all they had to all the winds   for while the mother showed it and the two   were turning and admiring it the work   to both appeared so costly rose a cry   that edyrns men were on them and they fled   with little save the jewels they had on   which being sold and sold had bought them bread   and edyrns men had caught them in their flight   and placed them in this ruin and she wished   the prince had found her in her ancient home   then let her fancy flit across the past   and roam the goodly places that she knew   and last bethought her how she used to watch   near that old home a pool of golden carp   and one was patched and blurred and lustreless   among his burnished brethren of the pool   and half asleep she made comparison   of that and these to her own faded self   and the gay court and fell asleep again   and dreamt herself was such a faded form   among her burnished sisters of the pool   but this was in the garden of a king   and though she lay dark in the pool she knew   that all was bright that all about were birds   of sunny plume in gilded trelliswork   that all the turf was rich in plots that looked   each like a garnet or a turkis in it   and lords and ladies of the high court went   in silver tissue talking things of state   and children of the king in cloth of gold   glanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks   and while she thought they will not see me came   a stately queen whose name was guinevere   and all the children in their cloth of gold   ran to her crying if we have fish at all   let them be gold and charge the gardeners now   to pick the faded creature from the pool   and cast it on the mixen that it die   and therewithal one came and seized on her   and enid started waking with her heart   all overshadowed by the foolish dream   and lo it was her mother grasping her   to get her well awake and in her hand   a suit of bright apparel which she laid   flat on the couch and spoke exultingly       see here my child how fresh the colours look   how fast they hold like colours of a shell   that keeps the wear and polish of the wave   why not  it never yet was worn i trow   look on it child and tell me if ye know it       and enid looked but all confused at first   could scarce divide it from her foolish dream   then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced   and answered yea i know it your good gift   so sadly lost on that unhappy night   your own good gift  yea surely said the dame   and gladly given again this happy morn   for when the jousts were ended yesterday   went yniol through the town and everywhere   he found the sack and plunder of our house   all scattered through the houses of the town   and gave command that all which once was ours   should now be ours again  and yestereve   while ye were talking sweetly with your prince   came one with this and laid it in my hand   for love or fear or seeking favour of us   because we have our earldom back again   and yestereve i would not tell you of it   but kept it for a sweet surprise at morn   yea truly is it not a sweet surprise   for i myself unwillingly have worn   my faded suit as you my child have yours   and howsoever patient yniol his   ah dear he took me from a goodly house   with store of rich apparel sumptuous fare   and page and maid and squire and seneschal   and pastime both of hawk and hound and all   that appertains to noble maintenance   yea and he brought me to a goodly house   but since our fortune swerved from sun to shade   and all through that young traitor cruel need   constrained us but a better time has come   so clothe yourself in this that better fits   our mended fortunes and a princes bride   for though ye won the prize of fairest fair   and though i heard him call you fairest fair   let never maiden think however fair   she is not fairer in new clothes than old   and should some great courtlady say the prince   hath picked a raggedrobin from the hedge   and like a madman brought her to the court   then were ye shamed and worse might shame the prince   to whom we are beholden but i know   that when my dear child is set forth at her best   that neither court nor country though they sought   through all the provinces like those of old   that lighted on queen esther has her match       here ceased the kindly mother out of breath   and enid listened brightening as she lay   then as the white and glittering star of morn   parts from a bank of snow and by and by   slips into golden cloud the maiden rose   and left her maiden couch and robed herself   helped by the mothers careful hand and eye   without a mirror in the gorgeous gown   who after turned her daughter round and said   she never yet had seen her half so fair   and called her like that maiden in the tale   whom gwydion made by glamour out of flowers   and sweeter than the bride of cassivelaun   flur for whose love the roman caesar first   invaded britain but we beat him back   as this great prince invaded us and we   not beat him back but welcomed him with joy   and i can scarcely ride with you to court   for old am i and rough the ways and wild   but yniol goes and i full oft shall dream   i see my princess as i see her now   clothed with my gift and gay among the gay       but while the women thus rejoiced geraint   woke where he slept in the high hall and called   for enid and when yniol made report   of that good mother making enid gay   in such apparel as might well beseem   his princess or indeed the stately queen   he answered  earl entreat her by my love   albeit i give no reason but my wish   that she ride with me in her faded silk   yniol with that hard message went it fell   like flaws in summer laying lusty corn   for enid all abashed she knew not why   dared not to glance at her good mothers face   but silently in all obedience   her mother silent too nor helping her   laid from her limbs the costlybroidered gift   and robed them in her ancient suit again   and so descended  never man rejoiced   more than geraint to greet her thus attired   and glancing all at once as keenly at her   as careful robins eye the delvers toil   made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall   but rested with her sweet face satisfied   then seeing cloud upon the mothers brow   her by both hands she caught and sweetly said       o my new mother be not wroth or grieved   at thy new son for my petition to her   when late i left caerleon our great queen   in words whose echo lasts they were so sweet   made promise that whatever bride i brought   herself would clothe her like the sun in heaven   thereafter when i reached this ruined hall   beholding one so bright in dark estate   i vowed that could i gain her our fair queen   no hand but hers should make your enid burst   sunlike from cloudand likewise thought perhaps   that service done so graciously would bind   the two together fain i would the two   should love each other  how can enid find   a nobler friend  another thought was mine   i came among you here so suddenly   that though her gentle presence at the lists   might well have served for proof that i was loved   i doubted whether daughters tenderness   or easy nature might not let itself   be moulded by your wishes for her weal   or whether some false sense in her own self   of my contrasting brightness overbore   her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall   and such a sense might make her long for court   and all its perilous glories  and i thought   that could i someway prove such force in her   linked with such love for me that at a word   no reason given her she could cast aside   a splendour dear to women new to her   and therefore dearer or if not so new   yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power   of intermitted usage then i felt   that i could rest a rock in ebbs and flows   fixt on her faith  now therefore i do rest   a prophet certain of my prophecy   that never shadow of mistrust can cross   between us  grant me pardon for my thoughts   and for my strange petition i will make   amends hereafter by some gaudyday   when your fair child shall wear your costly gift   beside your own warm hearth with on her knees   who knows another gift of the high god   which maybe shall have learned to lisp you thanks       he spoke  the mother smiled but half in tears   then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it   and claspt and kissed her and they rode away       now thrice that morning guinevere had climbed   the giant tower from whose high crest they say   men saw the goodly hills of somerset   and white sails flying on the yellow sea   but not to goodly hill or yellow sea   looked the fair queen but up the vale of usk   by the flat meadow till she saw them come   and then descending met them at the gates   embraced her with all welcome as a friend   and did her honour as the princes bride   and clothed her for her bridals like the sun   and all that week was old caerleon gay   for by the hands of dubric the high saint   they twain were wedded with all ceremony       and this was on the last years whitsuntide   but enid ever kept the faded silk   remembering how first he came on her   drest in that dress and how he loved her in it   and all her foolish fears about the dress   and all his journey toward her as himself   had told her and their coming to the court       and now this morning when he said to her   put on your worst and meanest dress she found   and took it and arrayed herself therein      geraint and enid    o purblind race of miserable men   how many among us at this very hour   do forge a lifelong trouble for ourselves   by taking true for false or false for true   here through the feeble twilight of this world   groping how many until we pass and reach   that other where we see as we are seen       so fared it with geraint who issuing forth   that morning when they both had got to horse   perhaps because he loved her passionately   and felt that tempest brooding round his heart   which if he spoke at all would break perforce   upon a head so dear in thunder said   not at my side  i charge thee ride before   ever a good way on before and this   i charge thee on thy duty as a wife   whatever happens not to speak to me   no not a word and enid was aghast   and forth they rode but scarce three paces on   when crying out effeminate as i am   i will not fight my way with gilded arms   all shall be iron he loosed a mighty purse   hung at his belt and hurled it toward the squire   so the last sight that enid had of home   was all the marble threshold flashing strown   with gold and scattered coinage and the squire   chafing his shoulder  then he cried again   to the wilds and enid leading down the tracks   through which he bad her lead him on they past   the marches and by bandithaunted holds   gray swamps and pools waste places of the hern   and wildernesses perilous paths they rode   round was their pace at first but slackened soon   a stranger meeting them had surely thought   they rode so slowly and they looked so pale   that each had suffered some exceeding wrong   for he was ever saying to himself   o i that wasted time to tend upon her   to compass her with sweet observances   to dress her beautifully and keep her true   and there he broke the sentence in his heart   abruptly as a man upon his tongue   may break it when his passion masters him   and she was ever praying the sweet heavens   to save her dear lord whole from any wound   and ever in her mind she cast about   for that unnoticed failing in herself   which made him look so cloudy and so cold   till the great plovers human whistle amazed   her heart and glancing round the waste she feared   in ever wavering brake an ambuscade   then thought again if there be such in me   i might amend it by the grace of heaven   if he would only speak and tell me of it       but when the fourth part of the day was gone   then enid was aware of three tall knights   on horseback wholly armed behind a rock   in shadow waiting for them caitiffs all   and heard one crying to his fellow look   here comes a laggard hanging down his head   who seems no bolder than a beaten hound   come we will slay him and will have his horse   and armour and his damsel shall be ours       then enid pondered in her heart and said   i will go back a little to my lord   and i will tell him all their caitiff talk   for be he wroth even to slaying me   far liefer by his dear hand had i die   than that my lord should suffer loss or shame       then she went back some paces of return   met his full frown timidly firm and said   my lord i saw three bandits by the rock   waiting to fall on you and heard them boast   that they would slay you and possess your horse   and armour and your damsel should be theirs       he made a wrathful answer  did i wish   your warning or your silence one command   i laid upon you not to speak to me   and thus ye keep it  well then lookfor now   whether ye wish me victory or defeat   long for my life or hunger for my death   yourself shall see my vigour is not lost       then enid waited pale and sorrowful   and down upon him bare the bandit three   and at the midmost charging prince geraint   drave the long spear a cubit through his breast   and out beyond and then against his brace   of comrades each of whom had broken on him   a lance that splintered like an icicle   swung from his brand a windy buffet out   once twice to right to left and stunned the twain   or slew them and dismounting like a man   that skins the wild beast after slaying him   stript from the three dead wolves of woman born   the three gay suits of armour which they wore   and let the bodies lie but bound the suits   of armour on their horses each on each   and tied the bridlereins of all the three   together and said to her drive them on   before you and she drove them through the waste       he followed nearer ruth began to work   against his anger in him while he watched   the being he loved best in all the world   with difficulty in mild obedience   driving them on  he fain had spoken to her   and loosed in words of sudden fire the wrath   and smouldered wrong that burnt him all within   but evermore it seemed an easier thing   at once without remorse to strike her dead   than to cry halt and to her own bright face   accuse her of the least immodesty   and thus tonguetied it made him wroth the more   that she could speak whom his own ear had heard   call herself false  and suffering thus he made   minutes an age  but in scarce longer time   than at caerleon the fulltided usk   before he turn to fall seaward again   pauses did enid keeping watch behold   in the first shallow shade of a deep wood   before a gloom of stubbornshafted oaks   three other horsemen waiting wholly armed   whereof one seemed far larger than her lord   and shook her pulses crying look a prize   three horses and three goodly suits of arms   and all in charge of whom a girl  set on   nay said the second yonder comes a knight   the third a craven how he hangs his head   the giant answered merrily yea but one   wait here and when he passes fall upon him       and enid pondered in her heart and said   i will abide the coming of my lord   and i will tell him all their villainy   my lord is weary with the fight before   and they will fall upon him unawares   i needs must disobey him for his good   how should i dare obey him to his harm   needs must i speak and though he kill me for it   i save a life dearer to me than mine       and she abode his coming and said to him   with timid firmness have i leave to speak   he said ye take it speaking and she spoke       there lurk three villains yonder in the wood   and each of them is wholly armed and one   is largerlimbed than you are and they say   that they will fall upon you while ye pass       to which he flung a wrathful answer back   and if there were an hundred in the wood   and every man were largerlimbed than i   and all at once should sally out upon me   i swear it would not ruffle me so much   as you that not obey me  stand aside   and if i fall cleave to the better man       and enid stood aside to wait the event   not dare to watch the combat only breathe   short fits of prayer at every stroke a breath   and he she dreaded most bare down upon him   aimed at the helm his lance erred but geraints   a little in the late encounter strained   struck through the bulky bandits corselet home   and then brake short and down his enemy rolled   and there lay still as he that tells the tale   saw once a great piece of a promontory   that had a sapling growing on it slide   from the long shorecliffs windy walls to the beach   and there lie still and yet the sapling grew   so lay the man transfixt  his craven pair   of comrades making slowlier at the prince   when now they saw their bulwark fallen stood   on whom the victor to confound them more   spurred with his terrible warcry for as one   that listens near a torrent mountainbrook   all through the crash of the near cataract hears   the drumming thunder of the huger fall   at distance were the soldiers wont to hear   his voice in battle and be kindled by it   and foemen scared like that false pair who turned   flying but overtaken died the death   themselves had wrought on many an innocent       thereon geraint dismounting picked the lance   that pleased him best and drew from those dead wolves   their three gay suits of armour each from each   and bound them on their horses each on each   and tied the bridlereins of all the three   together and said to her drive them on   before you and she drove them through the wood       he followed nearer still  the pain she had   to keep them in the wild ways of the wood   two sets of three laden with jingling arms   together served a little to disedge   the sharpness of that pain about her heart   and they themselves like creatures gently born   but into bad hands fallen and now so long   by bandits groomed pricked their light ears and felt   her low firm voice and tender government       so through the green gloom of the wood they past   and issuing under open heavens beheld   a little town with towers upon a rock   and close beneath a meadow gemlike chased   in the brown wild and mowers mowing in it   and down a rocky pathway from the place   there came a fairhaired youth that in his hand   bare victual for the mowers  and geraint   had ruth again on enid looking pale   then moving downward to the meadow ground   he when the fairhaired youth came by him said   friend let her eat the damsel is so faint   yea willingly replied the youth and thou   my lord eat also though the fare is coarse   and only meet for mowers then set down   his basket and dismounting on the sward   they let the horses graze and ate themselves   and enid took a little delicately   less having stomach for it than desire   to close with her lords pleasure but geraint   ate all the mowers victual unawares   and when he found all empty was amazed   and boy said he i have eaten all but take   a horse and arms for guerdon choose the best   he reddening in extremity of delight   my lord you overpay me fiftyfold   ye will be all the wealthier cried the prince   i take it as free gift then said the boy   not guerdon for myself can easily   while your good damsel rests return and fetch   fresh victual for these mowers of our earl   for these are his and all the field is his   and i myself am his and i will tell him   how great a man thou art  he loves to know   when men of mark are in his territory   and he will have thee to his palace here   and serve thee costlier than with mowers fare       then said geraint i wish no better fare   i never ate with angrier appetite   than when i left your mowers dinnerless   and into no earls palace will i go   i know god knows too much of palaces   and if he want me let him come to me   but hire us some fair chamber for the night   and stalling for the horses and return   with victual for these men and let us know       yea my kind lord said the glad youth and went   held his head high and thought himself a knight   and up the rocky pathway disappeared   leading the horse and they were left alone       but when the prince had brought his errant eyes   home from the rock sideways he let them glance   at enid where she droopt  his own false doom   that shadow of mistrust should never cross   betwixt them came upon him and he sighed   then with another humorous ruth remarked   the lusty mowers labouring dinnerless   and watched the sun blaze on the turning scythe   and after nodded sleepily in the heat   but she remembering her old ruined hall   and all the windy clamour of the daws   about her hollow turret plucked the grass   there growing longest by the meadows edge   and into many a listless annulet   now over now beneath her marriage ring   wove and unwove it till the boy returned   and told them of a chamber and they went   where after saying to her if ye will   call for the woman of the house to which   she answered thanks my lord the two remained   apart by all the chambers width and mute   as two creatures voiceless through the fault of birth   or two wild men supporters of a shield   painted who stare at open space nor glance   the one at other parted by the shield       on a sudden many a voice along the street   and heel against the pavement echoing burst   their drowse and either started while the door   pushed from without drave backward to the wall   and midmost of a rout of roisterers   femininely fair and dissolutely pale   her suitor in old years before geraint   entered the wild lord of the place limours   he moving up with pliant courtliness   greeted geraint full face but stealthily   in the midwarmth of welcome and graspt hand   found enid with the corner of his eye   and knew her sitting sad and solitary   then cried geraint for wine and goodly cheer   to feed the sudden guest and sumptuously   according to his fashion bad the host   call in what men soever were his friends   and feast with these in honour of their earl   and care not for the cost the cost is mine       and wine and food were brought and earl limours   drank till he jested with all ease and told   free tales and took the word and played upon it   and made it of two colours for his talk   when wine and free companions kindled him   was wont to glance and sparkle like a gem   of fifty facets thus he moved the prince   to laughter and his comrades to applause   then when the prince was merry asked limours   your leave my lord to cross the room and speak   to your good damsel there who sits apart   and seems so lonely  my free leave he said   get her to speak  she doth not speak to me   then rose limours and looking at his feet   like him who tries the bridge he fears may fail   crost and came near lifted adoring eyes   bowed at her side and uttered whisperingly       enid the pilot star of my lone life   enid my early and my only love   enid the loss of whom hath turned me wild   what chance is this how is it i see you here   ye are in my power at last are in my power   yet fear me not  i call mine own self wild   but keep a touch of sweet civility   here in the heart of waste and wilderness   i thought but that your father came between   in former days you saw me favourably   and if it were so do not keep it back   make me a little happier  let me know it   owe you me nothing for a life halflost   yea yea the whole dear debt of all you are   and enid you and he i see with joy   ye sit apart you do not speak to him   you come with no attendance page or maid   to serve youdoth he love you as of old   for call it lovers quarrels yet i know   though men may bicker with the things they love   they would not make them laughable in all eyes   not while they loved them and your wretched dress   a wretched insult on you dumbly speaks   your story that this man loves you no more   your beauty is no beauty to him now   a common chanceright well i know itpalled   for i know men  nor will ye win him back   for the mans love once gone never returns   but here is one who loves you as of old   with more exceeding passion than of old   good speak the word  my followers ring him round   he sits unarmed i hold a finger up   they understand  nay i do not mean blood   nor need ye look so scared at what i say   my malice is no deeper than a moat   no stronger than a wall  there is the keep   he shall not cross us more speak but the word   or speak it not but then by him that made me   the one true lover whom you ever owned   i will make use of all the power i have   o pardon me the madness of that hour   when first i parted from thee moves me yet       at this the tender sound of his own voice   and sweet selfpity or the fancy of it   made his eye moist but enid feared his eyes   moist as they were wineheated from the feast   and answered with such craft as women use   guilty or guiltless to stave off a chance   that breaks upon them perilously and said       earl if you love me as in former years   and do not practise on me come with morn   and snatch me from him as by violence   leave me tonight  i am weary to the death       low at leavetaking with his brandished plume   brushing his instep bowed the allamorous earl   and the stout prince bad him a loud goodnight   he moving homeward babbled to his men   how enid never loved a man but him   nor cared a broken eggshell for her lord       but enid left alone with prince geraint   debating his command of silence given   and that she now perforce must violate it   held commune with herself and while she held   he fell asleep and enid had no heart   to wake him but hung oer him wholly pleased   to find him yet unwounded after fight   and hear him breathing low and equally   anon she rose and stepping lightly heaped   the pieces of his armour in one place   all to be there against a sudden need   then dozed awhile herself but overtoiled   by that days grief and travel evermore   seemed catching at a rootless thorn and then   went slipping down horrible precipices   and strongly striking out her limbs awoke   then thought she heard the wild earl at the door   with all his rout of random followers   sound on a dreadful trumpet summoning her   which was the red cock shouting to the light   as the gray dawn stole oer the dewy world   and glimmered on his armour in the room   and once again she rose to look at it   but touched it unawares  jangling the casque   fell and he started up and stared at her   then breaking his command of silence given   she told him all that earl limours had said   except the passage that he loved her not   nor left untold the craft herself had used   but ended with apology so sweet   lowspoken and of so few words and seemed   so justified by that necessity   that though he thought was it for him she wept   in devon he but gave a wrathful groan   saying your sweet faces make good fellows fools   and traitors  call the host and bid him bring   charger and palfrey  so she glided out   among the heavy breathings of the house   and like a household spirit at the walls   beat till she woke the sleepers and returned   then tending her rough lord though all unasked   in silence did him service as a squire   till issuing armed he found the host and cried   thy reckoning friend and ere he learnt it take   five horses and their armours and the host   suddenly honest answered in amaze   my lord i scarce have spent the worth of one   ye will be all the wealthier said the prince   and then to enid forward and today   i charge you enid more especially   what thing soever ye may hear or see   or fancy though i count it of small use   to charge you that ye speak not but obey       and enid answered yea my lord i know   your wish and would obey but riding first   i hear the violent threats you do not hear   i see the danger which you cannot see   then not to give you warning that seems hard   almost beyond me  yet i would obey       yea so said he do it  be not too wise   seeing that ye are wedded to a man   not all mismated with a yawning clown   but one with arms to guard his head and yours   with eyes to find you out however far   and ears to hear you even in his dreams       with that he turned and looked as keenly at her   as careful robins eye the delvers toil   and that within her which a wanton fool   or hasty judger would have called her guilt   made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall   and geraint looked and was not satisfied       then forward by a way which beaten broad   led from the territory of false limours   to the waste earldom of another earl   doorm whom his shaking vassals called the bull   went enid with her sullen follower on   once she looked back and when she saw him ride   more near by many a rood than yestermorn   it wellnigh made her cheerful till geraint   waving an angry hand as who should say   ye watch me saddened all her heart again   but while the sun yet beat a dewy blade   the sound of many a heavilygalloping hoof   smote on her ear and turning round she saw   dust and the points of lances bicker in it   then not to disobey her lords behest   and yet to give him warning for he rode   as if he heard not moving back she held   her finger up and pointed to the dust   at which the warrior in his obstinacy   because she kept the letter of his word   was in a manner pleased and turning stood   and in the moment after wild limours   borne on a black horse like a thundercloud   whose skirts are loosened by the breaking storm   half ridden off with by the thing he rode   and all in passion uttering a dry shriek   dashed down on geraint who closed with him and bore   down by the length of lance and arm beyond   the crupper and so left him stunned or dead   and overthrew the next that followed him   and blindly rushed on all the rout behind   but at the flash and motion of the man   they vanished panicstricken like a shoal   of darting fish that on a summer morn   adown the crystal dykes at camelot   come slipping oer their shadows on the sand   but if a man who stands upon the brink   but lift a shining hand against the sun   there is not left the twinkle of a fin   betwixt the cressy islets white in flower   so scared but at the motion of the man   fled all the boon companions of the earl   and left him lying in the public way   so vanish friendships only made in wine       then like a stormy sunlight smiled geraint   who saw the chargers of the two that fell   start from their fallen lords and wildly fly   mixt with the flyers  horse and man he said   all of one mind and all righthonest friends   not a hoof left  and i methinks till now   was honestpaid with horses and with arms   i cannot steal or plunder no nor beg   and so what say ye shall we strip him there   your lover has your palfrey heart enough   to bear his armour shall we fast or dine   nothen do thou being right honest pray   that we may meet the horsemen of earl doorm   i too would still be honest  thus he said   and sadly gazing on her bridlereins   and answering not one word she led the way       but as a man to whom a dreadful loss   falls in a far land and he knows it not   but coming back he learns it and the loss   so pains him that he sickens nigh to death   so fared it with geraint who being pricked   in combat with the follower of limours   bled underneath his armour secretly   and so rode on nor told his gentle wife   what ailed him hardly knowing it himself   till his eye darkened and his helmet wagged   and at a sudden swerving of the road   though happily down on a bank of grass   the prince without a word from his horse fell       and enid heard the clashing of his fall   suddenly came and at his side all pale   dismounting loosed the fastenings of his arms   nor let her true hand falter nor blue eye   moisten till she had lighted on his wound   and tearing off her veil of faded silk   had bared her forehead to the blistering sun   and swathed the hurt that drained her dear lords life   then after all was done that hand could do   she rested and her desolation came   upon her and she wept beside the way       and many past but none regarded her   for in that realm of lawless turbulence   a woman weeping for her murdered mate   was cared as much for as a summer shower   one took him for a victim of earl doorm   nor dared to waste a perilous pity on him   another hurrying past a manatarms   rode on a mission to the bandit earl   half whistling and half singing a coarse song   he drove the dust against her veilless eyes   another flying from the wrath of doorm   before an everfancied arrow made   the long way smoke beneath him in his fear   at which her palfrey whinnying lifted heel   and scoured into the coppices and was lost   while the great charger stood grieved like a man       but at the point of noon the huge earl doorm   broadfaced with underfringe of russet beard   bound on a foray rolling eyes of prey   came riding with a hundred lances up   but ere he came like one that hails a ship   cried out with a big voice what is he dead   no no not dead she answered in all haste   would some of your people take him up   and bear him hence out of this cruel sun   most sure am i quite sure he is not dead       then said earl doorm  well if he be not dead   why wail ye for him thus ye seem a child   and be he dead i count you for a fool   your wailing will not quicken him  dead or not   ye mar a comely face with idiot tears   yet since the face is comelysome of you   here take him up and bear him to our hall   an if he live we will have him of our band   and if he die why earth has earth enough   to hide him  see ye take the charger too   a noble one                he spake and past away   but left two brawny spearmen who advanced   each growling like a dog when his good bone   seems to be plucked at by the village boys   who love to vex him eating and he fears   to lose his bone and lays his foot upon it   gnawing and growling  so the ruffians growled   fearing to lose and all for a dead man   their chance of booty from the mornings raid   yet raised and laid him on a litterbier   such as they brought upon their forays out   for those that might be wounded laid him on it   all in the hollow of his shield and took   and bore him to the naked hall of doorm   his gentle charger following him unled   and cast him and the bier in which he lay   down on an oaken settle in the hall   and then departed hot in haste to join   their luckier mates but growling as before   and cursing their lost time and the dead man   and their own earl and their own souls and her   they might as well have blest her  she was deaf   to blessing or to cursing save from one       so for long hours sat enid by her lord   there in the naked hall propping his head   and chafing his pale hands and calling to him   till at the last he wakened from his swoon   and found his own dear bride propping his head   and chafing his faint hands and calling to him   and felt the warm tears falling on his face   and said to his own heart she weeps for me   and yet lay still and feigned himself as dead   that he might prove her to the uttermost   and say to his own heart she weeps for me       but in the falling afternoon returned   the huge earl doorm with plunder to the hall   his lusty spearmen followed him with noise   each hurling down a heap of things that rang   against his pavement cast his lance aside   and doffed his helm  and then there fluttered in   halfbold halffrighted with dilated eyes   a tribe of women dressed in many hues   and mingled with the spearmen  and earl doorm   struck with a knifes haft hard against the board   and called for flesh and wine to feed his spears   and men brought in whole hogs and quarter beeves   and all the hall was dim with steam of flesh   and none spake word but all sat down at once   and ate with tumult in the naked hall   feeding like horses when you hear them feed   till enid shrank far back into herself   to shun the wild ways of the lawless tribe   but when earl doorm had eaten all he would   he rolled his eyes about the hall and found   a damsel drooping in a corner of it   then he remembered her and how she wept   and out of her there came a power upon him   and rising on the sudden he said eat   i never yet beheld a thing so pale   gods curse it makes me mad to see you weep   eat  look yourself  good luck had your good man   for were i dead who is it would weep for me   sweet lady never since i first drew breath   have i beheld a lily like yourself   and so there lived some colour in your cheek   there is not one among my gentlewomen   were fit to wear your slipper for a glove   but listen to me and by me be ruled   and i will do the thing i have not done   for ye shall share my earldom with me girl   and we will live like two birds in one nest   and i will fetch you forage from all fields   for i compel all creatures to my will       he spoke  the brawny spearman let his cheek   bulge with the unswallowed piece and turning stared   while some whose souls the old serpent long had drawn   down as the worm draws in the withered leaf   and makes it earth hissed each at others ear   what shall not be recordedwomen they   women or what had been those gracious things   but now desired the humbling of their best   yea would have helped him to it  and all at once   they hated her who took no thought of them   but answered in low voice her meek head yet   drooping i pray you of your courtesy   he being as he is to let me be       she spake so low he hardly heard her speak   but like a mighty patron satisfied   with what himself had done so graciously   assumed that she had thanked him adding yea   eat and be glad for i account you mine       she answered meekly how should i be glad   henceforth in all the world at anything   until my lord arise and look upon me       here the huge earl cried out upon her talk   as all but empty heart and weariness   and sickly nothing suddenly seized on her   and bare her by main violence to the board   and thrust the dish before her crying eat       no no said enid vext i will not eat   till yonder man upon the bier arise   and eat with me  drink then he answered  here   and filled a horn with wine and held it to her   lo i myself when flushed with fight or hot   gods curse with angeroften i myself   before i well have drunken scarce can eat   drink therefore and the wine will change thy will       not so she cried by heaven i will not drink   till my dear lord arise and bid me do it   and drink with me and if he rise no more   i will not look at wine until i die       at this he turned all red and paced his hall   now gnawed his under now his upper lip   and coming up close to her said at last   girl for i see ye scorn my courtesies   take warning  yonder man is surely dead   and i compel all creatures to my will   not eat nor drink  and wherefore wail for one   who put your beauty to this flout and scorn   by dressing it in rags  amazed am i   beholding how ye butt against my wish   that i forbear you thus  cross me no more   at least put off to please me this poor gown   this silken rag this beggarwomans weed   i love that beauty should go beautifully   for see ye not my gentlewomen here   how gay how suited to the house of one   who loves that beauty should go beautifully   rise therefore robe yourself in this  obey       he spoke and one among his gentlewomen   displayed a splendid silk of foreign loom   where like a shoaling sea the lovely blue   played into green and thicker down the front   with jewels than the sward with drops of dew   when all night long a cloud clings to the hill   and with the dawn ascending lets the day   strike where it clung  so thickly shone the gems       but enid answered harder to be moved   than hardest tyrants in their day of power   with lifelong injuries burning unavenged   and now their hour has come and enid said       in this poor gown my dear lord found me first   and loved me serving in my fathers hall   in this poor gown i rode with him to court   and there the queen arrayed me like the sun   in this poor gown he bad me clothe myself   when now we rode upon this fatal quest   of honour where no honour can be gained   and this poor gown i will not cast aside   until himself arise a living man   and bid me cast it  i have griefs enough   pray you be gentle pray you let me be   i never loved can never love but him   yea god i pray you of your gentleness   he being as he is to let me be       then strode the brute earl up and down his hall   and took his russet beard between his teeth   last coming up quite close and in his mood   crying i count it of no more avail   dame to be gentle than ungentle with you   take my salute unknightly with flat hand   however lightly smote her on the cheek       then enid in her utter helplessness   and since she thought he had not dared to do it   except he surely knew my lord was dead   sent forth a sudden sharp and bitter cry   as of a wild thing taken in the trap   which sees the trapper coming through the wood       this heard geraint and grasping at his sword   it lay beside him in the hollow shield   made but a single bound and with a sweep of it   shore through the swarthy neck and like a ball   the russetbearded head rolled on the floor   so died earl doorm by him he counted dead   and all the men and women in the hall   rose when they saw the dead man rise and fled   yelling as from a spectre and the two   were left alone together and he said       enid i have used you worse than that dead man   done you more wrong  we both have undergone   that trouble which has left me thrice your own   henceforward i will rather die than doubt   and here i lay this penance on myself   not though mine own ears heard you yestermorn   you thought me sleeping but i heard you say   i heard you say that you were no true wife   i swear i will not ask your meaning in it   i do believe yourself against yourself   and will henceforward rather die than doubt       and enid could not say one tender word   she felt so blunt and stupid at the heart   she only prayed him fly they will return   and slay you fly your charger is without   my palfrey lost  then enid shall you ride   behind me  yea said enid let us go   and moving out they found the stately horse   who now no more a vassal to the thief   but free to stretch his limbs in lawful fight   neighed with all gladness as they came and stooped   with a low whinny toward the pair  and she   kissed the white star upon his noble front   glad also then geraint upon the horse   mounted and reached a hand and on his foot   she set her own and climbed he turned his face   and kissed her climbing and she cast her arms   about him and at once they rode away       and never yet since high in paradise   oer the four rivers the first roses blew   came purer pleasure unto mortal kind   than lived through her who in that perilous hour   put hand to hand beneath her husbands heart   and felt him hers again  she did not weep   but oer her meek eyes came a happy mist   like that which kept the heart of eden green   before the useful trouble of the rain   yet not so misty were her meek blue eyes   as not to see before them on the path   right in the gateway of the bandit hold   a knight of arthurs court who laid his lance   in rest and made as if to fall upon him   then fearing for his hurt and loss of blood   she with her mind all full of what had chanced   shrieked to the stranger slay not a dead man   the voice of enid said the knight but she   beholding it was edyrn son of nudd   was moved so much the more and shrieked again   o cousin slay not him who gave you life   and edyrn moving frankly forward spake   my lord geraint i greet you with all love   i took you for a bandit knight of doorm   and fear not enid i should fall upon him   who love you prince with something of the love   wherewith we love the heaven that chastens us   for once when i was up so high in pride   that i was halfway down the slope to hell   by overthrowing me you threw me higher   now made a knight of arthurs table round   and since i knew this earl when i myself   was half a bandit in my lawless hour   i come the mouthpiece of our king to doorm   the king is close behind me bidding him   disband himself and scatter all his powers   submit and hear the judgment of the king       he hears the judgment of the king of kings   cried the wan prince and lo the powers of doorm   are scattered and he pointed to the field   where huddled here and there on mound and knoll   were men and women staring and aghast   while some yet fled and then he plainlier told   how the huge earl lay slain within his hall   but when the knight besought him follow me   prince to the camp and in the kings own ear   speak what has chanced ye surely have endured   strange chances here alone that other flushed   and hung his head and halted in reply   fearing the mild face of the blameless king   and after madness acted question asked   till edyrn crying if ye will not go   to arthur then will arthur come to you   enough he said i follow and they went   but enid in their going had two fears   one from the bandit scattered in the field   and one from edyrn  every now and then   when edyrn reined his charger at her side   she shrank a little  in a hollow land   from which old fires have broken men may fear   fresh fire and ruin  he perceiving said       fair and dear cousin you that most had cause   to fear me fear no longer i am changed   yourself were first the blameless cause to make   my natures prideful sparkle in the blood   break into furious flame being repulsed   by yniol and yourself i schemed and wrought   until i overturned him then set up   with one main purpose ever at my heart   my haughty jousts and took a paramour   did her mockhonour as the fairest fair   and toppling over all antagonism   so waxed in pride that i believed myself   unconquerable for i was wellnigh mad   and but for my main purpose in these jousts   i should have slain your father seized yourself   i lived in hope that sometime you would come   to these my lists with him whom best you loved   and there poor cousin with your meek blue eyes   the truest eyes that ever answered heaven   behold me overturn and trample on him   then had you cried or knelt or prayed to me   i should not less have killed him  and so you came   but once you cameand with your own true eyes   beheld the man you loved i speak as one   speaks of a service done him overthrow   my proud self and my purpose three years old   and set his foot upon me and give me life   there was i broken down there was i saved   though thence i rode allshamed hating the life   he gave me meaning to be rid of it   and all the penance the queen laid upon me   was but to rest awhile within her court   where first as sullen as a beast newcaged   and waiting to be treated like a wolf   because i knew my deeds were known i found   instead of scornful pity or pure scorn   such fine reserve and noble reticence   manners so kind yet stately such a grace   of tenderest courtesy that i began   to glance behind me at my former life   and find that it had been the wolfs indeed   and oft i talked with dubric the high saint   who with mild heat of holy oratory   subdued me somewhat to that gentleness   which when it weds with manhood makes a man   and you were often there about the queen   but saw me not or marked not if you saw   nor did i care or dare to speak with you   but kept myself aloof till i was changed   and fear not cousin i am changed indeed       he spoke and enid easily believed   like simple noble natures credulous   of what they long for good in friend or foe   there most in those who most have done them ill   and when they reached the camp the king himself   advanced to greet them and beholding her   though pale yet happy asked her not a word   but went apart with edyrn whom he held   in converse for a little and returned   and gravely smiling lifted her from horse   and kissed her with all pureness brotherlike   and showed an empty tent allotted her   and glancing for a minute till he saw her   pass into it turned to the prince and said       prince when of late ye prayed me for my leave   to move to your own land and there defend   your marches i was pricked with some reproof   as one that let foul wrong stagnate and be   by having looked too much through alien eyes   and wrought too long with delegated hands   not used mine own  but now behold me come   to cleanse this common sewer of all my realm   with edyrn and with others  have ye looked   at edyrn have ye seen how nobly changed   this work of his is great and wonderful   his very face with change of heart is changed   the world will not believe a man repents   and this wise world of ours is mainly right   full seldom doth a man repent or use   both grace and will to pick the vicious quitch   of blood and custom wholly out of him   and make all clean and plant himself afresh   edyrn has done it weeding all his heart   as i will weed this land before i go   i therefore made him of our table round   not rashly but have proved him everyway   one of our noblest our most valorous   sanest and most obedient  and indeed   this work of edyrn wrought upon himself   after a life of violence seems to me   a thousandfold more great and wonderful   than if some knight of mine risking his life   my subject with my subjects under him   should make an onslaught single on a realm   of robbers though he slew them one by one   and were himself nigh wounded to the death       so spake the king low bowed the prince and felt   his work was neither great nor wonderful   and past to enids tent and thither came   the kings own leech to look into his hurt   and enid tended on him there and there   her constant motion round him and the breath   of her sweet tendance hovering over him   filled all the genial courses of his blood   with deeper and with ever deeper love   as the southwest that blowing bala lake   fills all the sacred dee  so past the days       but while geraint lay healing of his hurt   the blameless king went forth and cast his eyes   on each of all whom uther left in charge   long since to guard the justice of the king   he looked and found them wanting and as now   men weed the white horse on the berkshire hills   to keep him bright and clean as heretofore   he rooted out the slothful officer   or guilty which for bribe had winked at wrong   and in their chairs set up a stronger race   with hearts and hands and sent a thousand men   to till the wastes and moving everywhere   cleared the dark places and let in the law   and broke the bandit holds and cleansed the land       then when geraint was whole again they past   with arthur to caerleon upon usk   there the great queen once more embraced her friend   and clothed her in apparel like the day   and though geraint could never take again   that comfort from their converse which he took   before the queens fair name was breathed upon   he rested well content that all was well   thence after tarrying for a space they rode   and fifty knights rode with them to the shores   of severn and they past to their own land   and there he kept the justice of the king   so vigorously yet mildly that all hearts   applauded and the spiteful whisper died   and being ever foremost in the chase   and victor at the tilt and tournament   they called him the great prince and man of men   but enid whom her ladies loved to call   enid the fair a grateful people named   enid the good and in their halls arose   the cry of children enids and geraints   of times to be nor did he doubt her more   but rested in her fealty till he crowned   a happy life with a fair death and fell   against the heathen of the northern sea   in battle fighting for the blameless king      balin and balan    pellam the king who held and lost with lot   in that first war and had his realm restored   but rendered tributary failed of late   to send his tribute wherefore arthur called   his treasurer one of many years and spake   go thou with him and him and bring it to us   lest we should set one truer on his throne   mans word is god in man                             his baron said   we go but harken  there be two strange knights   who sit near camelot at a fountainside   a mile beneath the forest challenging   and overthrowing every knight who comes   wilt thou i undertake them as we pass   and send them to thee                          arthur laughed upon him   old friend too old to be so young depart   delay not thou for aught but let them sit   until they find a lustier than themselves       so these departed  early one fair dawn   the lightwinged spirit of his youth returned   on arthurs heart he armed himself and went   so coming to the fountainside beheld   balin and balan sitting statuelike   brethren to right and left the spring that down   from underneath a plume of ladyfern   sang and the sand danced at the bottom of it   and on the right of balin balins horse   was fast beside an alder on the left   of balan balans near a poplartree   fair sirs said arthur wherefore sit ye here   balin and balan answered for the sake   of glory we be mightier men than all   in arthurs court that also have we proved   for whatsoever knight against us came   or i or he have easily overthrown   i too said arthur am of arthurs hall   but rather proven in his paynim wars   than famous jousts but see or proven or not   whether me likewise ye can overthrow   and arthur lightly smote the brethren down   and lightly so returned and no man knew       then balin rose and balan and beside   the carolling water set themselves again   and spake no word until the shadow turned   when from the fringe of coppice round them burst   a spangled pursuivant and crying sirs   rise follow ye be sent for by the king   they followed whom when arthur seeing asked   tell me your names why sat ye by the well   balin the stillness of a minute broke   saying an unmelodious name to thee   balin the savagethat addition thine   my brother and my better this man here   balan  i smote upon the naked skull   a thrall of thine in open hall my hand   was gauntleted half slew him for i heard   he had spoken evil of me thy just wrath   sent me a threeyears exile from thine eyes   i have not lived my life delightsomely   for i that did that violence to thy thrall   had often wrought some fury on myself   saving for balan  those three kingless years   have pastwere wormwoodbitter to me  king   methought that if we sat beside the well   and hurled to ground what knight soever spurred   against us thou wouldst take me gladlier back   and make as tentimes worthier to be thine   than twenty balins balan knight  i have said   not sonot all  a man of thine today   abashed us both and brake my boast  thy will   said arthur thou hast ever spoken truth   thy too fierce manhood would not let thee lie   rise my true knight  as children learn be thou   wiser for falling walk with me and move   to music with thine order and the king   thy chair a grief to all the brethren stands   vacant but thou retake it mine again       thereafter when sir balin entered hall   the lost one found was greeted as in heaven   with joy that blazed itself in woodland wealth   of leaf and gayest garlandage of flowers   along the walls and down the board they sat   and cup clashed cup they drank and some one sang   sweetvoiced a song of welcome whereupon   their common shout in chorus mounting made   those banners of twelve battles overhead   stir as they stirred of old when arthurs host   proclaimed him victor and the day was won       then balan added to their order lived   a wealthier life than heretofore with these   and balin till their embassage returned       sir king they brought report we hardly found   so bushed about it is with gloom the hall   of him to whom ye sent us pellam once   a christless foe of thine as ever dashed   horse against horse but seeing that thy realm   hath prospered in the name of christ the king   took as in rival heat to holy things   and finds himself descended from the saint   arimathaean joseph him who first   brought the great faith to britain over seas   he boasts his life as purer than thine own   eats scarce enow to keep his pulse abeat   hath pushed aside his faithful wife nor lets   or dame or damsel enter at his gates   lest he should be polluted  this gray king   showed us a shrine wherein were wondersyea   rich arks with priceless bones of martyrdom   thorns of the crown and shivers of the cross   and therewithal for thus he told us brought   by holy joseph thither that same spear   wherewith the roman pierced the side of christ   he much amazed us after when we sought   the tribute answered i have quite foregone   all matters of this world  garlon mine heir   of him demand it which this garlon gave   with much ado railing at thine and thee       but when we left in those deep woods we found   a knight of thine spearstricken from behind   dead whom we buried more than one of us   cried out on garlon but a woodman there   reported of some demon in the woods   was once a man who driven by evil tongues   from all his fellows lived alone and came   to learn black magic and to hate his kind   with such a hate that when he died his soul   became a fiend which as the man in life   was wounded by blind tongues he saw not whence   strikes from behind  this woodman showed the cave   from which he sallies and wherein he dwelt   we saw the hoofprint of a horse no more       then arthur let who goes before me see   he do not fall behind me  foully slain   and villainously who will hunt for me   this demon of the woods  said balan i   so claimed the quest and rode away but first   embracing balin good my brother hear   let not thy moods prevail when i am gone   who used to lay them hold them outer fiends   who leap at thee to tear thee shake them aside   dreams ruling when wit sleeps yea but to dream   that any of these would wrong thee wrongs thyself   witness their flowery welcome  bound are they   to speak no evil  truly save for fears   my fears for thee so rich a fellowship   would make me wholly blest  thou one of them   be one indeed  consider them and all   their bearing in their common bond of love   no more of hatred than in heaven itself   no more of jealousy than in paradise       so balan warned and went balin remained   whofor but three brief moons had glanced away   from being knighted till he smote the thrall   and faded from the presence into years   of exilenow would strictlier set himself   to learn what arthur meant by courtesy   manhood and knighthood wherefore hovered round   lancelot but when he marked his high sweet smile   in passing and a transitory word   make knight or churl or child or damsel seem   from being smiled at happier in themselves   sighed as a boy lameborn beneath a height   that glooms his valley sighs to see the peak   sunflushed or touch at night the northern star   for one from out his village lately climed   and brought report of azure lands and fair   far seen to left and right and he himself   hath hardly scaled with help a hundred feet   up from the base  so balin marvelling oft   how far beyond him lancelot seemed to move   groaned and at times would mutter these be gifts   born with the blood not learnable divine   beyond my reach  well had i foughtenwell   in those fierce wars struck hardand had i crowned   with my slain self the heaps of whom i slew   sobetterbut this worship of the queen   that honour too wherein she holds himthis   this was the sunshine that hath given the man   a growth a name that branches oer the rest   and strength against all odds and what the king   so prizesoverprizesgentleness   her likewise would i worship an i might   i never can be close with her as he   that brought her hither  shall i pray the king   to let me bear some token of his queen   whereon to gaze remembering herforget   my heats and violences live afresh   what if the queen disdained to grant it nay   being so statelygentle would she make   my darkness blackness and with how sweet grace   she greeted my return  bold will i be   some goodly cognizance of guinevere   in lieu of this rough beast upon my shield   langued gules and toothed with grinning savagery       and arthur when sir balin sought him said   what wilt thou bear balin was bold and asked   to bear her own crownroyal upon shield   whereat she smiled and turned her to the king   who answered thou shalt put the crown to use   the crown is but the shadow of the king   and this a shadows shadow let him have it   so this will help him of his violences   no shadow said sir balin o my queen   but light to me no shadow o my king   but golden earnest of a gentler life       so balin bare the crown and all the knights   approved him and the queen and all the world   made music and he felt his being move   in music with his order and the king       the nightingale fulltoned in middle may   hath ever and anon a note so thin   it seems another voice in other groves   thus after some quick burst of sudden wrath   the music in him seemed to change and grow   faint and faroff                     and once he saw the thrall   his passion half had gauntleted to death   that causer of his banishment and shame   smile at him as he deemed presumptuously   his arm half rose to strike again but fell   the memory of that cognizance on shield   weighted it down but in himself he moaned       too high this mount of camelot for me   these highset courtesies are not for me   shall i not rather prove the worse for these   fierier and stormier from restraining break   into some madness even before the queen       thus as a hearth lit in a mountain home   and glancing on the window when the gloom   of twilight deepens round it seems a flame   that rages in the woodland far below   so when his moods were darkened court and king   and all the kindly warmth of arthurs hall   shadowed an angry distance  yet he strove   to learn the graces of their table fought   hard with himself and seemed at length in peace       then chanced one morning that sir balin sat   closebowered in that garden nigh the hall   a walk of roses ran from door to door   a walk of lilies crost it to the bower   and down that range of roses the great queen   came with slow steps the morning on her face   and all in shadow from the counter door   sir lancelot as to meet her then at once   as if he saw not glanced aside and paced   the long white walk of lilies toward the bower   followed the queen sir balin heard her prince   art thou so little loyal to thy queen   as pass without good morrow to thy queen   to whom sir lancelot with his eyes on earth   fain would i still be loyal to the queen   yea so she said but so to pass me by   so loyal scarce is loyal to thyself   whom all men rate the king of courtesy   let be  ye stand fair lord as in a dream       then lancelot with his hand among the flowers   yeafor a dream  last night methought i saw   that maiden saint who stands with lily in hand   in yonder shrine  all round her prest the dark   and all the light upon her silver face   flowed from the spiritual lily that she held   lo these her emblems drew mine eyesaway   for see how perfectpure  as light a flush   as hardly tints the blossom of the quince   would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood       sweeter to me she said this garden rose   deephued and manyfolded sweeter still   the wildwood hyacinth and the bloom of may   prince we have ridden before among the flowers   in those fair daysnot all as cool as these   though seasonearlier  art thou sad or sick   our noble king will send thee his own leech   sick or for any matter angered at me       then lancelot lifted his large eyes they dwelt   deeptranced on hers and could not fall  her hue   changed at his gaze  so turning side by side   they past and balin started from his bower       queen subject but i see not what i see   damsel and lover hear not what i hear   my father hath begotten me in his wrath   i suffer from the things before me know   learn nothing am not worthy to be knight   a churl a clown and in him gloom on gloom   deepened  he sharply caught his lance and shield   nor stayed to crave permission of the king   but mad for strange adventure dashed away       he took the selfsame track as balan saw   the fountain where they sat together sighed   was i not better there with him and rode   the skyless woods but under open blue   came on the hoarhead woodman at a bough   wearily hewing  churl thine axe he cried   descended and disjointed it at a blow   to whom the woodman uttered wonderingly   lord thou couldst lay the devil of these woods   if arm of flesh could lay him  balin cried   him or the viler devil who plays his part   to lay that devil would lay the devil in me   nay said the churl our devil is a truth   i saw the flash of him but yestereven   and some do say that our sir garlon too   hath learned black magic and to ride unseen   look to the cave  but balin answered him   old fabler these be fancies of the churl   look to thy woodcraft and so leaving him   now with slack rein and careless of himself   now with dug spur and raving at himself   now with droopt brow down the long glades he rode   so marked not on his right a cavernchasm   yawn over darkness where nor far within   the whole day died but dying gleamed on rocks   roofpendent sharp and others from the floor   tusklike arising made that mouth of night   whereout the demon issued up from hell   he marked not this but blind and deaf to all   save that chained rage which ever yelpt within   past eastward from the falling sun  at once   he felt the hollowbeaten mosses thud   and tremble and then the shadow of a spear   shot from behind him ran along the ground   sideways he started from the path and saw   with pointed lance as if to pierce a shape   a light of armour by him flash and pass   and vanish in the woods and followed this   but all so blind in rage that unawares   he burst his lance against a forest bough   dishorsed himself and rose again and fled   far till the castle of a king the hall   of pellam lichenbearded grayly draped   with streaming grass appeared lowbuilt but strong   the ruinous donjon as a knoll of moss   the battlement overtopt with ivytods   a home of bats in every tower an owl      then spake the men of pellam crying lord   why wear ye this crownroyal upon shield   said balin for the fairest and the best   of ladies living gave me this to bear   so stalled his horse and strode across the court   but found the greetings both of knight and king   faint in the low dark hall of banquet  leaves   laid their green faces flat against the panes   sprays grated and the cankered boughs without   whined in the wood for all was hushed within   till when at feast sir garlon likewise asked   why wear ye that crownroyal balin said   the queen we worship lancelot i and all   as fairest best and purest granted me   to bear it  such a sound for arthurs knights   were hated strangers in the hall as makes   the white swanmother sitting when she hears   a strange knee rustle through her secret reeds   made garlon hissing then he sourly smiled   fairest i grant her  i have seen but best   best purest thou from arthurs hall and yet   so simple hast thou eyes or if are these   so far besotted that they fail to see   this fair wifeworship cloaks a secret shame   truly ye men of arthur be but babes       a goblet on the board by balin bossed   with holy josephs legend on his right   stood all of massiest bronze  one side had sea   and ship and sail and angels blowing on it   and one was rough with wattling and the walls   of that low church he built at glastonbury   this balin graspt but while in act to hurl   through memory of that token on the shield   relaxed his hold  i will be gentle he thought   and passing gentle caught his hand away   then fiercely to sir garlon eyes have i   that saw today the shadow of a spear   shot from behind me run along the ground   eyes too that long have watched how lancelot draws   from homage to the best and purest might   name manhood and a grace but scantly thine   who sitting in thine own hall canst endure   to mouth so huge a foulnessto thy guest   me me of arthurs table  felon talk   let be no more                    but not the less by night   the scorn of garlon poisoning all his rest   stung him in dreams  at length and dim through leaves   blinkt the white morn sprays grated and old boughs   whined in the wood  he rose descended met   the scorner in the castle court and fain   for hate and loathing would have past him by   but when sir garlon uttered mockingwise   what wear ye still that same crownscandalous   his countenance blackened and his forehead veins   bloated and branched and tearing out of sheath   the brand sir balin with a fiery ha   so thou be shadow here i make thee ghost   hard upon helm smote him and the blade flew   splintering in six and clinkt upon the stones   then garlon reeling slowly backward fell   and balin by the banneret of his helm   dragged him and struck but from the castle a cry   sounded across the court andmenatarms   a score with pointed lances making at him   he dashed the pummel at the foremost face   beneath a low door dipt and made his feet   wings through a glimmering gallery till he marked   the portal of king pellams chapel wide   and inward to the wall he stept behind   thence in a moment heard them pass like wolves   howling but while he stared about the shrine   in which he scarce could spy the christ for saints   beheld before a golden altar lie   the longest lance his eyes had ever seen   pointpainted red and seizing thereupon   pushed through an open casement down leaned on it   leapt in a semicircle and lit on earth   then hand at ear and harkening from what side   the blindfold rummage buried in the walls   might echo ran the counter path and found   his charger mounted on him and away   an arrow whizzed to the right one to the left   one overhead and pellams feeble cry   stay stay him he defileth heavenly things   with earthly usesmade him quickly dive   beneath the boughs and race through many a mile   of dense and open till his goodly horse   arising wearily at a fallen oak   stumbled headlong and cast him face to ground       halfwroth he had not ended but all glad   knightlike to find his charger yet unlamed   sir balin drew the shield from off his neck   stared at the priceless cognizance and thought   i have shamed thee so that now thou shamest me   thee will i bear no more high on a branch   hung it and turned aside into the woods   and there in gloom cast himself all along   moaning my violences my violences       but now the wholesome music of the wood   was dumbed by one from out the hall of mark   a damselerrant warbling as she rode   the woodland alleys vivien with her squire       the fire of heaven has killed the barren cold   and kindled all the plain and all the wold   the new leaf ever pushes off the old   the fire of heaven is not the flame of hell       old priest who mumble worship in your quire   old monk and nun ye scorn the worlds desire   yet in your frosty cells ye feel the fire   the fire of heaven is not the flame of hell       the fire of heaven is on the dusty ways   the wayside blossoms open to the blaze   the whole woodworld is one full peal of praise   the fire of heaven is not the flame of hell       the fire of heaven is lord of all things good   and starve not thou this fire within thy blood   but follow vivien through the fiery flood   the fire of heaven is not the flame of hell       then turning to her squire this fire of heaven   this old sunworship boy will rise again   and beat the cross to earth and break the king   and all his table                      then they reached a glade   where under one long lane of cloudless air   before another wood the royal crown   sparkled and swaying upon a restless elm   drew the vague glance of vivien and her squire   amazed were these lo there she crieda crown   borne by some high lordprince of arthurs hall   and there a horse the rider where is he   see yonder lies one dead within the wood   not dead he stirsbut sleeping  i will speak   hail royal knight we break on thy sweet rest   not doubtless all unearned by noble deeds   but bounden art thou if from arthurs hall   to help the weak  behold i fly from shame   a lustful king who sought to win my love   through evil ways  the knight with whom i rode   hath suffered misadventure and my squire   hath in him small defence but thou sir prince   wilt surely guide me to the warrior king   arthur the blameless pure as any maid   to get me shelter for my maidenhood   i charge thee by that crown upon thy shield   and by the great queens name arise and hence       and balin rose thither no more nor prince   nor knight am i but one that hath defamed   the cognizance she gave me  here i dwell   savage among the savage woods here die   die  let the wolves black maws ensepulchre   their brother beast whose anger was his lord   o me that such a name as guineveres   which our high lancelot hath so lifted up   and been thereby uplifted should through me   my violence and my villainy come to shame       thereat she suddenly laughed and shrill anon   sighed all as suddenly  said balin to her   is this thy courtesyto mock me ha   hence for i will not with thee  again she sighed   pardon sweet lord we maidens often laugh   when sick at heart when rather we should weep   i knew thee wronged  i brake upon thy rest   and now full loth am i to break thy dream   but thou art man and canst abide a truth   though bitter  hither boyand mark me well   dost thou remember at caerleon once   a year agonay then i love thee not   ay thou rememberest wellone summer dawn   by the great towercaerleon upon usk   nay truly we were hidden  this fair lord   the flower of all their vestal knighthood knelt   in amorous homagekneltwhat elseo ay   knelt and drew down from out his nightblack hair   and mumbled that white hand whose ringed caress   had wandered from her own kings golden head   and lost itself in darkness till she cried   i thought the great tower would crash down on both   rise my sweet king and kiss me on the lips   thou art my king  this lad whose lightest word   is mere white truth in simple nakedness   saw them embrace  he reddens cannot speak   so bashful he but all the maiden saints   the deathless mothermaidenhood of heaven   cry out upon her  up then ride with me   talk not of shame thou canst not an thou wouldst   do these more shame than these have done themselves       she lied with ease but horrorstricken he   remembering that dark bower at camelot   breathed in a dismal whisper it is truth       sunnily she smiled and even in this lone wood   sweet lord ye do right well to whisper this   fools prate and perish traitors  woods have tongues   as walls have ears  but thou shalt go with me   and we will speak at first exceeding low   meet is it the good king be not deceived   see now i set thee high on vantage ground   from whence to watch the time and eaglelike   stoop at thy will on lancelot and the queen       she ceased his evil spirit upon him leapt   he ground his teeth together sprang with a yell   tore from the branch and cast on earth the shield   drove his mailed heel athwart the royal crown   stampt all into defacement hurled it from him   among the forest weeds and cursed the tale   the toldof and the teller                               that weird yell   unearthlier than all shriek of bird or beast   thrilled through the woods and balan lurking there   his quest was unaccomplished heard and thought   the scream of that wooddevil i came to quell   then nearing lo he hath slain some brotherknight   and tramples on the goodly shield to show   his loathing of our order and the queen   my quest meseems is here  or devil or man   guard thou thine head  sir balin spake not word   but snatched a sudden buckler from the squire   and vaulted on his horse and so they crashed   in onset and king pellams holy spear   reputed to be red with sinless blood   redded at once with sinful for the point   across the maiden shield of balan pricked   the hauberk to the flesh and balins horse   was wearied to the death and when they clashed   rolling back upon balin crushed the man   inward and either fell and swooned away       then to her squire muttered the damsel fools   this fellow hath wrought some foulness with his queen   else never had he borne her crown nor raved   and thus foamed over at a rival name   but thou sir chick that scarce hast broken shell   art yet halfyolk not even come to down   who never sawest caerleon upon usk   and yet hast often pleaded for my love   see what i see be thou where i have been   or else sir chickdismount and loose their casques   i fain would know what manner of men they be   and when the squire had loosed them goodlylook   they might have cropt the myriad flower of may   and butt each other here like brainless bulls   dead for one heifer                       then the gentle squire   i hold them happy so they died for love   and vivien though ye beat me like your dog   i too could die as now i live for thee       live on sir boy she cried  i better prize   the living dog than the dead lion  away   i cannot brook to gaze upon the dead   then leapt her palfrey oer the fallen oak   and bounding forward leave them to the wolves       but when their foreheads felt the cooling air   balin first woke and seeing that true face   familiar up from cradletime so wan   crawled slowly with low moans to where he lay   and on his dying brother cast himself   dying and he lifted faint eyes he felt   one near him all at once they found the world   staring wildwide then with a childlike wail   and drawing down the dim disastrous brow   that oer him hung he kissed it moaned and spake       o balin balin i that fain had died   to save thy life have brought thee to thy death   why had ye not the shield i knew and why   trampled ye thus on that which bare the crown       then balin told him brokenly and in gasps   all that had chanced and balan moaned again       brother i dwelt a day in pellams hall   this garlon mocked me but i heeded not   and one said eat in peace a liar is he   and hates thee for the tribute this good knight   told me that twice a wanton damsel came   and sought for garlon at the castlegates   whom pellam drove away with holy heat   i well believe this damsel and the one   who stood beside thee even now the same   she dwells among the woods he said and meets   and dallies with him in the mouth of hell   foul are their lives foul are their lips they lied   pure as our own true mother is our queen       o brother answered balin woe is me   my madness all thy life has been thy doom   thy curse and darkened all thy day and now   the night has come  i scarce can see thee now    goodnight for we shall never bid again   goodmorrowdark my doom was here and dark   it will be there  i see thee now no more   i would not mine again should darken thine   goodnight true brother                           balan answered low   goodnight true brother here goodmorrow there   we two were born together and we die   together by one doom and while he spoke   closed his deathdrowsing eyes and slept the sleep   with balin either locked in eithers arm      merlin and vivien    a storm was coming but the winds were still   and in the wild woods of broceliande   before an oak so hollow huge and old   it looked a tower of ivied masonwork   at merlins feet the wily vivien lay       for he that always bare in bitter grudge   the slights of arthur and his table mark   the cornish king had heard a wandering voice   a minstrel of caerlon by strong storm   blown into shelter at tintagil say   that out of naked knightlike purity   sir lancelot worshipt no unmarried girl   but the great queen herself fought in her name   sware by hervows like theirs that high in heaven   love most but neither marry nor are given   in marriage angels of our lords report       he ceased and thenfor vivien sweetly said   she sat beside the banquet nearest mark   and is the fair example followed sir   in arthurs householdanswered innocently       ay by some feway trulyyouths that hold   it more beseems the perfect virgin knight   to worship woman as true wife beyond   all hopes of gaining than as maiden girl   they place their pride in lancelot and the queen   so passionate for an utter purity   beyond the limit of their bond are these   for arthur bound them not to singleness   brave hearts and clean and yetgod guide themyoung       then mark was half in heart to hurl his cup   straight at the speaker but forbore  he rose   to leave the hall and vivien following him   turned to her  here are snakes within the grass   and you methinks o vivien save ye fear   the monkish manhood and the mask of pure   worn by this court can stir them till they sting       and vivien answered smiling scornfully   why fear because that fostered at thy court   i savour of thyvirtues fear them no   as love if love is perfect casts out fear   so hate if hate is perfect casts out fear   my father died in battle against the king   my mother on his corpse in open field   she bore me there for born from death was i   among the dead and sown upon the wind   and then on thee and shown the truth betimes   that old true filth and bottom of the well   where truth is hidden  gracious lessons thine   and maxims of the mud  this arthur pure   great nature through the flesh herself hath made   gives him the lie  there is no being pure   my cherub saith not holy writ the same   if i were arthur i would have thy blood   thy blessing stainless king  i bring thee back   when i have ferreted out their burrowings   the hearts of all this order in mine hand   ayso that fate and craft and folly close   perchance one curl of arthurs golden beard   to me this narrow grizzled fork of thine   is cleanerfashionedwell i loved thee first   that warps the wit                        loud laughed the graceless mark   but vivien into camelot stealing lodged   low in the city and on a festal day   when guinevere was crossing the great hall   cast herself down knelt to the queen and wailed       why kneel ye there  what evil hath ye wrought   rise and the damsel bidden rise arose   and stood with folded hands and downward eyes   of glancing corner and all meekly said   none wrought but suffered much an orphan maid   my father died in battle for thy king   my mother on his corpsein open

stood   all glittering like may sunshine on may leaves   in green and gold and plumed with green replied   peace child of overpraise and overblame   we choose the last  our noble arthur him   ye scarce can overpraise will hear and know   naywe believe all evil of thy mark   well we shall test thee farther but this hour   we ride ahawking with sir lancelot   he hath given us a fair falcon which he trained   we go to prove it  bide ye here the while       she past and vivien murmured after go   i bide the while  then through the portalarch   peering askance and muttering brokenwise   as one that labours with an evil dream   beheld the queen and lancelot get to horse       is that the lancelot goodlyay but gaunt   courteousamends for gauntnesstakes her hand   that glance of theirs but for the street had been   a clinging kisshow hand lingers in hand   let go at lastthey ride awayto hawk   for waterfowl  royaller game is mine   for such a supersensual sensual bond   as that gray

while they dance   or dreamof thee they dreamed notnor of me   theseay but each of either  ride and dream   the mortal dream that never yet was mine   ride ride and dream until ye waketo me   then narrow court and lubber king farewell   for lancelot will be gracious to the rat   and our wise queen if knowing that i know   will hate loathe fearbut honour me the more       yet while they rode together down the plain   their talk was all of training terms of art   diet and seeling jesses leash and lure   she is too noble he said to check at pies   nor will she rake  there is no baseness in her   here when the queen demanded as by chance   know ye the stranger woman  let her be   said lancelot and unhooded casting off   the goodly falcon free she towered her bells   tone under tone shrilled and they lifted up   their eager faces wondering at the strength   boldness and royal knighthood of the bird   who pounced her quarry and slew it  many a time   as onceof oldamong the flowersthey rode       but vivien halfforgotten of the queen   among her damsels broidering sat heard watched   and whispered  through the peaceful court she crept   and whispered  then as arthur in the highest   leavened the world so vivien in the lowest   arriving at a time of golden rest   and sowing one ill hint from ear to ear   while all the heathen lay at arthurs feet   and no quest came but all was joust and play   leavened his hall  they heard and let her be       thereafter as an enemy that has left   death in the living waters and withdrawn   the wily vivien stole from arthurs court       she hated all the knights and heard in thought   their lavish comment when her name was named   for once when arthur walking all alone   vext at a rumour issued from herself   of some corruption crept among his knights   had met her vivien being greeted fair   would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood   with reverent eyes mockloyal shaken voice   and fluttered adoration and at last   with dark sweet hints of some who prized him more   than who should prize him most at which the king   had gazed upon her blankly and gone by   but one had watched and had not held his peace   it made the laughter of an afternoon   that vivien should attempt the blameless king   and after that she set herself to gain   him the most famous man of all those times   merlin who knew the range of all their arts   had built the king his havens ships and halls   was also bard and knew the starry heavens   the people called him wizard whom at first   she played about with slight and sprightly talk   and vivid smiles and faintlyvenomed points   of slander glancing here and grazing there   and yielding to his kindlier moods the seer   would watch her at her petulance and play   even when they seemed unloveable and laugh   as those that watch a kitten thus he grew   tolerant of what he half disdained and she   perceiving that she was but half disdained   began to break her sports with graver fits   turn red or pale would often when they met   sigh fully or allsilent gaze upon him   with such a fixt devotion that the old man   though doubtful felt the flattery and at times   would flatter his own wish in age for love   and half believe her true  for thus at times   he wavered but that other clung to him   fixt in her will and so the seasons went       then fell on merlin a great melancholy   he walked with dreams and darkness and he found   a doom that ever poised itself to fall   an evermoaning battle in the mist   worldwar of dying flesh against the life   death in all life and lying in all love   the meanest having power upon the highest   and the high purpose broken by the worm       so leaving arthurs court he gained the beach   there found a little boat and stept into it   and vivien followed but he marked her not   she took the helm and he the sail the boat   drave with a sudden wind across the deeps   and touching breton sands they disembarked   and then she followed merlin all the way   even to the wild woods of broceliande   for merlin once had told her of a charm   the which if any wrought on anyone   with woven paces and with waving arms   the man so wrought on ever seemed to lie   closed in the four walls of a hollow tower   from which was no escape for evermore   and none could find that man for evermore   nor could he see but him who wrought the charm   coming and going and he lay as dead   and lost to life and use and name and fame   and vivien ever sought to work the charm   upon the great enchanter of the time   as fancying that her glory would be great   according to his greatness whom she quenched       there lay she all her length and kissed his feet   as if in deepest reverence and in love   a twist of gold was round her hair a robe   of samite without price that more exprest   than hid her clung about her lissome limbs   in colour like the satinshining palm   on sallows in the windy gleams of march   and while she kissed them crying trample me   dear feet that i have followed through the world   and i will pay you worship tread me down   and i will kiss you for it he was mute   so dark a forethought rolled about his brain   as on a dull day in an ocean cave   the blind wave feeling round his long seahall   in silence  wherefore when she lifted up   a face of sad appeal and spake and said   o merlin do ye love me and again   o merlin do ye love me and once more   great master do ye love me he was mute   and lissome vivien holding by his heel   writhed toward him slided up his knee and sat   behind his ankle twined her hollow feet   together curved an arm about his neck   clung like a snake and letting her left hand   droop from his mighty shoulder as a leaf   made with her right a comb of pearl to part   the lists of such a board as youth gone out   had left in ashes  then he spoke and said   not looking at her who are wise in love   love most say least and vivien answered quick   i saw the little elfgod eyeless once   in arthurs arras hall at camelot   but neither eyes nor tongueo stupid child   yet you are wise who say it let me think   silence is wisdom  i am silent then   and ask no kiss then adding all at once   and lo i clothe myself with wisdom drew   the vast and shaggy mantle of his beard   across her neck and bosom to her knee   and called herself a gilded summer fly   caught in a great old tyrant spiders web   who meant to eat her up in that wild wood   without one word  so vivien called herself   but rather seemed a lovely baleful star   veiled in gray vapour till he sadly smiled   to what request for what strange boon he said   are these your pretty tricks and fooleries   o vivien the preamble yet my thanks   for these have broken up my melancholy       and vivien answered smiling saucily   what o my master have ye found your voice   i bid the stranger welcome  thanks at last   but yesterday you never opened lip   except indeed to drink  no cup had we   in mine own lady palms i culled the spring   that gathered trickling dropwise from the cleft   and made a pretty cup of both my hands   and offered you it kneeling  then you drank   and knew no more nor gave me one poor word   o no more thanks than might a goat have given   with no more sign of reverence than a beard   and when we halted at that other well   and i was faint to swooning and you lay   footgilt with all the blossomdust of those   deep meadows we had traversed did you know   that vivien bathed your feet before her own   and yet no thanks  and all through this wild wood   and all this morning when i fondled you   boon ay there was a boon one not so strange   how had i wronged you surely ye are wise   but such a silence is more wise than kind       and merlin locked his hand in hers and said   o did ye never lie upon the shore   and watch the curled white of the coming wave   glassed in the slippery sand before it breaks   even such a wave but not so pleasurable   dark in the glass of some presageful mood   had i for three days seen ready to fall   and then i rose and fled from arthurs court   to break the mood  you followed me unasked   and when i looked and saw you following me still   my mind involved yourself the nearest thing   in that mindmist  for shall i tell you truth   you seemed that wave about to break upon me   and sweep me from my hold upon the world   my use and name and fame  your pardon child   your pretty sports have brightened all again   and ask your boon for boon i owe you thrice   once for wrong done you by confusion next   for thanks it seems till now neglected last   for these your dainty gambols  wherefore ask   and take this boon so strange and not so strange       and vivien answered smiling mournfully   o not so strange as my long asking it   not yet so strange as you yourself are strange   nor half so strange as that dark mood of yours   i ever feared ye were not wholly mine   and see yourself have owned ye did me wrong   the people call you prophet  let it be   but not of those that can expound themselves   take vivien for expounder she will call   that threedayslong presageful gloom of yours   no presage but the same mistrustful mood   that makes you seem less noble than yourself   whenever i have asked this very boon   now asked again  for see you not dear love   that such a mood as that which lately gloomed   your fancy when ye saw me following you   must make me fear still more you are not mine   must make me yearn still more to prove you mine   and make me wish still more to learn this charm   of woven paces and of waving hands   as proof of trust  o merlin teach it me   the charm so taught will charm us both to rest   for grant me some slight power upon your fate   i feeling that you felt me worthy trust   should rest and let you rest knowing you mine   and therefore be as great as ye are named   not muffled round with selfish reticence   how hard you look and how denyingly   o if you think this wickedness in me   that i should prove it on you unawares   that makes me passing wrathful then our bond   had best be loosed for ever  but think or not   by heaven that hears i tell you the clean truth   as clean as blood of babes as white as milk   o merlin may this earth if ever i   if these unwitty wandering wits of mine   even in the jumbled rubbish of a dream   have tript on such conjectural treachery   may this hard earth cleave to the nadir hell   down down and close again and nip me flat   if i be such a traitress  yield my boon   till which i scarce can yield you all i am   and grant my rereiterated wish   the great proof of your love  because i think   however wise ye hardly know me yet       and merlin loosed his hand from hers and said   i never was less wise however wise   too curious vivien though you talk of trust   than when i told you first of such a charm   yea if ye talk of trust i tell you this   too much i trusted when i told you that   and stirred this vice in you which ruined man   through woman the first hour for howsoeer   in children a great curiousness be well   who have to learn themselves and all the world   in you that are no child for still i find   your face is practised when i spell the lines   i call itwell i will not call it vice   but since you name yourself the summer fly   i well could wish a cobweb for the gnat   that settles beaten back and beaten back   settles till one could yield for weariness   but since i will not yield to give you power   upon my life and use and name and fame   why will ye never ask some other boon   yea by gods rood i trusted you too much       and vivien like the tenderesthearted maid   that ever bided tryst at village stile   made answer either eyelid wet with tears   nay master be not wrathful with your maid   caress her  let her feel herself forgiven   who feels no heart to ask another boon   i think ye hardly know the tender rhyme   of trust me not at all or all in all   i heard the great sir lancelot sing it once   and it shall answer for me  listen to it       in love if love be love if love be ours   faith and unfaith can neer be equal powers   unfaith in aught is want of faith in all       it is the little rift within the lute   that by and by will make the music mute   and ever widening slowly silence all       the little rift within the lovers lute   or little pitted speck in garnered fruit   that rotting inward slowly moulders all       it is not worth the keeping  let it go   but shall it answer darling answer no   and trust me not at all or all in all    o master do ye love my tender rhyme       and merlin looked and half believed her true   so tender was her voice so fair her face   so sweetly gleamed her eyes behind her tears   like sunlight on the plain behind a shower   and yet he answered half indignantly       far other was the song that once i heard   by this huge oak sung nearly where we sit   for here we met some ten or twelve of us   to chase a creature that was current then   in these wild woods the hart with golden horns   it was the time when first the question rose   about the founding of a table round   that was to be for love of god and men   and noble deeds the flower of all the world   and each incited each to noble deeds   and while we waited one the youngest of us   we could not keep him silent out he flashed   and into such a song such fire for fame   such trumpetglowings in it coming down   to such a stern and ironclashing close   that when he stopt we longed to hurl together   and should have done it but the beauteous beast   scared by the noise upstarted at our feet   and like a silver shadow slipt away   through the dim land and all day long we rode   through the dim land against a rushing wind   that glorious roundel echoing in our ears   and chased the flashes of his golden horns   till they vanished by the fairy well   that laughs at ironas our warriors did   where children cast their pins and nails and cry   laugh little well but touch it with a sword   it buzzes fiercely round the point and there   we lost him  such a noble song was that   but vivien when you sang me that sweet rhyme   i felt as though you knew this cursed charm   were proving it on me and that i lay   and felt them slowly ebbing name and fame       and vivien answered smiling mournfully   o mine have ebbed away for evermore   and all through following you to this wild wood   because i saw you sad to comfort you   lo now what hearts have men they never mount   as high as woman in her selfless mood   and touching fame howeer ye scorn my song   take one verse morethe lady speaks itthis       my name once mine now thine is closelier mine   for fame could fame be mine that fame were thine   and shame could shame be thine that shame were mine   so trust me not at all or all in all       says she not well and there is morethis rhyme   is like the fair pearlnecklace of the queen   that burst in dancing and the pearls were spilt   some lost some stolen some as relics kept   but nevermore the same two sister pearls   ran down the silken thread to kiss each other   on her white neckso is it with this rhyme   it lives dispersedly in many hands   and every minstrel sings it differently   yet is there one true line the pearl of pearls   man dreams of fame while woman wakes to love   yea  love though love were of the grossest carves   a portion from the solid present eats   and uses careless of the rest but fame   the fame that follows death is nothing to us   and what is fame in life but halfdisfame   and counterchanged with darkness ye yourself   know well that envy calls you devils son   and since ye seem the master of all art   they fain would make you master of all vice       and merlin locked his hand in hers and said   i once was looking for a magic weed   and found a fair young squire who sat alone   had carved himself a knightly shield of wood   and then was painting on it fancied arms   azure an eagle rising or the sun   in dexter chief the scroll i follow fame   and speaking not but leaning over him   i took his brush and blotted out the bird   and made a gardener putting in a graff   with this for motto rather use than fame   you should have seen him blush but afterwards   he made a stalwart knight  o vivien   for you methinks you think you love me well   for me i love you somewhat rest  and love   should have some rest and pleasure in himself   not ever be too curious for a boon   too prurient for a proof against the grain   of him ye say ye love  but fame with men   being but ampler means to serve mankind   should have small rest or pleasure in herself   but work as vassal to the larger love   that dwarfs the petty love of one to one   use gave me fame at first and fame again   increasing gave me use  lo there my boon   what other for men sought to prove me vile   because i fain had given them greater wits   and then did envy call me devils son   the sick weak beast seeking to help herself   by striking at her better missed and brought   her own claw back and wounded her own heart   sweet were the days when i was all unknown   but when my name was lifted up the storm   brake on the mountain and i cared not for it   right well know i that fame is halfdisfame   yet needs must work my work  that other fame   to one at least who hath not children vague   the cackle of the unborn about the grave   i cared not for it  a single misty star   which is the second in a line of stars   that seem a sword beneath a belt of three   i never gazed upon it but i dreamt   of some vast charm concluded in that star   to make fame nothing  wherefore if i fear   giving you power upon me through this charm   that you might play me falsely having power   however well ye think ye love me now   as sons of kings loving in pupilage   have turned to tyrants when they came to power   i rather dread the loss of use than fame   if youand not so much from wickedness   as some wild turn of anger or a mood   of overstrained affection it may be   to keep me all to your own selfor else   a sudden spurt of womans jealousy   should try this charm on whom ye say ye love       and vivien answered smiling as in wrath   have i not sworn  i am not trusted  good   well hide it hide it i shall find it out   and being found take heed of vivien   a woman and not trusted doubtless i   might feel some sudden turn of anger born   of your misfaith and your fine epithet   is accurate too for this full love of mine   without the full heart back may merit well   your term of overstrained  so used as i   my daily wonder is i love at all   and as to womans jealousy o why not   o to what end except a jealous one   and one to make me jealous if i love   was this fair charm invented by yourself   i well believe that all about this world   ye cage a buxom captive here and there   closed in the four walls of a hollow tower   from which is no escape for evermore       then the great master merrily answered her   full many a love in loving youth was mine   i needed then no charm to keep them mine   but youth and love and that full heart of yours   whereof ye prattle may now assure you mine   so live uncharmed  for those who wrought it first   the wrist is parted from the hand that waved   the feet unmortised from their anklebones   who paced it ages back  but will ye hear   the legend as in guerdon for your rhyme       there lived a king in the most eastern east   less old than i yet older for my blood   hath earnest in it of far springs to be   a tawny pirate anchored in his port   whose bark had plundered twenty nameless isles   and passing one at the high peep of dawn   he saw two cities in a thousand boats   all fighting for a woman on the sea   and pushing his black craft among them all   he lightly scattered theirs and brought her off   with loss of half his people arrowslain   a maid so smooth so white so wonderful   they said a light came from her when she moved   and since the pirate would not yield her up   the king impaled him for his piracy   then made her queen  but those islenurtured eyes   waged such unwilling though successful war   on all the youth they sickened councils thinned   and armies waned for magnetlike she drew   the rustiest iron of old fighters hearts   and beasts themselves would worship camels knelt   unbidden and the brutes of mountain back   that carry kings in castles bowed black knees   of homage ringing with their serpent hands   to make her smile her golden anklebells   what wonder being jealous that he sent   his horns of proclamation out through all   the hundred underkingdoms that he swayed   to find a wizard who might teach the king   some charm which being wrought upon the queen   might keep her all his own  to such a one   he promised more than ever king has given   a league of mountain full of golden mines   a province with a hundred miles of coast   a palace and a princess all for him   but on all those who tried and failed the king   pronounced a dismal sentence meaning by it   to keep the list low and pretenders back   or like a king not to be trifled with   their heads should moulder on the city gates   and many tried and failed because the charm   of nature in her overbore their own   and many a wizard brow bleached on the walls   and many weeks a troop of carrion crows   hung like a cloud above the gateway towers       and vivien breaking in upon him said   i sit and gather honey yet methinks   thy tongue has tript a little  ask thyself   the lady never made unwilling war   with those fine eyes  she had her pleasure in it   and made her good man jealous with good cause   and lived there neither dame nor damsel then   wroth at a lovers loss were all as tame   i mean as noble as the queen was fair   not one to flirt a venom at her eyes   or pinch a murderous dust into her drink   or make her paler with a poisoned rose   well those were not our days  but did they find   a wizard  tell me was he like to thee       she ceased and made her lithe arm round his neck   tighten and then drew back and let her eyes   speak for her glowing on him like a brides   on her new lord her own the first of men       he answered laughing nay not like to me   at last they foundhis foragers for charms   a little glassyheaded hairless man   who lived alone in a great wild on grass   read but one book and ever reading grew   so grated down and filed away with thought   so lean his eyes were monstrous while the skin   clung but to crate and basket ribs and spine   and since he kept his mind on one sole aim   nor ever touched fierce wine nor tasted flesh   nor owned a sensual wish to him the wall   that sunders ghosts and shadowcasting men   became a crystal and he saw them through it   and heard their voices talk behind the wall   and learnt their elemental secrets powers   and forces often oer the suns bright eye   drew the vast eyelid of an inky cloud   and lashed it at the base with slanting storm   or in the noon of mist and driving rain   when the lake whitened and the pinewood roared   and the cairned mountain was a shadow sunned   the world to peace again  here was the man   and so by force they dragged him to the king   and then he taught the king to charm the queen   in suchwise that no man could see her more   nor saw she save the king who wrought the charm   coming and going and she lay as dead   and lost all use of life  but when the king   made proffer of the league of golden mines   the province with a hundred miles of coast   the palace and the princess that old man   went back to his old wild and lived on grass   and vanished and his book came down to me       and vivien answered smiling saucily   ye have the book  the charm is written in it   good  take my counsel  let me know it at once   for keep it like a puzzle chest in chest   with each chest locked and padlocked thirtyfold   and whelm all this beneath as vast a mound   as after furious battle turfs the slain   on some wild down above the windy deep   i yet should strike upon a sudden means   to dig pick open find and read the charm   then if i tried it who should blame me then       and smiling as a master smiles at one   that is not of his school nor any school   but that where blind and naked ignorance   delivers brawling judgments unashamed   on all things all day long he answered her       thou read the book my pretty vivien   o ay it is but twenty pages long   but every page having an ample marge   and every marge enclosing in the midst   a square of text that looks a little blot   the text no larger than the limbs of fleas   and every square of text an awful charm   writ in a language that has long gone by   so long that mountains have arisen since   with cities on their flanksthou read the book   and ever margin scribbled crost and crammed   with comment densest condensation hard   to mind and eye but the long sleepless nights   of my long life have made it easy to me   and none can read the text not even i   and none can read the comment but myself   and in the comment did i find the charm   o the results are simple a mere child   might use it to the harm of anyone   and never could undo it  ask no more   for though you should not prove it upon me   but keep that oath ye sware ye might perchance   assay it on some one of the table round   and all because ye dream they babble of you       and vivien frowning in true anger said   what dare the fullfed liars say of me   they ride abroad redressing human wrongs   they sit with knife in meat and wine in horn   they bound to holy vows of chastity   were i not woman i could tell a tale   but you are man you well can understand   the shame that cannot be explained for shame   not one of all the drove should touch me  swine       then answered merlin careless of her words   you breathe but accusation vast and vague   spleenborn i think and proofless  if ye know   set up the charge ye know to stand or fall       and vivien answered frowning wrathfully   o ay what say ye to sir valence him   whose kinsman left him watcher oer his wife   and two fair babes and went to distant lands   was one year gone and on returning found   not two but three there lay the reckling one   but one hour old  what said the happy sire   a sevenmonths babe had been a truer gift   those twelve sweet moons confused his fatherhood       then answered merlin nay i know the tale   sir valence wedded with an outland dame   some cause had kept him sundered from his wife   one child they had  it lived with her  she died   his kinsman travelling on his own affair   was charged by valence to bring home the child   he brought not found it therefore  take the truth       o ay said vivien overtrue a tale   what say ye then to sweet sir sagramore   that ardent man to pluck the flower in season   so says the song i trow it is no treason   o master shall we call him overquick   to crop his own sweet rose before the hour       and merlin answered overquick art thou   to catch a loathly plume fallen from the wing   of that foul bird of rapine whose whole prey   is mans good name  he never wronged his bride   i know the tale  an angry gust of wind   puffed out his torch among the myriadroomed   and manycorridored complexities   of arthurs palace  then he found a door   and darkling felt the sculptured ornament   that wreathen round it made it seem his own   and wearied out made for the couch and slept   a stainless man beside a stainless maid   and either slept nor knew of other there   till the high dawn piercing the royal rose   in arthurs casement glimmered chastely down   blushing upon them blushing and at once   he rose without a word and parted from her   but when the thing was blazed about the court   the brute world howling forced them into bonds   and as it chanced they are happy being pure       o ay said vivien that were likely too   what say ye then to fair sir percivale   and of the horrid foulness that he wrought   the saintly youth the spotless lamb of christ   or some black wether of st satans fold   what in the precincts of the chapelyard   among the knightly brasses of the graves   and by the cold hic jacets of the dead       and merlin answered careless of her charge   a sober man is percivale and pure   but once in life was flustered with new wine   then paced for coolness in the chapelyard   where one of satans shepherdesses caught   and meant to stamp him with her masters mark   and that he sinned is not believable   for look upon his facebut if he sinned   the sin that practice burns into the blood   and not the one dark hour which brings remorse   will brand us after of whose fold we be   or else were he the holy king whose hymns   are chanted in the minster worse than all   but is your spleen frothed out or have ye more       and vivien answered frowning yet in wrath   o ay what say ye to sir lancelot friend   traitor or true that commerce with the queen   i ask you is it clamoured by the child   or whispered in the corner do ye know it       to which he answered sadly yea i know it   sir lancelot went ambassador at first   to fetch her and she watched him from her walls   a rumour runs she took him for the king   so fixt her fancy on him  let them be   but have ye no one word of loyal praise   for arthur blameless king and stainless man       she answered with a low and chuckling laugh   man is he man at all who knows and winks   sees what his fair bride is and does and winks   by which the good king means to blind himself   and blinds himself and all the table round   to all the foulness that they work  myself   could call him were it not for womanhood   the pretty popular cause such manhood earns   could call him the main cause of all their crime   yea were he not crowned king coward and fool       then merlin to his own heart loathing said   o true and tender  o my liege and king   o selfless man and stainless gentleman   who wouldst against thine own eyewitness fain   have all men true and leal all women pure   how in the mouths of base interpreters   from overfineness not intelligible   to things with every sense as false and foul   as the poached filth that floods the middle street   is thy white blamelessness accounted blame       but vivien deeming merlin overborne   by instance recommenced and let her tongue   rage like a fire among the noblest names   polluting and imputing her whole self   defaming and defacing till she left   not even lancelot brave nor galahad clean       her words had issue other than she willed   he dragged his eyebrow bushes down and made   a snowy penthouse for his hollow eyes   and muttered in himself tell her the charm   so if she had it would she rail on me   to snare the next and if she have it not   so will she rail  what did the wanton say   not mount as high we scarce can sink as low   for men at most differ as heaven and earth   but women worst and best as heaven and hell   i know the table round my friends of old   all brave and many generous and some chaste   she cloaks the scar of some repulse with lies   i well believe she tempted them and failed   being so bitter  for fine plots may fail   though harlots paint their talk as well as face   with colours of the heart that are not theirs   i will not let her know  nine tithes of times   faceflatterer and backbiter are the same   and they sweet soul that most impute a crime   are pronest to it and impute themselves   wanting the mental range or low desire   not to feel lowest makes them level all   yea they would pare the mountain to the plain   to leave an equal baseness and in this   are harlots like the crowd that if they find   some stain or blemish in a name of note   not grieving that their greatest are so small   inflate themselves with some insane delight   and judge all nature from her feet of clay   without the will to lift their eyes and see   her godlike head crowned with spiritual fire   and touching other worlds  i am weary of her       he spoke in words part heard in whispers part   halfsuffocated in the hoary fell   and manywintered fleece of throat and chin   but vivien gathering somewhat of his mood   and hearing harlot muttered twice or thrice   leapt from her session on his lap and stood   stiff as a viper frozen loathsome sight   how from the rosy lips of life and love   flashed the baregrinning skeleton of death   white was her cheek sharp breaths of anger puffed   her fairy nostril out her hand halfclenched   went faltering sideways downward to her belt   and feeling had she found a dagger there   for in a wink the false love turns to hate   she would have stabbed him but she found it not   his eye was calm and suddenly she took   to bitter weeping like a beaten child   a long long weeping not consolable   then her false voice made way broken with sobs       o crueller than was ever told in tale   or sung in song  o vainly lavished love   o cruel there was nothing wild or strange   or seeming shamefulfor what shame in love   so love be true and not as yours isnothing   poor vivien had not done to win his trust   who called her what he called herall her crime   allallthe wish to prove him wholly hers       she mused a little and then clapt her hands   together with a wailing shriek and said   stabbed through the hearts affections to the heart   seethed like the kid in its own mothers milk   killed with a word worse than a life of blows   i thought that he was gentle being great   o god that i had loved a smaller man   i should have found in him a greater heart   o i that flattering my true passion saw   the knights the court the king dark in your light   who loved to make men darker than they are   because of that high pleasure which i had   to seat you sole upon my pedestal   of worshipi am answered and henceforth   the course of life that seemed so flowery to me   with you for guide and master only you   becomes the seacliff pathway broken short   and ending in a ruinnothing left   but into some low cave to crawl and there   if the wolf spare me weep my life away   killed with inutterable unkindliness       she paused she turned away she hung her head   the snake of gold slid from her hair the braid   slipt and uncoiled itself she wept afresh   and the dark wood grew darker toward the storm   in silence while his anger slowly died   within him till he let his wisdom go   for ease of heart and half believed her true   called her to shelter in the hollow oak   come from the storm and having no reply   gazed at the heaving shoulder and the face   handhidden as for utmost grief or shame   then thrice essayed by tenderesttouching terms   to sleek her ruffled peace of mind in vain   at last she let herself be conquered by him   and as the cageling newly flown returns   the seeminginjured simplehearted thing   came to her old perch back and settled there   there while she sat halffalling from his knees   halfnestled at his heart and since he saw   the slow tear creep from her closed eyelid yet   about her more in kindness than in love   the gentle wizard cast a shielding arm   but she dislinked herself at once and rose   her arms upon her breast across and stood   a virtuous gentlewoman deeply wronged   upright and flushed before him  then she said       there must now be no passages of love   betwixt us twain henceforward evermore   since if i be what i am grossly called   what should be granted which your own gross heart   would reckon worth the taking  i will go   in truth but one thing nowbetter have died   thrice than have asked it oncecould make me stay   that proof of trustso often asked in vain   how justly after that vile term of yours   i find with grief  i might believe you then   who knows once more  lo what was once to me   mere matter of the fancy now hath grown   the vast necessity of heart and life   farewell think gently of me for i fear   my fate or folly passing gayer youth   for one so old must be to love thee still   but ere i leave thee let me swear once more   that if i schemed against thy peace in this   may yon just heaven that darkens oer me send   one flash that missing all things else may make   my scheming brain a cinder if i lie       scarce had she ceased when out of heaven a bolt   for now the storm was close above them struck   furrowing a giant oak and javelining   with darted spikes and splinters of the wood   the dark earth round  he raised his eyes and saw   the tree that shone whitelisted through the gloom   but vivien fearing heaven had heard her oath   and dazzled by the lividflickering fork   and deafened with the stammering cracks and claps   that followed flying back and crying out   o merlin though you do not love me save   yet save me clung to him and hugged him close   and called him dear protector in her fright   nor yet forgot her practice in her fright   but wrought upon his mood and hugged him close   the pale blood of the wizard at her touch   took gayer colours like an opal warmed   she blamed herself for telling hearsay tales   she shook from fear and for her fault she wept   of petulancy she called him lord and liege   her seer her bard her silver star of eve   her god her merlin the one passionate love   of her whole life and ever overhead   bellowed the tempest and the rotten branch   snapt in the rushing of the riverrain   above them and in change of glare and gloom   her eyes and neck glittering went and came   till now the storm its burst of passion spent   moaning and calling out of other lands   had left the ravaged woodland yet once more   to peace and what should not have been had been   for merlin overtalked and overworn   had yielded told her all the charm and slept       then in one moment she put forth the charm   of woven paces and of waving hands   and in the hollow oak he lay as dead   and lost to life and use and name and fame       then crying i have made his glory mine   and shrieking out o fool the harlot leapt   adown the forest and the thicket closed   behind her and the forest echoed fool      lancelot and elaine    elaine the fair elaine the loveable   elaine the lily maid of astolat   high in her chamber up a tower to the east   guarded the sacred shield of lancelot   which first she placed where the mornings earliest ray   might strike it and awake her with the gleam   then fearing rust or soilure fashioned for it   a case of silk and braided thereupon   all the devices blazoned on the shield   in their own tinct and added of her wit   a border fantasy of branch and flower   and yellowthroated nestling in the nest   nor rested thus content but day by day   leaving her household and good father climbed   that eastern tower and entering barred her door   stript off the case and read the naked shield   now guessed a hidden meaning in his arms   now made a pretty history to herself   of every dint a sword had beaten in it   and every scratch a lance had made upon it   conjecturing when and where  this cut is fresh   that ten years back this dealt him at caerlyle   that at caerleon this at camelot   and ah gods mercy what a stroke was there   and here a thrust that might have killed but god   broke the strong lance and rolled his enemy down   and saved him  so she lived in fantasy       how came the lily maid by that good shield   of lancelot she that knew not even his name   he left it with her when he rode to tilt   for the great diamond in the diamond jousts   which arthur had ordained and by that name   had named them since a diamond was the prize       for arthur long before they crowned him king   roving the trackless realms of lyonnesse   had found a glen gray boulder and black tarn   a horror lived about the tarn and clave   like its own mists to all the mountain side   for here two brothers one a king had met   and fought together but their names were lost   and each had slain his brother at a blow   and down they fell and made the glen abhorred   and there they lay till all their bones were bleached   and lichened into colour with the crags   and he that once was king had on a crown   of diamonds one in front and four aside   and arthur came and labouring up the pass   all in a misty moonshine unawares   had trodden that crowned skeleton and the skull   brake from the nape and from the skull the crown   rolled into light and turning on its rims   fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn   and down the shingly scaur he plunged and caught   and set it on his head and in his heart   heard murmurs lo thou likewise shalt be king       thereafter when a king he had the gems   plucked from the crown and showed them to his knights   saying these jewels whereupon i chanced   divinely are the kingdoms not the kings   for public use  henceforward let there be   once every year a joust for one of these   for so by nine years proof we needs must learn   which is our mightiest and ourselves shall grow   in use of arms and manhood till we drive   the heathen who some say shall rule the land   hereafter which god hinder  thus he spoke   and eight years past eight jousts had been and still   had lancelot won the diamond of the year   with purpose to present them to the queen   when all were won but meaning all at once   to snare her royal fancy with a boon   worth half her realm had never spoken word       now for the central diamond and the last   and largest arthur holding then his court   hard on the river nigh the place which now   is this worlds hugest let proclaim a joust   at camelot and when the time drew nigh   spake for she had been sick to guinevere   are you so sick my queen you cannot move   to these fair jousts  yea lord she said ye know it   then will ye miss he answered the great deeds   of lancelot and his prowess in the lists   a sight ye love to look on  and the queen   lifted her eyes and they dwelt languidly   on lancelot where he stood beside the king   he thinking that he read her meaning there   stay with me i am sick my love is more   than many diamonds yielded and a heart   loveloyal to the least wish of the queen   however much he yearned to make complete   the tale of diamonds for his destined boon   urged him to speak against the truth and say   sir king mine ancient wound is hardly whole   and lets me from the saddle and the king   glanced first at him then her and went his way   no sooner gone than suddenly she began       to blame my lord sir lancelot much to blame   why go ye not to these fair jousts the knights   are half of them our enemies and the crowd   will murmur lo the shameless ones who take   their pastime now the trustful king is gone   then lancelot vext at having lied in vain   are ye so wise ye were not once so wise   my queen that summer when ye loved me first   then of the crowd ye took no more account   than of the myriad cricket of the mead   when its own voice clings to each blade of grass   and every voice is nothing  as to knights   them surely can i silence with all ease   but now my loyal worship is allowed   of all men  many a bard without offence   has linked our names together in his lay   lancelot the flower of bravery guinevere   the pearl of beauty  and our knights at feast   have pledged us in this union while the king   would listen smiling  how then is there more   has arthur spoken aught or would yourself   now weary of my service and devoir   henceforth be truer to your faultless lord       she broke into a little scornful laugh   arthur my lord arthur the faultless king   that passionate perfection my good lord   but who can gaze upon the sun in heaven   he never spake word of reproach to me   he never had a glimpse of mine untruth   he cares not for me  only here today   there gleamed a vague suspicion in his eyes   some meddling rogue has tampered with himelse   rapt in this fancy of his table round   and swearing men to vows impossible   to make them like himself  but friend to me   he is all fault who hath no fault at all   for who loves me must have a touch of earth   the low sun makes the colour  i am yours   not arthurs as ye know save by the bond   and therefore hear my words  go to the jousts   the tinytrumpeting gnat can break our dream   when sweetest and the vermin voices here   may buzz so loudwe scorn them but they sting       then answered lancelot the chief of knights   and with what face after my pretext made   shall i appear o queen at camelot i   before a king who honours his own word   as if it were his gods                             yea said the queen   a moral child without the craft to rule   else had he not lost me  but listen to me   if i must find you wit  we hear it said   that men go down before your spear at a touch   but knowing you are lancelot your great name   this conquers  hide it therefore go unknown   win by this kiss you will  and our true king   will then allow your pretext o my knight   as all for glory for to speak him true   ye know right well how meek soeer he seem   no keener hunter after glory breathes   he loves it in his knights more than himself   they prove to him his work  win and return       then got sir lancelot suddenly to horse   wroth at himself  not willing to be known   he left the barrenbeaten thoroughfare   chose the green path that showed the rarer foot   and there among the solitary downs   full often lost in fancy lost his way   till as he traced a faintlyshadowed track   that all in loops and links among the dales   ran to the castle of astolat he saw   fired from the west far on a hill the towers   thither he made and blew the gateway horn   then came an old dumb myriadwrinkled man   who let him into lodging and disarmed   and lancelot marvelled at the wordless man   and issuing found the lord of astolat   with two strong sons sir torre and sir lavaine   moving to meet him in the castle court   and close behind them stept the lily maid   elaine his daughter  mother of the house   there was not  some light jest among them rose   with laughter dying down as the great knight   approached them  then the lord of astolat   whence comes thou my guest and by what name   livest thou between the lips for by thy state   and presence i might guess thee chief of those   after the king who eat in arthurs halls   him have i seen  the rest his table round   known as they are to me they are unknown       then answered sir lancelot the chief of knights   known am i and of arthurs hall and known   what i by mere mischance have brought my shield   but since i go to joust as one unknown   at camelot for the diamond ask me not   hereafter ye shall know meand the shield   i pray you lend me one if such you have   blank or at least with some device not mine       then said the lord of astolat here is torres   hurt in his first tilt was my son sir torre   and so god wot his shield is blank enough   his ye can have  then added plain sir torre   yea since i cannot use it ye may have it   here laughed the father saying fie sir churl   is that answer for a noble knight   allow him but lavaine my younger here   he is so full of lustihood he will ride   joust for it and win and bring it in an hour   and set it in this damsels golden hair   to make her thrice as wilful as before       nay father nay good father shame me not   before this noble knight said young lavaine   for nothing  surely i but played on torre   he seemed so sullen vext he could not go   a jest no more for knight the maiden dreamt   that some one put this diamond in her hand   and that it was too slippery to be held   and slipt and fell into some pool or stream   the castlewell belike and then i said   that if i went and if i fought and won it   but all was jest and joke among ourselves   then must she keep it safelier  all was jest   but father give me leave an if he will   to ride to camelot with this noble knight   win shall i not but do my best to win   young as i am yet would i do my best       so will ye grace me answered lancelot   smiling a moment with your fellowship   oer these waste downs whereon i lost myself   then were i glad of you as guide and friend   and you shall win this diamondas i hear   it is a fair large diamondif ye may   and yield it to this maiden if ye will   a fair large diamond added plain sir torre   such be for queens and not for simple maids   then she who held her eyes upon the ground   elaine and heard her name so tost about   flushed slightly at the slight disparagement   before the stranger knight who looking at her   full courtly yet not falsely thus returned   if what is fair be but for what is fair   and only queens are to be counted so   rash were my judgment then who deem this maid   might wear as fair a jewel as is on earth   not violating the bond of like to like       he spoke and ceased  the lily maid elaine   won by the mellow voice before she looked   lifted her eyes and read his lineaments   the great and guilty love he bare the queen   in battle with the love he bare his lord   had marred his face and marked it ere his time   another sinning on such heights with one   the flower of all the west and all the world   had been the sleeker for it  but in him   his mood was often like a fiend and rose   and drove him into wastes and solitudes   for agony who was yet a living soul   marred as he was he seemed the goodliest man   that ever among ladies ate in hall   and noblest when she lifted up her eyes   however marred of more than twice her years   seamed with an ancient swordcut on the cheek   and bruised and bronzed she lifted up her eyes   and loved him with that love which was her doom       then the great knight the darling of the court   loved of the loveliest into that rude hall   stept with all grace and not with half disdain   hid under grace as in a smaller time   but kindly man moving among his kind   whom they with meats and vintage of their best   and talk and minstrel melody entertained   and much they asked of court and table round   and ever well and readily answered he   but lancelot when they glanced at guinevere   suddenly speaking of the wordless man   heard from the baron that ten years before   the heathen caught and reft him of his tongue   he learnt and warned me of their fierce design   against my house and him they caught and maimed   but i my sons and little daughter fled   from bonds or death and dwelt among the woods   by the great river in a boatmans hut   dull days were those till our good arthur broke   the pagan yet once more on badon hill       o there great lord doubtless lavaine said rapt   by all the sweet and sudden passion of youth   toward greatness in its elder you have fought   o tell usfor we live apartyou know   of arthurs glorious wars  and lancelot spoke   and answered him at full as having been   with arthur in the fight which all day long   rang by the white mouth of the violent glem   and in the four loud battles by the shore   of duglas that on bassa then the war   that thundered in and out the gloomy skirts   of celidon the forest and again   by castle gurnion where the glorious king   had on his cuirass worn our ladys head   carved of one emerald centered in a sun   of silver rays that lightened as he breathed   and at caerleon had he helped his lord   when the strong neighings of the wild white horse   set every gilded parapet shuddering   and up in agnedcathregonion too   and down the waste sandshores of trath treroit   where many a heathen fell and on the mount   of badon i myself beheld the king   charge at the head of all his table round   and all his legions crying christ and him   and break them and i saw him after stand   high on a heap of slain from spur to plume   red as the rising sun with heathen blood   and seeing me with a great voice he cried   they are broken they are broken for the king   however mild he seems at home nor cares   for triumph in our mimic wars the jousts   for if his own knight cast him down he laughs   saying his knights are better men than he   yet in this heathen war the fire of god   fills him  i never saw his like  there lives   no greater leader                       while he uttered this   low to her own heart said the lily maid   save your own great self fair lord and when he fell   from talk of war to traits of pleasantry   being mirthful he but in a stately kind   she still took note that when the living smile   died from his lips across him came a cloud   of melancholy severe from which again   whenever in her hovering to and fro   the lily maid had striven to make him cheer   there brake a suddenbeaming tenderness   of manners and of nature  and she thought   that all was nature all perchance for her   and all night long his face before her lived   as when a painter poring on a face   divinely through all hindrance finds the man   behind it and so paints him that his face   the shape and colour of a mind and life   lives for his children ever at its best   and fullest so the face before her lived   darksplendid speaking in the silence full   of noble things and held her from her sleep   till rathe she rose halfcheated in the thought   she needs must bid farewell to sweet lavaine   first in fear step after step she stole   down the long towerstairs hesitating   anon she heard sir lancelot cry in the court   this shield my friend where is it and lavaine   past inward as she came from out the tower   there to his proud horse lancelot turned and smoothed   the glossy shoulder humming to himself   halfenvious of the flattering hand she drew   nearer and stood  he looked and more amazed   than if seven men had set upon him saw   the maiden standing in the dewy light   he had not dreamed she was so beautiful   then came on him a sort of sacred fear   for silent though he greeted her she stood   rapt on his face as if it were a gods   suddenly flashed on her a wild desire   that he should wear her favour at the tilt   she braved a riotous heart in asking for it   fair lord whose name i know notnoble it is   i well believe the noblestwill you wear   my favour at this tourney  nay said he   fair lady since i never yet have worn   favour of any lady in the lists   such is my wont as those who know me know   yea so she answered then in wearing mine   needs must be lesser likelihood noble lord   that those who know should know you  and he turned   her counsel up and down within his mind   and found it true and answered true my child   well i will wear it  fetch it out to me   what is it and she told him a red sleeve   broidered with pearls and brought it  then he bound   her token on his helmet with a smile   saying i never yet have done so much   for any maiden living and the blood   sprang to her face and filled her with delight   but left her all the paler when lavaine   returning brought the yetunblazoned shield   his brothers which he gave to lancelot   who parted with his own to fair elaine   do me this grace my child to have my shield   in keeping till i come  a grace to me   she answered twice today  i am your squire   whereat lavaine said laughing lily maid   for fear our people call you lily maid   in earnest let me bring your colour back   once twice and thrice  now get you hence to bed   so kissed her and sir lancelot his own hand   and thus they moved away  she stayed a minute   then made a sudden step to the gate and there   her bright hair blown about the serious face   yet rosykindled with her brothers kiss   paused by the gateway standing near the shield   in silence while she watched their arms faroff   sparkle until they dipt below the downs   then to her tower she climbed and took the shield   there kept it and so lived in fantasy       meanwhile the new companions past away   far oer the long backs of the bushless downs   to where sir lancelot knew there lived a knight   not far from camelot now for forty years   a hermit who had prayed laboured and prayed   and ever labouring had scooped himself   in the white rock a chapel and a hall   on massive columns like a shorecliff cave   and cells and chambers  all were fair and dry   the green light from the meadows underneath   struck up and lived along the milky roofs   and in the meadows tremulous aspentrees   and poplars made a noise of falling showers   and thither wending there that night they bode       but when the next day broke from underground   and shot red fire and shadows through the cave   they rose heard mass broke fast and rode away   then lancelot saying hear but hold my name   hidden you ride with lancelot of the lake   abashed young lavaine whose instant reverence   dearer to true young hearts than their own praise   but left him leave to stammer is it indeed   and after muttering the great lancelot   at last he got his breath and answered one   one have i seenthat other our liege lord   the dread pendragon britains king of kings   of whom the people talk mysteriously   he will be therethen were i stricken blind   that minute i might say that i had seen       so spake lavaine and when they reached the lists   by camelot in the meadow let his eyes   run through the peopled gallery which half round   lay like a rainbow fallen upon the grass   until they found the clearfaced king who sat   robed in red samite easily to be known   since to his crown the golden dragon clung   and down his robe the dragon writhed in gold   and from the carvenwork behind him crept   two dragons gilded sloping down to make   arms for his chair while all the rest of them   through knots and loops and folds innumerable   fled ever through the woodwork till they found   the new design wherein they lost themselves   yet with all ease so tender was the work   and in the costly canopy oer him set   blazed the last diamond of the nameless king       then lancelot answered young lavaine and said   me you call great  mine is the firmer seat   the truer lance  but there is many a youth   now crescent who will come to all i am   and overcome it and in me there dwells   no greatness save it be some faroff touch   of greatness to know well i am not great   there is the man  and lavaine gaped upon him   as on a thing miraculous and anon   the trumpets blew and then did either side   they that assailed and they that held the lists   set lance in rest strike spur suddenly move   meet in the midst and there so furiously   shock that a man faroff might well perceive   if any man that day were left afield   the hard earth shake and a low thunder of arms   and lancelot bode a little till he saw   which were the weaker then he hurled into it   against the stronger  little need to speak   of lancelot in his glory  king duke earl   count baronwhom he smote he overthrew       but in the field were lancelots kith and kin   ranged with the table round that held the lists   strong men and wrathful that a stranger knight   should do and almost overdo the deeds   of lancelot and one said to the other lo   what is he  i do not mean the force alone   the grace and versatility of the man   is it not lancelot  when has lancelot worn   favour of any lady in the lists   not such his wont as we that know him know   how then who then a fury seized them all   a fiery family passion for the name   of lancelot and a glory one with theirs   they couched their spears and pricked their steeds and thus   their plumes driven backward by the wind they made   in moving all together down upon him   bare as a wild wave in the wide northsea   greenglimmering toward the summit bears with all   its stormy crests that smoke against the skies   down on a bark and overbears the bark   and him that helms it so they overbore   sir lancelot and his charger and a spear   downglancing lamed the charger and a spear   pricked sharply his own cuirass and the head   pierced through his side and there snapt and remained       then sir lavaine did well and worshipfully   he bore a knight of old repute to the earth   and brought his horse to lancelot where he lay   he up the side sweating with agony got   but thought to do while he might yet endure   and being lustily holpen by the rest   his partythough it seemed halfmiracle   to those he fought withdrave his kith and kin   and all the table round that held the lists   back to the barrier then the trumpets blew   proclaiming his the prize who wore the sleeve   of scarlet and the pearls and all the knights   his party cried advance and take thy prize   the diamond but he answered diamond me   no diamonds for gods love a little air   prize me no prizes for my prize is death   hence will i and i charge you follow me not       he spoke and vanished suddenly from the field   with young lavaine into the poplar grove   there from his charger down he slid and sat   gasping to sir lavaine draw the lancehead   ah my sweet lord sir lancelot said lavaine   i dread me if i draw it you will die   but he i die already with it  draw   drawand lavaine drew and sir lancelot gave   a marvellous great shriek and ghastly groan   and half his blood burst forth and down he sank   for the pure pain and wholly swooned away   then came the hermit out and bare him in   there stanched his wound and there in daily doubt   whether to live or die for many a week   hid from the wide worlds rumour by the grove   of poplars with their noise of falling showers   and evertremulous aspentrees he lay       but on that day when lancelot fled the lists   his party knights of utmost north and west   lords of waste marches kings of desolate isles   came round their great pendragon saying to him   lo sire our knight through whom we won the day   hath gone sore wounded and hath left his prize   untaken crying that his prize is death   heaven hinder said the king that such an one   so great a knight as we have seen today   he seemed to me another lancelot   yea twenty times i thought him lancelot   he must not pass uncared for  wherefore rise   o gawain and ride forth and find the knight   wounded and wearied needs must he be near   i charge you that you get at once to horse   and knights and kings there breathes not one of you   will deem this prize of ours is rashly given   his prowess was too wondrous  we will do him   no customary honour  since the knight   came not to us of us to claim the prize   ourselves will send it after  rise and take   this diamond and deliver it and return   and bring us where he is and how he fares   and cease not from your quest until ye find       so saying from the carven flower above   to which it made a restless heart he took   and gave the diamond  then from where he sat   at arthurs right with smiling face arose   with smiling face and frowning heart a prince   in the mid might and flourish of his may   gawain surnamed the courteous fair and strong   and after lancelot tristram and geraint   and gareth a good knight but therewithal   sir modreds brother and the child of lot   nor often loyal to his word and now   wroth that the kings command to sally forth   in quest of whom he knew not made him leave   the banquet and concourse of knights and kings       so all in wrath he got to horse and went   while arthur to the banquet dark in mood   past thinking is it lancelot who hath come   despite the wound he spake of all for gain   of glory and hath added wound to wound   and ridden away to die  so feared the king   and after two days tarriance there returned   then when he saw the queen embracing asked   love are you yet so sick  nay lord she said   and where is lancelot  then the queen amazed   was he not with you won he not your prize   nay but one like him  why that like was he   and when the king demanded how she knew   said lord no sooner had ye parted from us   than lancelot told me of a common talk   that men went down before his spear at a touch   but knowing he was lancelot his great name   conquered and therefore would he hide his name   from all men even the king and to this end   had made a pretext of a hindering wound   that he might joust unknown of all and learn   if his old prowess were in aught decayed   and added our true arthur when he learns   will well allow me pretext as for gain   of purer glory                     then replied the king   far lovelier in our lancelot had it been   in lieu of idly dallying with the truth   to have trusted me as he hath trusted thee   surely his king and most familiar friend   might well have kept his secret  true indeed   albeit i know my knights fantastical   so fine a fear in our large lancelot   must needs have moved my laughter  now remains   but little cause for laughter  his own kin   ill news my queen for all who love him this   his kith and kin not knowing set upon him   so that he went sore wounded from the field   yet good news too  for goodly hopes are mine   that lancelot is no more a lonely heart   he wore against his wont upon his helm   a sleeve of scarlet broidered with great pearls   some gentle maidens gift                               yea lord she said   thy hopes are mine and saying that she choked   and sharply turned about to hide her face   past to her chamber and there flung herself   down on the great kings couch and writhed upon it   and clenched her fingers till they bit the palm   and shrieked out traitor to the unhearing wall   then flashed into wild tears and rose again   and moved about her palace proud and pale       gawain the while through all the region round   rode with his diamond wearied of the quest   touched at all points except the poplar grove   and came at last though late to astolat   whom glittering in enamelled arms the maid   glanced at and cried what news from camelot lord   what of the knight with the red sleeve  he won   i knew it she said  but parted from the jousts   hurt in the side whereat she caught her breath   through her own side she felt the sharp lance go   thereon she smote her hand  wellnigh she swooned   and while he gazed wonderingly at her came   the lord of astolat out to whom the prince   reported who he was and on what quest   sent that he bore the prize and could not find   the victor but had ridden a random round   to seek him and had wearied of the search   to whom the lord of astolat bide with us   and ride no more at random noble prince   here was the knight and here he left a shield   this will he send or come for  furthermore   our son is with him we shall hear anon   needs must hear  to this the courteous prince   accorded with his wonted courtesy   courtesy with a touch of traitor in it   and stayed and cast his eyes on fair elaine   where could be found face daintier then her shape   from forehead down to foot perfectagain   from foot to forehead exquisitely turned   wellif i bide lo this wild flower for me   and oft they met among the garden yews   and there he set himself to play upon her   with sallying wit free flashes from a height   above her graces of the court and songs   sighs and slow smiles and golden eloquence   and amorous adulation till the maid   rebelled against it saying to him prince   o loyal nephew of our noble king   why ask you not to see the shield he left   whence you might learn his name  why slight your king   and lose the quest he sent you on and prove   no surer than our falcon yesterday   who lost the hern we slipt her at and went   to all the winds  nay by mine head said he   i lose it as we lose the lark in heaven   o damsel in the light of your blue eyes   but an ye will it let me see the shield   and when the shield was brought and gawain saw   sir lancelots azure lions crowned with gold   ramp in the field he smote his thigh and mocked   right was the king our lancelot that true man   and right was i she answered merrily i   who dreamed my knight the greatest knight of all   and if i dreamed said gawain that you love   this greatest knight your pardon lo ye know it   speak therefore  shall i waste myself in vain   full simple was her answer what know i   my brethren have been all my fellowship   and i when often they have talked of love   wished it had been my mother for they talked   meseemed of what they knew not so myself   i know not if i know what true love is   but if i know then if i love not him   i know there is none other i can love   yea by gods death said he ye love him well   but would not knew ye what all others know   and whom he loves  so be it cried elaine   and lifted her fair face and moved away   but he pursued her calling stay a little   one golden minutes grace he wore your sleeve   would he break faith with one i may not name   must our true man change like a leaf at last   naylike enow  why then far be it from me   to cross our mighty lancelot in his loves   and damsel for i deem you know full well   where your great knight is hidden let me leave   my quest with you the diamond also  here   for if you love it will be sweet to give it   and if he love it will be sweet to have it   from your own hand and whether he love or not   a diamond is a diamond  fare you well   a thousand timesa thousand times farewell   yet if he love and his love hold we two   may meet at court hereafter  there i think   so ye will learn the courtesies of the court   we two shall know each other                                  then he gave   and slightly kissed the hand to which he gave   the diamond and all wearied of the quest   leapt on his horse and carolling as he went   a truelove ballad lightly rode away       thence to the court he past there told the king   what the king knew sir lancelot is the knight   and added sire my liege so much i learnt   but failed to find him though i rode all round   the region  but i lighted on the maid   whose sleeve he wore she loves him and to her   deeming our courtesy is the truest law   i gave the diamond  she will render it   for by mine head she knows his hidingplace       the seldomfrowning king frowned and replied   too courteous truly ye shall go no more   on quest of mine seeing that ye forget   obedience is the courtesy due to kings       he spake and parted  wroth but all in awe   for twenty strokes of the blood without a word   lingered that other staring after him   then shook his hair strode off and buzzed abroad   about the maid of astolat and her love   all ears were pricked at once all tongues were loosed   the maid of astolat loves sir lancelot   sir lancelot loves the maid of astolat   some read the kings face some the queens and all   had marvel what the maid might be but most   predoomed her as unworthy  one old dame   came suddenly on the queen with the sharp news   she that had heard the noise of it before   but sorrowing lancelot should have stooped so low   marred her friends aim with pale tranquillity   so ran the tale like fire about the court   fire in dry stubble a ninedays wonder flared   till even the knights at banquet twice or thrice   forgot to drink to lancelot and the queen   and pledging lancelot and the lily maid   smiled at each other while the queen who sat   with lips severely placid felt the knot   climb in her throat and with her feet unseen   crushed the wild passion out against the floor   beneath the banquet where all the meats became   as wormwood and she hated all who pledged       but far away the maid in astolat   her guiltless rival she that ever kept   the onedayseen sir lancelot in her heart   crept to her father while he mused alone   sat on his knee stroked his gray face and said   father you call me wilful and the fault   is yours who let me have my will and now   sweet father will you let me lose my wits   nay said he surely  wherefore let me hence   she answered and find out our dear lavaine   ye will not lose your wits for dear lavaine   bide answered he  we needs must hear anon   of him and of that other  ay she said   and of that other for i needs must hence   and find that other wheresoeer he be   and with mine own hand give his diamond to him   lest i be found as faithless in the quest   as yon proud prince who left the quest to me   sweet father i behold him in my dreams   gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself   deathpale for lack of gentle maidens aid   the gentlerborn the maiden the more bound   my father to be sweet and serviceable   to noble knights in sickness as ye know   when these have worn their tokens  let me hence   i pray you  then her father nodding said   ay ay the diamond  wit ye well my child   right fain were i to learn this knight were whole   being our greatest  yea and you must give it   and sure i think this fruit is hung too high   for any mouth to gape for save a queens   nay i mean nothing  so then get you gone   being so very wilful you must go       lightly her suit allowed she slipt away   and while she made her ready for her ride   her fathers latest word hummed in her ear   being so very wilful you must go   and changed itself and echoed in her heart   being so very wilful you must die   but she was happy enough and shook it off   as we shake off the bee that buzzes at us   and in her heart she answered it and said   what matter so i help him back to life   then far away with good sir torre for guide   rode oer the long backs of the bushless downs   to camelot and before the citygates   came on her brother with a happy face   making a roan horse caper and curvet   for pleasure all about a field of flowers   whom when she saw lavaine she cried lavaine   how fares my lord sir lancelot  he amazed   torre and elaine why here sir lancelot   how know ye my lords name is lancelot   but when the maid had told him all her tale   then turned sir torre and being in his moods   left them and under the strangestatued gate   where arthurs wars were rendered mystically   past up the still rich city to his kin   his own far blood which dwelt at camelot   and her lavaine across the poplar grove   led to the caves  there first she saw the casque   of lancelot on the wall  her scarlet sleeve   though carved and cut and half the pearls away   streamed from it still and in her heart she laughed   because he had not loosed it from his helm   but meant once more perchance to tourney in it   and when they gained the cell wherein he slept   his battlewrithen arms and mighty hands   lay naked on the wolfskin and a dream   of dragging down his enemy made them move   then she that saw him lying unsleek unshorn   gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself   uttered a little tender dolorous cry   the sound not wonted in a place so still   woke the sick knight and while he rolled his eyes   yet blank from sleep she started to him saying   your prize the diamond sent you by the king   his eyes glistened  she fancied is it for me   and when the maid had told him all the tale   of king and prince the diamond sent the quest   assigned to her not worthy of it she knelt   full lowly by the corners of his bed   and laid the diamond in his open hand   her face was near and as we kiss the child   that does the task assigned he kissed her face   at once she slipt like water to the floor   alas he said your ride hath wearied you   rest must you have  no rest for me she said   nay for near you fair lord i am at rest   what might she mean by that his large black eyes   yet larger through his leanness dwelt upon her   till all her hearts sad secret blazed itself   in the hearts colours on her simple face   and lancelot looked and was perplext in mind   and being weak in body said no more   but did not love the colour womans love   save one he not regarded and so turned   sighing and feigned a sleep until he slept       then rose elaine and glided through the fields   and past beneath the weirdlysculptured gates   far up the dim rich city to her kin   there bode the night  but woke with dawn and past   down through the dim rich city to the fields   thence to the cave  so day by day she past   in either twilight ghostlike to and fro   gliding and every day she tended him   and likewise many a night  and lancelot   would though he called his wound a little hurt   whereof he should be quickly whole at times   brainfeverous in his heat and agony seem   uncourteous even he  but the meek maid   sweetly forbore him ever being to him   meeker than any child to a rough nurse   milder than any mother to a sick child   and never woman yet since mans first fall   did kindlier unto man but her deep love   upbore her till the hermit skilled in all   the simples and the science of that time   told him that her fine care had saved his life   and the sick man forgot her simple blush   would call her friend and sister sweet elaine   would listen for her coming and regret   her parting step and held her tenderly   and loved her with all love except the love   of man and woman when they love their best   closest and sweetest and had died the death   in any knightly fashion for her sake   and peradventure had he seen her first   she might have made this and that other world   another world for the sick man but now   the shackles of an old love straitened him   his honour rooted in dishonour stood   and faith unfaithful kept him falsely true       yet the great knight in his midsickness made   full many a holy vow and pure resolve   these as but born of sickness could not live   for when the blood ran lustier in him again   full often the bright image of one face   making a treacherous quiet in his heart   dispersed his resolution like a cloud   then if the maiden while that ghostly grace   beamed on his fancy spoke he answered not   or short and coldly and she knew right well   what the rough sickness meant but what this meant   she knew not and the sorrow dimmed her sight   and drave her ere her time across the fields   far into the rich city where alone   she murmured vain in vain  it cannot be   he will not love me  how then must i die   then as a little helpless innocent bird   that has but one plain passage of few notes   will sing the simple passage oer and oer   for all an april morning till the ear   wearies to hear it so the simple maid   went half the night repeating must i die   and now to right she turned and now to left   and found no ease in turning or in rest   and him or death she muttered death or him   again and like a burthen him or death       but when sir lancelots deadly hurt was whole   to astolat returning rode the three   there morn by morn arraying her sweet self   in that wherein she deemed she looked her best   she came before sir lancelot for she thought   if i be loved these are my festal robes   if not the victims flowers before he fall   and lancelot ever prest upon the maid   that she should ask some goodly gift of him   for her own self or hers and do not shun   to speak the wish most near to your true heart   such service have ye done me that i make   my will of yours and prince and lord am i   in mine own land and what i will i can   then like a ghost she lifted up her face   but like a ghost without the power to speak   and lancelot saw that she withheld her wish   and bode among them yet a little space   till he should learn it and one morn it chanced   he found her in among the garden yews   and said delay no longer speak your wish   seeing i go today then out she brake   going and we shall never see you more   and i must die for want of one bold word   speak  that i live to hear he said is yours   then suddenly and passionately she spoke   i have gone mad  i love you  let me die   ah sister answered lancelot what is this   and innocently extending her white arms   your love she said your loveto be your wife   and lancelot answered had i chosen to wed   i had been wedded earlier sweet elaine   but now there never will be wife of mine   no no she cried i care not to be wife   but to be with you still to see your face   to serve you and to follow you through the world   and lancelot answered nay the world the world   all ear and eye with such a stupid heart   to interpret ear and eye and such a tongue   to blare its own interpretationnay   full ill then should i quit your brothers love   and your good fathers kindness  and she said   not to be with you not to see your face   alas for me then my good days are done   nay noble maid he answered ten times nay   this is not love  but loves first flash in youth   most common  yea i know it of mine own self   and you yourself will smile at your own self   hereafter when you yield your flower of life   to one more fitly yours not thrice your age   and then will i for true you are and sweet   beyond mine old belief in womanhood   more specially should your good knight be poor   endow you with broad land and territory   even to the half my realm beyond the seas   so that would make you happy  furthermore   even to the death as though ye were my blood   in all your quarrels will i be your knight   this i will do dear damsel for your sake   and more than this i cannot                                 while he spoke   she neither blushed nor shook but deathlypale   stood grasping what was nearest then replied   of all this will i nothing and so fell   and thus they bore her swooning to her tower       then spake to whom through those black walls of yew   their talk had pierced her father  ay a flash   i fear me that will strike my blossom dead   too courteous are ye fair lord lancelot   i pray you use some rough discourtesy   to blunt or break her passion                                   lancelot said   that were against me  what i can i will   and there that day remained and toward even   sent for his shield  full meekly rose the maid   stript off the case and gave the naked shield   then when she heard his horse upon the stones   unclasping flung the casement back and looked   down on his helm from which her sleeve had gone   and lancelot knew the little clinking sound   and she by tact of love was well aware   that lancelot knew that she was looking at him   and yet he glanced not up nor waved his hand   nor bad farewell but sadly rode away   this was the one discourtesy that he used       so in her tower alone the maiden sat   his very shield was gone only the case   her own poor work her empty labour left   but still she heard him still his picture formed   and grew between her and the pictured wall   then came her father saying in low tones   have comfort whom she greeted quietly   then came her brethren saying peace to thee   sweet sister whom she answered with all calm   but when they left her to herself again   death like a friends voice from a distant field   approaching through the darkness called the owls   wailing had power upon her and she mixt   her fancies with the sallowrifted glooms   of evening and the moanings of the wind       and in those days she made a little song   and called her song the song of love and death   and sang it  sweetly could she make and sing       sweet is true love though given in vain in vain   and sweet is death who puts an end to pain   i know not which is sweeter no not i       love art thou sweet then bitter death must be   love thou art bitter sweet is death to me   o love if death be sweeter let me die       sweet love that seems not made to fade away   sweet death that seems to make us loveless clay   i know not which is sweeter no not i       i fain would follow love if that could be   i needs must follow death who calls for me   call and i follow i follow let me die       high with the last line scaled her voice and this   all in a fiery dawning wild with wind   that shook her tower the brothers heard and thought   with shuddering hark the phantom of the house   that ever shrieks before a death and called   the father and all three in hurry and fear   ran to her and lo the bloodred light of dawn   flared on her face she shrilling let me die       as when we dwell upon a word we know   repeating till the word we know so well   becomes a wonder and we know not why   so dwelt the father on her face and thought   is this elaine till back the maiden fell   then gave a languid hand to each and lay   speaking a still goodmorrow with her eyes   at last she said sweet brothers yesternight   i seemed a curious little maid again   as happy as when we dwelt among the woods   and when ye used to take me with the flood   up the great river in the boatmans boat   only ye would not pass beyond the cape   that has the poplar on it  there ye fixt   your limit oft returning with the tide   and yet i cried because ye would not pass   beyond it and far up the shining flood   until we found the palace of the king   and yet ye would not but this night i dreamed   that i was all alone upon the flood   and then i said now shall i have my will   and there i woke but still the wish remained   so let me hence that i may pass at last   beyond the poplar and far up the flood   until i find the palace of the king   there will i enter in among them all   and no man there will dare to mock at me   but there the fine gawain will wonder at me   and there the great sir lancelot muse at me   gawain who bad a thousand farewells to me   lancelot who coldly went nor bad me one   and there the king will know me and my love   and there the queen herself will pity me   and all the gentle court will welcome me   and after my long voyage i shall rest       peace said her father o my child ye seem   lightheaded for what force is yours to go   so far being sick and wherefore would ye look   on this proud fellow again who scorns us all       then the rough torre began to heave and move   and bluster into stormy sobs and say   i never loved him  an i meet with him   i care not howsoever great he be   then will i strike at him and strike him down   give me good fortune i will strike him dead   for this discomfort he hath done the house       to whom the gentle sister made reply   fret not yourself dear brother nor be wroth   seeing it is no more sir lancelots fault   not to love me than it is mine to love   him of all men who seems to me the highest       highest the father answered echoing highest   he meant to break the passion in her nay   daughter i know not what you call the highest   but this i know for all the people know it   he loves the queen and in an open shame   and she returns his love in open shame   if this be high what is it to be low       then spake the lily maid of astolat   sweet father all too faint and sick am i   for anger  these are slanders  never yet   was noble man but made ignoble talk   he makes no friend who never made a foe   but now it is my glory to have loved   one peerless without stain  so let me pass   my father howsoeer i seem to you   not all unhappy having loved gods best   and greatest though my love had no return   yet seeing you desire your child to live   thanks but you work against your own desire   for if i could believe the things you say   i should but die the sooner wherefore cease   sweet father and bid call the ghostly man   hither and let me shrive me clean and die       so when the ghostly man had come and gone   she with a face bright as for sin forgiven   besought lavaine to write as she devised   a letter word for word and when he asked   is it for lancelot is it for my dear lord   then will i bear it gladly she replied   for lancelot and the queen and all the world   but i myself must bear it  then he wrote   the letter she devised which being writ   and folded o sweet father tender and true   deny me not she saidye never yet   denied my fanciesthis however strange   my latest  lay the letter in my hand   a little ere i die and close the hand   upon it i shall guard it even in death   and when the heat is gone from out my heart   then take the little bed on which i died   for lancelots love and deck it like the queens   for richness and me also like the queen   in all i have of rich and lay me on it   and let there be prepared a chariotbier   to take me to the river and a barge   be ready on the river clothed in black   i go in state to court to meet the queen   there surely i shall speak for mine own self   and none of you can speak for me so well   and therefore let our dumb old man alone   go with me he can steer and row and he   will guide me to that palace to the doors       she ceased  her father promised whereupon   she grew so cheerful that they deemed her death   was rather in the fantasy than the blood   but ten slow mornings past and on the eleventh   her father laid the letter in her hand   and closed the hand upon it and she died   so that day there was dole in astolat       but when the next sun brake from underground   then those two brethren slowly with bent brows   accompanying the sad chariotbier   past like a shadow through the field that shone   fullsummer to that stream whereon the barge   palled all its length in blackest samite lay   there sat the lifelong creature of the house   loyal the dumb old servitor on deck   winking his eyes and twisted all his face   so those two brethren from the chariot took   and on the black decks laid her in her bed   set in her hand a lily oer her hung   the silken case with braided blazonings   and kissed her quiet brows and saying to her   sister farewell for ever and again   farewell sweet sister parted all in tears   then rose the dumb old servitor and the dead   oared by the dumb went upward with the flood   in her right hand the lily in her left   the letterall her bright hair streaming down   and all the coverlid was cloth of gold   drawn to her waist and she herself in white   all but her face and that clearfeatured face   was lovely for she did not seem as dead   but fast asleep and lay as though she smiled       that day sir lancelot at the palace craved   audience of guinevere to give at last   the price of half a realm his costly gift   hardwon and hardly won with bruise and blow   with deaths of others and almost his own   the nineyearsfoughtfor diamonds  for he saw   one of her house and sent him to the queen   bearing his wish whereto the queen agreed   with such and so unmoved a majesty   she might have seemed her statue but that he   lowdrooping till he wellnigh kissed her feet   for loyal awe saw with a sidelong eye   the shadow of some piece of pointed lace   in the queens shadow vibrate on the walls   and parted laughing in his courtly heart       all in an oriel on the summer side   vineclad of arthurs palace toward the stream   they met and lancelot kneeling uttered queen   lady my liege in whom i have my joy   take what i had not won except for you   these jewels and make me happy making them   an armlet for the roundest arm on earth   or necklace for a neck to which the swans   is tawnier than her cygnets  these are words   your beauty is your beauty and i sin   in speaking yet o grant my worship of it   words as we grant grief tears  such sin in words   perchance we both can pardon  but my queen   i hear of rumours flying through your court   our bond as not the bond of man and wife   should have in it an absoluter trust   to make up that defect  let rumours be   when did not rumours fly these as i trust   that you trust me in your own nobleness   i may not well believe that you believe       while thus he spoke half turned away the queen   brake from the vast orielembowering vine   leaf after leaf and tore and cast them off   till all the place whereon she stood was green   then when he ceased in one cold passive hand   received at once and laid aside the gems   there on a table near her and replied       it may be i am quicker of belief   than you believe me lancelot of the lake   our bond is not the bond of man and wife   this good is in it whatsoeer of ill   it can be broken easier  i for you   this many a year have done despite and wrong   to one whom ever in my heart of hearts   i did acknowledge nobler  what are these   diamonds for me they had been thrice their worth   being your gift had you not lost your own   to loyal hearts the value of all gifts   must vary as the givers  not for me   for her for your new fancy  only this   grant me i pray you  have your joys apart   i doubt not that however changed you keep   so much of what is graceful  and myself   would shun to break those bounds of courtesy   in which as arthurs queen i move and rule   so cannot speak my mind  an end to this   a strange one yet i take it with amen   so pray you add my diamonds to her pearls   deck her with these tell her she shines me down   an armlet for an arm to which the queens   is haggard or a necklace for a neck   o as much faireras a faith once fair   was richer than these diamondshers not mine   nay by the mother of our lord himself   or hers or mine mine now to work my will   she shall not have them                             saying which she seized   and through the casement standing wide for heat   flung them and down they flashed and smote the stream   then from the smitten surface flashed as it were   diamonds to meet them and they past away   then while sir lancelot leant in half disdain   at love life all things on the window ledge   close underneath his eyes and right across   where these had fallen slowly past the barge   whereon the lily maid of astolat   lay smiling like a star in blackest night       but the wild queen who saw not burst away   to weep and wail in secret and the barge   on to the palacedoorway sliding paused   there two stood armed and kept the door to whom   all up the marble stair tier over tier   were added mouths that gaped and eyes that asked   what is it but that oarsmans haggard face   as hard and still as is the face that men   shape to their fancys eye from broken rocks   on some cliffside appalled them and they said   he is enchanted cannot speakand she   look how she sleepsthe fairy queen so fair   yea but how pale what are they flesh and blood   or come to take the king to fairyland   for some do hold our arthur cannot die   but that he passes into fairyland       while thus they babbled of the king the king   came girt with knights  then turned the tongueless man   from the halfface to the full eye and rose   and pointed to the damsel and the doors   so arthur bad the meek sir percivale   and pure sir galahad to uplift the maid   and reverently they bore her into hall   then came the fine gawain and wondered at her   and lancelot later came and mused at her   and last the queen herself and pitied her   but arthur spied the letter in her hand   stoopt took brake seal and read it this was all       most noble lord sir lancelot of the lake   i sometime called the maid of astolat   come for you left me taking no farewell   hither to take my last farewell of you   i loved you and my love had no return   and therefore my true love has been my death   and therefore to our lady guinevere   and to all other ladies i make moan   pray for my soul and yield me burial   pray for my soul thou too sir lancelot   as thou art a knight peerless                                   thus he read   and ever in the reading lords and dames   wept looking often from his face who read   to hers which lay so silent and at times   so touched were they halfthinking that her lips   who had devised the letter moved again       then freely spoke sir lancelot to them all   my lord liege arthur and all ye that hear   know that for this most gentle maidens death   right heavy am i for good she was and true   but loved me with a love beyond all love   in women whomsoever i have known   yet to be loved makes not to love again   not at my years however it hold in youth   i swear by truth and knighthood that i gave   no cause not willingly for such a love   to this i call my friends in testimony   her brethren and her father who himself   besought me to be plain and blunt and use   to break her passion some discourtesy   against my nature  what i could i did   i left her and i bad her no farewell   though had i dreamt the damsel would have died   i might have put my wits to some rough use   and helped her from herself                                 then said the queen   sea was her wrath yet working after storm   ye might at least have done her so much grace   fair lord as would have helped her from her death   he raised his head their eyes met and hers fell   he adding             queen she would not be content   save that i wedded her which could not be   then might she follow me through the world she asked   it could not be  i told her that her love   was but the flash of youth would darken down   to rise hereafter in a stiller flame   toward one more worthy of herthen would i   more specially were he she wedded poor   estate them with large land and territory   in mine own realm beyond the narrow seas   to keep them in all joyance  more than this   i could not this she would not and she died       he pausing arthur answered o my knight   it will be to thy worship as my knight   and mine as head of all our table round   to see that she be buried worshipfully       so toward that shrine which then in all the realm   was richest arthur leading slowly went   the marshalled order of their table round   and lancelot sad beyond his wont to see   the maiden buried not as one unknown   nor meanly but with gorgeous obsequies   and mass and rolling music like a queen   and when the knights had laid her comely head   low in the dust of halfforgotten kings   then arthur spake among them let her tomb   be costly and her image thereupon   and let the shield of lancelot at her feet   be carven and her lily in her hand   and let the story of her dolorous voyage   for all true hearts be blazoned on her tomb   in letters gold and azure which was wrought   thereafter but when now the lords and dames   and people from the high door streaming brake   disorderly as homeward each the queen   who marked sir lancelot where he moved apart   drew near and sighed in passing lancelot   forgive me mine was jealousy in love   he answered with his eyes upon the ground   that is loves curse pass on my queen forgiven   but arthur who beheld his cloudy brows   approached him and with full affection said       lancelot my lancelot thou in whom i have   most joy and most affiance for i know   what thou hast been in battle by my side   and many a time have watched thee at the tilt   strike down the lusty and long practised knight   and let the younger and unskilled go by   to win his honour and to make his name   and loved thy courtesies and thee a man   made to be loved but now i would to god   seeing the homeless trouble in thine eyes   thou couldst have loved this maiden shaped it seems   by god for thee alone and from her face   if one may judge the living by the dead   delicately pure and marvellously fair   who might have brought thee now a lonely man   wifeless and heirless noble issue sons   born to the glory of thine name and fame   my knight the great sir lancelot of the lake       then answered lancelot fair she was my king   pure as you ever wish your knights to be   to doubt her fairness were to want an eye   to doubt her pureness were to want a heart   yea to be loved if what is worthy love   could bind him but free love will not be bound       free love so bound were freest said the king   let love be free free love is for the best   and after heaven on our dull side of death   what should be best if not so pure a love   clothed in so pure a loveliness yet thee   she failed to bind though being as i think   unbound as yet and gentle as i know       and lancelot answered nothing but he went   and at the inrunning of a little brook   sat by the river in a cove and watched   the high reed wave and lifted up his eyes   and saw the barge that brought her moving down   faroff a blot upon the stream and said   low in himself ah simple heart and sweet   ye loved me damsel surely with a love   far tenderer than my queens  pray for thy soul   ay that will i  farewell toonow at last   farewell fair lily  jealousy in love   not rather dead loves harsh heir jealous pride   queen if i grant the jealousy as of love   may not your crescent fear for name and fame   speak as it waxes of a love that wanes   why did the king dwell on my name to me   mine own name shames me seeming a reproach   lancelot whom the lady of the lake   caught from his mothers armsthe wondrous one   who passes through the vision of the night   she chanted snatches of mysterious hymns   heard on the winding waters eve and morn   she kissed me saying thou art fair my child   as a kings son and often in her arms   she bare me pacing on the dusky mere   would she had drowned me in it whereer it be   for what am i what profits me my name   of greatest knight  i fought for it and have it   pleasure to have it none to lose it pain   now grown a part of me  but what use in it   to make men worse by making my sin known   or sin seem less the sinner seeming great   alas for arthurs greatest knight a man   not after arthurs heart  i needs must break   these bonds that so defame me  not without   she wills it  would i if she willed it nay   who knows but if i would not then may god   i pray him send a sudden angel down   to seize me by the hair and bear me far   and fling me deep in that forgotten mere   among the tumbled fragments of the hills       so groaned sir lancelot in remorseful pain   not knowing he should die a holy man      the holy grail    from noiseful arms and acts of prowess done   in tournament or tilt sir percivale   whom arthur and his knighthood called the pure   had passed into the silent life of prayer   praise fast and alms and leaving for the cowl   the helmet in an abbey far away   from camelot there and not long after died       and one a fellowmonk among the rest   ambrosius loved him much beyond the rest   and honoured him and wrought into his heart   a way by love that wakened love within   to answer that which came  and as they sat   beneath a worldold yewtree darkening half   the cloisters on a gustful april morn   that puffed the swaying branches into smoke   above them ere the summer when he died   the monk ambrosius questioned percivale       o brother i have seen this yewtree smoke   spring after spring for half a hundred years   for never have i known the world without   nor ever strayed beyond the pale  but thee   when first thou camestsuch a courtesy   spake through the limbs and in the voicei knew   for one of those who eat in arthurs hall   for good ye are and bad and like to coins   some true some light but every one of you   stamped with the image of the king and now   tell me what drove thee from the table round   my brother was it earthly passion crost       nay said the knight for no such passion mine   but the sweet vision of the holy grail   drove me from all vainglories rivalries   and earthly heats that spring and sparkle out   among us in the jousts while women watch   who wins who falls and waste the spiritual strength   within us better offered up to heaven       to whom the monk  the holy graili trust   we are green in heavens eyes but here too much   we moulderas to things without i mean   yet one of your own knights a guest of ours   told us of this in our refectory   but spake with such a sadness and so low   we heard not half of what he said  what is it   the phantom of a cup that comes and goes       nay monk what phantom answered percivale   the cup the cup itself from which our lord   drank at the last sad supper with his own   this from the blessed land of aromat   after the day of darkness when the dead   went wandering oer moriahthe good saint   arimathaean joseph journeying brought   to glastonbury where the winter thorn   blossoms at christmas mindful of our lord   and there awhile it bode and if a man   could touch or see it he was healed at once   by faith of all his ills  but then the times   grew to such evil that the holy cup   was caught away to heaven and disappeared       to whom the monk  from our old books i know   that joseph came of old to glastonbury   and there the heathen prince arviragus   gave him an isle of marsh whereon to build   and there he built with wattles from the marsh   a little lonely church in days of yore   for so they say these books of ours but seem   mute of this miracle far as i have read   but who first saw the holy thing today       a woman answered percivale a nun   and one no further off in blood from me   than sister and if ever holy maid   with knees of adoration wore the stone   a holy maid though never maiden glowed   but that was in her earlier maidenhood   with such a fervent flame of human love   which being rudely blunted glanced and shot   only to holy things to prayer and praise   she gave herself to fast and alms  and yet   nun as she was the scandal of the court   sin against arthur and the table round   and the strange sound of an adulterous race   across the iron grating of her cell   beat and she prayed and fasted all the more       and he to whom she told her sins or what   her all but utter whiteness held for sin   a man wellnigh a hundred winters old   spake often with her of the holy grail   a legend handed down through five or six   and each of these a hundred winters old   from our lords time  and when king arthur made   his table round and all mens hearts became   clean for a season surely he had thought   that now the holy grail would come again   but sin broke out  ah christ that it would come   and heal the world of all their wickedness   o father asked the maiden might it come   to me by prayer and fasting  nay said he   i know not for thy heart is pure as snow   and so she prayed and fasted till the sun   shone and the wind blew through her and i thought   she might have risen and floated when i saw her       for on a day she sent to speak with me   and when she came to speak behold her eyes   beyond my knowing of them beautiful   beyond all knowing of them wonderful   beautiful in the light of holiness   and o my brother percivale she said   sweet brother i have seen the holy grail   for waked at dead of night i heard a sound   as of a silver horn from oer the hills   blown and i thought it is not arthurs use   to hunt by moonlight and the slender sound   as from a distance beyond distance grew   coming upon meo never harp nor horn   nor aught we blow with breath or touch with hand   was like that music as it came and then   streamed through my cell a cold and silver beam   and down the long beam stole the holy grail   rosered with beatings in it as if alive   till all the white walls of my cell were dyed   with rosy colours leaping on the wall   and then the music faded and the grail   past and the beam decayed and from the walls   the rosy quiverings died into the night   so now the holy thing is here again   among us brother fast thou too and pray   and tell thy brother knights to fast and pray   that so perchance the vision may be seen   by thee and those and all the world be healed       then leaving the pale nun i spake of this   to all men and myself fasted and prayed   always and many among us many a week   fasted and prayed even to the uttermost   expectant of the wonder that would be       and one there was among us ever moved   among us in white armour galahad   god make thee good as thou art beautiful   said arthur when he dubbed him knight and none   in so young youth was ever made a knight   till galahad and this galahad when he heard   my sisters vision filled me with amaze   his eyes became so like her own they seemed   hers and himself her brother more than i       sister or brother none had he but some   called him a son of lancelot and some said   begotten by enchantmentchatterers they   like birds of passage piping up and down   that gape for flieswe know not whence they come   for when was lancelot wanderingly lewd       but she the wan sweet maiden shore away   clean from her forehead all that wealth of hair   which made a silken matwork for her feet   and out of this she plaited broad and long   a strong swordbelt and wove with silver thread   and crimson in the belt a strange device   a crimson grail within a silver beam   and saw the bright boyknight and bound it on him   saying my knight my love my knight of heaven   o thou my love whose love is one with mine   i maiden round thee maiden bind my belt   go forth for thou shalt see what i have seen   and break through all till one will crown thee king   far in the spiritual city and as she spake   she sent the deathless passion in her eyes   through him and made him hers and laid her mind   on him and he believed in her belief       then came a year of miracle  o brother   in our great hall there stood a vacant chair   fashioned by merlin ere he past away   and carven with strange figures and in and out   the figures like a serpent ran a scroll   of letters in a tongue no man could read   and merlin called it the siege perilous   perilous for good and ill for there he said   no man could sit but he should lose himself   and once by misadvertence merlin sat   in his own chair and so was lost but he   galahad when he heard of merlins doom   cried if i lose myself i save myself       then on a summer night it came to pass   while the great banquet lay along the hall   that galahad would sit down in merlins chair       and all at once as there we sat we heard   a cracking and a riving of the roofs   and rending and a blast and overhead   thunder and in the thunder was a cry   and in the blast there smote along the hall   a beam of light seven times more clear than day   and down the long beam stole the holy grail   all over covered with a luminous cloud   and none might see who bare it and it past   but every knight beheld his fellows face   as in a glory and all the knights arose   and staring each at other like dumb men   stood till i found a voice and sware a vow       i sware a vow before them all that i   because i had not seen the grail would ride   a twelvemonth and a day in quest of it   until i found and saw it as the nun   my sister saw it and galahad sware the vow   and good sir bors our lancelots cousin sware   and lancelot sware and many among the knights   and gawain sware and louder than the rest       then spake the monk ambrosius asking him   what said the king  did arthur take the vow       nay for my lord said percivale the king   was not in hall  for early that same day   scaped through a cavern from a bandit hold   an outraged maiden sprang into the hall   crying on help  for all her shining hair   was smeared with earth and either milky arm   redrent with hooks of bramble and all she wore   torn as a sail that leaves the rope is torn   in tempest  so the king arose and went   to smoke the scandalous hive of those wild bees   that made such honey in his realm  howbeit   some little of this marvel he too saw   returning oer the plain that then began   to darken under camelot whence the king   looked up calling aloud lo there the roofs   of our great hall are rolled in thundersmoke   pray heaven they be not smitten by the bolt   for dear to arthur was that hall of ours   as having there so oft with all his knights   feasted and as the stateliest under heaven       o brother had you known our mighty hall   which merlin built for arthur long ago   for all the sacred mount of camelot   and all the dim rich city roof by roof   tower after tower spire beyond spire   by grove and gardenlawn and rushing brook   climbs to the mighty hall that merlin built   and four great zones of sculpture set betwixt   with many a mystic symbol gird the hall   and in the lowest beasts are slaying men   and in the second men are slaying beasts   and on the third are warriors perfect men   and on the fourth are men with growing wings   and over all one statue in the mould   of arthur made by merlin with a crown   and peaked wings pointed to the northern star   and eastward fronts the statue and the crown   and both the wings are made of gold and flame   at sunrise till the people in far fields   wasted so often by the heathen hordes   behold it crying we have still a king       and brother had you known our hall within   broader and higher than any in all the lands   where twelve great windows blazon arthurs wars   and all the light that falls upon the board   streams through the twelve great battles of our king   nay one there is and at the eastern end   wealthy with wandering lines of mount and mere   where arthur finds the brand excalibur   and also one to the west and counter to it   and blank  and who shall blazon it when and how   o there perchance when all our wars are done   the brand excalibur will be cast away       so to this hall full quickly rode the king   in horror lest the work by merlin wrought   dreamlike should on the sudden vanish wrapt   in unremorseful folds of rolling fire   and in he rode and up i glanced and saw   the golden dragon sparkling over all   and many of those who burnt the hold their arms   hacked and their foreheads grimed with smoke and seared   followed and in among bright faces ours   full of the vision prest  and then the king   spake to me being nearest percivale   because the hall was all in tumultsome   vowing and some protesting what is this       o brother when i told him what had chanced   my sisters vision and the rest his face   darkened as i have seen it more than once   when some brave deed seemed to be done in vain   darken and woe is me my knights he cried   had i been here ye had not sworn the vow   bold was mine answer had thyself been here   my king thou wouldst have sworn  yea yea said he   art thou so bold and hast not seen the grail       nay lord i heard the sound i saw the light   but since i did not see the holy thing   i sware a vow to follow it till i saw       then when he asked us knight by knight if any   had seen it all their answers were as one   nay lord and therefore have we sworn our vows       lo now said arthur have ye seen a cloud   what go ye into the wilderness to see       then galahad on the sudden and in a voice   shrilling along the hall to arthur called   but i sir arthur saw the holy grail   i saw the holy grail and heard a cry   o galahad and o galahad follow me       ah galahad galahad said the king for such   as thou art is the vision not for these   thy holy nun and thou have seen a sign   holier is none my percivale than she   a sign to maim this order which i made   but ye that follow but the leaders bell   brother the king was hard upon his knights   taliessin is our fullest throat of song   and one hath sung and all the dumb will sing   lancelot is lancelot and hath overborne   five knights at once and every younger knight   unproven holds himself as lancelot   till overborne by one he learnsand ye   what are ye galahadsno nor percivales   for thus it pleased the king to range me close   after sir galahad nay said he but men   with strength and will to right the wronged of power   to lay the sudden heads of violence flat   knights that in twelve great battles splashed and dyed   the strong white horse in his own heathen blood   but one hath seen and all the blind will see   go since your vows are sacred being made   yetfor ye know the cries of all my realm   pass through this hallhow often o my knights   your places being vacant at my side   this chance of noble deeds will come and go   unchallenged while ye follow wandering fires   lost in the quagmire  many of you yea most   return no more  ye think i show myself   too dark a prophet  come now let us meet   the morrow morn once more in one full field   of gracious pastime that once more the king   before ye leave him for this quest may count   the yetunbroken strength of all his knights   rejoicing in that order which he made       so when the sun broke next from under ground   all the great table of our arthur closed   and clashed in such a tourney and so full   so many lances brokennever yet   had camelot seen the like since arthur came   and i myself and galahad for a strength   was in us from this vision overthrew   so many knights that all the people cried   and almost burst the barriers in their heat   shouting sir galahad and sir percivale       but when the next day brake from under ground   o brother had you known our camelot   built by old kings age after age so old   the king himself had fears that it would fall   so strange and rich and dim for where the roofs   tottered toward each other in the sky   met foreheads all along the street of those   who watched us pass and lower and where the long   rich galleries ladyladen weighed the necks   of dragons clinging to the crazy walls   thicker than drops from thunder showers of flowers   fell as we past and men and boys astride   on wyvern lion dragon griffin swan   at all the corners named us each by name   calling god speed but in the ways below   the knights and ladies wept and rich and poor   wept and the king himself could hardly speak   for grief and all in middle street the queen   who rode by lancelot wailed and shrieked aloud   this madness has come on us for our sins   so to the gate of the three queens we came   where arthurs wars are rendered mystically   and thence departed every one his way       and i was lifted up in heart and thought   of all my lateshown prowess in the lists   how my strong lance had beaten down the knights   so many and famous names and never yet   had heaven appeared so blue nor earth so green   for all my blood danced in me and i knew   that i should light upon the holy grail       thereafter the dark warning of our king   that most of us would follow wandering fires   came like a driving gloom across my mind   then every evil word i had spoken once   and every evil thought i had thought of old   and every evil deed i ever did   awoke and cried this quest is not for thee   and lifting up mine eyes i found myself   alone and in a land of sand and thorns   and i was thirsty even unto death   and i too cried this quest is not for thee       and on i rode and when i thought my thirst   would slay me saw deep lawns and then a brook   with one sharp rapid where the crisping white   played ever back upon the sloping wave   and took both ear and eye and oer the brook   were appletrees and apples by the brook   fallen and on the lawns  i will rest here   i said i am not worthy of the quest   but even while i drank the brook and ate   the goodly apples all these things at once   fell into dust and i was left alone   and thirsting in a land of sand and thorns       and then behold a woman at a door   spinning and fair the house whereby she sat   and kind the womans eyes and innocent   and all her bearing gracious and she rose   opening her arms to meet me as who should say   rest here but when i touched her lo she too   fell into dust and nothing and the house   became no better than a broken shed   and in it a dead babe and also this   fell into dust and i was left alone       and on i rode and greater was my thirst   then flashed a yellow gleam across the world   and where it smote the plowshare in the field   the plowman left his plowing and fell down   before it where it glittered on her pail   the milkmaid left her milking and fell down   before it and i knew not why but thought   the sun is rising though the sun had risen   then was i ware of one that on me moved   in golden armour with a crown of gold   about a casque all jewels and his horse   in golden armour jewelled everywhere   and on the splendour came flashing me blind   and seemed to me the lord of all the world   being so huge  but when i thought he meant   to crush me moving on me lo he too   opened his arms to embrace me as he came   and up i went and touched him and he too   fell into dust and i was left alone   and wearying in a land of sand and thorns       and i rode on and found a mighty hill   and on the top a city walled  the spires   pricked with incredible pinnacles into heaven   and by the gateway stirred a crowd and these   cried to me climbing welcome percivale   thou mightiest and thou purest among men   and glad was i and clomb but found at top   no man nor any voice  and thence i past   far through a ruinous city and i saw   that man had once dwelt there but there i found   only one man of an exceeding age   where is that goodly company said i   that so cried out upon me and he had   scarce any voice to answer and yet gasped   whence and what art thou and even as he spoke   fell into dust and disappeared and i   was left alone once more and cried in grief   lo if i find the holy grail itself   and touch it it will crumble into dust       and thence i dropt into a lowly vale   low as the hill was high and where the vale   was lowest found a chapel and thereby   a holy hermit in a hermitage   to whom i told my phantoms and he said       o son thou hast not true humility   the highest virtue mother of them all   for when the lord of all things made himself   naked of glory for his mortal change   take thou my robe she said for all is thine   and all her form shone forth with sudden light   so that the angels were amazed and she   followed him down and like a flying star   led on the grayhaired wisdom of the east   but her thou hast not known  for what is this   thou thoughtest of thy prowess and thy sins   thou hast not lost thyself to save thyself   as galahad  when the hermit made an end   in silver armour suddenly galahad shone   before us and against the chapel door   laid lance and entered and we knelt in prayer   and there the hermit slaked my burning thirst   and at the sacring of the mass i saw   the holy elements alone but he   saw ye no more  i galahad saw the grail   the holy grail descend upon the shrine   i saw the fiery face as of a child   that smote itself into the bread and went   and hither am i come and never yet   hath what thy sister taught me first to see   this holy thing failed from my side nor come   covered but moving with me night and day   fainter by day but always in the night   bloodred and sliding down the blackened marsh   bloodred and on the naked mountain top   bloodred and in the sleeping mere below   bloodred  and in the strength of this i rode   shattering all evil customs everywhere   and past through pagan realms and made them mine   and clashed with pagan hordes and bore them down   and broke through all and in the strength of this   come victor  but my time is hard at hand   and hence i go and one will crown me king   far in the spiritual city and come thou too   for thou shalt see the vision when i go       while thus he spake his eye dwelling on mine   drew me with power upon me till i grew   one with him to believe as he believed   then when the day began to wane we went       there rose a hill that none but man could climb   scarred with a hundred wintry watercourses   storm at the top and when we gained it storm   round us and death for every moment glanced   his silver arms and gloomed  so quick and thick   the lightnings here and there to left and right   struck till the dry old trunks about us dead   yea rotten with a hundred years of death   sprang into fire  and at the base we found   on either hand as far as eye could see   a great black swamp and of an evil smell   part black part whitened with the bones of men   not to be crost save that some ancient king   had built a way where linked with many a bridge   a thousand piers ran into the great sea   and galahad fled along them bridge by bridge   and every bridge as quickly as he crost   sprang into fire and vanished though i yearned   to follow and thrice above him all the heavens   opened and blazed with thunder such as seemed   shoutings of all the sons of god  and first   at once i saw him far on the great sea   in silvershining armour starryclear   and oer his head the holy vessel hung   clothed in white samite or a luminous cloud   and with exceeding swiftness ran the boat   if boat it werei saw not whence it came   and when the heavens opened and blazed again   roaring i saw him like a silver star   and had he set the sail or had the boat   become a living creature clad with wings   and oer his head the holy vessel hung   redder than any rose a joy to me   for now i knew the veil had been withdrawn   then in a moment when they blazed again   opening i saw the least of little stars   down on the waste and straight beyond the star   i saw the spiritual city and all her spires   and gateways in a glory like one pearl   no larger though the goal of all the saints   strike from the sea and from the star there shot   a rosered sparkle to the city and there   dwelt and i knew it was the holy grail   which never eyes on earth again shall see   then fell the floods of heaven drowning the deep   and how my feet recrost the deathful ridge   no memory in me lives but that i touched   the chapeldoors at dawn i know and thence   taking my warhorse from the holy man   glad that no phantom vext me more returned   to whence i came the gate of arthurs wars       o brother asked ambrosiusfor in sooth   these ancient booksand they would win theeteem   only i find not there this holy grail   with miracles and marvels like to these   not all unlike which oftentime i read   who read but on my breviary with ease   till my head swims and then go forth and pass   down to the little thorpe that lies so close   and almost plastered like a martins nest   to these old wallsand mingle with our folk   and knowing every honest face of theirs   as well as ever shepherd knew his sheep   and every homely secret in their hearts   delight myself with gossip and old wives   and ills and aches and teethings lyingsin   and mirthful sayings children of the place   that have no meaning half a league away   or lulling random squabbles when they rise   chafferings and chatterings at the marketcross   rejoice small man in this small world of mine   yea even in their hens and in their eggs   o brother saving this sir galahad   came ye on none but phantoms in your quest   no man no woman                      then sir percivale   all men to one so bound by such a vow   and women were as phantoms  o my brother   why wilt thou shame me to confess to thee   how far i faltered from my quest and vow   for after i had lain so many nights   a bedmate of the snail and eft and snake   in grass and burdock i was changed to wan   and meagre and the vision had not come   and then i chanced upon a goodly town   with one great dwelling in the middle of it   thither i made and there was i disarmed   by maidens each as fair as any flower   but when they led me into hall behold   the princess of that castle was the one   brother and that one only who had ever   made my heart leap for when i moved of old   a slender page about her fathers hall   and she a slender maiden all my heart   went after her with longing  yet we twain   had never kissed a kiss or vowed a vow   and now i came upon her once again   and one had wedded her and he was dead   and all his land and wealth and state were hers   and while i tarried every day she set   a banquet richer than the day before   by me for all her longing and her will   was toward me as of old till one fair morn   i walking to and fro beside a stream   that flashed across her orchard underneath   her castlewalls she stole upon my walk   and calling me the greatest of all knights   embraced me and so kissed me the first time   and gave herself and all her wealth to me   then i remembered arthurs warning word   that most of us would follow wandering fires   and the quest faded in my heart  anon   the heads of all her people drew to me   with supplication both of knees and tongue   we have heard of thee  thou art our greatest knight   our lady says it and we well believe   wed thou our lady and rule over us   and thou shalt be as arthur in our land   o me my brother but one night my vow   burnt me within so that i rose and fled   but wailed and wept and hated mine own self   and even the holy quest and all but her   then after i was joined with galahad   cared not for her nor anything upon earth       then said the monk poor men when yule is cold   must be content to sit by little fires   and this am i so that ye care for me   ever so little yea and blest be heaven   that brought thee here to this poor house of ours   where all the brethren are so hard to warm   my cold heart with a friend  but o the pity   to find thine own first love once moreto hold   hold her a wealthy bride within thine arms   or all but hold and thencast her aside   foregoing all her sweetness like a weed   for we that want the warmth of double life   we that are plagued with dreams of something sweet   beyond all sweetness in a life so rich   ah blessed lord i speak too earthlywise   seeing i never strayed beyond the cell   but live like an old badger in his earth   with earth about him everywhere despite   all fast and penance  saw ye none beside   none of your knights                          yea so said percivale   one night my pathway swerving east i saw   the pelican on the casque of our sir bors   all in the middle of the rising moon   and toward him spurred and hailed him and he me   and each made joy of either then he asked   where is he hast thou seen himlancelotonce   said good sir bors he dashed across memad   and maddening what he rode  and when i cried   ridest thou then so hotly on a quest   so holy lancelot shouted stay me not   i have been the sluggard and i ride apace   for now there is a lion in the way   so vanished                 then sir bors had ridden on   softly and sorrowing for our lancelot   because his former madness once the talk   and scandal of our table had returned   for lancelots kith and kin so worship him   that ill to him is ill to them to bors   beyond the rest  he well had been content   not to have seen so lancelot might have seen   the holy cup of healing and indeed   being so clouded with his grief and love   small heart was his after the holy quest   if god would send the vision well  if not   the quest and he were in the hands of heaven       and then with small adventure met sir bors   rode to the lonest tract of all the realm   and found a people there among their crags   our race and blood a remnant that were left   paynim amid their circles and the stones   they pitch up straight to heaven  and their wise men   were strong in that old magic which can trace   the wandering of the stars and scoffed at him   and this high quest as at a simple thing   told him he followedalmost arthurs words   a mocking fire  what other fire than he   whereby the blood beats and the blossom blows   and the sea rolls and all the world is warmed   and when his answer chafed them the rough crowd   hearing he had a difference with their priests   seized him and bound and plunged him into a cell   of great piled stones and lying bounden there   in darkness through innumerable hours   he heard the hollowringing heavens sweep   over him till by miraclewhat else   heavy as it was a great stone slipt and fell   such as no wind could move  and through the gap   glimmered the streaming scud  then came a night   still as the day was loud and through the gap   the seven clear stars of arthurs table round   for brother so one night because they roll   through such a round in heaven we named the stars   rejoicing in ourselves and in our king   and these like bright eyes of familiar friends   in on him shone  and then to me to me   said good sir bors beyond all hopes of mine   who scarce had prayed or asked it for myself   across the seven clear starso grace to me   in colour like the fingers of a hand   before a burning taper the sweet grail   glided and past and close upon it pealed   a sharp quick thunder  afterwards a maid   who kept our holy faith among her kin   in secret entering loosed and let him go       to whom the monk  and i remember now   that pelican on the casque  sir bors it was   who spake so low and sadly at our board   and mighty reverent at our grace was he   a squareset man and honest and his eyes   an outdoor sign of all the warmth within   smiled with his lipsa smile beneath a cloud   but heaven had meant it for a sunny one   ay ay sir bors who else  but when ye reached   the city found ye all your knights returned   or was there sooth in arthurs prophecy   tell me and what said each and what the king       then answered percivale  and that can i   brother and truly since the living words   of so great men as lancelot and our king   pass not from door to door and out again   but sit within the house  o when we reached   the city our horses stumbling as they trode   on heaps of ruin hornless unicorns   cracked basilisks and splintered cockatrices   and shattered talbots which had left the stones   raw that they fell from brought us to the hall       and there sat arthur on the daisthrone   and those that had gone out upon the quest   wasted and worn and but a tithe of them   and those that had not stood before the king   who when he saw me rose and bad me hail   saying a welfare in thine eye reproves   our fear of some disastrous chance for thee   on hill or plain at sea or flooding ford   so fierce a gale made havoc here of late   among the strange devices of our kings   yea shook this newer stronger hall of ours   and from the statue merlin moulded for us   halfwrenched a golden wing but nowthe quest   this visionhast thou seen the holy cup   that joseph brought of old to glastonbury       so when i told him all thyself hast heard   ambrosius and my fresh but fixt resolve   to pass away into the quiet life   he answered not but sharply turning asked   of gawain gawain was this quest for thee       nay lord said gawain not for such as i   therefore i communed with a saintly man   who made me sure the quest was not for me   for i was much awearied of the quest   but found a silk pavilion in a field   and merry maidens in it and then this gale   tore my pavilion from the tentingpin   and blew my merry maidens all about   with all discomfort yea and but for this   my twelvemonth and a day were pleasant to me       he ceased and arthur turned to whom at first   he saw not for sir bors on entering pushed   athwart the throng to lancelot caught his hand   held it and there halfhidden by him stood   until the king espied him saying to him   hail bors if ever loyal man and true   could see it thou hast seen the grail and bors   ask me not for i may not speak of it   i saw it and the tears were in his eyes       then there remained but lancelot for the rest   spake but of sundry perils in the storm   perhaps like him of cana in holy writ   our arthur kept his best until the last   thou too my lancelot asked the king my friend   our mightiest hath this quest availed for thee       our mightiest answered lancelot with a groan   o kingand when he paused methought i spied   a dying fire of madness in his eyes   o king my friend if friend of thine i be   happier are those that welter in their sin   swine in the mud that cannot see for slime   slime of the ditch  but in me lived a sin   so strange of such a kind that all of pure   noble and knightly in me twined and clung   round that one sin until the wholesome flower   and poisonous grew together each as each   not to be plucked asunder and when thy knights   sware i sware with them only in the hope   that could i touch or see the holy grail   they might be plucked asunder  then i spake   to one most holy saint who wept and said   that save they could be plucked asunder all   my quest were but in vain to whom i vowed   that i would work according as he willed   and forth i went and while i yearned and strove   to tear the twain asunder in my heart   my madness came upon me as of old   and whipt me into waste fields far away   there was i beaten down by little men   mean knights to whom the moving of my sword   and shadow of my spear had been enow   to scare them from me once and then i came   all in my folly to the naked shore   wide flats where nothing but coarse grasses grew   but such a blast my king began to blow   so loud a blast along the shore and sea   ye could not hear the waters for the blast   though heapt in mounds and ridges all the sea   drove like a cataract and all the sand   swept like a river and the clouded heavens   were shaken with the motion and the sound   and blackening in the seafoam swayed a boat   halfswallowed in it anchored with a chain   and in my madness to myself i said   i will embark and i will lose myself   and in the great sea wash away my sin   i burst the chain i sprang into the boat   seven days i drove along the dreary deep   and with me drove the moon and all the stars   and the wind fell and on the seventh night   i heard the shingle grinding in the surge   and felt the boat shock earth and looking up   behold the enchanted towers of carbonek   a castle like a rock upon a rock   with chasmlike portals open to the sea   and steps that met the breaker there was none   stood near it but a lion on each side   that kept the entry and the moon was full   then from the boat i leapt and up the stairs   there drew my sword  with suddenflaring manes   those two great beasts rose upright like a man   each gript a shoulder and i stood between   and when i would have smitten them heard a voice   doubt not go forward if thou doubt the beasts   will tear thee piecemeal  then with violence   the sword was dashed from out my hand and fell   and up into the sounding hall i past   but nothing in the sounding hall i saw   no bench nor table painting on the wall   or shield of knight only the rounded moon   through the tall oriel on the rolling sea   but always in the quiet house i heard   clear as a lark high oer me as a lark   a sweet voice singing in the topmost tower   to the eastward  up i climbed a thousand steps   with pain  as in a dream i seemed to climb   for ever  at the last i reached a door   a light was in the crannies and i heard   glory and joy and honour to our lord   and to the holy vessel of the grail   then in my madness i essayed the door   it gave and through a stormy glare a heat   as from a seventimesheated furnace i   blasted and burnt and blinded as i was   with such a fierceness that i swooned away   o yet methought i saw the holy grail   all palled in crimson samite and around   great angels awful shapes and wings and eyes   and but for all my madness and my sin   and then my swooning i had sworn i saw   that which i saw but what i saw was veiled   and covered and this quest was not for me       so speaking and here ceasing lancelot left   the hall long silent till sir gawainnay   brother i need not tell thee foolish words   a reckless and irreverent knight was he   now boldened by the silence of his king   well i will tell thee  o king my liege he said   hath gawain failed in any quest of thine   when have i stinted stroke in foughten field   but as for thine my good friend percivale   thy holy nun and thou have driven men mad   yea made our mightiest madder than our least   but by mine eyes and by mine ears i swear   i will be deafer than the blueeyed cat   and thrice as blind as any noonday owl   to holy virgins in their ecstasies   henceforward                  deafer said the blameless king   gawain and blinder unto holy things   hope not to make thyself by idle vows   being too blind to have desire to see   but if indeed there came a sign from heaven   blessed are bors lancelot and percivale   for these have seen according to their sight   for every fiery prophet in old times   and all the sacred madness of the bard   when god made music through them could but speak   his music by the framework and the chord   and as ye saw it ye have spoken truth       naybut thou errest lancelot  never yet   could all of true and noble in knight and man   twine round one sin whatever it might be   with such a closeness but apart there grew   save that he were the swine thou spakest of   some root of knighthood and pure nobleness   whereto see thou that it may bear its flower       and spake i not too truly o my knights   was i too dark a prophet when i said   to those who went upon the holy quest   that most of them would follow wandering fires   lost in the quagmirelost to me and gone   and left me gazing at a barren board   and a lean orderscarce returned a tithe   and out of those to whom the vision came   my greatest hardly will believe he saw   another hath beheld it afar off   and leaving human wrongs to right themselves   cares but to pass into the silent life   and one hath had the vision face to face   and now his chair desires him here in vain   however they may crown him otherwhere       and some among you held that if the king   had seen the sight he would have sworn the vow   not easily seeing that the king must guard   that which he rules and is but as the hind   to whom a space of land is given to plow   who may not wander from the allotted field   before his work be done but being done   let visions of the night or of the day   come as they will and many a time they come   until this earth he walks on seems not earth   this light that strikes his eyeball is not light   this air that smites his forehead is not air   but visionyea his very hand and foot   in moments when he feels he cannot die   and knows himself no vision to himself   nor the high god a vision nor that one   who rose again  ye have seen what ye have seen       so spake the king  i knew not all he meant      pelleas and ettarre    king arthur made new knights to fill the gap   left by the holy quest and as he sat   in hall at old caerleon the high doors   were softly sundered and through these a youth   pelleas and the sweet smell of the fields   past and the sunshine came along with him       make me thy knight because i know sir king   all that belongs to knighthood and i love   such was his cry  for having heard the king   had let proclaim a tournamentthe prize   a golden circlet and a knightly sword   full fain had pelleas for his lady won   the golden circlet for himself the sword   and there were those who knew him near the king   and promised for him  and arthur made him knight       and this new knight sir pelleas of the isles   but lately come to his inheritance   and lord of many a barren isle was he   riding at noon a day or twain before   across the forest called of dean to find   caerleon and the king had felt the sun   beat like a strong knight on his helm and reeled   almost to falling from his horse but saw   near him a mound of evensloping side   whereon a hundred stately beeches grew   and here and there great hollies under them   but for a mile all round was open space   and fern and heath  and slowly pelleas drew   to that dim day then binding his good horse   to a tree cast himself down and as he lay   at random looking over the brown earth   through that greenglooming twilight of the grove   it seemed to pelleas that the fern without   burnt as a living fire of emeralds   so that his eyes were dazzled looking at it   then oer it crost the dimness of a cloud   floating and once the shadow of a bird   flying and then a fawn and his eyes closed   and since he loved all maidens but no maid   in special halfawake he whispered where   o where i love thee though i know thee not   for fair thou art and pure as guinevere   and i will make thee with my spear and sword   as famouso my queen my guinevere   for i will be thine arthur when we meet       suddenly wakened with a sound of talk   and laughter at the limit of the wood   and glancing through the hoary boles he saw   strange as to some old prophet might have seemed   a vision hovering on a sea of fire   damsels in divers colours like the cloud   of sunset and sunrise and all of them   on horses and the horses richly trapt   breasthigh in that bright line of bracken stood   and all the damsels talked confusedly   and one was pointing this way and one that   because the way was lost                             and pelleas rose   and loosed his horse and led him to the light   there she that seemed the chief among them said   in happy time behold our pilotstar   youth we are damselserrant and we ride   armed as ye see to tilt against the knights   there at caerleon but have lost our way   to right to left straight forward back again   which tell us quickly                            pelleas gazing thought   is guinevere herself so beautiful   for large her violet eyes looked and her bloom   a rosy dawn kindled in stainless heavens   and round her limbs mature in womanhood   and slender was her hand and small her shape   and but for those large eyes the haunts of scorn   she might have seemed a toy to trifle with   and pass and care no more  but while he gazed   the beauty of her flesh abashed the boy   as though it were the beauty of her soul   for as the base man judging of the good   puts his own baseness in him by default   of will and nature so did pelleas lend   all the young beauty of his own soul to hers   believing her and when she spake to him   stammered and could not make her a reply   for out of the waste islands had he come   where saving his own sisters he had known   scarce any but the women of his isles   rough wives that laughed and screamed against the gulls   makers of nets and living from the sea       then with a slow smile turned the lady round   and looked upon her people and as when   a stone is flung into some sleeping tarn   the circle widens till it lip the marge   spread the slow smile through all her company   three knights were thereamong and they too smiled   scorning him for the lady was ettarre   and she was a great lady in her land       again she said o wild and of the woods   knowest thou not the fashion of our speech   or have the heavens but given thee a fair face   lacking a tongue                      o damsel answered he   i woke from dreams and coming out of gloom   was dazzled by the sudden light and crave   pardon  but will ye to caerleon  i   go likewise  shall i lead you to the king       lead then she said and through the woods they went   and while they rode the meaning in his eyes   his tenderness of manner and chaste awe   his broken utterances and bashfulness   were all a burthen to her and in her heart   she muttered i have lighted on a fool   raw yet so stale  but since her mind was bent   on hearing after trumpet blown her name   and title queen of beauty in the lists   criedand beholding him so strong she thought   that peradventure he will fight for me   and win the circlet  therefore flattered him   being so gracious that he wellnigh deemed   his wish by hers was echoed and her knights   and all her damsels too were gracious to him   for she was a great lady                             and when they reached   caerleon ere they past to lodging she   taking his hand o the strong hand she said   see look at mine but wilt thou fight for me   and win me this fine circlet pelleas   that i may love thee                          then his helpless heart   leapt and he cried ay wilt thou if i win   ay that will i she answered and she laughed   and straitly nipt the hand and flung it from her   then glanced askew at those three knights of hers   till all her ladies laughed along with her       o happy world thought pelleas all meseems   are happy i the happiest of them all   nor slept that night for pleasure in his blood   and green woodways and eyes among the leaves   then being on the morrow knighted sware   to love one only  and as he came away   the men who met him rounded on their heels   and wondered after him because his face   shone like the countenance of a priest of old   against the flame about a sacrifice   kindled by fire from heaven  so glad was he       then arthur made vast banquets and strange knights   from the four winds came in  and each one sat   though served with choice from air land stream and sea   oft in midbanquet measuring with his eyes   his neighbours make and might  and pelleas looked   noble among the noble for he dreamed   his lady loved him and he knew himself   loved of the king  and him his newmade knight   worshipt whose lightest whisper moved him more   than all the ranged reasons of the world       then blushed and brake the morning of the jousts   and this was called the tournament of youth   for arthur loving his young knight withheld   his older and his mightier from the lists   that pelleas might obtain his ladys love   according to her promise and remain   lord of the tourney  and arthur had the jousts   down in the flat field by the shore of usk   holden  the gilded parapets were crowned   with faces and the great tower filled with eyes   up to the summit and the trumpets blew   there all day long sir pelleas kept the field   with honour  so by that strong hand of his   the sword and golden circlet were achieved       then rang the shout his lady loved  the heat   of pride and glory fired her face her eye   sparkled she caught the circlet from his lance   and there before the people crowned herself   so for the last time she was gracious to him       then at caerleon for a spaceher look   bright for all others cloudier on her knight   lingered ettarre  and seeing pelleas droop   said guinevere we marvel at thee much   o damsel wearing this unsunny face   to him who won thee glory  and she said   had ye not held your lancelot in your bower   my queen he had not won  whereat the queen   as one whose foot is bitten by an ant   glanced down upon her turned and went her way       but after when her damsels and herself   and those three knights all set their faces home   sir pelleas followed  she that saw him cried   damselsand yet i should be shamed to say it   i cannot bide sir baby  keep him back   among yourselves  would rather that we had   some rough old knight who knew the worldly way   albeit grizzlier than a bear to ride   and jest with  take him to you keep him off   and pamper him with papmeat if ye will   old milky fables of the wolf and sheep   such as the wholesome mothers tell their boys   nay should ye try him with a merry one   to find his mettle good  and if he fly us   small matter let him  this her damsels heard   and mindful of her small and cruel hand   they closing round him through the journey home   acted her hest and always from her side   restrained him with all manner of device   so that he could not come to speech with her   and when she gained her castle upsprang the bridge   down rang the grate of iron through the groove   and he was left alone in open field       these be the ways of ladies pelleas thought   to those who love them trials of our faith   yea let her prove me to the uttermost   for loyal to the uttermost am i   so made his moan and darkness falling sought   a priory not far off there lodged but rose   with morning every day and moist or dry   fullarmed upon his charger all day long   sat by the walls and no one opened to him       and this persistence turned her scorn to wrath   then calling her three knights she charged them out   and drive him from the walls  and out they came   but pelleas overthrew them as they dashed   against him one by one and these returned   but still he kept his watch beneath the wall       thereon her wrath became a hate and once   a week beyond while walking on the walls   with her three knights she pointed downward look   he haunts mei cannot breathebesieges me   down strike him put my hate into your strokes   and drive him from my walls  and down they went   and pelleas overthrew them one by one   and from the tower above him cried ettarre   bind him and bring him in                                 he heard her voice   then let the strong hand which had overthrown   her minionknights by those he overthrew   be bounden straight and so they brought him in       then when he came before ettarre the sight   of her rich beauty made him at one glance   more bondsman in his heart than in his bonds   yet with good cheer he spake behold me lady   a prisoner and the vassal of thy will   and if thou keep me in thy donjon here   content am i so that i see thy face   but once a day  for i have sworn my vows   and thou hast given thy promise and i know   that all these pains are trials of my faith   and that thyself when thou hast seen me strained   and sifted to the utmost wilt at length   yield me thy love and know me for thy knight       then she began to rail so bitterly   with all her damsels he was stricken mute   but when she mocked his vows and the great king   lighted on words  for pity of thine own self   peace lady peace  is he not thine and mine   thou fool she said i never heard his voice   but longed to break away  unbind him now   and thrust him out of doors for save he be   fool to the midmost marrow of his bones   he will return no more  and those her three   laughed and unbound and thrust him from the gate       and after this a week beyond again   she called them saying there he watches yet   there like a dog before his masters door   kicked he returns  do ye not hate him ye   ye know yourselves  how can ye bide at peace   affronted with his fulsome innocence   are ye but creatures of the board and bed   no men to strike  fall on him all at once   and if ye slay him i reck not  if ye fail   give ye the slave mine order to be bound   bind him as heretofore and bring him in   it may be ye shall slay him in his bonds       she spake and at her will they couched their spears   three against one  and gawain passing by   bound upon solitary adventure saw   low down beneath the shadow of those towers   a villainy three to one  and through his heart   the fire of honour and all noble deeds   flashed and he called i strike upon thy side   the caitiffs  nay said pelleas but forbear   he needs no aid who doth his ladys will       so gawain looking at the villainy done   forbore but in his heat and eagerness   trembled and quivered as the dog withheld   a moment from the vermin that he sees   before him shivers ere he springs and kills       and pelleas overthrew them one to three   and they rose up and bound and brought him in   then first her anger leaving pelleas burned   full on her knights in many an evil name   of craven weakling and thricebeaten hound   yet take him ye that scarce are fit to touch   far less to bind your victor and thrust him out   and let who will release him from his bonds   and if he comes againthere she brake short   and pelleas answered lady for indeed   i loved you and i deemed you beautiful   i cannot brook to see your beauty marred   through evil spite  and if ye love me not   i cannot bear to dream you so forsworn   i had liefer ye were worthy of my love   than to be loved again of youfarewell   and though ye kill my hope not yet my love   vex not yourself  ye will not see me more       while thus he spake she gazed upon the man   of princely bearing though in bonds and thought   why have i pushed him from me this man loves   if love there be  yet him i loved not  why   i deemed him fool yea so or that in him   a somethingwas it nobler than myself   seemed my reproach  he is not of my kind   he could not love me did he know me well   nay let him goand quickly  and her knights   laughed not but thrust him bounden out of door       forth sprang gawain and loosed him from his bonds   and flung them oer the walls and afterward   shaking his hands as from a lazars rag   faith of my body he said and art thou not   yea thou art he whom late our arthur made   knight of his table yea and he that won   the circlet wherefore hast thou so defamed   thy brotherhood in me and all the rest   as let these caitiffs on thee work their will       and pelleas answered o their wills are hers   for whom i won the circlet and mine hers   thus to be bounden so to see her face   marred though it be with spite and mockery now   other than when i found her in the woods   and though she hath me bounden but in spite   and all to flout me when they bring me in   let me be bounden i shall see her face   else must i die through mine unhappiness       and gawain answered kindly though in scorn   why let my lady bind me if she will   and let my lady beat me if she will   but an she send her delegate to thrall   these fighting hands of minechrist kill me then   but i will slice him handless by the wrist   and let my lady sear the stump for him   howl as he may  but hold me for your friend   come ye know nothing  here i pledge my troth   yea by the honour of the table round   i will be leal to thee and work thy work   and tame thy jailing princess to thine hand   lend me thine horse and arms and i will say   that i have slain thee  she will let me in   to hear the manner of thy fight and fall   then when i come within her counsels then   from prime to vespers will i chant thy praise   as prowest knight and truest lover more   than any have sung thee living till she long   to have thee back in lusty life again   not to be bound save by white bonds and warm   dearer than freedom  wherefore now thy horse   and armour  let me go  be comforted   give me three days to melt her fancy and hope   the third night hence will bring thee news of gold       then pelleas lent his horse and all his arms   saving the goodly sword his prize and took   gawains and said betray me not but help   art thou not he whom men call lightoflove       ay said gawain for women be so light   then bounded forward to the castle walls   and raised a bugle hanging from his neck   and winded it and that so musically   that all the old echoes hidden in the wall   rang out like hollow woods at huntingtide       up ran a score of damsels to the tower   avaunt they cried our lady loves thee not   but gawain lifting up his vizor said   gawain am i gawain of arthurs court   and i have slain this pelleas whom ye hate   behold his horse and armour  open gates   and i will make you merry                               and down they ran   her damsels crying to their lady lo   pelleas is deadhe told ushe that hath   his horse and armour  will ye let him in   he slew him  gawain gawain of the court   sir gawainthere he waits below the wall   blowing his bugle as who should say him nay       and so leave given straight on through open door   rode gawain whom she greeted courteously   dead is it so she asked  ay ay said he   and oft in dying cried upon your name   pity on him she answered a good knight   but never let me bide one hour at peace   ay thought gawain and you be fair enow   but i to your dead man have given my troth   that whom ye loathe him will i make you love       so those three days aimless about the land   lost in a doubt pelleas wandering   waited until the third night brought a moon   with promise of large light on woods and ways       hot was the night and silent but a sound   of gawain ever coming and this lay   which pelleas had heard sung before the queen   and seen her sadden listeningvext his heart   and marred his resta worm within the rose       a rose but one none other rose had i   a rose one rose and this was wondrous fair   one rose a rose that gladdened earth and sky   one rose my rose that sweetened all mine air   i cared not for the thorns the thorns were there       one rose a rose to gather by and by   one rose a rose to gather and to wear   no rose but onewhat other rose had i   one rose my rose a rose that will not die   he dies who loves itif the worm be there       this tender rhyme and evermore the doubt   why lingers gawain with his golden news   so shook him that he could not rest but rode   ere midnight to her walls and bound his horse   hard by the gates  wide open were the gates   and no watch kept and in through these he past   and heard but his own steps and his own heart   beating for nothing moved but his own self   and his own shadow  then he crost the court   and spied not any light in hall or bower   but saw the postern portal also wide   yawning and up a slope of garden all   of roses white and red and brambles mixt   and overgrowing them went on and found   here too all hushed below the mellow moon   save that one rivulet from a tiny cave   came lightening downward and so spilt itself   among the roses and was lost again       then was he ware of three pavilions reared   above the bushes gildenpeakt  in one   red after revel droned her lurdane knights   slumbering and their three squires across their feet   in one their malice on the placid lip   frozen by sweet sleep four of her damsels lay   and in the third the circlet of the jousts   bound on her brow were gawain and ettarre       back as a hand that pushes through the leaf   to find a nest and feels a snake he drew   back as a coward slinks from what he fears   to cope with or a traitor proven or hound   beaten did pelleas in an utter shame   creep with his shadow through the court again   fingering at his swordhandle until he stood   there on the castlebridge once more and thought   i will go back and slay them where they lie       and so went back and seeing them yet in sleep   said ye that so dishallow the holy sleep   your sleep is death and drew the sword and thought   what slay a sleeping knight the king hath bound   and sworn me to this brotherhood again   alas that ever a knight should be so false   then turned and so returned and groaning laid   the naked sword athwart their naked throats   there left it and them sleeping and she lay   the circlet of her tourney round her brows   and the sword of the tourney across her throat       and forth he past and mounting on his horse   stared at her towers that larger than themselves   in their own darkness thronged into the moon   then crushed the saddle with his thighs and clenched   his hands and maddened with himself and moaned       would they have risen against me in their blood   at the last day  i might have answered them   even before high god  o towers so strong   huge solid would that even while i gaze   the crack of earthquake shivering to your base   split you and hell burst up your harlot roofs   bellowing and charred you through and through within   black as the harlots hearthollow as a skull   let the fierce east scream through your eyeletholes   and whirl the dust of harlots round and round   in dung and nettles hiss snakei saw him there   let the fox bark let the wolf yell  who yells   here in the still sweet summer night but i   i the poor pelleas whom she called her fool   fool beasthe she or i myself most fool   beast too as lacking human witdisgraced   dishonoured all for trial of true love   lovewe be all alike  only the king   hath made us fools and liars  o noble vows   o great and sane and simple race of brutes   that own no lust because they have no law   for why should i have loved her to my shame   i loathe her as i loved her to my shame   i never loved her i but lusted for her   away          he dashed the rowel into his horse   and bounded forth and vanished through the night       then she that felt the cold touch on her throat   awaking knew the sword and turned herself   to gawain  liar for thou hast not slain   this pelleas here he stood and might have slain   me and thyself  and he that tells the tale   says that her everveering fancy turned   to pelleas as the one true knight on earth   and only lover and through her love her life   wasted and pined desiring him in vain       but he by wild and way for half the night   and over hard and soft striking the sod   from out the soft the spark from off the hard   rode till the star above the wakening sun   beside that tower where percivale was cowled   glanced from the rosy forehead of the dawn   for so the words were flashed into his heart   he knew not whence or wherefore  o sweet star   pure on the virgin forehead of the dawn   and there he would have wept but felt his eyes   harder and drier than a fountain bed   in summer  thither came the village girls   and lingered talking and they come no more   till the sweet heavens have filled it from the heights   again with living waters in the change   of seasons  hard his eyes harder his heart   seemed but so weary were his limbs that he   gasping of arthurs hall am i but here   here let me rest and die cast himself down   and gulfed his griefs in inmost sleep so lay   till shaken by a dream that gawain fired   the hall of merlin and the morning star   reeled in the smoke brake into flame and fell       he woke and being ware of some one nigh   sent hands upon him as to tear him crying   false and i held thee pure as guinevere       but percivale stood near him and replied   am i but false as guinevere is pure   or art thou mazed with dreams or being one   of our freespoken table hast not heard   that lancelotthere he checked himself and paused       then fared it with sir pelleas as with one   who gets a wound in battle and the sword   that made it plunges through the wound again   and pricks it deeper  and he shrank and wailed   is the queen false and percivale was mute   have any of our round table held their vows   and percivale made answer not a word   is the king true  the king said percivale   why then let men couple at once with wolves   what art thou mad                        but pelleas leaping up   ran through the doors and vaulted on his horse   and fled  small pity upon his horse had he   or on himself or any and when he met   a cripple one that held a hand for alms   hunched as he was and like an old dwarfelm   that turns its back upon the salt blast the boy   paused not but overrode him shouting false   and false with gawain and so left him bruised   and battered and fled on and hill and wood   went ever streaming by him till the gloom   that follows on the turning of the world   darkened the common path  he twitched the reins   and made his beast that better knew it swerve   now off it and now on but when he saw   high up in heaven the hall that merlin built   blackening against the deadgreen stripes of even   black nest of rats he groaned ye build too high       not long thereafter from the city gates   issued sir lancelot riding airily   warm with a gracious parting from the queen   peace at his heart and gazing at a star   and marvelling what it was  on whom the boy   across the silent seeded meadowgrass   borne clashed  and lancelot saying what name hast thou   that ridest here so blindly and so hard   no name no name he shouted a scourge am i   to lash the treasons of the table round   yea but thy name  i have many names he cried   i am wrath and shame and hate and evil fame   and like a poisonous wind i pass to blast   and blaze the crime of lancelot and the queen   first over me said lancelot shalt thou pass   fight therefore yelled the youth and either knight   drew back a space and when they closed at once   the weary steed of pelleas floundering flung   his rider who called out from the dark field   thou art as false as hell  slay me  i have no sword   then lancelot yea between thy lipsand sharp   but here i will disedge it by thy death   slay then he shrieked my will is to be slain   and lancelot with his heel upon the fallen   rolling his eyes a moment stood then spake   rise weakling i am lancelot say thy say       and lancelot slowly rode his warhorse back   to camelot and sir pelleas in brief while   caught his unbroken limbs from the dark field   and followed to the city  it chanced that both   brake into hall together worn and pale   there with her knights and dames was guinevere   full wonderingly she gazed on lancelot   so soon returned and then on pelleas him   who had not greeted her but cast himself   down on a bench hardbreathing  have ye fought   she asked of lancelot  ay my queen he said   and hast thou overthrown him  ay my queen   then she turning to pelleas o young knight   hath the great heart of knighthood in thee failed   so far thou canst not bide unfrowardly   a fall from him  then for he answered not   or hast thou other griefs  if i the queen   may help them loose thy tongue and let me know   but pelleas lifted up an eye so fierce   she quailed and he hissing i have no sword   sprang from the door into the dark  the queen   looked hard upon her lover he on her   and each foresaw the dolorous day to be   and all talk died as in a grove all song   beneath the shadow of some bird of prey   then a long silence came upon the hall   and modred thought the time is hard at hand      the last tournament    dagonet the fool whom gawain in his mood   had made mockknight of arthurs table round   at camelot high above the yellowing woods   danced like a withered leaf before the hall   and toward him from the hall with harp in hand   and from the crown thereof a carcanet   of ruby swaying to and fro the prize   of tristram in the jousts of yesterday   came tristram saying why skip ye so sir fool       for arthur and sir lancelot riding once   far down beneath a winding wall of rock   heard a child wail  a stump of oak halfdead   from roots like some black coil of carven snakes   clutched at the crag and started through mid air   bearing an eagles nest  and through the tree   rushed ever a rainy wind and through the wind   pierced ever a childs cry  and crag and tree   scaling sir lancelot from the perilous nest   this ruby necklace thrice around her neck   and all unscarred from beak or talon brought   a maiden babe which arthur pitying took   then gave it to his queen to rear  the queen   but coldly acquiescing in her white arms   received and after loved it tenderly   and named it nestling so forgot herself   a moment and her cares till that young life   being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold   past from her and in time the carcanet   vext her with plaintive memories of the child   so she delivering it to arthur said   take thou the jewels of this dead innocence   and make them an thou wilt a tourneyprize       to whom the king peace to thine eagleborne   dead nestling and this honour after death   following thy will but o my queen i muse   why ye not wear on arm or neck or zone   those diamonds that i rescued from the tarn   and lancelot won methought for thee to wear       would rather you had let them fall she cried   plunge and be lostillfated as they were   a bitterness to meye look amazed   not knowing they were lost as soon as given   slid from my hands when i was leaning out   above the riverthat unhappy child   past in her barge  but rosier luck will go   with these rich jewels seeing that they came   not from the skeleton of a brotherslayer   but the sweet body of a maiden babe   perchancewho knowsthe purest of thy knights   may win them for the purest of my maids       she ended and the cry of a great jousts   with trumpetblowings ran on all the ways   from camelot in among the faded fields   to furthest towers and everywhere the knights   armed for a day of glory before the king       but on the hither side of that loud morn   into the hall staggered his visage ribbed   from ear to ear with dogwhipweals his nose   bridgebroken one eye out and one hand off   and one with shattered fingers dangling lame   a churl to whom indignantly the king       my churl for whom christ died what evil beast   hath drawn his claws athwart thy face or fiend   man was it who marred heavens image in thee thus       then sputtering through the hedge of splintered teeth   yet strangers to the tongue and with blunt stump   pitchblackened sawing the air said the maimed churl       he took them and he drave them to his tower   some hold he was a tableknight of thine   a hundred goodly onesthe red knight he   lord i was tending swine and the red knight   brake in upon me and drave them to his tower   and when i called upon thy name as one   that doest right by gentle and by churl   maimed me and mauled and would outright have slain   save that he sware me to a message saying   tell thou the king and all his liars that i   have founded my round table in the north   and whatsoever his own knights have sworn   my knights have sworn the counter to itand say   my tower is full of harlots like his court   but mine are worthier seeing they profess   to be none other than themselvesand say   my knights are all adulterers like his own   but mine are truer seeing they profess   to be none other and say his hour is come   the heathen are upon him his long lance   broken and his excalibur a straw       then arthur turned to kay the seneschal   take thou my churl and tend him curiously   like a kings heir till all his hurts be whole   the heathenbut that everclimbing wave   hurled back again so often in empty foam   hath lain for years at restand renegades   thieves bandits leavings of confusion whom   the wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere   friends through your manhood and your fealtynow   make their last head like satan in the north   my younger knights newmade in whom your flower   waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds   move with me toward their quelling which achieved   the loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore   but thou sir lancelot sitting in my place   enchaired tomorrow arbitrate the field   for wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it   only to yield my queen her own again   speak lancelot thou art silent  is it well       thereto sir lancelot answered it is well   yet better if the king abide and leave   the leading of his younger knights to me   else for the king has willed it it is well       then arthur rose and lancelot followed him   and while they stood without the doors the king   turned to him saying is it then so well   or mine the blame that oft i seem as he   of whom was written a sound is in his ears   the foot that loiters bidden gothe glance   that only seems halfloyal to command   a manner somewhat fallen from reverence   or have i dreamed the bearing of our knights   tells of a manhood ever less and lower   or whence the fear lest this my realm upreared   by noble deeds at one with noble vows   from flat confusion and brute violences   reel back into the beast and be no more       he spoke and taking all his younger knights   down the slope city rode and sharply turned   north by the gate  in her high bower the queen   working a tapestry lifted up her head   watched her lord pass and knew not that she sighed   then ran across her memory the strange rhyme   of bygone merlin where is he who knows   from the great deep to the great deep he goes       but when the morning of a tournament   by these in earnest those in mockery called   the tournament of the dead innocence   brake with a wet wind blowing lancelot   round whose sick head all night like birds of prey   the words of arthur flying shrieked arose   and down a streetway hung with folds of pure   white samite and by fountains running wine   where children sat in white with cups of gold   moved to the lists and there with slow sad steps   ascending filled his doubledragoned chair       he glanced and saw the stately galleries   dame damsel each through worship of their queen   whiterobed in honour of the stainless child   and some with scattered jewels like a bank   of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire   he looked but once and vailed his eyes again       the sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream   to ears but halfawaked then one low roll   of autumn thunder and the jousts began   and ever the wind blew and yellowing leaf   and gloom and gleam and shower and shorn plume   went down it  sighing weariedly as one   who sits and gazes on a faded fire   when all the goodlier guests are past away   sat their great umpire looking oer the lists   he saw the laws that ruled the tournament   broken but spake not once a knight cast down   before his throne of arbitration cursed   the dead babe and the follies of the king   and once the laces of a helmet cracked   and showed him like a vermin in its hole   modred a narrow face  anon he heard   the voice that billowed round the barriers roar   an oceansounding welcome to one knight   but newlyentered taller than the rest   and armoured all in forest green whereon   there tript a hundred tiny silver deer   and wearing but a hollyspray for crest   with everscattering berries and on shield   a spear a harp a bugletristramlate   from overseas in brittany returned   and marriage with a princess of that realm   isolt the whitesir tristram of the woods   whom lancelot knew had held sometime with pain   his own against him and now yearned to shake   the burthen off his heart in one full shock   with tristram even to death  his strong hands gript   and dinted the gilt dragons right and left   until he groaned for wrathso many of those   that ware their ladies colours on the casque   drew from before sir tristram to the bounds   and there with gibes and flickering mockeries   stood while he muttered craven crests  o shame   what faith have these in whom they sware to love   the glory of our round table is no more       so tristram won and lancelot gave the gems   not speaking other word than hast thou won   art thou the purest brother  see the hand   wherewith thou takest this is red to whom   tristram half plagued by lancelots languorous mood   made answer ay but wherefore toss me this   like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound   lest be thy fair queens fantasy  strength of heart   and might of limb but mainly use and skill   are winners in this pastime of our king   my handbelike the lance hath dript upon it   no blood of mine i trow but o chief knight   right arm of arthur in the battlefield   great brother thou nor i have made the world   be happy in thy fair queen as i in mine       and tristram round the gallery made his horse   caracole then bowed his homage bluntly saying   fair damsels each to him who worships each   sole queen of beauty and of love behold   this day my queen of beauty is not here   and most of these were mute some angered one   murmuring all courtesy is dead and one   the glory of our round table is no more       then fell thick rain plume droopt and mantle clung   and pettish cries awoke and the wan day   went glooming down in wet and weariness   but under her black brows a swarthy one   laughed shrilly crying praise the patient saints   our one white day of innocence hath past   though somewhat draggled at the skirt  so be it   the snowdrop only flowering through the year   would make the world as blank as wintertide   comelet us gladden their sad eyes our queens   and lancelots at this nights solemnity   with all the kindlier colours of the field       so dame and damsel glittered at the feast   variously gay  for he that tells the tale   likened them saying as when an hour of cold   falls on the mountain in midsummer snows   and all the purple slopes of mountain flowers   pass under white till the warm hour returns   with veer of wind and all are flowers again   so dame and damsel cast the simple white   and glowing in all colours the live grass   rosecampion bluebell kingcup poppy glanced   about the revels and with mirth so loud   beyond all use that halfamazed the queen   and wroth at tristram and the lawless jousts   brake up their sports then slowly to her bower   parted and in her bosom pain was lord       and little dagonet on the morrow morn   high over all the yellowing autumntide   danced like a withered leaf before the hall   then tristram saying why skip ye so sir fool   wheeled round on either heel dagonet replied   belike for lack of wiser company   or being fool and seeing too much wit   makes the world rotten why belike i skip   to know myself the wisest knight of all   ay fool said tristram but tis eating dry   to dance without a catch a roundelay   to dance to  then he twangled on his harp   and while he twangled little dagonet stood   quiet as any watersodden log   stayed in the wandering warble of a brook   but when the twangling ended skipt again   and being asked why skipt ye not sir fool   made answer i had liefer twenty years   skip to the broken music of my brains   than any broken music thou canst make   then tristram waiting for the quip to come   good now what music have i broken fool   and little dagonet skipping arthur the kings   for when thou playest that air with queen isolt   thou makest broken music with thy bride   her daintier namesake down in brittany   and so thou breakest arthurs music too   save for that broken music in thy brains   sir fool said tristram i would break thy head   fool i came too late the heathen wars were oer   the life had flown we sware but by the shell   i am but a fool to reason with a fool   come thou art crabbed and sour  but lean me down   sir dagonet one of thy long asses ears   and harken if my music be not true       free lovefree fieldwe love but while we may   the woods are hushed their music is no more   the leaf is dead the yearning past away   new leaf new lifethe days of frost are oer   new life new love to suit the newer day   new loves are sweet as those that went before   free lovefree fieldwe love but while we may       ye might have moved slowmeasure to my tune   not stood stockstill  i made it in the woods   and heard it ring as true as tested gold       but dagonet with one foot poised in his hand   friend did ye mark that fountain yesterday   made to run winebut this had run itself   all out like a long life to a sour end   and them that round it sat with golden cups   to hand the wine to whosoever came   the twelve small damosels white as innocence   in honour of poor innocence the babe   who left the gems which innocence the queen   lent to the king and innocence the king   gave for a prizeand one of those white slips   handed her cup and piped the pretty one   drink drink sir fool and thereupon i drank   spatpishthe cup was gold the draught was mud       and tristram was it muddier than thy gibes   is all the laughter gone dead out of thee   not marking how the knighthood mock thee fool   fear god  honour the kinghis one true knight   sole follower of the vowsfor here be they   who knew thee swine enow before i came   smuttier than blasted grain  but when the king   had made thee fool thy vanity so shot up   it frighted all free fool from out thy heart   which left thee less than fool and less than swine   a naked aughtyet swine i hold thee still   for i have flung thee pearls and find thee swine       and little dagonet mincing with his feet   knight an ye fling those rubies round my neck   in lieu of hers ill hold thou hast some touch   of music since i care not for thy pearls   swine  i have wallowed i have washedthe world   is flesh and shadowi have had my day   the dirty nurse experience in her kind   hath fouled mean i wallowed then i washed   i have had my day and my philosophies   and thank the lord i am king arthurs fool   swine say ye swine goats asses rams and geese   trooped round a paynim harper once who thrummed   on such a wire as musically as thou   some such fine songbut never a kings fool       and tristram then were swine goats asses geese   the wiser fools seeing thy paynim bard   had such a mastery of his mystery   that he could harp his wife up out of hell       then dagonet turning on the ball of his foot   and whither harpst thou thine down and thyself   down and two more  a helpful harper thou   that harpest downward  dost thou know the star   we call the harp of arthur up in heaven       and tristram ay sir fool for when our king   was victor wellnigh day by day the knights   glorying in each new glory set his name   high on all hills and in the signs of heaven       and dagonet answered ay and when the land   was freed and the queen false ye set yourself   to babble about him all to show your wit   and whether he were king by courtesy   or king by rightand so went harping down   the black kings highway got so far and grew   so witty that ye played at ducks and drakes   with arthurs vows on the great lake of fire   tuwhoo do ye see it do ye see the star       nay fool said tristram not in open day   and dagonet nay nor will  i see it and hear   it makes a silent music up in heaven   and i and arthur and the angels hear   and then we skip  lo fool he said ye talk   fools treason  is the king thy brother fool   then little dagonet clapt his hands and shrilled   ay ay my brother fool the king of fools   conceits himself as god that he can make   figs out of thistles silk from bristles milk   from burning spurge honey from hornetcombs   and men from beastslong live the king of fools       and down the city dagonet danced away   but through the slowlymellowing avenues   and solitary passes of the wood   rode tristram toward lyonnesse and the west   before him fled the face of queen isolt   with rubycircled neck but evermore   past as a rustle or twitter in the wood   made dull his inner keen his outer eye   for all that walked or crept or perched or flew   anon the face as when a gust hath blown   unruffling waters recollect the shape   of one that in them sees himself returned   but at the slot or fewmets of a deer   or even a fallen feather vanished again       so on for all that day from lawn to lawn   through many a leaguelong bower he rode  at length   a lodge of intertwisted beechenboughs   furzecrammed and brackenrooft the which himself   built for a summer day with queen isolt   against a shower dark in the golden grove   appearing sent his fancy back to where   she lived a moon in that low lodge with him   till mark her lord had past the cornish king   with six or seven when tristram was away   and snatched her thence yet dreading worse than shame   her warrior tristram spake not any word   but bode his hour devising wretchedness       and now that desert lodge to tristram lookt   so sweet that halting in he past and sank   down on a drift of foliage randomblown   but could not rest for musing how to smoothe   and sleek his marriage over to the queen   perchance in lone tintagil far from all   the tonguesters of the court she had not heard   but then what folly had sent him overseas   after she left him lonely here a name   was it the name of one in brittany   isolt the daughter of the king  isolt   of the white hands they called her  the sweet name   allured him first and then the maid herself   who served him well with those white hands of hers   and loved him well until himself had thought   he loved her also wedded easily   but left her all as easily and returned   the blackblue irish hair and irish eyes   had drawn him homewhat marvel then he laid   his brows upon the drifted leaf and dreamed       he seemed to pace the strand of brittany   between isolt of britain and his bride   and showed them both the rubychain and both   began to struggle for it till his queen   graspt it so hard that all her hand was red   then cried the breton look her hand is red   these be no rubies this is frozen blood   and melts within her handher hand is hot   with ill desires but this i gave thee look   is all as cool and white as any flower   followed a rush of eagles wings and then   a whimpering of the spirit of the child   because the twain had spoiled her carcanet       he dreamed but arthur with a hundred spears   rode far till oer the illimitable reed   and many a glancing plash and sallowy isle   the widewinged sunset of the misty marsh   glared on a huge machicolated tower   that stood with open doors whereout was rolled   a roar of riot as from men secure   amid their marshes ruffians at their ease   among their harlotbrides an evil song   lo there said one of arthurs youth for there   high on a grim dead tree before the tower   a goodly brother of the table round   swung by the neck  and on the boughs a shield   showing a shower of blood in a field noir   and therebeside a horn inflamed the knights   at that dishonour done the gilded spur   till each would clash the shield and blow the horn   but arthur waved them back  alone he rode   then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn   that sent the face of all the marsh aloft   an ever upwardrushing storm and cloud   of shriek and plume the red knight heard and all   even to tipmost lance and topmost helm   in bloodred armour sallying howled to the king       the teeth of hell flay bare and gnash thee flat   lo art thou not that eunuchhearted king   who fain had clipt free manhood from the world   the womanworshipper  yea gods curse and i   slain was the brother of my paramour   by a knight of thine and i that heard her whine   and snivel being eunuchhearted too   sware by the scorpionworm that twists in hell   and stings itself to everlasting death   to hang whatever knight of thine i fought   and tumbled  art thou king look to thy life       he ended  arthur knew the voice the face   wellnigh was helmethidden and the name   went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind   and arthur deigned not use of word or sword   but let the drunkard as he stretched from horse   to strike him overbalancing his bulk   down from the causeway heavily to the swamp   fall as the crest of some slowarching wave   heard in dead night along that tableshore   drops flat and after the great waters break   whitening for half a league and thin themselves   far over sands marbled with moon and cloud   from less and less to nothing thus he fell   headheavy then the knights who watched him roared   and shouted and leapt down upon the fallen   there trampled out his face from being known   and sank his head in mire and slimed themselves   nor heard the king for their own cries but sprang   through open doors and swording right and left   men women on their sodden faces hurled   the tables over and the wines and slew   till all the rafters rang with womanyells   and all the pavement streamed with massacre   then echoing yell with yell they fired the tower   which half that autumn night like the live north   redpulsing up through alioth and alcor   made all above it and a hundred meres   about it as the water moab saw   came round by the east and out beyond them flushed   the long low dune and lazyplunging sea       so all the ways were safe from shore to shore   but in the heart of arthur pain was lord       then out of tristram waking the red dream   fled with a shout and that low lodge returned   midforest and the wind among the boughs   he whistled his good warhorse left to graze   among the forest greens vaulted upon him   and rode beneath an evershowering leaf   till one lone woman weeping near a cross   stayed him  why weep ye  lord she said my man   hath left me or is dead whereon he thought   what if she hate me now i would not this   what if she love me still i would not that   i know not what i wouldbut said to her   yet weep not thou lest if thy mate return   he find thy favour changed and love thee not   then pressing day by day through lyonnesse   last in a roky hollow belling heard   the hounds of mark and felt the goodly hounds   yelp at his heart but turning past and gained   tintagil half in sea and high on land   a crown of towers                      down in a casement sat   a low seasunset glorying round her hair   and glossythroated grace isolt the queen   and when she heard the feet of tristram grind   the spiring stone that scaled about her tower   flushed started met him at the doors and there   belted his body with her white embrace   crying aloud not marknot mark my soul   the footstep fluttered me at first  not he   catlike through his own castle steals my mark   but warriorwise thou stridest through his halls   who hates thee as i himeven to the death   my soul i felt my hatred for my mark   quicken within me and knew that thou wert nigh   to whom sir tristram smiling i am here   let be thy mark seeing he is not thine       and drawing somewhat backward she replied   can he be wronged who is not even his own   but save for dread of thee had beaten me   scratched bitten blinded marred me somehowmark   what rights are his that dare not strike for them   not lift a handnot though he found me thus   but harken have ye met him hence he went   today for three days huntingas he said   and so returns belike within an hour   marks way my soulbut eat not thou with mark   because he hates thee even more than fears   nor drink  and when thou passest any wood   close vizor lest an arrow from the bush   should leave me all alone with mark and hell   my god the measure of my hate for mark   is as the measure of my love for thee       so plucked one way by hate and one by love   drained of her force again she sat and spake   to tristram as he knelt before her saying   o hunter and o blower of the horn   harper and thou hast been a rover too   for ere i mated with my shambling king   ye twain had fallen out about the bride   of onehis name is out of methe prize   if prize she werewhat marvelshe could see   thine friend and ever since my craven seeks   to wreck thee villainously  but o sir knight   what dame or damsel have ye kneeled to last       and tristram last to my queen paramount   here now to my queen paramount of love   and lovelinessay lovelier than when first   her light feet fell on our rough lyonnesse   sailing from ireland                          softly laughed isolt   flatter me not for hath not our great queen   my dole of beauty trebled and he said   her beauty is her beauty and thine thine   and thine is more to mesoft gracious kind   save when thy mark is kindled on thy lips   most gracious but she haughty even to him   lancelot for i have seen him wan enow   to make one doubt if ever the great queen   have yielded him her love                               to whom isolt   ah then false hunter and false harper thou   who brakest through the scruple of my bond   calling me thy white hind and saying to me   that guinevere had sinned against the highest   and imisyoked with such a want of man   that i could hardly sin against the lowest       he answered o my soul be comforted   if this be sweet to sin in leadingstrings   if here be comfort and if ours be sin   crowned warrant had we for the crowning sin   that made us happy  but how ye greet mefear   and fault and doubtno word of that fond tale   thy deep heartyearnings thy sweet memories   of tristram in that year he was away       and saddening on the sudden spake isolt   i had forgotten all in my strong joy   to see theeyearningsay for hour by hour   here in the neverended afternoon   o sweeter than all memories of thee   deeper than any yearnings after thee   seemed those farrolling westwardsmiling seas   watched from this tower  isolt of britain dashed   before isolt of brittany on the strand   would that have chilled her bridekiss  wedded her   fought in her fathers battles wounded there   the king was all fulfilled with gratefulness   and she my namesake of the hands that healed   thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress   wellcan i wish her any huger wrong   than having known thee her too hast thou left   to pine and waste in those sweet memories   o were i not my marks by whom all men   are noble i should hate thee more than love       and tristram fondling her light hands replied   grace queen for being loved  she loved me well   did i love her the name at least i loved   isolti fought his battles for isolt   the night was dark the true star set  isolt   the name was ruler of the darkisolt   care not for her patient and prayerful meek   paleblooded she will yield herself to god       and isolt answered yea and why not i   mine is the larger need who am not meek   paleblooded prayerful  let me tell thee now   here one black mute midsummer night i sat   lonely but musing on thee wondering where   murmuring a light song i had heard thee sing   and once or twice i spake thy name aloud   then flashed a levinbrand and near me stood   in fuming sulphur blue and green a fiend   marks way to steal behind one in the dark   for there was mark  he has wedded her he said   not said but hissed it  then this crown of towers   so shook to such a roar of all the sky   that here in utter dark i swooned away   and woke again in utter dark and cried   i will flee hence and give myself to god   and thou wert lying in thy new lemans arms       then tristram ever dallying with her hand   may god be with thee sweet when old and gray   and past desire a saying that angered her   may god be with thee sweet when thou art old   and sweet no more to me  i need him now   for when had lancelot uttered aught so gross   even to the swineherds malkin in the mast   the greater man the greater courtesy   far other was the tristram arthurs knight   but thou through ever harrying thy wild beasts   save that to touch a harp tilt with a lance   becomes thee wellart grown wild beast thyself   how darest thou if lover push me even   in fancy from thy side and set me far   in the gray distance half a life away   her to be loved no more  unsay it unswear   flatter me rather seeing me so weak   broken with mark and hate and solitude   thy marriage and mine own that i should suck   lies like sweet wines  lie to me  i believe   will ye not lie not swear as there ye kneel   and solemnly as when ye sware to him   the man of men our kingmy god the power   was once in vows when men believed the king   they lied not then who sware and through their vows   the king prevailing made his realmi say   swear to me thou wilt love me even when old   grayhaired and past desire and in despair       then tristram pacing moodily up and down   vows did you keep the vow you made to mark   more than i mine  lied say ye  nay but learnt   the vow that binds too strictly snaps itself   my knighthood taught me thisay being snapt   we run more counter to the soul thereof   than had we never sworn  i swear no more   i swore to the great king and am forsworn   for onceeven to the heighti honoured him   man is he man at all methought when first   i rode from our rough lyonnesse and beheld   that victor of the pagan throned in hall   his hair a sun that rayed from off a brow   like hillsnow high in heaven the steelblue eyes   the golden beard that clothed his lips with light   moreover that weird legend of his birth   with merlins mystic babble about his end   amazed me then his foot was on a stool   shaped as a dragon he seemed to me no man   but michael trampling satan so i sware   being amazed  but this went by the vows   o aythe wholesome madness of an hour   they served their use their time for every knight   believed himself a greater than himself   and every follower eyed him as a god   till he being lifted up beyond himself   did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done   and so the realm was made but then their vows   first mainly through that sullying of our queen   began to gall the knighthood asking whence   had arthur right to bind them to himself   dropt down from heaven washed up from out the deep   they failed to trace him through the flesh and blood   of our old kings  whence then a doubtful lord   to bind them by inviolable vows   which flesh and blood perforce would violate   for feel this arm of minethe tide within   red with free chase and heatherscented air   pulsing full man can arthur make me pure   as any maiden child lock up my tongue   from uttering freely what i freely hear   bind me to one  the wide world laughs at it   and worldling of the world am i and know   the ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour   woos his own end we are not angels here   nor shall be  vowsi am woodman of the woods   and hear the garnetheaded yaffingale   mock them  my soul we love but while we may   and therefore is my love so large for thee   seeing it is not bounded save by love       here ending he moved toward her and she said   good  an i turned away my love for thee   to some one thrice as courteous as thyself   for courtesy wins woman all as well   as valour may but he that closes both   is perfect he is lancelottaller indeed   rosier and comelier thoubut say i loved   this knightliest of all knights and cast thee back   thine own small saw we love but while we may   well then what answer                            he that while she spake   mindful of what he brought to adorn her with   the jewels had let one finger lightly touch   the warm white apple of her throat replied   press this a little closer sweet until   come i am hungered and halfangeredmeat   wine wineand i will love thee to the death   and out beyond into the dream to come       so then when both were brought to full accord   she rose and set before him all he willed   and after these had comforted the blood   with meats and wines and satiated their hearts   now talking of their woodland paradise   the deer the dews the fern the founts the lawns   now mocking at the much ungainliness   and craven shifts and long crane legs of mark   then tristram laughing caught the harp and sang       ay ay o aythe winds that bend the brier   a star in heaven a star within the mere   ay ay o aya star was my desire   and one was far apart and one was near   ay ay o aythe winds that bow the grass   and one was water and one star was fire   and one will ever shine and one will pass   ay ay o aythe winds that move the mere       then in the lights last glimmer tristram showed   and swung the ruby carcanet  she cried   the collar of some order which our king   hath newly founded all for thee my soul   for thee to yield thee grace beyond thy peers       not so my queen he said but the red fruit   grown on a magic oaktree in midheaven   and won by tristram as a tourneyprize   and hither brought by tristram for his last   loveoffering and peaceoffering unto thee       he spoke he turned then flinging round her neck   claspt it and cried thine order o my queen   but while he bowed to kiss the jewelled throat   out of the dark just as the lips had touched   behind him rose a shadow and a shriek   marks way said mark and clove him through the brain       that night came arthur home and while he climbed   all in a deathdumb autumndripping gloom   the stairway to the hall and looked and saw   the great queens bower was darkabout his feet   a voice clung sobbing till he questioned it   what art thou and the voice about his feet   sent up an answer sobbing i am thy fool   and i shall never make thee smile again      guinevere    queen guinevere had fled the court and sat   there in the holy house at almesbury   weeping none with her save a little maid   a novice  one low light betwixt them burned   blurred by the creeping mist for all abroad   beneath a moon unseen albeit at full   the white mist like a facecloth to the face   clung to the dead earth and the land was still       for hither had she fled her cause of flight   sir modred he that like a subtle beast   lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne   ready to spring waiting a chance  for this   he chilled the popular praises of the king   with silent smiles of slow disparagement   and tampered with the lords of the white horse   heathen the brood by hengist left and sought   to make disruption in the table round   of arthur and to splinter it into feuds   serving his traitorous end and all his aims   were sharpened by strong hate for lancelot       for thus it chanced one morn when all the court   greensuited but with plumes that mocked the may   had been their wont amaying and returned   that modred still in green all ear and eye   climbed to the high top of the gardenwall   to spy some secret scandal if he might   and saw the queen who sat betwixt her best   enid and lissome vivien of her court   the wiliest and the worst and more than this   he saw not for sir lancelot passing by   spied where he couched and as the gardeners hand   picks from the colewort a green caterpillar   so from the high wall and the flowering grove   of grasses lancelot plucked him by the heel   and cast him as a worm upon the way   but when he knew the prince though marred with dust   he reverencing kings blood in a bad man   made such excuses as he might and these   full knightly without scorn for in those days   no knight of arthurs noblest dealt in scorn   but if a man were halt or hunched in him   by those whom god had made fulllimbed and tall   scorn was allowed as part of his defect   and he was answered softly by the king   and all his table  so sir lancelot holp   to raise the prince who rising twice or thrice   full sharply smote his knees and smiled and went   but ever after the small violence done   rankled in him and ruffled all his heart   as the sharp wind that ruffles all day long   a little bitter pool about a stone   on the bare coast                      but when sir lancelot told   this matter to the queen at first she laughed   lightly to think of modreds dusty fall   then shuddered as the village wife who cries   i shudder some one steps across my grave   then laughed again but faintlier for indeed   she halfforesaw that he the subtle beast   would track her guilt until he found and hers   would be for evermore a name of scorn   henceforward rarely could she front in hall   or elsewhere modreds narrow foxy face   hearthiding smile and gray persistent eye   henceforward too the powers that tend the soul   to help it from the death that cannot die   and save it even in extremes began   to vex and plague her  many a time for hours   beside the placid breathings of the king   in the dead night grim faces came and went   before her or a vague spiritual fear   like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors   heard by the watcher in a haunted house   that keeps the rust of murder on the walls   held her awake  or if she slept she dreamed   an awful dream for then she seemed to stand   on some vast plain before a setting sun   and from the sun there swiftly made at her   a ghastly something and its shadow flew   before it till it touched her and she turned   when lo her own that broadening from her feet   and blackening swallowed all the land and in it   far cities burnt and with a cry she woke   and all this trouble did not pass but grew   till even the clear face of the guileless king   and trustful courtesies of household life   became her bane and at the last she said   o lancelot get thee hence to thine own land   for if thou tarry we shall meet again   and if we meet again some evil chance   will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze   before the people and our lord the king   and lancelot ever promised but remained   and still they met and met  again she said   o lancelot if thou love me get thee hence   and then they were agreed upon a night   when the good king should not be there to meet   and part for ever  vivien lurking heard   she told sir modred  passionpale they met   and greeted  hands in hands and eye to eye   low on the border of her couch they sat   stammering and staring  it was their last hour   a madness of farewells  and modred brought   his creatures to the basement of the tower   for testimony and crying with full voice   traitor come out ye are trapt at last aroused   lancelot who rushing outward lionlike   leapt on him and hurled him headlong and he fell   stunned and his creatures took and bare him off   and all was still  then she the end is come   and i am shamed for ever and he said   mine be the shame mine was the sin  but rise   and fly to my strong castle overseas   there will i hide thee till my life shall end   there hold thee with my life against the world   she answered lancelot wilt thou hold me so   nay friend for we have taken our farewells   would god that thou couldst hide me from myself   mine is the shame for i was wife and thou   unwedded  yet rise now and let us fly   for i will draw me into sanctuary   and bide my doom  so lancelot got her horse   set her thereon and mounted on his own   and then they rode to the divided way   there kissed and parted weeping  for he past   loveloyal to the least wish of the queen   back to his land but she to almesbury   fled all night long by glimmering waste and weald   and heard the spirits of the waste and weald   moan as she fled or thought she heard them moan   and in herself she moaned too late too late   till in the cold wind that foreruns the morn   a blot in heaven the raven flying high   croaked and she thought he spies a field of death   for now the heathen of the northern sea   lured by the crimes and frailties of the court   begin to slay the folk and spoil the land       and when she came to almesbury she spake   there to the nuns and said mine enemies   pursue me but o peaceful sisterhood   receive and yield me sanctuary nor ask   her name to whom ye yield it till her time   to tell you and her beauty grace and power   wrought as a charm upon them and they spared   to ask it              so the stately queen abode   for many a week unknown among the nuns   nor with them mixed nor told her name nor sought   wrapt in her grief for housel or for shrift   but communed only with the little maid   who pleased her with a babbling heedlessness   which often lured her from herself but now   this night a rumour wildly blown about   came that sir modred had usurped the realm   and leagued him with the heathen while the king   was waging war on lancelot  then she thought   with what a hate the people and the king   must hate me and bowed down upon her hands   silent until the little maid who brooked   no silence brake it uttering late so late   what hour i wonder now and when she drew   no answer by and by began to hum   an air the nuns had taught her late so late   which when she heard the queen looked up and said   o maiden if indeed ye list to sing   sing and unbind my heart that i may weep   whereat full willingly sang the little maid       late late so late and dark the night and chill   late late so late but we can enter still   too late too late ye cannot enter now       no light had we  for that we do repent   and learning this the bridegroom will relent   too late too late ye cannot enter now       no light  so late and dark and chill the night   o let us in that we may find the light   too late too late  ye cannot enter now       have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet   o let us in though late to kiss his feet   no no too late ye cannot enter now       so sang the novice while full passionately   her head upon her hands remembering   her thought when first she came wept the sad queen   then said the little novice prattling to her      o pray you noble lady weep no more   but let my words the words of one so small   who knowing nothing knows but to obey   and if i do not there is penance given   comfort your sorrows for they do not flow   from evil done right sure am i of that   who see your tender grace and stateliness   but weigh your sorrows with our lord the kings   and weighing find them less for gone is he   to wage grim war against sir lancelot there   round that strong castle where he holds the queen   and modred whom he left in charge of all   the traitorah sweet lady the kings grief   for his own self and his own queen and realm   must needs be thrice as great as any of ours   for me i thank the saints i am not great   for if there ever come a grief to me   i cry my cry in silence and have done   none knows it and my tears have brought me good   but even were the griefs of little ones   as great as those of great ones yet this grief   is added to the griefs the great must bear   that howsoever much they may desire   silence they cannot weep behind a cloud   as even here they talk at almesbury   about the good king and his wicked queen   and were i such a king with such a queen   well might i wish to veil her wickedness   but were i such a king it could not be       then to her own sad heart muttered the queen   will the child kill me with her innocent talk   but openly she answered must not i   if this false traitor have displaced his lord   grieve with the common grief of all the realm       yea said the maid this is all womans grief   that she is woman whose disloyal life   hath wrought confusion in the table round   which good king arthur founded years ago   with signs and miracles and wonders there   at camelot ere the coming of the queen       then thought the queen within herself again   will the child kill me with her foolish prate   but openly she spake and said to her   o little maid shut in by nunnery walls   what canst thou know of kings and tables round   or what of signs and wonders but the signs   and simple miracles of thy nunnery       to whom the little novice garrulously   yea but i know  the land was full of signs   and wonders ere the coming of the queen   so said my father and himself was knight   of the great tableat the founding of it   and rode thereto from lyonnesse and he said   that as he rode an hour or maybe twain   after the sunset down the coast he heard   strange music and he paused and turningthere   all down the lonely coast of lyonnesse   each with a beaconstar upon his head   and with a wild sealight about his feet   he saw themheadland after headland flame   far on into the rich heart of the west   and in the light the white mermaiden swam   and strong manbreasted things stood from the sea   and sent a deep seavoice through all the land   to which the little elves of chasm and cleft   made answer sounding like a distant horn   so said my fatheryea and furthermore   next morning while he past the dimlit woods   himself beheld three spirits mad with joy   come dashing down on a tall wayside flower   that shook beneath them as the thistle shakes   when three gray linnets wrangle for the seed   and still at evenings on before his horse   the flickering fairycircle wheeled and broke   flying and linked again and wheeled and broke   flying for all the land was full of life   and when at last he came to camelot   a wreath of airy dancers handinhand   swung round the lighted lantern of the hall   and in the hall itself was such a feast   as never man had dreamed for every knight   had whatsoever meat he longed for served   by hands unseen and even as he said   down in the cellars merry bloated things   shouldered the spigot straddling on the butts   while the wine ran  so glad were spirits and men   before the coming of the sinful queen       then spake the queen and somewhat bitterly   were they so glad ill prophets were they all   spirits and men  could none of them foresee   not even thy wise father with his signs   and wonders what has fallen upon the realm       to whom the novice garrulously again   yea one a bard of whom my father said   full many a noble warsong had he sung   even in the presence of an enemys fleet   between the steep cliff and the coming wave   and many a mystic lay of life and death   had chanted on the smoky mountaintops   when round him bent the spirits of the hills   with all their dewy hair blown back like flame   so said my fatherand that night the bard   sang arthurs glorious wars and sang the king   as wellnigh more than man and railed at those   who called him the false son of gorlois   for there was no man knew from whence he came   but after tempest when the long wave broke   all down the thundering shores of bude and bos   there came a day as still as heaven and then   they found a naked child upon the sands   of dark tintagil by the cornish sea   and that was arthur and they fostered him   till he by miracle was approven king   and that his grave should be a mystery   from all men like his birth and could he find   a woman in her womanhood as great   as he was in his manhood then he sang   the twain together well might change the world   but even in the middle of his song   he faltered and his hand fell from the harp   and pale he turned and reeled and would have fallen   but that they stayed him up nor would he tell   his vision but what doubt that he foresaw   this evil work of lancelot and the queen       then thought the queen lo they have set her on   our simpleseeming abbess and her nuns   to play upon me and bowed her head nor spake   whereat the novice crying with clasped hands   shame on her own garrulity garrulously   said the good nuns would check her gadding tongue   full often and sweet lady if i seem   to vex an ear too sad to listen to me   unmannerly with prattling and the tales   which my good father told me check me too   nor let me shame my fathers memory one   of noblest manners though himself would say   sir lancelot had the noblest and he died   killed in a tilt come next five summers back   and left me but of others who remain   and of the two firstfamed for courtesy   and pray you check me if i ask amiss   but pray you which had noblest while you moved   among them lancelot or our lord the king       then the pale queen looked up and answered her   sir lancelot as became a noble knight   was gracious to all ladies and the same   in open battle or the tiltingfield   forbore his own advantage and the king   in open battle or the tiltingfield   forbore his own advantage and these two   were the most noblymannered men of all   for manners are not idle but the fruit   of loyal nature and of noble mind       yea said the maid be manners such fair fruit   then lancelots needs must be a thousandfold   less noble being as all rumour runs   the most disloyal friend in all the world       to which a mournful answer made the queen   o closed about by narrowing nunnerywalls   what knowest thou of the world and all its lights   and shadows all the wealth and all the woe   if ever lancelot that most noble knight   were for one hour less noble than himself   pray for him that he scape the doom of fire   and weep for her that drew him to his doom       yea said the little novice i pray for both   but i should all as soon believe that his   sir lancelots were as noble as the kings   as i could think sweet lady yours would be   such as they are were you the sinful queen       so she like many another babbler hurt   whom she would soothe and harmed where she would heal   for here a sudden flush of wrathful heat   fired all the pale face of the queen who cried   such as thou art be never maiden more   for ever thou their tool set on to plague   and play upon and harry me petty spy   and traitress  when that storm of anger brake   from guinevere aghast the maiden rose   white as her veil and stood before the queen   as tremulously as foam upon the beach   stands in a wind ready to break and fly   and when the queen had added get thee hence   fled frighted  then that other left alone   sighed and began to gather heart again   saying in herself the simple fearful child   meant nothing but my own toofearful guilt   simpler than any child betrays itself   but help me heaven for surely i repent   for what is true repentance but in thought   not even in inmost thought to think again   the sins that made the past so pleasant to us   and i have sworn never to see him more   to see him more                     and even in saying this   her memory from old habit of the mind   went slipping back upon the golden days   in which she saw him first when lancelot came   reputed the best knight and goodliest man   ambassador to lead her to his lord   arthur and led her forth and far ahead   of his and her retinue moving they   rapt in sweet talk or lively all on love   and sport and tilts and pleasure for the time   was maytime and as yet no sin was dreamed   rode under groves that looked a paradise   of blossom over sheets of hyacinth   that seemed the heavens upbreaking through the earth   and on from hill to hill and every day   beheld at noon in some delicious dale   the silk pavilions of king arthur raised   for brief repast or afternoon repose   by couriers gone before and on again   till yet once more ere set of sun they saw   the dragon of the great pendragonship   that crowned the state pavilion of the king   blaze by the rushing brook or silent well       but when the queen immersed in such a trance   and moving through the past unconsciously   came to that point where first she saw the king   ride toward her from the city sighed to find   her journey done glanced at him thought him cold   high selfcontained and passionless not like him   not like my lancelotwhile she brooded thus   and grew halfguilty in her thoughts again   there rode an armed warrior to the doors   a murmuring whisper through the nunnery ran   then on a sudden a cry the king  she sat   stiffstricken listening but when armed feet   through the long gallery from the outer doors   rang coming prone from off her seat she fell   and grovelled with her face against the floor   there with her milkwhite arms and shadowy hair   she made her face a darkness from the king   and in the darkness heard his armed feet   pause by her then came silence then a voice   monotonous and hollow like a ghosts   denouncing judgment but though changed the kings       liest thou here so low the child of one   i honoured happy dead before thy shame   well is it that no child is born of thee   the children born of thee are sword and fire   red ruin and the breaking up of laws   the craft of kindred and the godless hosts   of heathen swarming oer the northern sea   whom i while yet sir lancelot my right arm   the mightiest of my knights abode with me   have everywhere about this land of christ   in twelve great battles ruining overthrown   and knowest thou now from whence i comefrom him   from waging bitter war with him  and he   that did not shun to smite me in worse way   had yet that grace of courtesy in him left   he spared to lift his hand against the king   who made him knight  but many a knight was slain   and many more and all his kith and kin   clave to him and abode in his own land   and many more when modred raised revolt   forgetful of their troth and fealty clave   to modred and a remnant stays with me   and of this remnant will i leave a part   true men who love me still for whom i live   to guard thee in the wild hour coming on   lest but a hair of this low head be harmed   fear not  thou shalt be guarded till my death   howbeit i know if ancient prophecies   have erred not that i march to meet my doom   thou hast not made my life so sweet to me   that i the king should greatly care to live   for thou hast spoilt the purpose of my life   bear with me for the last time while i show   even for thy sake the sin which thou hast sinned   for when the roman left us and their law   relaxed its hold upon us and the ways   were filled with rapine here and there a deed   of prowess done redressed a random wrong   but i was first of all the kings who drew   the knighthooderrant of this realm and all   the realms together under me their head   in that fair order of my table round   a glorious company the flower of men   to serve as model for the mighty world   and be the fair beginning of a time   i made them lay their hands in mine and swear   to reverence the king as if he were   their conscience and their conscience as their king   to break the heathen and uphold the christ   to ride abroad redressing human wrongs   to speak no slander no nor listen to it   to honour his own word as if his gods   to lead sweet lives in purest chastity   to love one maiden only cleave to her   and worship her by years of noble deeds   until they won her for indeed i knew   of no more subtle master under heaven   than is the maiden passion for a maid   not only to keep down the base in man   but teach high thought and amiable words   and courtliness and the desire of fame   and love of truth and all that makes a man   and all this throve before i wedded thee   believing lo mine helpmate one to feel   my purpose and rejoicing in my joy   then came thy shameful sin with lancelot   then came the sin of tristram and isolt   then others following these my mightiest knights   and drawing foul ensample from fair names   sinned also till the loathsome opposite   of all my heart had destined did obtain   and all through thee so that this life of mine   i guard as gods high gift from scathe and wrong   not greatly care to lose but rather think   how sad it were for arthur should he live   to sit once more within his lonely hall   and miss the wonted number of my knights   and miss to hear high talk of noble deeds   as in the golden days before thy sin   for which of us who might be left could speak   of the pure heart nor seem to glance at thee   and in thy bowers of camelot or of usk   thy shadow still would glide from room to room   and i should evermore be vext with thee   in hanging robe or vacant ornament   or ghostly footfall echoing on the stair   for think not though thou wouldst not love thy lord   thy lord hast wholly lost his love for thee   i am not made of so slight elements   yet must i leave thee woman to thy shame   i hold that man the worst of public foes   who either for his own or childrens sake   to save his blood from scandal lets the wife   whom he knows false abide and rule the house   for being through his cowardice allowed   her station taken everywhere for pure   she like a new disease unknown to men   creeps no precaution used among the crowd   makes wicked lightnings of her eyes and saps   the fealty of our friends and stirs the pulse   with devils leaps and poisons half the young   worst of the worst were that man he that reigns   better the kings waste hearth and aching heart   than thou reseated in thy place of light   the mockery of my people and their bane       he paused and in the pause she crept an inch   nearer and laid her hands about his feet   far off a solitary trumpet blew   then waiting by the doors the warhorse neighed   at a friends voice and he spake again       yet think not that i come to urge thy crimes   i did not come to curse thee guinevere   i whose vast pity almost makes me die   to see thee laying there thy golden head   my pride in happier summers at my feet   the wrath which forced my thoughts on that fierce law   the doom of treason and the flaming death   when first i learnt thee hidden here is past   the pangwhich while i weighed thy heart with one   too wholly true to dream untruth in thee   made my tears burnis also pastin part   and all is past the sin is sinned and i   lo i forgive thee as eternal god   forgives  do thou for thine own soul the rest   but how to take last leave of all i loved   o golden hair with which i used to play   not knowing o imperialmoulded form   and beauty such as never woman wore   until it became a kingdoms curse with thee   i cannot touch thy lips they are not mine   but lancelots  nay they never were the kings   i cannot take thy hand  that too is flesh   and in the flesh thou hast sinned and mine own flesh   here looking down on thine polluted cries   i loathe thee yet not less o guinevere   for i was ever virgin save for thee   my love through flesh hath wrought into my life   so far that my doom is i love thee still   let no man dream but that i love thee still   perchance and so thou purify thy soul   and so thou lean on our fair father christ   hereafter in that world where all are pure   we two may meet before high god and thou   wilt spring to me and claim me thine and know   i am thine husbandnot a smaller soul   nor lancelot nor another  leave me that   i charge thee my last hope  now must i hence   through the thick night i hear the trumpet blow   they summon me their king to lead mine hosts   far down to that great battle in the west   where i must strike against the man they call   my sisters sonno kin of mine who leagues   with lords of the white horse heathen and knights   traitorsand strike him dead and meet myself   death or i know not what mysterious doom   and thou remaining here wilt learn the event   but hither shall i never come again   never lie by thy side see thee no more   farewell              and while she grovelled at his feet   she felt the kings breath wander oer her neck   and in the darkness oer her fallen head   perceived the waving of his hands that blest       then listening till those armed steps were gone   rose the pale queen and in her anguish found   the casement  peradventure so she thought   if i might see his face and not be seen   and lo he sat on horseback at the door   and near him the sad nuns with each a light   stood and he gave them charge about the queen   to guard and foster her for evermore   and while he spake to these his helm was lowered   to which for crest the golden dragon clung   of britain so she did not see the face   which then was as an angels but she saw   wet with the mists and smitten by the lights   the dragon of the great pendragonship   blaze making all the night a steam of fire   and even then he turned and more and more   the moony vapour rolling round the king   who seemed the phantom of a giant in it   enwound him fold by fold and made him gray   and grayer till himself became as mist   before her moving ghostlike to his doom       then she stretched out her arms and cried aloud   oh arthur there her voice brake suddenly   thenas a stream that spouting from a cliff   fails in mid air but gathering at the base   remakes itself and flashes down the vale   went on in passionate utterance                                    gonemy lord   gone through my sin to slay and to be slain   and he forgave me and i could not speak   farewell  i should have answered his farewell   his mercy choked me  gone my lord the king   my own true lord how dare i call him mine   the shadow of another cleaves to me   and makes me one pollution  he the king   called me polluted  shall i kill myself   what help in that  i cannot kill my sin   if soul be soul nor can i kill my shame   no nor by living can i live it down   the days will grow to weeks the weeks to months   the months will add themselves and make the years   the years will roll into the centuries   and mine will ever be a name of scorn   i must not dwell on that defeat of fame   let the world be that is but of the world   what else what hope i think there was a hope   except he mocked me when he spake of hope   his hope he called it but he never mocks   for mockery is the fume of little hearts   and blessed be the king who hath forgiven   my wickedness to him and left me hope   that in mine own heart i can live down sin   and be his mate hereafter in the heavens   before high god  ah great and gentle lord   who wast as is the conscience of a saint   among his warring senses to thy knights   to whom my false voluptuous pride that took   full easily all impressions from below   would not look up or halfdespised the height   to which i would not or i could not climb   i thought i could not breathe in that fine air   that pure severity of perfect light   i yearned for warmth and colour which i found   in lancelotnow i see thee what thou art   thou art the highest and most human too   not lancelot nor another  is there none   will tell the king i love him though so late   nowere he goes to the great battle none   myself must tell him in that purer life   but now it were too daring  ah my god   what might i not have made of thy fair world   had i but loved thy highest creature here   it was my duty to have loved the highest   it surely was my profit had i known   it would have been my pleasure had i seen   we needs must love the highest when we see it   not lancelot nor another                               here her hand   grasped made her vail her eyes  she looked and saw   the novice weeping suppliant and said to her   yea little maid for am i not forgiven   then glancing up beheld the holy nuns   all round her weeping and her heart was loosed   within her and she wept with these and said       ye know me then that wicked one who broke   the vast design and purpose of the king   o shut me round with narrowing nunnerywalls   meek maidens from the voices crying shame   i must not scorn myself  he loves me still   let no one dream but that he loves me still   so let me if you do not shudder at me   nor shun to call me sister dwell with you   wear black and white and be a nun like you   fast with your fasts not feasting with your feasts   grieve with your griefs not grieving at your joys   but not rejoicing mingle with your rites   pray and be prayed for lie before your shrines   do each low office of your holy house   walk your dim cloister and distribute dole   to poor sick people richer in his eyes   who ransomed us and haler too than i   and treat their loathsome hurts and heal mine own   and so wear out in almsdeed and in prayer   the sombre close of that voluptuous day   which wrought the ruin of my lord the king       she said  they took her to themselves and she   still hoping fearing is it yet too late   dwelt with them till in time their abbess died   then she for her good deeds and her pure life   and for the power of ministration in her   and likewise for the high rank she had borne   was chosen abbess there an abbess lived   for three brief years and there an abbess past   to where beyond these voices there is peace      the passing of arthur    that story which the bold sir bedivere   first made and latest left of all the knights   told when the man was no more than a voice   in the white winter of his age to those   with whom he dwelt new faces other minds       for on their march to westward bedivere   who slowly paced among the slumbering host   heard in his tent the moanings of the king       i found him in the shining of the stars   i marked him in the flowering of his fields   but in his ways with men i find him not   i waged his wars and now i pass and die   o me for why is all around us here   as if some lesser god had made the world   but had not force to shape it as he would   till the high god behold it from beyond   and enter it and make it beautiful   or else as if the world were wholly fair   but that these eyes of men are dense and dim   and have not power to see it as it is   perchance because we see not to the close   for i being simple thought to work his will   and have but stricken with the sword in vain   and all whereon i leaned in wife and friend   is traitor to my peace and all my realm   reels back into the beast and is no more   my god thou hast forgotten me in my death   naygod my christi pass but shall not die       then ere that last weird battle in the west   there came on arthur sleeping gawain killed   in lancelots war the ghost of gawain blown   along a wandering wind and past his ear   went shrilling hollow hollow all delight   hail king tomorrow thou shalt pass away   farewell there is an isle of rest for thee   and i am blown along a wandering wind   and hollow hollow hollow all delight   and fainter onward like wild birds that change   their season in the night and wail their way   from cloud to cloud down the long wind the dream   shrilled but in going mingled with dim cries   far in the moonlit haze among the hills   as of some lonely city sacked by night   when all is lost and wife and child with wail   pass to new lords and arthur woke and called   who spake  a dream  o light upon the wind   thine gawain was the voiceare these dim cries   thine or doth all that haunts the waste and wild   mourn knowing it will go along with me       this heard the bold sir bedivere and spake   o me my king let pass whatever will   elves and the harmless glamour of the field   but in their stead thy name and glory cling   to all high places like a golden cloud   for ever  but as yet thou shalt not pass   light was gawain in life and light in death   is gawain for the ghost is as the man   and care not thou for dreams from him but rise   i hear the steps of modred in the west   and with him many of thy people and knights   once thine whom thou hast loved but grosser grown   than heathen spitting at their vows and thee   right well in heart they know thee for the king   arise go forth and conquer as of old       then spake king arthur to sir bedivere   far other is this battle in the west   whereto we move than when we strove in youth   and brake the petty kings and fought with rome   or thrust the heathen from the roman wall   and shook him through the north  ill doom is mine   to war against my people and my knights   the king who fights his people fights himself   and they my knights who loved me once the stroke   that strikes them dead is as my death to me   yet let us hence and find or feel a way   through this blind haze which ever since i saw   one lying in the dust at almesbury   hath folded in the passes of the world       then rose the king and moved his host by night   and ever pushed sir modred league by league   back to the sunset bound of lyonnesse   a land of old upheaven from the abyss   by fire to sink into the abyss again   where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt   and the long mountains ended in a coast   of evershifting sand and far away   the phantom circle of a moaning sea   there the pursuer could pursue no more   and he that fled no further fly the king   and there that day when the great light of heaven   burned at his lowest in the rolling year   on the waste sand by the waste sea they closed   nor ever yet had arthur fought a fight   like this last dim weird battle of the west   a deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea   whereof the chill to him who breathed it drew   down with his blood till all his heart was cold   with formless fear and even on arthur fell   confusion since he saw not whom he fought   for friend and foe were shadows in the mist   and friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew   and some had visions out of golden youth   and some beheld the faces of old ghosts   look in upon the battle and in the mist   was many a noble deed many a base   and chance and craft and strength in single fights   and ever and anon with host to host   shocks and the splintering spear the hard mail hewn   shieldbreakings and the clash of brands the crash   of battleaxes on shattered helms and shrieks   after the christ of those who falling down   looked up for heaven and only saw the mist   and shouts of heathen and the traitor knights   oaths insults filth and monstrous blasphemies   sweat writhings anguish labouring of the lungs   in that close mist and cryings for the light   moans of the dying and voices of the dead       last as by some one deathbed after wail   of suffering silence follows or through death   or deathlike swoon thus over all that shore   save for some whisper of the seething seas   a dead hush fell but when the dolorous day   grew drearier toward twilight falling came   a bitter wind clear from the north and blew   the mist aside and with that wind the tide   rose and the pale king glanced across the field   of battle  but no man was moving there   nor any cry of christian heard thereon   nor yet of heathen only the wan wave   brake in among dead faces to and fro   swaying the helpless hands and up and down   tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen   and shivered brands that once had fought with rome   and rolling far along the gloomy shores   the voice of days of old and days to be       then spake king arthur to sir bedivere   and whiter than the mist that all day long   had held the field of battle was the king       hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world   and wastes the narrow realm whereon we move   and beats upon the faces of the dead   my dead as though they had not died for me   o bedivere for on my heart hath fallen   confusion till i know not what i am   nor whence i am nor whether i be king   behold i seem but king among the dead       then spake the bold sir bedivere  my king   king everywhere and so the dead have kings   there also will i worship thee as king   yet still thy life is whole and still i live   who love thee but who hates thee he that brought   the heathen back among us yonder stands   modred unharmed the traitor of thine house       then spake the king  my house hath been my doom   but call not thou this traitor of my house   who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me   my house are rather they who sware my vows   yea even while they brake them owned me king   and well for thee saying in my dark hour   when all the purport of my throne hath failed   that quick or dead thou holdest me for king   king am i whatsoever be their cry   and one last act of kinghood shalt thou see   yet ere i pass  and uttering this the king   made at the man  then modred smote his liege   hard on that helm which many a heathen sword   had beaten thin while arthur at one blow   striking the last stroke with excalibur   slew him and all but slain himself he fell       so all day long the noise of battle rolled   among the mountains by the winter sea   until king arthurs table man by man   had fallen in lyonnesse about their lord   king arthur  then because his wound was deep   the bold sir bedivere uplifted him   and bore him to a chapel nigh the field   a broken chancel with a broken cross   that stood on a dark strait of barren land   on one side lay the ocean and on one   lay a great water and the moon was full       then spake king arthur to sir bedivere   the sequel of today unsolders all   the goodliest fellowship of famous knights   whereof this world holds record  such a sleep   they sleepthe men i loved  i think that we   shall never more at any future time   delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds   walking about the gardens and the halls   of camelot as in the days that were   i perish by this people which i made   though merlin sware that i should come again   to rule once more but let what will be be   i am so deeply smitten through the helm   that without help i cannot last till morn   thou therefore take my brand excalibur   which was my pride  for thou rememberest how   in those old days one summer noon an arm   rose up from out the bosom of the lake   clothed in white samite mystic wonderful   holding the swordand how i rowed across   and took it and have worn it like a king   and wheresoever i am sung or told   in aftertime this also shall be known   but now delay not  take excalibur   and fling him far into the middle mere   watch what thou seest and lightly bring me word       to him replied the bold sir bedivere   it is not meet sir king to leave thee thus   aidless alone and smitten through the helm   a little thing may harm a wounded man   yet i thy hest will all perform at full   watch what i see and lightly bring thee word       so saying from the ruined shrine he stept   and in the moon athwart the place of tombs   where lay the mighty bones of ancient men   old knights and over them the seawind sang   shrill chill with flakes of foam  he stepping down   by zigzag paths and juts of pointed rock   came on the shining levels of the lake       there drew he forth the brand excalibur   and oer him drawing it the winter moon   brightening the skirts of a long cloud ran forth   and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt   for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks   myriads of topazlights and jacinthwork   of subtlest jewellery  he gazed so long   that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood   this way and that dividing the swift mind   in act to throw  but at the last it seemed   better to leave excalibur concealed   there in the manyknotted waterflags   that whistled stiff and dry about the marge   so strode he back slow to the wounded king       then spake king arthur to sir bedivere   hast thou performed my mission which i gave   what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard       and answer made the bold sir bedivere   i heard the ripple washing in the reeds   and the wild water lapping on the crag       to whom replied king arthur faint and pale   thou hast betrayed thy nature and thy name   not rendering true answer as beseemed   thy fealty nor like a noble knight   for surer sign had followed either hand   or voice or else a motion of the mere   this is a shameful thing for men to lie   yet now i charge thee quickly go again   as thou art lief and dear and do the thing   i bade thee watch and lightly bring me word       then went sir bedivere the second time   across the ridge and paced beside the mere   counting the dewy pebbles fixed in thought   but when he saw the wonder of the hilt   how curiously and strangely chased he smote   his palms together and he cried aloud       and if indeed i cast the brand away   surely a precious thing one worthy note   should thus be lost for ever from the earth   which might have pleased the eyes of many men   what good should follow this if this were done   what harm undone  deep harm to disobey   seeing obedience is the bond of rule   were it well to obey then if a king demand   an act unprofitable against himself   the king is sick and knows not what he does   what record or what relic of my lord   should be to aftertime but empty breath   and rumours of a doubt  but were this kept   stored in some treasurehouse of mighty kings   some one might show it at a joust of arms   saying king arthurs sword excalibur   wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake   nine years she wrought it sitting in the deeps   upon the hidden bases of the hills   so might some old man speak in the aftertime   to all the people winning reverence   but now much honour and much fame were lost       so spake he clouded with his own conceit   and hid excalibur the second time   and so strode back slow to the wounded king       then spoke king arthur breathing heavily   what is it thou hast seen or what hast heard       and answer made the bold sir bedivere   i heard the water lapping on the crag   and the long ripple washing in the reeds       to whom replied king arthur much in wrath   ah miserable and unkind untrue   unknightly traitorhearted  woe is me   authority forgets a dying king   laid widowed of the power in his eye   that bowed the will  i see thee what thou art   for thou the latestleft of all my knights   in whom should meet the offices of all   thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt   either from lust of gold or like a girl   valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes   yet for a man may fail in duty twice   and the third time may prosper get thee hence   but if thou spare to fling excalibur   i will arise and slay thee with my hands       then quickly rose sir bedivere and ran   and leaping down the ridges lightly plunged   among the bulrush beds and clutched the sword   and strongly wheeled and threw it  the great brand   made lightnings in the splendour of the moon   and flashing round and round and whirled in an arch   shot like a streamer of the northern morn   seen where the moving isles of winter shock   by night with noises of the northern sea   so flashed and fell the brand excalibur   but ere he dipt the surface rose an arm   clothed in white samite mystic wonderful   and caught him by the hilt and brandished him   three times and drew him under in the mere   and lightly went the other to the king       then spoke king arthur drawing thicker breath   now see i by thine eyes that this is done   speak out  what is it thou hast heard or seen       and answer made the bold sir bedivere   sir king i closed mine eyelids lest the gems   should blind my purpose for i never saw   nor shall see here or elsewhere till i die   not though i live three lives of mortal men   so great a miracle as yonder hilt   then with both hands i flung him wheeling him   but when i looked again behold an arm   clothed in white samite mystic wonderful   that caught him by the hilt and brandished him   three times and drew him under in the mere       and answer made king arthur breathing hard   my end draws nigh tis time that i were gone   make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight   and bear me to the margin yet i fear   my wound hath taken cold and i shall die       so saying from the pavement he half rose   slowly with pain reclining on his arm   and looking wistfully with wide blue eyes   as in a picture  him sir bedivere   remorsefully regarded through his tears   and would have spoken but he found not words   then took with care and kneeling on one knee   oer both his shoulders drew the languid hands   and rising bore him through the place of tombs       but as he walked king arthur panted hard   like one that feels a nightmare on his bed   when all the house is mute  so sighed the king   muttering and murmuring at his ear quick quick   i fear it is too late and i shall die       but the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge   clothed with his breath and looking as he walked   larger than human on the frozen hills   he heard the deep behind him and a cry   before  his own thought drove him like a goad   dry clashed his harness in the icy caves   and barren chasms and all to left and right   the bare black cliff clanged round him as he based   his feet on juts of slippery crag that rang   sharpsmitten with the dint of armed heels   and on a sudden lo the level lake   and the long glories of the winter moon       then saw they how there hove a dusky barge   dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern   beneath them and descending they were ware   that all the decks were dense with stately forms   blackstoled blackhooded like a dreamby these   three queens with crowns of gold  and from them rose   a cry that shivered to the tingling stars   and as it were one voice an agony   of lamentation like a wind that shrills   all night in a waste land where no one comes   or hath come since the making of the world       then murmured arthur place me in the barge   so to the barge they came  there those three queens   put forth their hands and took the king and wept   but she that rose the tallest of them all   and fairest laid his head upon her lap   and loosed the shattered casque and chafed his hands   and called him by his name complaining loud   and dropping bitter tears against a brow   striped with dark blood  for all his face was white   and colourless and like the withered moon   smote by the fresh beam of the springing east   and all his greaves and cuisses dashed with drops   of onset and the light and lustrous curls   that made his forehead like a rising sun   high from the daisthronewere parched with dust   or clotted into points and hanging loose   mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips   so like a shattered column lay the king   not like that arthur who with lance in rest   from spur to plume a star of tournament   shot through the lists at camelot and charged   before the eyes of ladies and of kings       then loudly cried the bold sir bedivere   ah my lord arthur whither shall i go   where shall i hide my forehead and my eyes   for now i see the true old times are dead   when every morning brought a noble chance   and every chance brought out a noble knight   such times have been not since the light that led   the holy elders with the gift of myrrh   but now the whole round table is dissolved   which was an image of the mighty world   and i the last go forth companionless   and the days darken round me and the years   among new men strange faces other minds       and slowly answered arthur from the barge   the old order changeth yielding place to new   and god fulfils himself in many ways   lest one good custom should corrupt the world   comfort thyself  what comfort is in me   i have lived my life and that which i have done   may he within himself make pure but thou   if thou shouldst never see my face again   pray for my soul  more things are wrought by prayer   than this world dreams of  wherefore let thy voice   rise like a fountain for me night and day   for what are men better than sheep or goats   that nourish a blind life within the brain   if knowing god they lift not hands of prayer   both for themselves and those who call them friend   for so the whole round earth is every way   bound by gold chains about the feet of god   but now farewell  i am going a long way   with these thou seestif indeed i go   for all my mind is clouded with a doubt   to the islandvalley of avilion   where falls not hail or rain or any snow   nor ever wind blows loudly but it lies   deepmeadowed happy fair with orchard lawns   and bowery hollows crowned with summer sea   where i will heal me of my grievous wound       so said he and the barge with oar and sail   moved from the brink like some fullbreasted swan   that fluting a wild carol ere her death   ruffles her pure cold plume and takes the flood   with swarthy webs  long stood sir bedivere   revolving many memories till the hull   looked one black dot against the verge of dawn   and on the mere the wailing died away       but when that moan had past for evermore   the stillness of the dead worlds winter dawn   amazed him and he groaned the king is gone   and therewithal came on him the weird rhyme   from the great deep to the great deep he goes       whereat he slowly turned and slowly clomb   the last hard footstep of that iron crag   thence marked the black hull moving yet and cried   he passes to be king among the dead   and after healing of his grievous wound   he comes again butif he come no more   o me be yon dark queens in yon black boat   who shrieked and wailed the three whereat we gazed   on that high day when clothed with living light   they stood before his throne in silence friends   of arthur who should help him at his need       then from the dawn it seemed there came but faint   as from beyond the limit of the world   like the last echo born of a great cry   sounds as if some fair city were one voice   around a king returning from his wars       thereat once more he moved about and clomb   even to the highest he could climb and saw   straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand   or thought he saw the speck that bare the king   down that long water opening on the deep   somewhere far off pass on and on and go   from less to less and vanish into light   and the new sun rose bringing the new year      to the queen    o loyal to the royal in thyself   and loyal to thy land as this to thee   bear witness that rememberable day   when pale as yet and feverworn the prince   who scarce had plucked his flickering life again   from halfway down the shadow of the grave   past with thee through thy people and their love   and london rolled one tide of joy through all   her trebled millions and loud leagues of man   and welcome witness too the silent cry   the prayer of many a race and creed and clime   thunderless lightnings striking under sea   from sunset and sunrise of all thy realm   and that true north whereof we lately heard   a strain to shame us keep you to yourselves   so loyal is too costly friendsyour love   is but a burthen  loose the bond and go   is this the tone of empire
