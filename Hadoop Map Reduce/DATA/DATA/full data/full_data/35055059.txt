35055059	the coxon fund  by henry james     chapter i    theyve got him for life i said to myself that evening on my way back to the station but later on alone in the compartment from wimbledon to waterloo before the glory of the district railway i amended this declaration in the light of the sense that my friends would probably after all not enjoy a monopoly of mr saltram  i wont pretend to have taken his vast measure on that first occasion but i think i had achieved a glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many persons in the way of charges accepted  he had been a great experience and it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how we should all sooner or later have the honour of dealing with him as a whole  whatever impression i then received of the amount of this total i had a full enough vision of the patience of the mulvilles  he was to stay all the winter  adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting from the inevitable emphasis  these excellent people might indeed have been content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months but if they didnt say he was to stay all summer as well it was only because this was more than they ventured to hope  i remember that at dinner that evening he wore slippers new and predominantly purple of some queer carpetstuff but the mulvilles were still in the stage of supposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders at a later time they grew poor dears to fear no snatching but theirs was a fidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud  wonderful indeed as when all was said you inevitably pronounced frank saltram it was not to be overlooked that the kent mulvilles were in their way still more extraordinary  as striking an instance as could easily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find remarkable conveniences  they had sent for me from wimbledon to come out and dine and there had been an implication in adelaides notejudged by her notes alone she might have been thought sillythat it was a case in which something momentous was to be determined or done  i had never known them not be in a state about somebody and i dare say i tried to be droll on this point in accepting their invitation on finding myself in the presence of their latest discovery i had not at first felt irreverence droopand thank heaven i have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative in mr saltrams company  i saw howeveri hasten to declare itthat compared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of inconsiderable feather and i afterwards took credit to myself for not having even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of the man  he had an incomparable gift i never was blind to itit dazzles me still  it dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact for im not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to some expense inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a plume  how the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the art of portraiture had only the canvas  nature in truth had largely rounded it and if memory hovering about it sometimes holds her breath this is because the voice that comes back was really golden  though the great man was an inmate and didnt dress he kept dinner on this occasion waiting and the first words he uttered on coming into the room were an elated announcement to mulville that he had found out something  not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at his face i privately asked adelaide what he had found out  i shall never forget the look she gave me as she replied  everything  she really believed it  at that moment at any rate he had found out that the mercy of the mulvilles was infinite  he had previously of course discovered as i had myself for that matter that their dinners were soignes  let me not indeed in saying this neglect to declare that i shall falsify my counterfeit if i seem to hint that there was in his nature any ounce of calculation  he took whatever came but he never plotted for it and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have been so little of a parasite  he had a system of the universe but he had no system of spongingthat was quite handtomouth  he had fine gross easy senses but it was not his goodnatured appetite that wrought confusion  if he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with our dinners and it would have been a great economy of finer matter  i make free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if i was never able to do what the mulvilles did and people with still bigger houses and simpler charities i met first and last every demand of reflexion of emotionparticularly perhaps those of gratitude and of resentment no one i think paid the tribute of giving him up so often and if its rendering honour to borrow wisdom ive a right to talk of my sacrifices  he yielded lessons as the sea yields fishi lived for a while on this diet  sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive monstrous failureif failure after all it washad been designed for my private recreation  he fairly pampered my curiosity but the history of that experience would take me too far  this is not the large canvas i just now spoke of and i wouldnt have approached him with my present hand had it been a question of all the features  frank saltrams features for artistic purposes are verily the anecdotes that are to be gathered  their name is legion and this is only one of which the interest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons  such episodes as one looks back are the little dramas that made up the innumerable facets of the big dramawhich is yet to be reported    chapter ii    it is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinctmy own as it were and this otherthey equally began in a manner the first night of my acquaintance with frank saltram the night i came back from wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that in london for the very thrill of it i could only walk home  walking and swinging my stick i overtook at buckingham gate george gravener and george graveners story may be said to have begun with my making him as our paths lay together come home with me for a talk  i duly remember let me parenthesise that it was still more that of another person and also that several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second chapter  i had much to say to him none the less about my visit to the mulvilles whom he more indifferently knew and i was at any rate so amusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking for news of the old man of the sea i hadnt said mr saltram was old and it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather george gravener  i had at that time a lodging in ebury street and gravener was staying at his brothers empty house in eaton square  at cambridge five years before even in our devastating set his intellectual power had seemed to me almost awful  some one had once asked me privately with blanched cheeks what it was then that after all such a mind as that left standing  it leaves itself i could recollect devoutly replying i could smile at present for this remembrance since before we got to ebury street i was struck with the fact that save in the sense of being well set up on his legs george gravener had actually ceased to tower  the universe he laid low had somehow bloomed againthe usual eminences were visible  i wondered whether he had lost his humour or only dreadful thought had never had anynot even when i had fancied him most aristophanesque  what was the need of appealing to laughter however i could enviously enquire where you might appeal so confidently to measurement  mr saltrams queer figure his thick nose and hanging lip were fresh to me  in the light of my old friends fine cold symmetry they presented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness  already at hungry twentysix gravener looked as blank and parliamentary as if he were fifty and popular  in my scrap of a residencehe had a worldlings eye for its futile conveniences but never a comrades jokei sounded frank saltram in his ears a circumstance i mention in order to note that even then i was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment  as he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of impatience of the preposterous mulvilles his relation to whom like mine had had its origin in an early a childish intimacy with the young adelaide the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation when she married kent mulville who was older than gravener and i and much more amiable i gained a friend but gravener practically lost one  we reacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their deplorable social actionthe form the term was also his of nasty secondrate gush  i may have held in my for interieur that the good people at wimbledon were beautiful fools but when he sniffed at them i couldnt help taking the opposite line for i already felt that even should we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed  it came home to me that he was admirably british as without so much as a sociable sneer at my bookbinder he turned away from the serried rows of my little french library  of course ive never seen the fellow but its clear enough hes a humbug  clear enough is just what it isnt i replied if it only were  that ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to be later a long ache for final frivolous rest gravener was profound enough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldnt be anything but a dissenter and when i answered that the very note of his fascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted that there was no cad like your cultivated cad and that i might depend upon discoveringsince i had had the levity not already to have enquiredthat my shining light proceeded a generation back from a methodist cheesemonger  i confess i was struck with his insistence and i said after reflexion  it may bei admit it may be but why on earth are you so sureasking the question mainly to lay him the trap of saying that it was because the poor man didnt dress for dinner  he took an instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side  because the kent mulvilles have invented him  theyve an infallible hand for frauds  all their geese are swans  they were born to be duped they like it they cry for it they dont know anything from anything and they disgust oneluckily perhaps with christian charity  his vehemence was doubtless an accident but it might have been a strange foreknowledge  i forget what protest i dropped it was at any rate something that led him to go on after a moment  i only ask one thingits perfectly simple is a man in a given case a real gentleman  a real gentleman my dear fellowthats so soon said  not so soon when he isnt  if theyve got hold of one this time he must be a great rascal  i might feel injured i answered if i didnt reflect that they dont rave about me  dont be too sure  ill grant that hes a gentleman gravener presently added if youll admit that hes a scamp  i dont know which to admire most your logic or your benevolence  my friend coloured at this but he didnt change the subject where did they pick him up  i think they were struck with something he had published  i can fancy the dreary thing  i believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties  that of course wasnt to be endured so they jumped at the privilege of paying his debts  i professed that i knew nothing about his debts and i reminded my visitor that though the dear mulvilles were angels they were neither idiots nor millionaires what they mainly aimed at was reuniting mr saltram to his wife i was expecting to hear he has basely abandoned her gravener went on at this and im too glad you dont disappoint me  i tried to recall exactly what mrs mulville had told me  he didnt leave herno  its she who has left him  left him to us gravener asked  the monstermany thanks  i decline to take him  youll hear more about him in spite of yourself  i cant no i really cant resist the impression that hes a big man  i was already masteringto my shame perhaps be it saidjust the tone my old friend least liked  its doubtless only a trifle he returned but you havent happened to mention what his reputations to rest on  why on what i began by boring you withhis extraordinary mind  as exhibited in his writings  possibly in his writings but certainly in his talk which is far and away the richest i ever listened to  and whats it all about  my dear fellow dont ask me  about everything i pursued reminding myself of poor adelaide  about his ideas of things i then more charitably added  you must have heard him to know what i meanits unlike anything that ever was heard  i coloured i admit i overcharged a little for such a picture was an anticipation of saltrams later development and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him  however i really expressed a little lyrically perhaps my actual imagination of him when i proceeded to declare that in a cloud of tradition of legend he might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great talkers  before we parted george gravener had wondered why such a row should be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered and pensioned  the greater the windbag the greater the calamity  out of proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of the tongue  we were drenched with talkour wretched age was dying of it  i differed from him here sincerely only going so far as to concede and gladly that we were drenched with sound  it was not however the mere speakers who were killing usit was the mere stammerers  fine talk was as rare as it was refreshingthe gift of the gods themselves the one starry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity  how many men were there who rose to this privilege of how many masters of conversation could he boast the acquaintance  dying of talkwhy we were dying of the lack of it  bad writing wasnt talk as many people seemed to think and even good wasnt always to be compared to it  from the best talk indeed the best writing had something to learn  i fancifully added that we too should peradventure be gilded by the legend should be pointed at for having listened for having actually heard  gravener who had glanced at his watch and discovered it was midnight found to all this a retort beautifully characteristic of him  theres one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of the best talk and of the worst  he looked in saying this as if he meant great things and i was sure he could only mean once more that neither of them mattered if a man wasnt a real gentleman  perhaps it was what he did mean he deprived me however of the exultation of being right by putting the truth in a slightly different way  the only thing that really counts for ones estimate of a person is his conduct  he had his watch still in his palm and i reproached him with unfair play in having ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which i always gave in  my pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly added that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no exception  none whatever  none whatever  trust me then to try to be good at any price i laughed as i went with him to the door  i declare i will be if i have to be horrible    chapter iii    if that first night was one of the liveliest or at any rate was the freshest of my exaltations there was another four years later that was one of my great discomposures  repetition i well knew by this time was the secret of saltrams power to alienate and of course one would never have seen him at his finest if one hadnt seen him in his remorses  they set in mainly at this season and were magnificent elemental orchestral  i was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances was now due but none the less in our arduous attempt to set him on his feet as a lecturer it was impossible not to feel that two failures were a large order as we said for a short course of five  this was the second time and it was past nine oclock the audience a muster unprecedented and really encouraging had fortunately the attitude of blandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of if im not mistaken an analysis of primary ideas had drawn to the neighbourhood of upper baker street  there was in those days in that region a petty lecturehall to be secured on terms as moderate as the funds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the maintenance of five small saltramsi include the motherand one large one  by the time the saltrams of different sizes were all maintained we had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the machinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain them  it was i the other time who had been forced into the breach standing up there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin benches where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical as a suspicion that we couldnt so much as put a finger on mr saltram  there was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the early hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroadhe took one for meditation whenever he was to address such a companysome accident had disabled or delayed him  the meditative walks were a fiction for he never that any one could discover prepared anything but a magnificent prospectus hence his circulars and programmes of which i possess an almost complete collection are the solemn ghosts of generations never born  i put the case as it seemed to me at the best but i admit i had been angry and kent mulville was shocked at my want of public optimism  this time therefore i left the excuses to his more practised patience only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal from a young lady next whom in the hall i found myself sitting  my position was an accident but if it had been calculated the reason would scarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room had an approach to an appearance  our philosophers tail was deplorably limp  this visitor was the only person who looked at her ease who had come a little in the spirit of adventure  she seemed to carry amusement in her handsome young head and her presence spoke a little mystifyingly of a sudden extension of saltrams sphere of influence  he was doing better than we hoped and he had chosen such an occasion of all occasions to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond infirmities  the young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and black velvet and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type presumably a waitingmaid  she herself might perhaps have been a foreign countess and before she addressed me i had beguiled our sorry interval by finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of madame sand  it didnt make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from this to the certitude that she was american it simply engendered depressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from boston  she asked me if as a person apparently more initiated i would recommend further waiting and i answered that if she considered i was on my honour i would privately deprecate it  perhaps she didnt at any rate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were left almost alone  i presently ascertained she knew mrs saltram and this explained in a manner the miracle  the brotherhood of the friends of the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood or perhaps i should say the sisterhood of the friends of the wife like the kent mulvilles i belonged to both fraternities and even better than they i think i had sounded the abyss of mrs saltrams wrongs  she bored me to extinction and i knew but too well how she had bored her husband but there were those who stood by her the most efficient of whom were indeed the handful of poor saltrams backers  they did her liberal justice whereas her mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our philosopher im bound to say it was we howeverwe of both camps as it were who had always done most for her  i thought my young lady looked richi scarcely knew why and i hoped she had put her hand in her pocket  i soon made her out however not at all a fine fanaticshe was but a generous irresponsible enquirer  she had come to england to see her aunt and it was at her aunts she had met the dreary lady we had all so much on our mind  i saw shed help to pass the time when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasnt intrinsically more interesting  that was refreshing for it was an article of faith in mrs saltrams circleat least among those who scorned to know her horrid husbandthat she was attractive on her merits  she was in truth a most ordinary person as saltram himself would have been if he hadnt been a prodigy  the question of vulgarity had no application to him but it was a measure his wife kept challenging you to apply  i hasten to add that the consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his having left her to starve he doesnt seem to have much force of character said my young lady at which i laughed out so loud that my departing friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if i were making a joke of their discomfiture  my joke probably cost saltram a subscription or two but it helped me on with my interlocutress she says he drinks like a fish she sociably continued and yet she allows that his minds wonderfully clear  it was amusing to converse with a pretty girl who could talk of the clearness of saltrams mind  i expected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever  i tried to tell heri had it almost on my consciencewhat was the proper way to regard him an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this occasion with the usual effect of my feeling that i wasnt after all very sure of it  she had come tonight out of high curiosityshe had wanted to learn this proper way for herself  she had read some of his papers and hadnt understood them but it was at home at her aunts that her curiosity had been kindledkindled mainly by his wifes remarkable stories of his want of virtue  i suppose they ought to have kept me away my companion dropped and i suppose theyd have done so if i hadnt somehow got an idea that hes fascinating  in fact mrs saltram herself says he is  so you came to see where the fascination resides  well youve seen  my young lady raised fine eyebrows  do you mean in his bad faith  in the extraordinary effects of it his possession that is of some quality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the humiliation as i may call it to which he has subjected us  the humiliation  why mine for instance as one of his guarantors before you as the purchaser of a ticket  she let her charming gay eyes rest on me  you dont look humiliated a bit and if you did i should let you off disappointed as i am for the mysterious quality you speak of is just the quality i came to see  oh you cant see it i cried  how then do you get at it  you dont  you mustnt suppose hes goodlooking i added  why his wife says hes lovely  my hilarity may have struck her as excessive but i confess it broke out afresh  had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea so characteristic on mrs saltrams part of what was irritating in the narrowness of that ladys point of view  mrs saltram i explained undervalues him where hes strongest so that to make up for it perhaps she overpraises him where hes weak  hes not assuredly superficially attractive hes middle aged fat featureless save for his great eyes  yes his great eyes said my young lady attentively  she had evidently heard all about his great eyesthe beaux yeux for which alone we had really done it all  theyre tragic and splendidlights on a dangerous coast  but he moves badly and dresses worse and altogether hes anything but smart  my companion who appeared to reflect on this after a moment appealed  do you call him a real gentleman  i started slightly at the question for i had a sense of recognising it  george gravener years before that first flushed night had put me face to face with it  it had embarrassed me then but it didnt embarrass me now for i had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it  a real gentleman  emphatically not  my promptitude surprised her a little but i quickly felt how little it was to gravener i was now talking  do you say that because heswhat do you call it in englandof humble extraction  not a bit  his father was a country schoolmaster and his mother the widow of a sexton but that has nothing to do with it  i say it simply because i know him well  but isnt it an awful drawback  awfulquite awful  i mean isnt it positively fatal  fatal to what  not to his magnificent vitality  again she had a meditative moment  and is his magnificent vitality the cause of his vices  your questions are formidable but im glad you put them  i was thinking of his noble intellect  his vices as you say have been much exaggerated  they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect  a want of will  a want of dignity  he doesnt recognise his obligations  on the contrary he recognises them with effusion especially in public  he smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them but when they pass over he turns away and he speedily loses them in the crowd  the recognitions purely spiritualit isnt in the least social  so he leaves all his belongings to other people to take care of  he accepts favours loans sacrificesall with nothing more deterrent than an agony of shame  fortunately were a little faithful band and we do what we can  i held my tongue about the natural children engendered to the number of three in the wantonness of his youth  i only remarked that he did make effortsoften tremendous ones  but the efforts i said never come to much  the only things that come to much are the abandonments the surrenders  and how much do they come to  youre right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay but as ive told you before your questions are rather terrible  they come these mere exercises of genius to a great sum total of poetry of philosophy a mighty mass of speculation notation quotation  the genius is there you see to meet the surrender but theres no genius to support the defence  but what is there after all at his age to show  in the way of achievement recognised and reputation established i asked  to show if you will there isnt much since his writing mostly isnt as fine isnt certainly as showy as his talk  moreover twothirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements  showing frank saltram is often a poor business i went on  we endeavoured youll have observed to show him tonight  however if he had lectured hed have lectured divinely  it would just have been his talk  and what would his talk just have been  i was conscious of some ineffectiveness as well perhaps as of a little impatience as i replied  the exhibition of a splendid intellect  my young lady looked not quite satisfied at this but as i wasnt prepared for another question i hastily pursued  the sight of a great suspended swinging crystalhuge lucid lustrous a block of lightflashing back every impression of life and every possibility of thought  this gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky porch of the hall in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were almost the only thing saltrams treachery hadnt extinguished  i went with her to the door of her carriage out of which she leaned a moment after she had thanked me and taken her seat  her smile even in the darkness was pretty  i do want to see that crystal  youve only to come to the next lecture  i go abroad in a day or two with my aunt  wait over till next week i suggested  its quite worth it  she became grave  not unless he really comes  at which the brougham started off carrying her away too fast fortunately for my manners to allow me to exclaim ingratitude    chapter iv    mrs saltram made a great affair of her right to be informed where her husband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience  she came to me to ascertain but i couldnt satisfy her for in spite of my ingenuity i remained in ignorance  it wasnt till much later that i found this had not been the case with kent mulville whose hope for the best never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened to know the worst  he had known it on the occasion i speak ofthat is immediately after  he was impenetrable then but ultimately confessed  what he confessed was more than i shall now venture to make public  it was of course familiar to me that saltram was incapable of keeping the engagements which after their separation he had entered into with regard to his wife a deeply wronged justly resentful quite irreproachable and insufferable person  she often appeared at my chambers to talk over his lapses for if as she declared she had washed her hands of him she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution which she handed about for analysis  she had arts of her own of exciting ones impatience the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption that we were kind to her because we liked her  in reality her personal fall had been a sort of social risesince i had seen the moment when in our little conscientious circle her desolation almost made her the fashion her voice was grating and her children ugly moreover she hated the good mulvilles whom i more and more loved  they were the people who by doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself and the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a pressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability  im bound to say he didnt criticise his benefactors though practically he got tired of them she however had the highest standards about eleemosynary forms  she offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by dependence and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society  she pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she doubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me  i dare say i should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of imaginationif it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard saltrams expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate subjects of woe  they were all flowers of his character pearls strung on an endless thread but she had a stubborn little way of challenging them one after the other as if she never suspected that he had a character such as it was or that deficiencies might be organic the irritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation  one might doubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for such a man but if this had happened it would have been through ones feeling that there could be none for such a woman  i recognised her superiority when i asked her about the aunt of the disappointed young lady  it sounded like a sentence from an englishfrench or other phrasebook  she triumphed in what she told me and she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld my friend of the other evening miss anvoy had but lately come to england lady coxon the aunt had been established here for years in consequence of her marriage with the late sir gregory of that name  she had a house in the regents park a bathchair and a fernery and above all she had sympathy  mrs saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends  this vagueness caused me to feel how much i was out of it and how large an independent circle mrs saltram had at her command  i should have been glad to know more about the disappointed young lady but i felt i should know most by not depriving her of her advantage as she might have mysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge  for the present moreover this experience was stayed lady coxon having in fact gone abroad accompanied by her niece  the niece besides being immensely clever was an heiress mrs saltram said the only daughter and the light of the eyes of some great american merchant a man over there of endless indulgences and dollars  she had pretty clothes and pretty manners and she had what was prettier still the great thing of all  the great thing of all for mrs saltram was always sympathy and she spoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightnt know where to turn for it  a few months later indeed when they had come back her tone perceptibly changed  she alluded to them on my leading her up to it rather as to persons in her debt for favours received  what had happened i didnt know but i saw it would take only a little more or a little less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social countenancepeople for whom she had vainly tried to do something  i confess i saw how it wouldnt be in a mere week or two that i should rid myself of the image of ruth anvoy in whose very name when i learnt it i found something secretly to like  i should probably neither see her nor hear of her again  the knights widow he had been mayor of clockborough would pass away and the heiress would return to her inheritance  i gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to his wife the story of her attempt to hear mrsaltram and i founded this reticence on the easy supposition that mrs saltram had fatigued by overpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted  the girl at any rate would forget the small adventure be distracted take a husband besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment  we clung to the idea of the brilliant course delivered without an accident that as a lecturer would still make the paying public aware of our great man but the fact remained that in the case of an inspiration so unequal there was treachery there was fallacy at least in the very conception of a series  in our scrutiny of ways and means we were inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis the syllabus partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free hand in drawing up such things but for myself i laughed at our playbills even while i stickled for them  it was indeed amusing work to be scrupulous for frank saltram who also at moments laughed about it so far as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass for such a sound  he admitted with a candour all his own that he was in truth only to be depended on in the mulvilles drawingroom  yes he suggestively allowed its there i think that im at my best quite late when it gets toward elevenand if ive not been too much worried we all knew what too much worry meant it meant too enslaved for the hour to the superstition of sobriety  on the saturdays i used to bring my portmanteau so as not to have to think of eleven oclock trains  i had a bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of cushioned chintz its pictures and its flowers its large fireside and clear lamplight we might really arrive at something if the mulvilles would but charge for admission  here it was however that they shamelessly broke down as theres a flaw in every perfection this was the inexpugnable refuge of their egotism  they declined to make their saloon a market so that saltrams golden words continued the sole coin that rang there  it can have happened to no man however to be paid a greater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his greatest nights  the most profane on these occasions felt a presence all minor eloquence grew dumb  adelaide mulville for the pride of her hospitality anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire  i used to call it the musicroom for we had anticipated bayreuth  the very gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of thought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea  in the consideration of ways and means the sittings of our little board we were always conscious of the creak of mrs saltrams shoes  she hovered she interrupted she almost presided the state of affairs being mostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was to be done next  it was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that in concatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather led her so often to my door  she thought us spiritless creatures with editors and publishers but she carried matters to no great effect when she personally pushed into backshops  she wanted all moneys to be paid to herself  they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures  they trickled away into the desertthey were mainly at best alas a slender stream  the editors and the publishers were the last people to take this remarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be established  the former were halfdistraught between the desire to cut him and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears and when a volume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they suggested alternative titles which as reported to our friend brought into his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome  the title of an unwritten book didnt after all much matter but some masterpiece of saltrams may have died in his bosom of the shudder with which it was then convulsed  the ideal solution failing the fee at kent mulvilles door would have been some system of subscription to projected treatises with their non appearance provided forprovided for i mean by the indulgence of subscribers  the authors real misfortune was that subscribers were so wretchedly literal  when they tastelessly enquired why publication hadnt ensued i was tempted to ask who in the world had ever been so published  nature herself had brought him out in voluminous form and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work    chapter v    i was doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years but there were sacrifices i declined to make and i never passed the hat to george gravener  i never forgot our little discussion in ebury street and i think it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal i had found so easy to mss anvoy  it had cost me nothing to confide to this charming girl but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of my youth that the character of the real gentleman wasnt an attribute of the man i took such pains for  was this because i had already generalised to the point of perceiving that women are really the unfastidious sex  i knew at any rate that gravener already quite in view but still hungry and frugal had naturally enough more ambition than charity  he had sharp aims for stray sovereigns being in view most from the tall steeple of clockborough  his immediate ambition was to occupy e lui seul the field of vision of that smokilyseeing city and all his movements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle the movement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully with the posture of the hand on the heart  he talked to clockborough in short only less beguilingly than frank saltram talked to his electors with the difference to our credit however that we had already voted and that our candidate had no antagonist but himself  he had more than once been at wimbledonit was mrs mulvilles work not mineand by the time the claret was served had seen the god descend  he took more pains to swing his censer than i had expected but on our way back to town he forestalled any little triumph i might have been so artless as to express by the observation that such a man wasa hundred timesa man to use and never a man to be used by  i remember that this neat remark humiliated me almost as much as if virtually in the fever of broken slumbers i hadnt often made it myself  the difference was that on graveners part a force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine  he was able to use peoplehe had the machinery and the irony of saltrams being made showy at clockborough came out to me when he said as if he had no memory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him  i hate his type you know but ill be hanged if i dont put some of those things in  i can find a place for them  we might even find a place for the fellow himself  i myself should have had some fear not i need scarcely say for the things themselves but for some other things very near them in fine for the rest of my eloquence  later on i could see that the oracle of wimbledon was not in this case so appropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only coincided more exactly with those of the party  there was a distinct moment when without saying anything more definite to me gravener entertained the idea of annexing mr saltram  such a project was delusive for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and that pressed from headquarters upon clockboroughthe bottling in a word of the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in cornexchangeswas an experiment for which no one had the leisure  the only thing would have been to carry him massively about paid caged clipped to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular channel frank saltrams channel however was essentially not calculable and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have ensued for what there would have been to do the empire the great newspaper was there to look to but it was no new misfortune that there were delicate situations in which the empire broke down  in fine there was an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist commissioned to report on mr saltram might never come back from the errand  no one knew better than george gravener that that was a time when prompt returns counted double  if he therefore found our friend an exasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being as he said poor gravener up in the clouds not because he was down in the dust  the man would have been just as he was a real enough gentleman if he could have helped to put in a real gentleman  graveners great objection to the actual member was that he was not one  lady coxon had a fine old house a house with grounds at clockborough which she had let but after she returned from abroad i learned from mrs saltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume possession  i could see the faded red livery the big square shoulders the highwalled garden of this decent abode  as the rumble of dissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit and i found myself hoping the politics of the late mayors widow wouldnt be such as to admonish her to ask him to dinner perhaps indeed i went so far as to pray they would naturally form a bar to any contact  i tried to focus the manybuttoned page in the daily airing as he perhaps even pushed the bathchair over somebodys toes  i was destined to hear none the less through mrs saltramwho i afterwards learned was in correspondence with lady coxons housekeeperthat gravener was known to have spoken of the habitation i had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at clockborough  on his part i was sure this was the voice not of envy but of experience  the vivid scene was now peopled and i could see him in the oldtime garden with miss anvoy who would be certain and very justly to think him good looking  it would be too much to describe myself as troubled by this play of surmise but i occur to remember the relief singular enough of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an annoyance really much greater an annoyance the result of its happening to come over me about that time with a rush that i was simply ashamed of frank saltram  there were limits after all and my mark at last had been reached  i had had my disgusts if i may allow myself today such an expression but this was a supreme revolt  certain things cleared up in my mind certain values stood out  it was all very well to have an unfortunate temperament there was nothing so unfortunate as to have for practical purposes nothing else  i avoided george gravener at this moment and reflected that at such a time i should do so most effectually by leaving england  i wanted to forget frank saltramthat was all  i didnt want to do anything in the world to him but that  indignation had withered on the stalk and i felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only by never thinking of him again  it wasnt for anything he had done to me it was for what he had done to the mulvilles  adelaide cried about it for a week and her husband profiting by the example so signally given him of the fatal effect of a want of character left the letter the drop too much unanswered  the letter an incredible one addressed by saltram to wimbledon during a stay with the pudneys at ramsgate was the central feature of the incident which however had many features each more painful than whichever other we compared it with  the pudneys had behaved shockingly but that was no excuse  base ingratitude gross indecencyone had ones choice only of such formulas as that the more they fitted the less they gave one rest  these are dead aches now and i am under no obligation thank heaven to be definite about the business  there are things which if i had had to tell themwell would have stopped me off here altogether  i went abroad for the general election and if i dont know how much on the continent i forgot i at least know how much i missed him  at a distance in a foreign land ignoring abjuring unlearning him i discovered what he had done for me  i owed him oh unmistakeably certain noble conceptions i had lighted my little taper at his smoky lamp and lo it continued to twinkle but the light it gave me just showed me how much more i wanted  i was pursued of course by letters from mrs saltram which i didnt scruple not to read though quite aware her embarrassments couldnt but be now of the gravest  i sacrificed to propriety by simply putting them away and this is how one day as my absence drew to an end my eye while i rummaged in my desk for another paper was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the packet  the allusion was to miss anvoy who it appeared was engaged to be married to mr george gravener and the news was two months old  a direct question of mrs saltrams had thus remained unansweredshe had enquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a hand might be  the great other fact about him just then was that he had been triumphantly returned for clockborough in the interest of the party that had swept the countryso that i might easily have referred mrs saltram to the journals of the day  yet when i at last wrote her that i was coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her i but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to miss anvoy    chapter vi    i had almost avoided the general election but some of its consequences on my return had smartly to be faced  the season in london began to breathe again and to flap its folded wings confidence under the new ministry was understood to be reviving and one of the symptoms in a social body was a recovery of appetite  people once more fed together and it happened that one saturday night at somebodys house i fed with george gravener when the ladies left the room i moved up to where he sat and begged to congratulate him  on my election he asked after a moment so that i could feign jocosely not to have heard of that triumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more personal  i dare say i coloured however for his political success had momentarily passed out of my mind  what was present to it was that he was to marry that beautiful girl and yet his question made me conscious of some discomposurei hadnt intended to put this before everything  he himself indeed ought gracefully to have done so and i remember thinking the whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what he had won i had fixed my thoughts on his seat  we straightened the matter out and he was so much lighter in hand than i had lately seen him that his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source  he was so good as to say that he hoped i should soon make the acquaintance of miss anvoy who with her aunt was presently coming up to town  lady coxon in the country had been seriously unwell and this had delayed their arrival  i told him i had heard the marriage would be a splendid one on which brightened and humanised by his luck he laughed and said do you mean for her  when i had again explained what i meant he went on  oh shes an american but youd scarcely know it unless perhaps he added by her being used to more money than most girls in england even the daughters of rich men  that wouldnt in the least do for a fellow like me you know if it wasnt for the great liberality of her father  he really has been most kind and everythings quite satisfactory he added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous fancy to her and that during a recent visit at coldfield she had nearly won over lady maddock  i gathered from something he dropped later on that the freehanded gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement but had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to across the water for other favours  people are simplified alike by great contentments and great yearnings and whether or no it was graveners directness that begot my own i seem to recall that in some turn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to ask if miss anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt  my enquiry drew out that lady coxon who was the oddest of women would have in any contingency to act under her late husbands will which was odder still saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with queer loopholes  there were several dreary people coxon cousins old maids to whom she would have more or less to minister  gravener laughed without saying no when i suggested that the young lady might come in through a loophole then suddenly as if he suspected my turning a lantern on him he declared quite dryly  thats all rotones moved by other springs  a fortnight later at lady coxons own house i understood well enough the springs one was moved by  gravener had spoken of me there as an old friend and i received a gracious invitation to dine  the knights widow was again indisposedshe had succumbed at the eleventh hour so that i found miss anvoy bravely playing hostess without even graveners help since to make matters worse he had just sent up word that the house the insatiable house with which he supposed he had contracted for easier terms positively declined to release him  i was struck with the courage the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the fauna and flora of the regents park  i did what i could to help her to classify them after i had recovered from the confusion of seeing her slightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her intended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about frank saltram  i had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was a person who could carry a responsibility but i leave the reader to judge of my sense of the aggravation for either of us of such a burden when i heard the servant announce mrs saltram  from what immediately passed between the two ladies i gathered that the latter had been sent for posthaste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of the house  good i remember crying shell be put by me and my apprehension was promptly justified  mrs saltram taken in to dinner and taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability was mrs saltram with a vengeance  i asked myself what miss anvoy meant by doing such things but the only answer i arrived at was that gravener was verily fortunate  she hadnt happened to tell him of her visit to upper baker street but shed certainly tell him tomorrow not indeed that this would make him like any better her having had the innocence to invite such a person as mrs saltram on such an occasion  it could only strike me that i had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her cleverness such freedom into her modesty this i think was when after dinner she said to me frankly with almost jubilant mirth  oh you dont admire mrs saltram  why should i  this was truly a young person without guile  i had briefly to consider before i could reply that my objection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people met at the social boardi knew all her stories  then as miss anvoy remained momentarily vague i added  those about her husband  oh yes but there are some new ones  none for me  ah novelty would be pleasant  doesnt it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid  his fluctuations dont matter i returned for at night all cats are grey  you saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him together  what will you have  he has no dignity  miss anvoy who had been introducing with her american distinctness looked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked  its too bad i cant see him  you mean gravener wont let you  i havent asked him  he lets me do everything  but you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him  we havent happened to talk of him the girl said  get him to take you some day out to see the mulvilles  i thought mr saltram had thrown the mulvilles over  utterly  but that wont prevent his being planted there again to bloom like a rose within a month or two  miss anvoy thought a moment  then i should like to see them she said with her fostering smile  theyre tremendously worth it  you mustnt miss them  ill make george take me she went on as mrs saltram came up to interrupt us  she sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had smiled at me and addressing the question to her continued  but the chance of a lectureone of the wonderful lectures  isnt there another course announced  another  there are about thirty i exclaimed turning away and feeling mrs saltrams little eyes in my back  a few days after this i heard that graveners marriage was near at handwas settled for whitsuntide but as no invitation had reached me i had my doubts and there presently came to me in fact the report of a postponement  something was the matter what was the matter was supposed to be that lady coxon was now critically ill  i had called on her after my dinner in the regents park but i had neither seen her nor seen miss anvoy  i forget today the exact order in which at this period sundry incidents occurred and the particular stage at which it suddenly struck me making me catch my breath a little that the progression the acceleration was for all the world that of fine drama  this was probably rather late in the day and the exact order doesnt signify  what had already occurred was some accident determining a more patient wait  george gravener whom i met again in fact told me as much but without signs of perturbation  lady coxon had to be constantly attended to and there were other good reasons as well  lady coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the occasion of a second attempt in the regents park i equally failed to obtain a sight of her niece  i judged it discreet in all the conditions not to make a third but this didnt matter for it was through adelaide mulville that the sidewind of the comedy though i was at first unwitting began to reach me  i went to wimbledon at times because saltram was there and i went at others because he wasnt  the pudneys who had taken him to birmingham had already got rid of him and we had a horrible consciousness of his wandering roofless in dishonour about the smoky midlands almost as the injured lear wandered on the stormlashed heath  his room upstairs had been lately done up i could hear the crackle of the new chintz and the difference only made his smirches and bruises his splendid tainted genius the more tragic  if he wasnt barefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod  these were the things adelaide and i who were old enough friends to stare at each other in silence talked about when we didnt speak  when we spoke it was only about the brilliant girl george gravener was to marry and whom he had brought out the other sunday  i could see that this presentation had been happy for mrs mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion of showing confidence in a new relation she likes meshe likes me  her native humility exulted in that measure of success  we all knew for ourselves how she liked those who liked her and as regards ruth anvoy she was more easily won over than lady maddock    chapter vii    one of the consequences for the mulvilles of the sacrifices they made for frank saltram was that they had to give up their carriage adelaide drove gently into london in a onehorse greenish thing an early victorian landau hired near at hand imaginatively from a brokendown jobmaster whose wife was in consumptiona vehicle that made people turn round all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat and a shawl one of the dear womans own this was his position and i dare say his costume when on an afternoon in july she went to return miss anvoys visit  the wheel of fate had now revolved and amid silences deep and exhaustive compunctions and condonations alike unutterable saltram was reinstated  was it in pride or in penance that mrs mulville had begun immediately to drive him about  if he was ashamed of his ingratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness but she was incorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while she was in shops or with her acquaintance  however if he was in the pillory for twenty minutes in the regents parki mean at lady coxons door while his companion paid her callit wasnt to the further humiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in person not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew him in to be introduced to the bright young american  her account of the introduction i had in its order but before that very late in the season under graveners auspices i met miss anvoy at tea at the house of commons  the member for clockborough had gathered a group of pretty ladies and the mulvilles were not of the party  on the great terrace as i strolled off with her a little the guest of honour immediately exclaimed to me  ive seen him you knowive seen him  she told me about saltrams call  and how did you find him  oh so strange  you didnt like him  i cant tell till i see him again  you want to do that  she had a pause  immensely  we went no further i fancied she had become aware gravener was looking at us  she turned back toward the knot of the others and i said  dislike him as much as you willi see youre bitten  bitten  i thought she coloured a little  oh it doesnt matter i laughed one doesnt die of it  i hope i shant die of anything before ive seen more of mrs mulville  i rejoiced with her over plain adelaide whom she pronounced the loveliest woman she had met in england but before we separated i remarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if she should see more of frank saltramwhich would be likely to follow on any increase of acquaintance with mrs mulvilleshe might find herself flattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal questionthat of the relative that of the opposed importances of virtue and brains  she replied that this was surely a subject on which one took everything for granted whereupon i admitted that i had perhaps expressed myself ill  what i referred to was what i had referred to the night we met in upper baker streetthe relative importance relative to virtue of other gifts  she asked me if i called virtue a gifta thing handed to us in a parcel on our first birthday and i declared that this very enquiry proved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt  she would have help however the same help i myself had once had in resisting its tendency to make one cross  what help do you mean  that of the member for clockborough  she stared smiled then returned  why my idea has been to help him  she had helped himi had his own word for it that at clockborough her bedevilment of the voters had really put him in  she would do so doubtless again and again though i heard the very next month that this fine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse  news of the catastrophe first came to me from mrs saltram and it was afterwards confirmed at wimbledon  poor miss anvoy was in trouble great disasters in america had suddenly summoned her home  her father in new york had suffered reverses lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how much he had had  it was adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at less than a weeks notice  alone  gravener has permitted that  what will you have  the house of commons  im afraid i cursed the house of commons  i was so much interested  of course hed follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife only she mightnt now be able to bring him anything like the marriageportion of which he had begun by having the virtual promise  mrs mulville let me know what was already said  she was charming this american girl but really these american fathers  what was a man to do  mr saltram according to mrs mulville was of opinion that a man was never to suffer his relation to money to become a spiritual relationhe was to keep it exclusively material  moi pas comprendre i commented on this in rejoinder to which adelaide with her beautiful sympathy explained that she supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it dont you know but not to think too much about it  to take it but not to thank you for it i still more profanely enquired  for a quarter of an hour afterwards she wouldnt look at me but this didnt prevent my asking her what had been the result that afternoonin the regents park of her taking our friend to see miss anvoy  oh so charming she answered brightening  he said he recognised in her a nature he could absolutely trust  yes but im speaking of the effect on herself  mrs mulville had to remount the stream  it was everything one could wish  something in her tone made me laugh  do you mean she gave hima dole  well since you ask me  right there on the spot  again poor adelaide faltered  it was to me of course she gave it  i stared somehow i couldnt see the scene  do you mean a sum of money  it was very handsome  now at last she met my eyes though i could see it was with an effort  thirty pounds  straight out of her pocket  out of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing  she just slipped the folded notes into my hand  he wasnt looking it was while he was going back to the carriage  oh said adelaide reassuringly i take care of it for him  the dear practical soul thought my agitation for i confess i was agitated referred to the employment of the money  her disclosure made me for a moment muse violently and i dare say that during that moment i wondered if anything else in the world makes people so gross as unselfishness i uttered i suppose some vague synthetic cry for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at such passages  i assure you my dear friend he was in one of his happy hours  but i wasnt thinking of that  truly indeed these americans i said  with her father in the very act as it were of swindling her betrothed  mrs mulville stared  oh i suppose mr anvoy has scarcely gone bankruptor whatever he has doneon purpose  very likely they wont be able to keep it up but there it was and it was a very beautiful impulse  you say saltram was very fine  beyond everything  he surprised even me  and i know what youve enjoyed  after a moment i added  had he peradventure caught a glimpse of the money in the tabledrawer  at this my companion honestly flushed  how can you be so cruel when you know how little he calculates  forgive me i do know it  but you tell me things that act on my nerves  im sure he hadnt caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea  mrs mulville brightly concurred  and perhaps even of her beautiful listening face  perhaps even  and what was it all about  his talk  it was apropos of her engagement which i had told him about  the idea of marriage the philosophy the poetry the sublimity of it  it was impossible wholly to restrain ones mirth at this and some rude ripple that i emitted again caused my companion to admonish me  it sounds a little stale but you know his freshness  of illustration  indeed i do  and how he has always been right on that great question  on what great question dear lady hasnt he been right  of what other great men can you equally say itand that he has never but never had a deflexion mrs mulville exultantly demanded  i tried to think of some other great man but i had to give it up didnt miss anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way than by her charming present i was reduced to asking instead  oh yes she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the carriage  these words somehow brushed up a picture of saltrams big shawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau  she said she wasnt disappointed adelaide pursued  i turned it over  did he wear his shawl  his shawl  she hadnt even noticed  i mean yours  he looked very nice and you know hes really clean  miss anvoy used such a remarkable expressionshe said his minds like a crystal  i pricked up my ears  a crystal  suspended in the moral worldswinging and shining and flashing there  shes monstrously clever you know  i thought again  monstrously    chapter viii    george gravener didnt follow her for late in september after the house had risen i met him in a railwaycarriage  he was coming up from scotland and i had just quitted some relations who lived near durham  the current of travel back to london wasnt yet strong at any rate on entering the compartment i found he had had it for some time to himself  we fared in company and though he had a blue book in his lap and the open jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused papers we inevitably we even at last sociably conversed  i saw things werent well with him but i asked no question till something dropped by himself made as it had made on another occasion an absence of curiosity invidious  he mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend lady coxon who with her niece likely to be detained some time in america lay seriously ill at clockborough much on his mind and on his hands  ah miss anvoys in america  her father has got into horrid straitshas lost no end of money  i waited after expressing due concern but i eventually said  i hope that raises no objection to your marriage  none whatever moreover its my trade to meet objections  but it may create tiresome delays of which there have been too many from various causes already  lady coxon got very bad then she got much better  then mr anvoy suddenly began to totter and now he seems quite on his back  im afraid hes really in for some big reverse  lady coxons worse again awfully upset by the news from america and she sends me word that she must have ruth  how can i supply her with ruth  i havent got ruth myself  surely you havent lost her i returned  shes everything to her wretched father  she writes me every posttelling me to smooth her aunts pillow  ive other things to smooth but the old lady save for her servants is really alone she wont receive her coxon relationsshes angry at so much of her money going to them  besides shes hopelessly mad said gravener very frankly  i dont remember whether it was this or what it was that made me ask if she hadnt such an appreciation of mrs saltram as might render that active person of some use  he gave me a cold glance wanting to know what had put mrs saltram into my head and i replied that she was unfortunately never out of it  i happened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the kindness lady coxon had shown her  gravener declared this to be false lady coxon who didnt care for her hadnt seen her three times  the only foundation for it was that miss anvoy who used poor girl to chuck money about in a manner she must now regret had for an hour seen in the miserable womanyou could never know what shed see in peoplean interesting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed  but even miss anvoy was now quite tired of her  gravener told me more about the crash in new york and the annoyance it had been to him and we also glanced here and there in other directions but by the time we got to doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was keeping something back  we stopped at that station and at the carriagedoor some one made a movement to get in  gravener uttered a sound of impatience and i felt sure that but for this i should have had the secret  then the intruder for some reason spared us his company we started afresh and my hope of a disclosure returned  my companion held his tongue however and i pretended to go to sleep in fact i really dozed for discouragement  when i reopened my eyes he was looking at me with an injured air  he tossed away with some vivacity the remnant of a cigarette and then said  if youre not too sleepy i want to put you a case  i answered that id make every effort to attend and welcomed the note of interest when he went on  as i told you a while ago lady coxon poor dear is demented  his tone had much behind itwas full of promise  i asked if her ladyships misfortune were a trait of her malady or only of her character and he pronounced it a product of both  the case he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to have the impression the judgement he might also sayof another person  i mean of the average intelligent man but you see i take what i can get there would be the technical the strictly legal view then there would be the way the question would strike a man of the world  he had lighted another cigarette while he talked and i saw he was glad to have it to handle when he brought out at last with a laugh slightly artificial  in fact its a subject on which miss anvoy and i are pulling different ways  and you want me to decide between you  i decide in advance for miss anvoy  in advancethats quite right  thats how i decided when i proposed to her  but my story will interest you only so far as your mind isnt made up  gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued  are you familiar with the idea of the endowment of research  of research i was at sea a moment  i give you lady coxons phrase  she has it on the brain  she wishes to endow  some earnest and loyal seeker gravener said  it was a sketchy design of her late husbands and he handed it on to her setting apart in his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for life but of which should she eventually see her opportunitythe matter was left largely to her discretionshe would best honour his memory by determining the exemplary public use  this sum of money no less than thirteen thousand pounds was to be called the coxon fund and poor sir gregory evidently proposed to himself that the coxon fund should cover his name with glorybe universally desired and admired  he left his wife a full declaration of his views so far at least as that term may be applied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine  a little learnings a dangerous thing and a good citizen who happens to have been an ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage hes worst of all when hes dead because then he cant be stopped however such as they were the poor mans aspirations are now in his wifes bosom or fermenting rather in her foolish brain  it lies with her to carry them out  but of course she must first catch her hare  her earnest loyal seeker  the flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence as may aid the light thats in it to shine upon the human race  the individual in a word who having the rest of the machinery the spiritual the intellectual is most hampered in his search  his search for what  for moral truth  thats what sir gregory calls it  i burst out laughing  delightful munificent sir gregory  its a charming idea  so miss anvoy thinks  has she a candidate for the fund  not that i know ofand shes perfectly reasonable about it  but lady coxon has put the matter before her and weve naturally had a lot of talk  talk that as youve so interestingly intimated has landed you in a disagreement  she considers theres something in it gravener said  and you consider theres nothing  it seems to me a piece of solemn twaddlewhich cant fail to be attended with consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral  to begin with fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunala bench of competent people of judges  the sole tribunal is lady coxon  and any one she chooses to invite  but she has invited you i noted  im not competenti hate the thing  besides she hasnt my friend went on  the real history of the matter i take it is that the inspiration was originally lady coxons own that she infected him with it and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her beautiful her aboriginal enthusiasm she came to england forty years ago a thin transcendental bostonian and even her odd happy frumpy clockborough marriage never really materialised her  she feels indeed that she has become very britishas if that as a process as a werden as anything but an original sign of grace were conceivable but its precisely what makes her cling to the notion of the fundcling to it as to a link with the ideal  how can she cling if shes dying  do you mean how can she act in the matter gravener asked thats precisely the question  she cant  as she has never yet caught her hare never spied out her lucky impostorhow should she with the life she has ledher husbands intention has come very near lapsing  his idea to do him justice was that it should lapse if exactly the right person the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury should fail to turn up  ah the poor dear womans very particularshe says there must be no mistake  i found all this quite thrillingi took it in with avidity  and if she dies without doing anything what becomes of the money i demanded  it goes back to his family if she hasnt made some other disposition of it  she may do that thenshe may divert it  her hands are not tied  she has a grand discretion  the proof is that three months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece  for miss anvoys own use  for miss anvoys own useon the occasion of her prospective marriage  she was discouragedthe earnest seeker required so earnest a search  she was afraid of making a mistake every one she could think of seemed either not earnest enough or not poor enough  on the receipt of the first bad news about mr anvoys affairs she proposed to ruth to make the sacrifice for her  as the situation in new york got worse she repeated her proposal  which miss anvoy declined  except as a formal trust  you mean except as committing herself legally to place the money  on the head of the deserving object the great man frustrated said gravener  she only consents to act in the spirit of sir gregorys scheme  and you blame her for that i asked with some intensity  my tone couldnt have been harsh but he coloured a little and there was a queer light in his eye  my dear fellow if i blamed the young lady im engaged to i shouldnt immediately say it even to so old a friend as you  i saw that some deep discomfort some restless desire to be sided with reassuringly approvingly mirrored had been at the bottom of his drifting so far and i was genuinely touched by his confidence  it was inconsistent with his habits but being troubled about a woman was not for him a habit that itself was an inconsistency  george gravener could stand straight enough before any other combination of forces  it amused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an american accent a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father but all my old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that i could help him  i saw that i could from the insincere tone in which he pursued  ive criticised her of course ive contended with her and it has been great fun  yet it clearly couldnt have been such great fun as to make it improper for me presently to ask if miss anvoy had nothing at all settled on herself  to this he replied that she had only a trifle from her mothera mere four hundred a year which was exactly why it would be convenient to him that she shouldnt decline in the face of this total change in her prospects an accession of income which would distinctly help them to marry  when i enquired if there were no other way in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight of her benevolence to be felt he answered that lady coxon was affectionate indeed but was scarcely to be called rich  she could let her project of the fund lapse for her nieces benefit but she couldnt do anything else  she had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously provided for and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious coxons  she was a woman of an inordinate conscience and her conscience was now a distress to her hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of resentful husbands portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers  we were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms the multiplication of lights  i think youll find i said with a laugh that your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the philosopher is undiscoverable  he began to gather up his papers  who can set a limit to the ingenuity of an extravagant woman  yes after all who indeed i echoed as i recalled the extravagance commemorated in adelaides anecdote of miss anvoy and the thirty pounds    chapter ix    the thing i had been most sensible of in that talk with george gravener was the way saltrams name kept out of it  it seemed to me at the time that we were quite pointedly silent about him but afterwards it appeared more probable there had been on my companions part no conscious avoidance  later on i was sure of this and for the best of reasonsthe simple reason of my perceiving more completely that for evil as well as for good he said nothing to graveners imagination  that honest man didnt fear himhe was too much disgusted with him  no more did i doubtless and for very much the same reason  i treated my friends story as an absolute confidence but when before christmas by mrs saltram i was informed of lady coxons death without having had news of miss anvoys return i found myself taking for granted we should hear no more of these nuptials in which as obscurely unnatural i now saw i had never too disconcertedly believed  i began to ask myself how people who suited each other so little could please each other so much  the charm was some material charm some afffinity exquisite doubtless yet superficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion to force and grace and fortune happy accidents and easy contacts they might dote on each others persons but how could they know each others souls  how could they have the same prejudices how could they have the same horizon  such questions i confess seemed quenched but not answered when one day in february going out to wimbledon i found our young lady in the house  a passion that had brought her back across the wintry ocean was as much of a passion as was needed  no impulse equally strong indeed had drawn george gravener to america a circumstance on which however i reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none of my business  ruth anvoy was distinctly different and i felt that the difference was not simply that of her marks of mourning  mrs mulville told me soon enough what it was  it was the difference between a handsome girl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a year  this explanation indeed didnt wholly content me not even when i learned that her mourning had a double causelearned that poor mr anvoy giving way altogether buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving next to nothing had died a few weeks before  so she has come out to marry george gravener i commented wouldnt it have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble  hasnt the house just met adelaide replied  and for mr gravener the house  then she added  i gather that her having come is exactly a sign that the marriage is a little shaky  if it were quite all right a selfrespecting girl like ruth would have waited for him over there  i noted that they were already ruth and adelaide but what i said was  do you mean shell have had to return to make it so  no i mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of it  adelaide could only surmise however as yet and there was more as we found to be revealed  mrs mulville on hearing of her arrival had brought the young lady out in the green landau for the sunday  the coxons were in possession of the house in regents park and miss anvoy was in dreary lodgings  george gravener had been with her when adelaide called but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at wimbledon  the carriage with mr saltram in it but not mentioned had been sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the ladies up gravener had left them together and at the end of an hour on the saturday afternoon the party of three had driven out to wimbledon this was the girls second glimpse of our great man and i was interested in asking mrs mulville if the impression made by the first appeared to have been confirmed  on her replying after consideration that of course with time and opportunity it couldnt fail to be but that she was disappointed i was sufficiently struck with her use of this last word to question her further  do you mean youre disappointed because you judge miss anvoy to be  yes i hoped for a greater effect last evening  we had two or three people but he scarcely opened his mouth  hell be all the better tonight i opined after a moment  then i pursued  what particular importance do you attach to the idea of her being impressed  adelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity  why the importance of her being as happy as we are  im afraid that at this my levity grew  oh thats a happiness almost too great to wish a person  i saw she hadnt yet in her mind what i had in mine and at any rate the visitors actual bliss was limited to a walk in the garden with kent mulville  later in the afternoon i also took one and i saw nothing of miss anvoy till dinner at which we failed of the company of saltram who had caused it to be reported that he was indisposed and lying down this made us most of usfor there were other friends present convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable things that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of expressing  if a fine little american enquirer hadnt been there we would have expressed them otherwise and adelaide would have pretended not to hear  i had seen her before the very fact abstract herself nobly and i knew that more than once to keep it from the servants managing dissimulating cleverly she had helped her husband to carry him bodily to his room  just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so high that i had begun to get nervousto wonder if by chance there were something behind it if he were kept straight for instance by the knowledge that the hated pudneys would have more to tell us if they chose  he was lying low but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us in this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest pools  we should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had sprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel about our ears  kent mulville had been up to his room but had come back with a face that told as few tales as i had seen it succeed in telling on the evening i waited in the lectureroom with miss anvoy  i said to myself that our friend had gone out but it was a comfort that the presence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of suggesting to each other in respect of his errand edifying possibilities in which we didnt ourselves believe  at ten oclock he came into the drawingroom with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes sending out great signals  it was precisely with his entrance that i ceased to be vividly conscious of him  i saw that the crystal as i had called it had begun to swing and i had need of my immediate attention for miss anvoy  even when i was told afterwards that he had as we might have said today broken the record the manner in which that attention had been rewarded relieved me of a sense of loss  i had of course a perfect general consciousness that something great was going on it was a little like having been etherised to hear herr joachim play  the old music was in the air i felt the strong pulse of thought the sink and swell the flight the poise the plunge but i knew something about one of the listeners that nobody else knew and saltrams monologue could reach me only through that medium to this hour im of no use when as a witness im appealed tofor they still absurdly contend about itas to whether or no on that historic night he was drunk and my position is slightly ridiculous for ive never cared to tell them what it really was i was taken up with  what i got out of it is the only morsel of the total experience that is quite my own  the others were shared but this is incommunicable  i feel that now im bound to say even in thus roughly evoking the occasion and it takes something from my pride of clearness  however i shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if i remark that our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of observation to be sensible of mine  it was plainly not the question of her marriage that had brought her back  i greatly enjoyed this discovery and was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have stirred no step  in this case doubtless gravener would in spite of the house of commons have found means to rejoin her  it afterwards made me uncomfortable for her that alone in the lodging mrs mulville had put before me as dreary she should have in any degree the air of waiting for her fate so that i was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone to stay at coldfield  if she was in england at all while the engagement stood the only proper place for her was under lady maddocks wing  now that she was unfortunate and relatively poor perhaps her prospective sisterinlaw would be wholly won over  there would be much to say if i had space about the way her behaviour as i caught gleams of it ministered to the image that had taken birth in my mind to my private amusement while that other night i listened to george gravener in the railwaycarriage i watched her in the light of this queer possibilitya formidable thing certainly to meetand i was aware that it coloured extravagantly perhaps my interpretation of her very looks and tones  at wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me she was literally afraid of saltram in dread of a coercion that she had begun already to feel  i had come up to town with her the next day and had been convinced that though deeply interested she was immensely on her guard  she would show as little as possible before she should be ready to show everything  what this final exhibition might be on the part of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out i found it great sport to forecast  it would have been exciting to be approached by her appealed to by her for advice but i prayed to heaven i mightnt find myself in such a predicament  if there was really a present rigour in the situation of which gravener had sketched for me the elements she would have to get out of her difficulty by herself  it wasnt i who had launched her and it wasnt i who could help her  i didnt fail to ask myself why since i couldnt help her i should think so much about her  it was in part my suspense that was responsible for this i waited impatiently to see whether she wouldnt have told mrs mulville a portion at least of what i had learned from gravener  but i saw mrs mulville was still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadnt come as a conciliatory bride  that she had come in some other character was the only thing that fitted all the appearances  having for family reasons to spend some time that spring in the west of england i was in a manner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumblei mean of the continuous hum of saltrams thoughtand my uneasiness tended to keep me quiet  there was something i wanted so little to have to say that my prudence surmounted my curiosity  i only wondered if ruth anvoy talked over the idea of the coxon fund with lady maddock and also somewhat why i didnt hear from wimbledon  i had a reproachful note about something or other from mrs saltram but it contained no mention of lady coxons niece on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent untoward events    chapter x    poor adelaides silence was fully explained laterpractically explained when in june returning to london i was honoured by this admirable woman with an early visit  as soon as she arrived i guessed everything and as soon as she told me that darling ruth had been in her house nearly a month i had my question ready what in the name of maidenly modesty is she staying in england for  because she loves me so cried adelaide gaily  but she hadnt come to see me only to tell me miss anvoy loved her  that was quite sufficiently established and what was much more to the point was that mr gravener had now raised an objection to it  he had protested at least against her being at wimbledon where in the innocence of his heart he had originally brought her himself he called on her to put an end to their engagement in the only proper the only happy manner  and why in the world doesnt she do do i asked  adelaide had a pause  she says you know  then on my also hesitating she added  a condition he makes  the coxon fund i panted  he has mentioned to her his having told you about it  ah but so little  do you mean she has accepted the trust  in the most splendid spiritas a duty about which there can be no two opinions  to which my friend added  of course shes thinking of mr saltram  i gave a quick cry at this which in its violence made my visitor turn pale  how very awful  awful  why to have anything to do with such an idea ones self  im sure you neednt and mrs mulville tossed her head  he isnt good enough i went on to which she opposed a sound almost as contentious as my own had been  this made me with genuine immediate horror exclaim  you havent influenced her i hope and my emphasis brought back the blood with a rush to poor adelaides face  she declared while she blushedfor i had frightened her againthat she had never influenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged for herself  he had influenced her if i would as he did every one who had a soul that word as we knew even expressed feebly the power of the things he said to haunt the mind  how could she adelaide help it if miss anvoys mind was haunted  i demanded with a groan what right a pretty girl engaged to a rising mp had to have a mind but the only explanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so clever  she regarded mr saltram naturally as a tremendous force for good  she was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough to admire  shes many things enough but is she among them rich enough i demanded  rich enough i mean to sacrifice such a lot of good money  thats for herself to judge  besides its not her own money she doesnt in the least consider it so  and gravener does if not his own and thats the whole difficulty  the difficulty that brought her back yes  she had absolutely to see her poor aunts solicitor  its clear that by lady coxons will she may have the money but its still clearer to her conscience that the original condition definite intensely implied on her uncles part is attached to the use of it  she can only take one view of it  its for the endowment or its for nothing  the endowment i permitted myself to observe is a conception superficially sublime but fundamentally ridiculous  are you repeating mr graveners words adelaide asked  possibly though ive not seen him for months  its simply the way it strikes me too  its an old wifes tale  gravener made some reference to the legal aspect but such an absurdly loose arrangement has no legal aspect  ruth doesnt insist on that said mrs mulville and its for her exactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral obligation  are you repeating her words i enquired  i forget what else adelaide said but she said she was magnificent  i thought of george gravener confronted with such magnificence as that and i asked what could have made two such persons ever suppose they understood each other  mrs mulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and that she suffered as such a woman could suffer  nevertheless she wanted to see me  at this i sprang up with a groan  oh im so sorrywhen  small though her sense of humour i think adelaide laughed at my sequence  we discussed the day the nearest it would be convenient i should come out but before she went i asked my visitor how long she had been acquainted with these prodigies  for several weeks but i was pledged to secrecy  and thats why you didnt write  i couldnt very well tell you she was with me without telling you that no time had even yet been fixed for her marriage  and i couldnt very well tell you as much as that without telling you what i knew of the reason of it  it was not till a day or two ago mrs mulville went on that she asked me to ask you if you wouldnt come and see her  then at last she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the endowment  i turned this over  why on earth does she want to see me  to talk with you naturally about mr saltram  as a subject for the prize  this was hugely obvious and i presently returned  i think ill sail tomorrow for australia  well thensail said mrs mulville getting up  but i frivolously continued  on thursday at five we said  the appointment was made definite and i enquired how all this time the unconscious candidate had carried himself  in perfection really by the happiest of chances  he has positively been a dear  and then as to what we revere him for in the most wonderful form  his very highestpure celestial light you wont do him an ill turn adelaide pleaded at the door  what danger can equal for him the danger to which hes exposed from himself i asked  look out sharp if he has lately been too prim  hell presently take a day off treat us to some exhibition that will make an endowment a scandal  a scandal mrs mulville dolorously echoed  is miss anvoy prepared for that  my visitor for a moment screwed her parasol into my carpet  he grows bigger every day  so do you i laughed as she went off  that girl at wimbledon on the thursday afternoon more than justified my apprehensions  i recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had produced in me from the firstthe faint foreknowledge that there was something very stiff i should have to do for her  i felt more than ever committed to my fate as standing before her in the big drawingroom where they had tactfully left us to ourselves i tried with a smile to string together the pearls of lucidity which from her chair she successively tossed me  pale and bright in her monotonous mourning she was an image of intelligent purpose of the passion of duty but i asked myself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that which permitted her to laugh out as for the joy of her difficulty into the priggish old room  this remarkable young woman could be earnest without being solemn and at moments when i ought doubtless to have cursed her obstinacy i found myself watching the unstudied play of her eyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by the parting of her lips  these aberrations i hasten to add didnt prevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me  her reason for this was as distinct as her beauty  it was to make me explain what i had meant on the occasion of our first meeting by mr saltrams want of dignity  it wasnt that she couldnt imagine but she desired it there from my lips  what she really desired of course was to know whether there was worse about him than what she had found out for herself  she hadnt been a month so much in the house with him without discovering that he wasnt a man of monumental bronze  he was like a jelly minus its mould he had to be embanked and that was precisely the source of her interest in him and the ground of her project  she put her project boldly before me  there it stood in its preposterous beauty  she was as willing to take the humorous view of it as i could be  the only difference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasnt necessarily prohibitive wasnt paralysing  moreover she professed that she couldnt discuss with me the primary questionthe moral obligation  that was in her own breast  there were things she couldnt go intoinjunctions impressions she had received  they were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her aunt they were absolutely clear to her and on questions of delicacy the interpretation of a fidelity of a promise one had always in the last resort to make up ones mind for ones self  it was the idea of the application to the particular case such a splendid one at last that troubled her and she admitted that it stirred very deep things  she didnt pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter if it had been she wouldnt have attempted to saddle me with any portion of it  the mulvilles were sympathy itself but were they absolutely candid  could they indeed be in their positionwould it even have been to be desired  yes she had sent for me to ask no less than that of mewhether there was anything dreadful kept back she made no allusion whatever to george graveneri thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety perhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion the effect of a determination that people shouldnt know from herself that her relations with the man she was to marry were strained  all the weight however that she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight he had thrown in vain  oh she knew the question of character was immense and that one couldnt entertain any plan for making merit comfortable without running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of interrogationpoints which like a young ladies school out for a walk hooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess conduct  but were we absolutely to hold that there was never never never an exception never never never an occasion for liberal acceptance for clever charity for suspended pedantry for letting one side in short outbalance another  when miss anvoy threw off this appeal i could have embraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to mrs saltram  why not have the courage of ones forgiveness she asked as well as the enthusiasm of ones adhesion  seeing how wonderfully youve threshed the whole thing out i evasively replied gives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm has reached  she considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine and i divined that it struck her i might possibly intend it as a reference to some personal subjection to our fat philosopher to some aberration of sensibility some perversion of taste  at least i couldnt interpret otherwise the sudden flash that came into her face  such a manifestation as the result of any word of mine embarrassed me but while i was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile of exquisite good nature  oh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one dislikes him she said and if her tone simply extinguished his strange figure with the brush of its compassion it also rings in my ear today as the purest of all our praises  but with what quick response of fine pity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh ah poor saltram  she instantly with this took the measure of all i didnt believe and it enabled her to go on  what can one do when a person has given such a lift to ones interest in life  yes what can one do  if i struck her as a little vague it was because i was thinking of another person  i indulged in another inarticulate murmurpoor george gravener  what had become of the lift he had given that interest  later on i made up my mind that she was sore and stricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money  this was the hidden reason of her alienation  the probable sincerity in spite of the illiberality of his scruples about the particular use of it under discussion didnt efface the ugliness of his demand that they should buy a good house with it  then as for his alienation he didnt pardonably enough grasp the lift frank saltram had given her interest in life  if a mere spectator could ask that last question with what rage in his heart the man himself might  he wasnt like her i was to see too proud to show me why he was disappointed    chapter xi    i was unable this time to stay to dinner  such at any rate was the plea on which i took leave  i desired in truth to get away from my young lady for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her  how could i satisfy her  i asked myselfhow could i tell her how much had been kept back  i didnt even know and i certainly didnt desire to know  my own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor saltrams weaknessesnot to learn the most  a great deal that i had in fact learned had been forced upon me by his wife  there was something even irritating in miss anvoys crude conscientiousness and i wondered why after all she couldnt have let him alone and been content to entrust george gravener with the purchase of the good house  i was sure he would have driven a bargain got something excellent and cheap  i laughed louder even than she i temporised i failed her i told her i must think over her case  i professed a horror of responsibilities and twitted her with her own extravagant passion for them  it wasnt really that i was afraid of the scandal the moral discredit for the fund what troubled me most was a feeling of a different order  of course as the beneficiary of the fund was to enjoy a simple lifeinterest as it was hoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards it wouldnt be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldnt have been a striking example of the domestic virtues  the fund would start badly as it were and the laurel would in some respects at least scarcely be greener from the brows of the original wearer  that idea however was at that hour as i have hinted not the source of solicitude it ought perhaps to have been for i felt less the irregularity of saltrams getting the money than that of this exalted young womans giving it up  i wanted her to have it for herself and i told her so before i went away  she looked graver at this than she had looked at all saying she hoped such a preference wouldnt make me dishonest  it made me to begin with very restlessmade me instead of going straight to the station fidget a little about that manycoloured common which gives wimbledon horizons  there was a worry for me to work off or rather keep at a distance for i declined even to admit to myself that i had in miss anvoys phrase been saddled with it  what could have been clearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of trouble the coxon fund would in future save us and of yet liking better to face a continuance of that trouble than see and in fact contribute to a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in whom i was deeply interested  suddenly at the end of twenty minutes there was projected across this clearness the image of a massive middleaged man seated on a bench under a tree with sad far wandering eyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick a stick i recognised a stout goldheaded staff that i had given him in devoted days  i stopped short as he turned his face to me and it happened that for some reason or other i took in as i had perhaps never done before the beauty of his rich blank gaze  it was charged with experience as the sky is charged with light and i felt on the instant as if we had been overspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome of a temple doubtless i was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by something in the way i had been giving him up and sinking him  while i met it i stood there smitten and i felt myself responding to it with a sort of guilty grimace  this brought back his attention in a smile which expressed for me a cheerful weary patience a bruised noble gentleness  i had told miss anvoy that he had no dignity but what did he seem to me all unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up if he didnt seem unconcerned with small things didnt seem in short majestic  there was majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and puzzlements over his maintenance and his reward  after i had sat by him a few minutes i passed my arm over his big soft shoulderwherever you touched him you found equally little firmnessand said in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear  come back to town with me old friendcome back and spend the evening  i wanted to hold him i wanted to keep him and at waterloo an hour later i telegraphed possessively to the mulvilles  when he objected as regards staying all night that he had no things i asked him if he hadnt everything of mine  i had abstained from ordering dinner and it was too late for preliminaries at a club so we were reduced to tea and fried fish at my roomsreduced also to the transcendent  something had come up which made me want him to feel at peace with meand which precisely was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion  i had too often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant but it gives me pleasure now to think that on that particular evening i didnt even mention mrs saltram and the children  late into the night we smoked and talked old shames and old rigours fell away from us i only let him see that i was conscious of what i owed him  he was as mild as contrition and as copious as faith he was never so fine as on a shy return and even better at forgiving than at being forgiven  i dare say it was a smaller matter than that famous night at wimbledon the night of the problematical sobriety and of miss anvoys initiation but i was as much in it on this occasion as i had been out of it then  at about 130 he was sublime  he never in whatever situation rose till all other risings were over and his breakfasts at wimbledon had always been the principal reason mentioned by departing cooks  the coast was therefore clear for me to receive her when early the next morning to my surprise it was announced to me his wife had called  i hesitated after she had come up about telling her saltram was in the house but she herself settled the question kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which looking at me very hard in the eyes she placed with a pregnant absence of comment in my hand  for a single moment there glimmered before me the fond hope that mrs saltram had tendered me as it were her resignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form  to bring this about i would have feigned any humiliation but after my eyes had caught the superscription i heard myself say with a flatness that betrayed a sense of something very different from relief  oh the pudneys  i knew their envelopes though they didnt know mine they always used the kind sold at postoffices with the stamp affixed and as this letter hadnt been posted they had wasted a penny on me  i had seen their horrid missives to the mulvilles but hadnt been in direct correspondence with them  they enclosed it to me to be delivered  they doubtless explain to you that they hadnt your address  i turned the thing over without opening it  why in the world should they write to me  because theyve something to tell you  the worst mrs saltram dryly added  it was another chapter i felt of the history of their lamentable quarrel with her husband the episode in which vindictively disingenuously as they themselves had behaved one had to admit that he had put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life  he had begun by insulting the matchless mulvilles for these more specious protectors and then according to his wont at the end of a few months had dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left yawning behind  the chasm at wimbledon was now blessedly closed but the pudneys across their persistent gulf kept up the nastiest fire  i never doubted they had a strong case and i had been from the first for not defending himreasoning that if they werent contradicted theyd perhaps subside  this was above all what i wanted and i so far prevailed that i did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little circle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne  i knew that is i divined that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as their courage conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed place in which saltram could have planted a blow  it was a question with them whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his blow so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each other  i judged that on the day the pudneys should cease for some reason or other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more disconcerting than any of its predecessors  as i held mrs saltrams letter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had comethey had ceased to be afraid  i dont want to know the worst i presently declared  youll have to open the letter  it also contains an enclosure  i felt itit was fat and uncanny  wheels within wheels i exclaimed  theres something for me too to deliver  so they tell meto miss anvoy  i stared i felt a certain thrill  why dont they send it to her directly  mrs saltram hung fire  because shes staying with mr and mrs mulville  and why should that prevent  again my visitor faltered and i began to reflect on the grotesque the unconscious perversity of her action  i was the only person save george gravener and the mulvilles who was aware of sir gregory coxons and of miss anvoys strange bounty  where could there have been a more signal illustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having complacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it  theres the chance of their seeing her letters  they know mr pudneys hand  still i didnt understand then it flashed upon me  you mean they might intercept it  how can you imply anything so base i indignantly demanded  its not iits mr pudney cried mrs saltram with a flush its his own idea  then why couldnt he send the letter to you to be delivered  mrs saltrams embarrassment increased she gave me another hard look  you must make that out for yourself  i made it out quickly enough  its a denunciation  a real lady doesnt betray her husband this virtuous woman exclaimed  i burst out laughing and i fear my laugh may have had an effect of impertinence  especially to miss anvoy whos so easily shocked why do such things concern her i asked much at a loss  because shes there exposed to all his craft  mr and mrs pudney have been watching this  they feel she may be taken in  thank you for all the rest of us  what difference can it make when she has lost her power to contribute  again mrs saltram considered then very nobly  there are other things in the world than money  this hadnt occurred to her so long as the young lady had any but she now added with a glance at my letter that mr and mrs pudney doubtless explained their motives  its all in kindness she continued as she got up  kindness to miss anvoy  you took on the whole another view of kindness before her reverses  my companion smiled with some acidity perhaps youre no safer than the mulvilles  i didnt want her to think that nor that she should report to the pudneys that they had not been happy in their agent and i well remember that this was the moment at which i began with considerable emotion to promise myself to enjoin upon miss anvoy never to open any letter that should come to her in one of those penny envelopes  my emotion and i fear i must add my confusion quickly deepened i presently should have been as glad to frighten mrs saltram as to think i might by some diplomacy restore the pudneys to a quieter vigilance  its best you should take my view of my safety i at any rate soon responded  when i saw she didnt know what i meant by this i added  you may turn out to have done in bringing me this letter a thing youll profoundly regret  my tone had a significance which i could see did make her uneasy and there was a moment after i had made two or three more remarks of studiously bewildering effect at which her eyes followed so hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which i emphasised them that i instinctively slipped mr pudneys communication into my pocket she looked in her embarrassed annoyance capable of grabbing it to send it back to him  i felt after she had gone as if i had almost given her my word i wouldnt deliver the enclosure  the passionate movement at any rate with which in solitude i transferred the whole thing unopened from my pocket to a drawer which i doublelocked would have amounted for an initiated observer to some such pledge    chapter xii    mrs saltram left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in painas if i had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious  i didnt quite know what it wasit had a shocking resemblance to my honour  the emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet vibrated to the pleasure with which the night before i had rallied to the rare analyst the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder  what had dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as saltram appeared before me in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his value  hang it one had to choose one had to put that value somewhere so i would put it really high and have done with it mrs mulville drove in for him at a discreet hourthe earliest she could suppose him to have got up and i learned that miss anvoy would also have come had she not been expecting a visit from mr gravener  i was perfectly mindful that i was under bonds to see this young lady and also that i had a letter to hand to her but i took my time i waited from day to day  i left mrs saltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the pudneys  i knew at last what i meanti had ceased to wince at my responsibility i gave this supreme impression of saltram time to fade if it would but it didnt fade and individually it hasnt faded even now during the month that i thus invited myself to stiffen again adelaide mulville perplexed by my absence wrote to me to ask why i was so stiff  at that season of the year i was usually oftener with them  she also wrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between mr gravener and her sweet young frienda state of things but half satisfactory to her so long as the advantage resulting to mr saltram failed to disengage itself from the merely nebulous state  she intimated that her sweet young friend was if anything a trifle too reserved she also intimated that there might now be an opening for another clever young man  there never was the slightest opening i may here parenthesise and of course the question cant come up today  these are old frustrations now ruth anvoy hasnt married i hear and neither have i  during the month toward the end i wrote to george gravener to ask if on a special errand i might come to see him and his answer was to knock the very next day at my door  i saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with the talk we had had in the railway carriage and his promptitude showed that the ashes of his eagerness werent yet cold  i told him there was something i felt i ought in candour to let him knowi recognised the obligation his friendly confidence had laid on me  you mean miss anvoy has talked to you  she has told me so herself he said  it wasnt to tell you so that i wanted to see you i replied for it seemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself  if however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you i was discouraging  discouraging  on the subject of a present application of the coxon fund  to the case of mr saltram  my dear fellow i dont know what you call discouraging gravener cried  well i thought i was and i thought she thought i was  i believe she did but such a things measured by the effect shes not discouraged he said  thats her own affair  the reason i asked you to see me was that it appeared to me i ought to tell you frankly thatdecidedlyi cant undertake to produce that effect  in fact i dont want to  its very good of you damn you my visitor laughed red and really grave  then he said  youd like to see that scoundrel publicly glorifiedperched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension  i braced myself  taking one form of public recognition with another it seems to me on the whole i should be able to bear it when i see the compliments that are paid right and left i ask myself why this one shouldnt take its course  this therefore is what youre entitled to have looked to me to mention to you  ive some evidence that perhaps would be really dissuasive but i propose to invite mss anvoy to remain in ignorance of it  and to invite me to do the same  oh you dont require ityouve evidence enough  i speak of a sealed letter that ive been requested to deliver to her  and you dont mean to  theres only one consideration that would make me i said  graveners clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute but evidently without fishing up a clue to this motivea failure by which i was almost wounded  what does the letter contain  its sealed as i tell you and i dont know what it contains  why is it sent through you  rather than you i wondered how to put the thing  the only explanation i can think of is that the person sending it may have imagined your relations with miss anvoy to be at an endmay have been told this is the case by mrs saltram  my relations with miss anvoy are not at an end poor gravener stammered  again for an instant i thought  the offer i propose to make you gives me the right to address you a question remarkably direct are you still engaged to miss anvoy  no im not he slowly brought out  but were perfectly good friends  such good friends that youll again become prospective husband and wife if the obstacle in your path be removed  removed he anxiously repeated  if i send miss anvoy the letter i speak of she may give up her idea  then for gods sake send it  ill do so if youre ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now presumably bring about your marriage  id marry her the next day my visitor cried  yes but would she marry you  what i ask of you of course is nothing less than your word of honour as to your conviction of this  if you give it me i said ill engage to hand her the letter before night  gravener took up his hat turning it mechanically round he stood looking a moment hard at its unruffled perfection  then very angrily honestly and gallantly hand it to the devil he broke out with which he clapped the hat on his head and left me  will you read it or not i said to ruth anvoy at wimbledon when i had told her the story of mrs saltrams visit  she debated for a time probably of the briefest but long enough to make me nervous  have you brought it with you  no indeed  its at home locked up  there was another great silence and then she said go back and destroy it  i went back but i didnt destroy it till after saltrams death when i burnt it unread  the pudneys approached her again pressingly but prompt as they were the coxon fund had already become an operative benefit and a general amaze  mr saltram while we gathered about as it were to watch the manna descend had begun to draw the magnificent income  he drew it as he had always drawn everything with a grand abstracted gesture  its magnificence alas as all the world now knows quite quenched him it was the beginning of his decline  it was also naturally a new grievance for his wife who began to believe in him as soon as he was blighted and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed him on the whim of a meddlesome american to renounce his glorious office to become as she says like everybody else  the very day he found himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce  this deprived us as may easily be imagined of much of our occupation and especially deprived the mulvilles whose want of selfsupport i never measured till they lost their great inmate  theyve no one to live on now  adelaides most frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark that dear faraway ruths intentions were doubtless good  she and kent are even yet looking for another prop but no one presents a true sphere of usefulness they complain that people are selfsufficing  with saltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered the grander the elder style  theyve got their carriage back but whats an empty carriage  in short i think we were all happier as well as poorer before even including george gravener who by the deaths of his brother and his nephew has lately become lord maddock  his wife whose fortune clears the property is criminally dull he hates being in the upper house and hasnt yet had high office  but what are these accidents which i should perhaps apologise for mentioning in the light of the great eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which the coxon fund must be rolling up
