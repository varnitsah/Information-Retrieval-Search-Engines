97360520	red eve  by h rider haggard     first published 1911     dedication  ditchingham may 27 1911 my dear jehu  for five long but not unhappy years seated or journeying side by side we have striven as royal commissioners to find a means whereby our coasts may be protected from the outrageous flowing surges of the sea i quote the jurists of centuries ago the idle swamps turned to fertility and the barren hills clothed with forest also with small success how foreshore may be best defined  what will result from all these labours i do not know nor whether grave geologists ever read romance save that which the pen of time inscribes upon the rocks still in memory of our fellowship in them i offer to you this story written in their intervals of red eve the dauntless and of murgh gateway of the gods whose dreadful galley still sails from east to west and from west to east yes and evermore shall sail your friend and colleague h rider haggard to dr jehu fgs st andrews nb      red eve    murgh the death  they knew nothing of it in england or all the western countries in those days before crecy was fought when the third edward sat upon the throne there was none to tell them of the doom that the east whence come light and life death and the decrees of god had loosed upon the world not one in a multitude in europe had ever even heard of those vast lands of far cathay peopled with hundreds of millions of coldfaced yellow men lands which had grown very old before our own familiar states and empires were carved out of mountain of forest and of savagehaunted plain yet if their eyes had been open so that they could see well might they have trembled king prince priest merchant captain citizen and poor labouring hind well might they all have trembled when the east sent forth her gifts  look across the world beyond that curtain of thick darkness behold a vast city of fantastic houses half buried in winter snows and reddened by the lurid sunset breaking through a sawtoothed canopy of cloud everywhere upon the temple squares and open spaces great fires burning a strange fuelthe bodies of thousands of mankind pestilence was king of that city a pestilence hitherto unknown innumerable hordes had died and were dying yet innumerable hordes remained all the patient east bore forth those still shapes that had been theirs to love or hate and their task done turned to the banks of the mighty river and watched    down the broad street which ran between the fantastic houses advanced a procession toward the brown iceflecked river first marched a company of priests clad in black robes and carrying on poles lanterns of black paper lighted although the sun still shone behind marched another company of priests clad in white robes and bearing white lanterns also lighted but at these none looked nor did they listen to the dirges that they sang for all eyes were fixed upon him who filled the centre space and upon his two companions  the first companion was a lovely woman jewelhung wearing false flowers in her streaming hair and beneath her bared breasts a kirtle of white silk life and love embodied in radiance and beauty she danced in front looking about her with alluring eyes and scattering petals of dead roses from a basket which she bore different was the second companion who stalked behind so thin so sexless that none could say if the shape were that of man or woman dry streaming locks of irongrey an ashen countenance deepset hollow eyes a beetling parchmentcovered brow lean shanks half hidden with a rotting rag clawlike hands which clutched miserably at the air such was its awful fashion that of new death in all its terrors  between them touched of neither went a man naked save for a red girdle and a long red cloak that was fastened round his throat and hung down from his broad shoulders there was nothing strange about this man unless it were perhaps the strength that seemed to flow from him and the glance of his icy eyes he was just a burly yellow man whose age none could tell for the hood of the red cloak hid his hair one who seemed to be far removed from youth and yet untouched by time he walked on steadily intently his face immovable taking no heed  only now and again he turned those long eyes of his upon one of the multitude who watched him pass crouched upon their knees in solemn silence always upon one whether it were man woman or child with a glance meant for that one and no other and ever the one upon whom it fell rose from the knee made obeisance and departed as though filled with some inspired purpose  down to the quay went the black priests the white priests and the redcloaked man preceded by rose life followed by ashen death through the funeral fires they wended and the lurid sunset shone upon them all  to the pillars of this quay was fastened a strange highpooped ship with crimson sails set upon her masts the white priests and the black priests formed lines upon either side of the broad gangway of that ship and bowed as the redcloaked man walked over it between them quite alone for now she with the dead roses and she of the ashen countenance had fallen back as the sun sank standing on the lofty stern he cried aloud  here the work is done now i the eating fire i the messenger get me to the west among you for a while i cease to burn yet remember me for i shall come again  as he spoke the ropes of the ship were loosened the wind caught her crimson sails and she departed into the night one bloodred spot against its blackness  the multitude watched until they could see her no longer then they flamed up with mingled joy and rage they laughed madly they cursed him who had departed  we live we live we live they cried murgh is gone murgh is gone kill his priests make sacrifice of his shadows murgh is gone bearing the curse of the east into the bosom of the west look it follows him and they pointed to a cloud of smoke or vapour in which terrible shapes seemed to move dimly that trailed after the departing redsailed ship  the black priests and the white priests heard without struggle without complaint as though they were but taking part in some set ceremony they kneeled down in lines upon the snow naked from the waist up executioners with great swords appeared they advanced upon the kneeling lines without haste without wrath and letting fall the heavy swords upon the patient outstretched necks did their grim office till all were dead then they turned to find her of the flowers who had danced before and her of the tattered weeds who had followed after purposing to cast them to the funeral flames but these were gone though none had seen them go only out of the gathering darkness from some temple or pagodatop a voice spoke like a moaning wind  fools wailed the voice still with you is murgh the second thing created murgh who was made to be mans minister murgh the messenger shall reappear from beyond the setting sun ye cannot kill ye cannot spare those priests you seemed to slay he had summoned to be his officers afar fools ye do but serve as serves murgh gateway of the gods life and death are not in your hands or in his they are in the hands of the master of murgh helper of man of that lord whom no eye hath seen but whose behests all who are born obeyyes even the mighty murgh looser of burdens whom in your foolishness ye fear    so spoke this voice out of the darkness and that night the sword of the great pestilence was lifted from the eastern land and there the funeral fires flared no more    chapter i  the trystingplace  on the very day when murgh the messenger sailed forth into that uttermost sea a young man and a maiden met together at the blythburgh marshes near to dunwich on the eastern coast of england in this the month of february of the year 1346 hard and bitter frost held suffolk in its grip the muddy stream of blyth it is true was frozen only in places since the tide flowing up from the southwold harbour where it runs into the sea between that ancient town and the hamlet of walberswick had broken up the ice but all else was set hard and fast and now toward sunset the cold was bitter  stark and naked stood the tall dry reeds the blackbirds and starlings perched upon the willows seemed swollen into feathery balls the fur started on the backs of hares and a fourhorse wain could travel in safety over swamps where at any other time a schoolboy dared not set his foot  on such an eve with snow threatening the great marsh was utterly desolate and this was why these two had chosen it for their meeting place  to look on they were a goodly pairthe girl who was clothed in the red she always wore tall dark well shaped with large black eyes and a determined face one who would make a very stately woman the man broad shouldered with grey eyes that were quick and almost fierce long limbed hard agile and healthy one who had never known sickness who looked as though the world were his own to master he was young but threeandtwenty that day and his simple dress a tunic of thick wool fastened round him with a leathern belt to which hung a short sword showed that his degree was modest  the girl although she seemed his elder in fact was only in her twentieth year yet from her who had been reared in the hard school of that cruel age childhood had long departed leaving her a ripened woman before her time  this pair stood looking at each other  well cousin eve clavering said the man in his clear voice why did your message bid me meet you in this cold place  because i had a word to say to you cousin hugh de cressi she answered boldly and the marsh being so cold and so lonesome i thought it suited to my purpose does grey dick watch yonder  ay behind those willows arrow on string and god help him on whom dick draws but what was that word eve  one easy to understand she replied looking him in the eyesfarewell  he shivered as though with the cold and his face changed  an ill birthday greeting yet i feared it he muttered huskily but why more now than at any other time  would you know hugh well the story is short so ill let it out our greatgrandmother the heiress of the de cheneys married twice did she not and from the first husband came the de cressis and from the second the claverings but in this way or in that we claverings got the lands or most of them and you de cressis the nobler stock took to merchandise now since those days you have grown rich with your fishing fleets your wool mart and your ferry dues at walberswick and southwold we too are rich in manors and land counting our acres by the thousand but yet poor lacking your gold though yonder manorand she pointed to some towers which rose far away above the trees upon the high landhas many mouths to feed also the sea has robbed us at dunwich where i was born taking our great house and sundry streets that paid us rent and your market of southwold has starved out ours at blythburgh  well what has all this to do with you and me eve  much hugh as you should know who have been bred to trade and she glanced at his merchants dress between de cressi and clavering there has been rivalry and feud for three long generations when we were children it abated for a while since your father lent money to mine and that is why they suffered us to grow up side by side but then they quarrelled about the ferry that we had set in pawn and your father asked his gold back again and not getting it took the ferry which i have always held a foolish and strifebreeding deed since from that day forward the war was open therefore hugh if we meet at all it must be in these frozen reeds or behind the cover of a thicket like a village slut and her man  i know that well enough eve who have spoken with you but twice in nine months and he devoured her beautiful face with hungry eyes but of that word farewell  of that ill word this hugh i have a new suitor up yonder a fine french suitor a very great lord indeed whose wealth i am told none can number from his mother he has the valley of the waveney up to bungay townay and beyondand from his father a whole county in normandy five french knights ride behind his banner and with them ten squires and i know not how many menatarms there is feasting yonder at the manor i can tell you ere his train leaves us our winter provender will be done and well have to drink small beer till the wine ships come from france in spring  and what is this lords name  gods truth he has several she answered sir edmund acour in england and in france the high and puissant count of noyon and in italy near to the city of venicefor there too he has possessions which came to him through his grandmotherthe seigneur of cattrina  and having so much does he want you too as i have heard eve and if so why  so he swears she answered slowly and as for the reason why i suppose you must seek it in my face which by illfortune has pleased his lordship since first he saw it a month ago at the least he has asked me in marriage of my father who jumped at him like a winter pike and so im betrothed  and do you want him eve  ay i want him as far as the sun is from the moon or the world from either i want him in heaven or beneath the earth or anywhere away from me  at these words a light shone in hughs keen grey eyes  im glad of that eve for ive been told much of this fine fellowamongst other things that he is a traitor come here to spy on england but should i be a match for him man to man eve he asked after a little pause  she looked him up and down then answered  i think so though he is no weakling but not for him and the five knights and the ten squires and my noble father and my brother and the rest oh hugh hugh she added bitterly cannot you understand that you are but a merchants lad though your blood be as noble as any in this realma merchants lad the last of five brothers why were you not born the first of them if you wished for eve clavering for then your red gold might have bought me  ask that of those who begot me said hugh come now whats in your mind youre not one to be sold like a heifer at a faring and go whimpering to the altar and i am not one to see you led there while i stand upon my feet we are made of a clay too stiff for a french lords fingers eve though it is true that they may drag you whither you would not walk  no she answered i think i shall take some marrying against my wish moreover i am dunwich born  what of that eve  go ask your godsire and my friend sir andrew arnold the old priest in the library of the temple there he showed me an ancient roll a copy of the charter granted by john and other kings of england to the citizens of dunwich  what said this writing eve  it said among other things that no man or maid of dunwich can be forced to marry against their will even in the lifetime of their parents  but will it hold today  ay i think so i think that is why the holy sir andrew showed it to me knowing something of our case for he is my confessor when i can get to him  then sweet you are safe exclaimed hugh with a sigh of relief  ay so safe that tomorrow father nicholas the french chaplain in his train has been warned to wed me to my lord acourthat is if im there to wed  and if this acour is here ill seek him out tonight and challenge him eve and hugh laid hand upon his sword  doubtless she replied sarcastically sir edmund acour count of noyon seigneur of cattrina will find it honour to accept the challenge of hugh de cressi the merchants youngest son oh hugh hugh are your wits frozen like this winter marsh not thus can you save me  the young man thought a while staring at the ground and biting his lips then he looked up suddenly and said  how much do you love me eve  with a slow smile she opened her arms and next moment they were kissing each other as heartily as ever man and maid have kissed since the world began so heartily indeed that when at length she pushed him from her her lovely face was as red as the cloak she wore  you know well that i love you to my sorrow and undoing she said in a broken voice from childhood it has been so between us and till the grave takes one or both it will be so and for my part beyond it if the priests speak true for whatever may be your case i am not one to change my fancy when i give i give all though it be of little worth in truth hugh if i could i would marry you tonight though you are naught but a merchants son or even and she paused wiping her eyes with the back of her slim strong hand  i thank you he answered trembling with joy so it is with me for you and no other woman i live and die and though i am so humble ill be worthy of you yet if god keeps me in breath you shall not blush for your man eve well i am not great at words so let us come to deeds will you away with me now i think that father arnold would find you lodging for the night and an altar to be wed at and tomorrow our ship sails for flanders and for france  yes but would your father give us passage in it hugh  why not it could not deepen the feud between our houses which already has no bottom and if he refused we would take one for the captain is my friend and i have some little store set by it came to me from my mother  you ask much she said all a woman has my life perchance as well yet there it is ill go because im a fool hugh and as it chances you are more to me than aught and i hate this fine french lord i tell you i sicken at his glance and shiver when he touches me why if he came too near i should murder him and be hanged ill go though god alone knows the end of it  our purpose being honest the end will be good eve though perhaps before all is done we may often think it evil and now lets away though i wish that you were dressed in another colour  red eve they name me and red is my badge because it suits my dark face best cavil not at my robe hugh for it is the only dowry you will get with eve clavering how shall we go by the walberswick ferry you have no horses  nay but i have a skiff hidden in the reeds five miles furlongs off we must keep to the heath above walberswick for there they might know your red cloak even after dark and i would not have you seen till we are safe with sir arnold in the preceptory mother of heaven what is that  a peewit no more she answered indifferently  nay it is my man dick calling like a peewit that is his sign when trouble is afoot ah here he comes  as he spoke a tall gaunt man appeared advancing towards them his gait was a shambling trot that seemed slow although in truth he was covering the ground with extraordinary swiftness moreover he moved so silently that even on the frostheld soil his step could not be heard and so carefully that not a reed stirred as he threaded in and out among their clumps like an otter his head crouched down and his long bow pointed before him as though it were a spear half a minute more and he was before thema very strange man to see his years were not so many thirty perhaps and yet his face looked quite old because of its lack of colouring its thinness and the hard lines that marked where the muscles ran down to the tight straight mouth and up to the big forehead over which hung hair so light that at a little distance he seemed ashengrey only in this cold rocky face set very far apart were two paleblue eyes which just now when he chose to lift their lids that generally kept near together as though he were half asleep were full of fire and quick cunning  reaching the pair this strange fellow dropped to his knee and raised his cap to eve the great lady of the claveringsred eve as they called her through that countryside then he spoke in a low husky voice  theyre coming master you and your mistress must to earth unless you mean to face them in the open and the pale eyes glittered as he tapped his great black bow  who are coming dick be plain man  sir john clavering my ladys father young john my ladys brother the fine french lord who wears a white swan for a crest three of the nights his companions and sixno sevenmenatarms also from the other side of the grieve thomas of kessland and with him his marsh men and verderers  and what are they coming for he asked again have they hounds and hawk on wrist  nay but they have swords and knife on thigh and he let his pale eyes fall on eve  oh have done she broke in they come to take me and ill not be taken they come to kill you and ill not see you slain and live i had words with my father this morning about the frenchman and i fear let out the truth he told me then that ere the dunwich roses bloomed again she who loved you would have naught but bones to kiss dick you know the fen where can we hide till nightfall  follow me said the man and keep low  plunging into the dense brake of reeds through which he glided like a polecat dick led them over ground whereon save in times of hard frost no man could tread heading toward the river bank for two hundred paces or more they went thus till quite near to the lip of the stream they came to a patch of reeds higher and thicker than the rest in the centre of which was a little mound hid in a tangle of scrub and rushes once perhaps a hundred or a thousand years before some old marsh dweller had lived upon this mound or been buried in it at any rate on its southern side hidden by reeds and a withered willow was a cavity of which the mouth could not be seen that might have been a chamber for the living or the dead  thrusting aside the growths that masked it dick bade them enter and lie still  none will find us here he said as he lifted up the reeds behind them unless they chance to have hounds which i did not see hist be still they come    chapter ii  the fight by the river  for a while hugh and eve heard nothing but grey dicks ears were sharper than theirs quick as these might be about half a minute later however they caught the sound of horses hoofs ringing on the hard earth followed by that of voices and the crackle of breaking reeds  two of the speakers appeared and pulled up their horses near by in a dry hollow that lay between them and the river bank peeping between the reeds that grew about the mouth of the earthdwelling eve saw them  my father and the frenchman she whispered look and she slid back a little so that hugh might see  peering through the stems of the undergrowth set as it were in a little frame against the red and ominous sky the eyes of hugh de cressi fell upon sir edmund acour a gallant even a splendidlooking knightthat was his first impression of him broad shouldered graceful in age neither young nor old clean featured quick eyed with a mobile mouth and a little squarecut beard soft and languid voiced black haired richly dressed in a fur robe and mounted on a fine black horse such was the man  staring at acour and remembering that he too loved red eve hugh grew suddenly ashamed how could a mere merchant compare himself with this magnificent lord this highbred manytitled favourite of courts and of fortune how could he rival him he who had never yet travelled a hundred miles from the place where he was born save once when he sailed on a trading voyage to calais as well might a hooded crow try to match a peregrine that swooped to snatch away the dove from beneath its claws yes he hugh was the grey crow eve was the dove whom he had captured and yonder shiftyeyed count was the fleet fierce peregrine who soon would tear out his heart and bear the quarry far away hugh shivered a little as the thought struck him not with fear for himself but at the dread of that great and close bereavement  the girl at his side felt the shiver and her mind quickened by love and peril guessed its purport she said nothing for words were dangerous only turning her beautiful face she pressed her lips upon her lovers hand it was her message to him thereby as he knew well humble as he might be she acknowledged him her lord forever i am with you said that kiss have no fear in life or in death none shall divide us he looked at her with grateful eyes and would have spoken had she not placed her hand upon his mouth and pointed  acour was speaking in english which he used with a strong french accent  well we do not find your beautiful runaway sir john he said in a clear and cultivated voice and although i am not vain for my part i cannot believe that she has come to such a place as this to meet a merchants clerk she who should company with kings  yet i fear it is so sir edmund answered sir john clavering a stout dark man of middle age this girl of mine is very heady as i give warning you will find out when she is your wife for years she has set her fancy upon hugh de cressi yes since they were boy and girl together as i think and while he lives i doubt shell never change it  while he livesthen why should he continue to live sir john asked the count indifferently surely the world will not miss a chapmans son  the de cressis are my kin although i hate them sir edmund also they are rich and powerful and have many friends in high places if this young man died by my command it would start a blood feud of which none can tell the end for after all he is nobly born  then sir john he shall die by mine no not at my own hands since i do not fight with traders but i have those about me who are pretty swordsmen and know how to pick a quarrel before a week is out there will be a funeral in dunwich  i know nothing of your men and do not want to hear of their quarrels past or future said sir john testily  of course not answered the count i pray you forget my words name of god what an accursed and illomened spot is this i feel as though i were standing by my own graveit came upon me suddenly and he shivered and turned pale  dick lifted his bow but hugh knocked the arrow aside ere he could loose it  to those who talk of death death often draws near replied clavering crossing himself though i find the place well enough seeing the hour and season  do youdo you sir john look at that sky look at the river beneath which has turned to blood hark to the howl of the wind in the reeds and the cry of the birds we cannot see ay and look at our shadows on the snow mine lies flat by a great hole and yours rising against yonder bank is that of a hooded man with hollow eyesdeath himself as i should limn him there it is gone what a fool am i or how strong is that wine of yours shall we be going also  nay here comes my son with tidings well jack have you found your sister he added addressing a dark and somewhat saturnine young man who now rode up to them from over the crest of the hollow  no sir though we have beat the marsh through and through so that scarce an otter could have escaped us and yet shes here for thomas of kessland caught sight of her red cloak among the reeds and whats more hugh de cressi is with her and grey dick too for both were seen  i am glad theres a third said sir john drily though god save me from his arrows this grey dick he added to the count is a wild homeless halfwit whom they call hugh de cressis shadow but the finest archer in suffolk with norfolk thrown in one who can put a shaft through every button on your doublet at fifty pacesay and bring down wild geese on the wing twice out of four times for i have seen him do it with that black bow of his  indeed then i should like to see him shootat somebody else answered acour for in those days such skill was of interest to all soldiers kill hugh de cressi if you will friend but spare grey dick he might be useful  ay sir edmund broke in the young man furiously ill kill him if i can catch him the dog who dares to bring scandal on my sisters name let the saints but give me five minutes face to face with him alone with none to help either of us and ill beat him to a pulp and hang whats left of him upon the nearest tree to be a warning to all such puppies  i note the challenge said sir edmund and should the chance come my way will keep the lists for you with pleasure since whatever this hugh may be i doubt that from his blood hell prove no coward but young sir you must catch your puppy ere you hang him and if he is in this marsh he must have gone to ground  i think so too sir edmund but if so well soon start the badger look yonder and he pointed to smoke rising at several spots half a mile or more away  what have you done son asked sir john anxiously  fired the reeds he said with a savage laugh and set men to watch that the game does not break back oh have no fear father red eve will take no harm the girl ever loved fire moreover if she is there she will run to the water before it and be caught  fool thundered sir john do you know your sister so little as like as not shell stay and burn and then ill lose my girl who when all is said is worth ten of you well what is done cannot be undone but if death comes of this mad trick it is on your head not mine to the bank and watch with me sir edmund for we can do no more    ten minutes later and the fugitives in the mound peeping out from their hole saw clouds of smoke floating above them  you should have let me shoot master hugh said grey dick in his hard dry whisper id have had these three at least and theyd have been good company on the road to hell which now we must walk alone  nay answered hugh sternly ill murder none though they strive to murder us and these least of all and he glanced at eve who sat staring out of the mouth of the hole her chin resting on her hand you had best give in sweetheart he said hoarsely fire is worse than foes and it draws near  i fear it less she answered moreover marriage is worse than eithersometimes  hugh took counsel with grey dick  this place will burn like tinder he said pointing to the dry reeds which grew thickly all about them and to the masses of brushwood and other rubbish that had drifted against the side of the little mound in times of flood if the fire reaches us we must perish of flame or smoke or both  ay answered dick like old witch sarah when they burned her in her house she screeched a lot though some say it was her cat that screeched and she died mum  if we could get into the water now dick  he shook his ashhued head  the pools are frozen moreover as well die of heat as cold i love not icewater  what counsel then dick  youll not take the best masterto loose my bow upon them that fine fellow did well to be afraid for had you not knocked up my hand thered be an arrow sticking in his throat by now he was right death walked near to him  it must not be dick unless they strike first what else  perchance when the smoke begins to trouble them which it must soon theyll move then we will run for the river tis but fifty yards the lady eve can swim like a duck and so can you the tide has turned and will bear you to the point and ill hold the bank against any who try to follow and take my chance what say you of that plan lady  that it is good as another or as bad she answered indifferently lets bide where we are and do what we must when we must nay waste no more breath hugh ill not yield and go home like a naughty child to be married it was you who snatched away grey dicks shaft not i and now ill save myself  red evethats red eve muttered the henchman with a dry chuckle of admiration the dead trouble neither man nor woman ah she knows she knows  after this there was silence for a while save for the roar of the fire that ever drew more near  eve held her cloak pressed against her mouth to filter the smoke which grew thick  it is time to move said hugh coughing as he spoke by heavens grace we are too late look  as he spoke suddenly in the broad belt of reeds which lay between them and the river bank fire appeared in several places caused doubtless by the flaming flakes which the strong wind had carried from behind the mound moreover these new fires burning up briskly and joining themselves together began to advance toward the three in the hole  the wind has turned said dick now it is fire or water if you can get there how do you choose to die and as he spoke he unstrung his bow and slipped it into its leathern case  neither one way nor the other answered eve some may die tonight but we shall not  hugh leapt up and took command  cover your faces to the eyes and run for it he said ill go first then you eve and dick behind make for the point and leapthe water is deep there  they sprang to their feet and forward into the reeds when they were almost at the edge of the fire a shout told them that they had been seen eve the swift of foot outpaced hugh and was the first to leap into that circle of tall flames she was through it they were all through it scorched but unharmed thirty paces away was the little point of land where nothing grew for the spring tides washed it that jutted out into the waters of the blythe and perhaps a hundred to their right the claverings poured down on them foot and horse together  hugh caught his foot in a willow root and fell eve and grey dick sped onward unknowing they reached the point above the water turned and saw dick slipped his bow from its case strung it and set an arrow on the string hugh had gained his feet but a man who had come up sprang and cast his arms about him hugh threw him to the ground for he was very strong and shook himself free then he drew the short and heavy sword that he wore and shouting out make way to those who stood between him and the little promontory started to run again  these opened to the right and left to let him pass for they feared the look in his eyes and the steel in his hand only young john clavering who had leapt from his horse would not budge as hugh tried to push past him he struck him in the face calling out  we have caught the de cressi thief take him and hang him  at the insult of the blow and words hugh stopped dead and turned quite white whereupon the men thinking that he was afraid closed in upon him then in the silence the harsh croaking voice of grey dick was heard saying  sir john of clavering bid your people let my master go or i will send an arrow through your heart and he lifted the long bow and drew it  sir john muttered something thinking that this was a poor way to die and again the men fell back except one french knight who perhaps did not catch or understand his words  this man stretched out his hand to seize hugh but before ever it fell upon his shoulder the bow twanged and acours retainer was seen whirling round and round cursing with pain in the palm of his hand was an arrow that had sunk through it to the feathers  you are right that knave shoots well said the count to sir john who made no answer  now again all fell back so that hugh might have run for it if he would but his blood was up and he did not stir  john clavering he said addressing the young man just now when i lay hid in yonder hole i heard you say that if you had five minutes with me alone youd beat me to a pulp and hang what was left of me on the nearest tree well here i stand and theres a tree having first tried to burn me and your sister you have struck me in the face will you make good your words or shall i strike you in the face and go my way nay keep your dogs off me grey dick yonder has more arrows  now a tumult rose some saying one thing and some another but all keeping an eye upon grey dick and his bent bow at last sir edmund acour rode forward and in his polished stately way said to john  young sir this merchant is in the right and whatever his trade may be his blood is as good as your own after your brave words either you should fight him or take back the blow you gave  then he leaned down and whispered into johns ear  your sword is longer than his make an end of him and of all his trouble lest men should laugh at you as an empty boaster  now john who was brave and needed but little urging turned to his father and said  have i your leave to whip this fellow sir  you should have asked that before you struck him in the face replied the knight you are a man grown do as best pleases you only if you take the blow begone from blythburgh  then eve who all this time had been listening called out from where she stood above the river  brother john if you fight your cousin hugh who is my affianced husband and fall on your own head be it for know your blood shall not stand between him and me since it was you who struck him and not he you be warned john and let him go lest he should send you farther than you wish to travel and to you hugh i say though it is much to ask if he throws down his sword forget that unknightly blow and come thither  you hear said hugh shortly to john now because she is your sister if its your will ill begone in peace  ay answered john setting his thin lips because you are a coward womanthief and seek to live that you may bring shame upon our house well that will pass when you die presently  john john boast not cried eve who has shown you where you will sleep tonight  whether i shall live or die god knows alone said hugh solemnly but what i seek to know is should it chance to be your lot to die whether your people or this frenchman will set on me or raise a bloodfeud against me tell me now sir john clavering  if you kill my son in combat à outrance he being the challenger answered the knight none shall lift hand against you for that deed if i can hold them back but know that i have other cause of quarrel against youand he pointed to his daughterand that if you meddle more with her who is not for you certainly you shall die  and young sir broke in sir edmund i pray you to understand that this lady eve tomorrow becomes my wife with the will of her father and her kin and that if you try to stand between us although i may not fight you seeing what i am and what you are ill kill you like a rat when and where i get the chance yes he added in a savage snarl i pledge my knightly honour that i will kill you like a rat if i must follow you across the world to do so  you will not have need to travel far if i have my will answered the young man sternly since red eve is mine not yours and living or dead mine she will remain as for your fine knightly honour sir edmund acour count de noyon seigneur of cattrina what has a traitor to his king to do with honour one who is here as a spy of philip of france as the poor merchants lad knows well oh take you hand from your sword of which you say i am not worthy and since you say also that i have so many enemies let me begin with a squire of my own degree  now at these bold words arose a clamour of voices speaking in french and english  what say you to this sir edmund shouted sir john clavering above them all you are a great lord and a wealthy beloved by me also as the affianced of my daughter but i am a loyal englishman who have no truck with traitors to my king  what say i asked sir edmund calmly i say that if this fellow can fight as well as he can lie your son has but a poor chance with him as you know well i came hither from france to visit my estates not to learn what strength his grace of england my liege lord gathers for the new war with philip  enough said sir john though this is the first i have heard of such a war for it would seem that you know more of king edwards mind than i do the light begins to fail there is no time for talk stand clear all men and let these two settle it  ay croaked grey dick stand clear all men while my master cuts the throat of his cousin clavering since he who stands not clear shall presently lie straight and he tapped his terrible bow with his right hand then instantly seized the string again  the two were face to face round them on horse and on foot at a distance perhaps of twenty paces were gathered the clavering men and the french counts troop for now all had come up from the far parts of the marsh only toward the river side the ring was open whether because those who made it feared grey dicks arrows or in order that he and red eve might see everything that chanced  the pair were well matched for though hugh was the taller john his senior by a year was thicker set and better trained in arms but the sword of john was longer by a hands breadth than that hugh carried as a merchant which was heavy of such a make as the ancient romans used and sharpened on either edge neither of them wore armour since hugh had no right to do so and john had not come out to fight  they stood still for a moment in the midst of a breathless silence the red light of the stormy sunset striking across them both everything was red the smokeclouds rising from the sullen burning marsh into which the fire was still eating far away the waters of the blythe brimful with the tide that had just turned toward the sea the snow and ice itself even the triangle of wild swans brought by the hard weather from the northern lands looked red as they pursued their heavy and majestic flight toward the south heedless of man and his affairs beneath  not long did these remain heedless however since either to show his skill or for some other purpose of his own grey dick lifted his bow and loosed an arrow almost it seemed at hazard yet that arrow pierced the leader of the flock so that down it came in wide circles and in a last struggle hovered for a moment over the group of men then fell among them with a thud the blood from its pierced breast bespattering sir edmund acour and john claverings black hair  an ill omen for those two and especially for him who wears a white swan for a crest said a voice but at the moment none took much notice except grey dick who chuckled at the success of his shot since all were intent on greater mattersnamely which of those two young men should die  sir john the father rode forward and addressed them  to the death without mercy to the fallen he said grimly  they bent their heads in answer  now he cried and reined back his horse  the first home thrust wins whispered acour to him as he wiped the blood of the swan off his sleeve thank god your sons sword is the longer  perhaps the pair heard this whisper or perhaps being without mail they knew that it was so at least for a while they circled round and round each other but out of reach  then at length john clavering rushed in and thrust hugh sprang back before his point again he rushed and thrust and again hugh sprang back a third time and hugh fairly ran whereon a shout went up from the claverings  the chapmans afraid cried one give him a yard measure shouted another he cannot handle steel  eve turned her face and her very eyes were sick with doubt  is it true she gasped  ay answered dick the archer its true that he draws him to the river bank those who wait will learn why oh the swan he sees not the swan  as he spoke hugh in his retreat before another of john claverings rushes struck his foot against the great dead bird and staggered john leapt upon him and he went down  is he pierced muttered eve  nay missed answered dick by half an inch ah i thought so  as the words left his lips clavering fell sprawling on his back for hugh had caught his leg with his left arm and thrown him so that they lay both together on the ground  there they closed rolling over each other but too close to stab  now goodnight john said dick with his hoarse chuckle throat him masterthroat him  the flurry in the snow was at an end john lay on his back de cressi knelt on him and lifted his short sword  do you yield men heard him say  nay answered clavering then suddenly hugh rose and suffered his adversary to do likewise  ill not stick you like a hog he said and some cried well done for the act seemed noble only acour muttered fool  next instant they were at it again but this time it was hugh who attacked and john who gave back right to the rivers edge for skill and courage seemed to fail him at once  turn your head lady said dick for now one must die but eve could not  the swords flashed for the last time in the red light then that of de cressi vanished clavering threw his arms wide and fell backward a splash as of a great stone thrown into water and all was done  hugh stood a moment on the rivers bank staring at the stream beneath then he turned and began to walk slowly toward the dead swan  ere ever he reached it sir john clavering fell from his horse in a swoon and a shout of rage went up from all his people  kill him they yelled and leapt forward  now hugh understood and ran for the point of land one man a frenchman got in front of him he cut him down and sped on  what now said eve as he joined them  he did not answer only pointed first to the clavering folk and next to the water showing that she must choose between the two  swim for it growled grey dick ill hold them back a while and then join you and as he spoke his bow twanged  for an instant eve paused then threw off her scarlet cloak  remember i slew your brother said hugh hoarsely  i remember that he would have slain you she answered and leapt straight from the point into the icy flood beneath which her head sank  when it rose again there was another head beside it that of dead john who appeared for one moment to be seen no more for ever since ere morning the ocean had him  now hugh leapt after her and presently the pair of them were swimming side by side to the rivers further shore then as now it was but a narrow stream yet they did not reach it easily for cumbered as they were with clothes and numbed by the icecold water the fierce tide caught them and carried them beyond the bend there they were lost in the gathering darkness so that most of those who watched believed that they had sunk and drowned but it was not so for after a long struggle they came safe to shore near to a clump of willows and clambered over the frozen mud to the heath beyond  first fire then water said hugh in a mazed voice  you have missed out love and death answered the girla full feast for a day that is not done but whither now  to take sanctuary at the preceptory and raise my kin forward eve ere you freeze  i think there is that in me which will not freeze she answered and broke into a run  now night closed in and the snow which had been threatening all day began to fall making their path over the heath difficult  we need grey dick to guide us but alack i fear he is dead muttered hugh  i think others will be dead not dick she answered  just then they heard a footstep behind them  hugh wheeled round and drew his sword but almost before it had left the scabbard a long figure glided out of the snow and said  more to the left master more to the left unless you would make your peace on blythburgh bridge where some would be glad to meet you  how went it asked hugh shortly  not well i shot thrice and slew three men two of the french knights and thomas of kessland against whom i had a score that now is settled but the fourth time i missed  who asked eve between her teeth as she ran beside him  the frenchman who means to marry you when the others fell back he came at me on his horse as i was setting a fresh arrow thinking to get me i had to shoot quick and aimed low for his heart because in that light i could not make certain of his face he saw and jerked up the horses head so that the shaft took it in the throat and killed the beast without hurting its rider he was off in an instant and at me with others before i could draw again so i thought it time to go which i did backward as he thrust perhaps he thinks he killed me as i meant he should only when he looks at his sword hell find it clean thats all  and again grey dick chuckled    chapter iii  father andrew  none were abroad in the streets of dunwich on that bitter winter night when these three trudged wearily down middlegate street through the driving snow to the door of the grey preceptory of the knights templar in a window above the porch a light burned dimly the only one to be seen in any of the houses round about for by now all men were abed  tis father arnolds room said eve he sits there at his books ill knock and call him but do you two go lay hold of the ring of the church door and she nodded toward a grey pile that stood near by then none can touch you and how know we who may be in this house  ill go no step further answered hugh sullenly all this temple ground is sanctuary or at least we will risk it and seizing the knocker he hammered at the door  the light in the window vanished and presently they heard a sound of creaking bolts then the door opened revealing a tall man whitebearded ancient and clad in a frayed furred robe worn over a priests cassock who held a lantern in his hand  who knocks he asked does some soul pass that you disturb me after curfew  ay father andrew answered hugh souls have passed and souls are near to passing let us in and we will tell you all  without waiting for an answer he entered with the others pushed to the massive door and bolted it again  whats this a woman said the old priest eve of clavering by the saints  yes she answered calmly though her teeth chattered eve of clavering eve the red this time with the blood of men soaked with the waters of the blythe frozen with the snows of dunwich heath where she has lain hid for hours with a furze bush for shelter eve who seeks shriving a dry rag for her back a morsel for her lips and fire to warm her which in the name of christ and of charity she prays you will not refuse to her  so she spoke and laughed recklessly  almost before she had finished her wild words the old man who looked what he was a knight arrayed in priestly robes had run to a door at the end of the hall and was calling through it mother agnes mother agnes  be not so hasty sir andrew answered a shrill voice a posset must have time to boil it is meet now that you wear a tonsure that you who are no longer a centurion should forget these come and he cometh ways when the waters hot  the rest of that speech was lost for father arnold muttering some word belonging to his centurion days dived into the kitchen to reappear presently dragging a little withered old woman after him who was dressed in a robe of conventual make  peace mother agnes peace he said take this lady dry her array her in your best gown give her food warm her and bring her back to me short what care i if the robe be short obey or it will not be come and he cometh but go and she goeth and then who will shelter one who talks so much  he thrust the pair of them through the kitchen door and returning led hugh and grey dick up a broad oak stair to what had been the guesthall of the preceptory on its first floor  it was a very great chamber where before their order was dispersed all the knights templar had been wont to dine with those who visited them at times of festival tattered banners still hung among the cobwebs of the ancient roof the shields of past masters with stately blazonings were carved in stone upon the walls but of all this departed splendour but little could be seen since the place was lit only by a single lamp of whales oil and a fire that burned upon the wide stone hearth a great fire since father arnold who had spent many years of his life in the east loved warmth  now hugh de cressi he said what have you done  slain my cousin john of clavering father and perhaps another man  in fair fight very fair fight croaked grey dick  who doubts it can a de cressi be a murderer asked the priest and you richard the archer what have you done  shot a good horse and three bad men dead with arrowsat least they should be deadand another through the hand standing one against twenty  a gallanti meanan evil deed broke in the old warrior priest though once it happened to me in a place called damascusbut you both are wet also come into my chamber i can furnish you with garments of a sort and richard set that black bow of yours near the fire but not too fire as you should know well a damp string is ill to draw with nay fear not to leave it this is sanctuary and to make sure i will lock the doors    half an hour was gone by and a very strange company had gathered round the big fire in the guestchamber of the temple eating with appetite of such food as its scanty larder could provide for them first there was red eve in a woollen garment the sunday wear of mother agnes for twenty years past and more which reached but little below her knees and was shaped like a sack on her feet were no shoes and for sole adornment her curling black hair fell about her shoulders for so she had arranged it because the gown would not meet across her bosom yet odd as it might be in this costume eve looked wonderfully beautiful perhaps because it was so scant and the leathern strap about her waist caused it to cling close to her shapely form  by her stood hugh wearing a splendid suit of chain armour it had been sir andrew arnolds in his warlike years and now he lent it to his godson hugh because as he said he had nothing else also it may have crossed the minds of both of them that such mail as this which the saracens had forged if somewhat out of fashion could still turn swordcuts  then there was grey dick whose garments seemed to consist of a sack with holes in it tied round him with a rope his quiver of arrows slung over it for ornament he sat by the fire on a stool oiling his black bow with a rind of the fat bacon that he had been eating  all the tale had been told and father arnold looked very grave indeed  i have known strange and dreadful stories in my time he said but never i think one stranger or more dreadful what would you do now godson  take sanctuary for myself and grey dick because of the slaying of john clavering and others and afterward be married by you to eve  be married to the sister with the brothers blood upon your hands without absolution from the church or pardon from the king and you but a merchants younger son and she tonight one of the greatest heiresses in east anglia why how may that be  i blame him not broke in eve john whom i never loved strove to smoke us out like rats because he was in the pay of the norman my lord of acour john struck hugh in the face with his hand and slandered him with his tongue john was given his life once and afterwards slain in fair fight oh i say i blame him not nor shall johns blood rise between him and me  yet the world will blame him and you too eve yes even those who love you both a while must go by say a year at least ill not marry you at once and cannot if i would with both your fathers living and unadvised and the sheriff waiting at the gate tell me now do any know that you have entered here  nay said dick looking up from his bow the hunt came after us but i hid these two in a bush and led it away past hinton to the ipswich road keeping but just ahead in the snow and talking in three voices then i gave them the slip and returned theyll not guess that we have come to dunwich for a while  and when they do even the boldest will not enter this holy sanctuary while the church has terrors for mens souls yet here you must not stay for long lest in this way or in that your lives pay the price of it or a bloody feud break out between the claverings of blythburgh and the de cressis of dunwich daughter eve get you to bed with old agnes you are so weary that you will not mind her snores tomorrow ere the dawn ill talk with you and meanwhile i have words for hugh nay have no fear the windows are all barred and archer dick shall watch the door  eve went unwillingly enough although she could scarcely walk flashing a goodnight to her lover with her fine eyes presently grey dick also went to sleep like a dog with one eye open in the little antechamber near to the great door  now hugh said father arnold when they were left alone your case is desperate for if you stay here certainly these claverings will have your blood yet if you can be got away safely there is still a shaft that you may shoot more deadly than any that ever left grey dicks quiver but yesterday i told you for your comfortwhen we spoke of his wooing of red evethat this norman for such he is although his mother was english and he was english born is a traitor to king edward whom he pretends to serve  ay and i said as much to him this afternoon when he prated to me of his knightly honour and though i had no time to take note of faces i thought he liked it little who answered hotly that i was a liar  i am sorry hugh it may put him on his guard or perhaps hell pay no heed at least the words are said and theres an end now hearken i told neither you nor any one all the blackness of his treachery have you guessed what this acour is here to do  spy out the kings power in these parts i suppose  more than thatand he dropped his voice to a whisperspy out a safe landingplace for fifty thousand normans upon our suffolk coast they are to sail hither this coming summer and set the crown of england upon their duke john who will hold it as vassal to his sire philip of france  gods name is that true  ay though in such a devils business that name is best left out look you lad i had warning from overseas where although i am now nothing but a poor old priest of a broken order i still have friends in high places therefore i watched and found that messengers were passing between acour and france one of these messengers a priest came a week ago to dunwich and spent the night in a tavern waiting for his ship to sail in the morning the good wife who keeps that tavernask not her namewould go far to serve me that night this priest slept sound and while he slept a letter was cut from the lining of his cassock and another without writing sewn there in place of it so that hell never know the difference till he reaches john of normandy and then not where he lost it stay you shall see and he went to the wall and from some secret place behind the hangings produced a writing which he handed to hugh who looked at it then gave it back to him saying  read it to me father english i can spell out but this french puzzles my eyes  so he read hugh listening eagerly to every word  my lord duke  this by a faithful hand that you know to tell you all goes well with your graces business and with that of your royal father while pretending to hunt or hawk i have found three places along this seaboard at any one of which the army can land next summer with little resistance to fear for though the land is rich in cattle and corn the people are few  these places of which i have made survey have deep water up to the beach i will tell you of them more particularly when i return meanwhile i linger here for sundry reasons which you know hoping to draw those of whom you speak to me to your cause which god aiding me i shall do since he of england has wronged one of them and slighted the others so that they are bitter against him and ready to listen to the promises which i make in your name  as an excuse for my long stay that has caused doubts in some quarters i speak of my suffolk lands which need my care also i court the daughter of my host here the knight of clavering a stubborn englishman who cannot be won but a man of great power and repute this courtship which began in jest has ended in earnest since the girl is very haughty and beautiful and as she will not be played with i propose with your good leave to make her my wife her father accepts my suit and when he and the brother are out of the way as doubtless may happen after your army comes she will have great possessions  i thank your grace for the promise of the wide english lands of which i spoke to you and the title that goes with them these i will do my best to earn nor will i ask for them till i kneel before you when you are crowned king of england at westminster as i doubt not god will bring about before this year is out i have made a map of the road by which your army should march on london after landing and of the towns to be sacked upon the way thither this however i keep since although not one in ten thousand of these english swine can read french or any other tongue should it chance to be lost all can understand a map not that there is any fear of loss for who will meddle with a priest who carries credentials signed by his holiness himself  i do homage to your grace this written with my hand from blythburgh in suffolk on the twentieth day of february 1346  edmund of noyon  father arnold ceased reading and hugh gasped out  what a fool is this knavecount  most men are my son in this way or in that and the few wise profit by their folly thus this letter which he thought so safe will save england to edward and his race you from many dangers your betrothed from a marriage which she hatesthat is if you can get safe away with it from dunwich  where to father  to king edward in london with another that i will write for you ere the dawn  but is it safe father to trust so precious a thing to me who have bitter enemies awaiting me and may as like as not be crows meat by tomorrow  father arnold looked at him with his soft and dreamy eyes then said  i think the crows not hatched that will pick your bones hugh though at the last there be crows or worms for all of us  why not father doubtless this morning young john of clavering thought as much and now he is in the stakenets or food for fishes  would you like to hear hugh and will you keep it to yourself even from eve  ay that i would and will  hell think me mad muttered the old priest to himself then went on aloud as one who takes a sudden resolution well ill tell you leaving you to make what you will of a story that till now has been heard by no living man  far in the east is the great country that we call cathay though in truth it has many other names and i alone of all who breathe in england have visited that land  how did you get there asked hugh amazed for though he knew dimly that father arnold had travelled much in his youth he never dreamed that he had reached the mystic territories of cathay or indeed that such a place really was except in fable  it would take from now till morning to tell son nor even then would you understand the road it is enough to say that i went on a pilgrimage to jerusalem where our blessed saviour died that was the beginning thence i travelled with arabs to the red sea where wild men made a slave of me and we were blown across the indian ocean to a beauteous island named ceylon in which all the folk are black  from this place i escaped in a vessel called a junk that brought me to the town of singapore thence at last following my star i came to cathay after two years of journeyings there i dwelt in honour for three more years moving from place to place since never before had its inhabitants seen a western man and they made much of me always sending me forward to new cities so at length i reached the greatest of them all which is called kambaluc or peking and there was the guest of its emperor timur  all the story of my life and adventures yonder i have written down and any who will may read it after i am dead but of these i have no time to speak nor have they anything to do with you whilst i dwelt in kambaluc as the guest of the emperor timur i made study of the religion of this mighty people who i was told worshipped gods in the shape of men i visited a shrine called the temple of heaven hoping that there i should see such a god who was named tien but found in it nothing but splendid emptiness  then i asked if there was no god that i could see with my eyes whereon the emperor laughed at me and said there was such a god but he counselled me not to visit him i prayed him to suffer me to do so since i who worshipped the only true god feared no other whereon growing angry he commanded some of his servants to take this fool to the house of murgh and let him see whether his god could protect him against murgh having said this he bade me farewell adding that though every man must meet murgh once few met him twice and therefore he did not think that he should see me again  now in my heart i grew afraid but none would tell me more of this murgh or what was likely to happen to me at his hands still i would not show any fear and strong in the faith of christ i determined to look upon this idol for such i expected him to be  that night the servants of timur bore me out of the city in a litter and by the starlight i saw that we travelled toward a hill through great graveyards where people were burying their dead at the foot of the hill they set me down upon a road and told me to walk up it and that at dawn i should see the house of murgh whereof the gates were always open and could enter there if i wished i asked if they would wait for my return whereon they answered smiling that if i so desired they would do so till evening but that it seemed scarcely needful since they did not suppose that i should return  do yonder pilgrims to the house of murgh return asked their captain pointing towards those graveyards which we had passed  i made no answer but walked forward up a broad and easy road unchallenged of any till i came to what even in that dim light i could see was a great and frowning gateway whereof the doors appeared to be open now at first i thought i would pass this gateway at once and see what lay beyond but from this i was held back by some great fear for which i could find no cause unless it were bred of what the emperor and his servants had said to me so i remembered their wordsnamely that i should tarry till dawn to enter the house  there then i tarried seated on the ground before the gateway and feeling as though yet alive i had descended among the dead indeed the silence was that of the dead no voice spoke no hound barked no leaf stirred only far above me i heard a continual soughing as though winged souls passed to and fro never in my life had i felt so much alone never so much afraid  at length the dawn broke and oh glad was i to see its light for fear lest i should die in darkness now i saw that i was on a hilltop where grew great groves of cedar trees and that set amid them was a blacktiled temple surrounded by a wall built of black brick  it was not a great place although the gateway which was surmounted by two black dragons of stone or iron was very great so great that a tall ship could have sailed through it and left its arch untouched  i kneeled down and prayed to the blessed saints and the guardian angels to protect me then i arose crossed myself to scare off all evil things by that holy sign and set forward toward the mighty gateway oh never never till that hour had i understood how lowly a thing is man on that broad road travelling toward the awful dragonguarded arch beyond which lay i knew not what it seemed to me that i was the only man left in the world i whose hour had come to enter the portals of destruction  i passed into the cold shadow of the gateway unchallenged by any watchman and found myself in a courtyard surrounded by a wall also built of black brick which had doors in it that seemed to be of dark stone or iron whither these doors led i do not know since the wall cut off the sight of any buildings that may have lain beyond in the centre of this courtyard was a pool of still black water and at the head of the pool a chair of black marble  sir andrew paused and hugh said  a plain place for a temple father without adornments or images but perhaps this was the outer court and the temple stood within  ay son the plainest temple that ever i saw who have seen many in all lands though what was beyond it i do not know and yetterrible terrible terriblei tell you that those black walls and that black water were more fearsome to look on than any churchyard vault grim with bones or a torturepit where victims quiver out their souls midst shrieks and groanings and yet i could see nothing of which to be afraid and hear nothing save that soughing of invisible wings whereof i have spoken an empty chair a pool of water some walls and doors and above the quiet sky what was there to fear in such things as these still so greatly did i fear that i sank to my knees and began to pray once more this time to the blessed saviour himself since i was sure that none else could help me  when i looked up again the chair was no longer empty hugh a man sat in it of whom i thought at first only one thingthat he must be very strong though not bigger than other men strength seemed to flow from him i should not have wondered if he had placed his hands upon the massive sides of that stone chair and torn it asunder  what was he like father samson or goliath  i never saw either son so cannot say but what was he like oh i cannot say that either although still i see him in my heart my mortal lips will not tell the likeness of that man perhaps because he seemed to be like all men and yet different from all he had an iron brow beneath which shone deep cold eyes he was cleanshaven or perchance his face grew no hair his lips were thick and still and his features did not change like those of other men he looked as though he could not change as though he had been thus for infinite ages and yet remained neither young nor old as for his dress he wore a cloak of flaming red such a cloak as your eve loves to wear and white sandals on his feet there was no covering on his shaven head which gleamed like a skull his breast was naked but across it hung one row of black jewels from the sheen of them i think they must have been pearls which are sometimes found of that colour in the east he had no weapon nor staff and his hands hung down on either side of the chair  for a long while i watched him but if he saw me he took no note as i watched i perceived that birds were coming to and leaving him in countless numbers and thought that it must be their wings which made the constant soughing sound that filled all the still and dreadful air  what kind of birds were they father  i am not sure but i think doves at least their flight was straight and swift like to that of doves yet of this i am not sure either since i saw each of them for but a second as they reached the man they appeared out of nothingness they were of two colours snowwhite and coalblack the white appeared upon his right side the black upon his left side each bird in those neverceasing streams hovered for an instant by his head the white over his right shoulder the black over his left shoulder as though they whispered a message to his ear and having whispered were gone upon their errand  what was that errand father  how can i know as no one ever told me yet i will hazard a guess that it had to do with the mystery of life and death souls that were born into the world and souls departing from the world perchance making report to one of gods ministers clothed in flesh but who can say at least i watched those magic fowls till my eyes grew dizzy and a sort of slumber began to creep into my brain  how long i stayed thus i do not remember for i had lost all sense of time in the end however i was awakened by a cold soft voice the sound of which seemed to flow through my veins like ice that addressed me in our own rough english tongue spoken as you and i learned it at our nurses knees  to what god were you praying just now andrew arnold  oh sir i answered how do you who dwell in cathay where i am a stranger know my language and my name  he lifted his cold eyes and looked at me and i felt them pierce into the depths of my soul in the same way that i know your heart he said but do not ask questions answer them that i may learn whether you are a true man or a liar  i was praying to christ i faltered the saviour of us all  a great god andrew arnold and a pure though his followers are few in the world as yet but do you think that he can save you from me as you were asking him to do  he can save my soul i replied plucking up courage who would not deny the lord even in a devils den  ah your soul well i have nothing to do with souls except to count them as they pass through my dominion and you are quite right to pray to one of the lords of that into which you go now man what is your business with me and why do you visit one of whom you are so much afraid  o murgh i began then ceased for i knew not what to answer  so they have told you my name now i will tell you one of its meanings it is gate of the gods why did you dare to visit gate of the gods you fear to answer listen you came forth to see some painted idol or some bedizened priest muttering rites he does not understand to that which is not and lo you have found that which is behind all idols and all priests you sought an incensed and a golden shrine and you have found only the black and iron portals which every man must pass but which few desire to enter until they are called well you are young and strong come try a fall with murgh and when he has thrown you rise and choose which of those ways you will and he swept his hand toward the doors around him then forget this world and enter into that which you have chosen  now because i could not help myself i rose from my knees and advanced or was drawn toward that dreadful man as i came he too rose from his chair stretching out his arms as a wrestler does and i knew that within the circle of those arms lay my death still i who in my youth was held brave went on and rushed striving to clasp him next moment before ever i touched himoh well was it for me that i touched him notsome strength seized me and whirled me round and round as a dead leaf is whirled by the wind and tossed me up and cast me down and left me prone and nerveless  rise said the cold voice above me for you are unhurt  so i rose and felt even then that i who thought that every bone in my body must be broken was stronger than i had ever been before it was as though the lamp which had burnt low was filled suddenly with a new and purer oil  man said mine adversary and i thought that in his cold eyes there was something like a smile did you think to touch murgh and live did you think to wrestle with him as in a book of one of your prophets a certain jacob wrestled with an angel and conquereduntil it was his turn to pass the gate of the gods  now i stared at this dweller in cathay who spoke my tongue and knew the tale of jacob in the ancient book then answered  sir murgh or sir gate or whatever your name may be i thought to do nothing you drew me to you you challenged me and since by the rule of my order i may refuse no challenge from one who is not a christian i came on to do my best but before ever i laid hand on you i was cast down by a wind that is all the story save that it has pleased you to let me live who evidently could have slain me for which i thank you  you are wrong sir andrew he answered i did not draw you to me men come to murgh at their appointed hour murgh does not come to them you sought him before your hour and therefore he refused you yet you will meet him again as all flesh must when its hour comes and because you are bold and have not cringed before my strength for your comfort i will show you when and how stand by me but lay no hand on me or my robe and look into my glass while for a moment for your sake i stay the stream of time and show you what lies beneath its foam that blinds the eyes of men  he waved his arms and the black doves and the white doves ceased to appear and disappear and the eternal soughings of their wings was silent he pointed to the water at his feet and i saw not a picture but a scene so real that i could have sworn it was alive about me yes those who took part in it stood in front of me as though the pool were solid ground that their feet pressed you were one of them son you were one of them and the old knight paused supporting himself against the mantelshelf as though that recollection overcame him  what did you see whispered hugh  by gods holy name i saw the blythburgh marshes deep in snow that was red bloodred with the light of sunrise oh i could not be mistook and there ran the wintry river there the church tower soared there were the frowning treeclad banks there was the rough moorland over which the east wind piped for the dead bracken bent before it and not twenty paces from me leaped a hare disturbed suddenly from its form by a hungry fox whose red head peeped through the reeds yes yes i saw the brutes white teeth gleam as it licked its disappointed lips and i felt glad that its prey had beaten it when you look upon that scene hugh as one day you shall remember the hare and the head of the hungry fox and by these judge my truth  a fox and a hare broke in hugh id show you such tomorrow was there no more  ay much for instance a hollow in the marsh an open grave and an axe yes an axe that had delved it where the bog was soft beneath the snow grey dick held the axe in one hand and his black bow in the other while red eve your eve stood at its edge and stared into it like one in a dream then at the head of the grave an old old man clad in mail beneath his priestly robes and that man myself hugh grown very ancient but still myself and no other  and at the foot of the grave you hugh de cressi you and no other wayworn and fierce but also clad in mail and wearing a knights crest upon your shield you with drawn sword in hand and facing you also with drawn sword rage and despair on his dark face a stately foreignlooking man whom mine eyes have never seen but whom i should know again midst a million a man who i think was doomed to fill the grave  lastly standing on a little mound near to the bank of the swirling river where jagged sheets of ice ground against each other like the teeth of the wicked in hell strangely capped and clad in black his arms crossed upon his breast and a light smile in his cold eyes he who was called murgh in cathay he who named himself gateway of the gods  for a moment i saw then all was gone and i found myselfi know not whywalking toward the mighty arch whereon sat the iron dragons in its shadow i turned and looked back there at the head of the pool the man was seated in his chair and to right and to left of him came the black doves and the white doves in countless multitudes all the thousands of them that had been stayed in their flight pouring down upon him at onceor so i thought they wheeled about his head they hid his face from me and ii departed into the shadow of the arch and i saw him and them no more    chapter iv  the penance  the tale was done and these two stood staring at one another from each side of the glowing hearth whose red light illumined their faces at length the heavy silence was broken by sir andrew  i read your heart hugh he said as murgh read mine for i think that he gave me not only strength but something of his wisdom also whereby i was able to win safe back to england and to this hour to walk unharmed by many a pit i read your heart and in its book is written that you think me mad one who pleases his old age with tales of marvel that others told him or which his own brain fashioned  not so father answered hugh uneasily for in truth some such thoughts were passing through his mind onlyonly the thing is very strange and it happened so long ago before eve and i were born before those that begot us were born either perchance  yes more than fifty years agoit may be sixtyi forget in sixty years the memory plays strange tricks with men no doubt so how can i blame you if you believewhat you do believe and yet hugh he went on after a pause and speaking with passion this was no dream of which i tell you why do you suppose that among all those that have grown up about me i have chosen you out to love you and your eve not because a chance made me your godsire and her my pupil i say that from your infancy your faces haunted me ay and when you had turned childhoods corner and once i met the pair of you walking hand in hand then of a sudden i knew that it was you two and no others whom that god or devil had showed to me standing by the open grave upon the banks of blythe i knew it of dick the archer also and can i be mistaken of such a man as that who has no fellow in england but you think i dreamed it all and perhaps i should not have spoken though something made me speak well in a day to come you may change your mind since whatever dangers threaten you will not die yet hugh tell me now what is this frenchman like who would marry eve i have never seen him  hugh who was glad to get back to the things of earth described acour as best he could  ah said sir andrew much such a man as stood face to face with you by the grave while murgh watched and you are not likely to be friends are you but i forgot you have determined that it was but a dream and now you are wondering how he who is called gate of the gods in cathay could come to blythburgh well i think that all the world is his garden given to him by god but doubtless thats only another face of my dream whereof well speak no moreat present now for your troubles which are no dream lie you down to sleep on the skin of that striped beast i killed it in cathayin my day of dreams and now it shall serve for yours from which may the dead eyes of john clavering be absent i go forth to seek your father and to arrange certain matters with grey dick at the door youll be safe for a while i think if not heres a cupboard where you may hide and drawing aside the arras he showed him a certain secret place large enough to hold a man then left the room  hugh laid himself upon the skin of the beast which had been a tiger though he did not know it by that name so weary was he that not all he had gone through that day or even the old warriorpriests marvellous tale in which he and eve played so wonderful a part could keep his eyes from closing presently he was fast asleep and so remained until four hours later something disturbed him and he awoke to see sir andrew writing at a desk  rise my son said the old priest without looking up from his paper early as it is you must be stirring if you would be clear of dunwich by daybreak and keep a whole skin i have set a taper in my sleepingcloset yonder and there youll find water to wash with and a stool to kneel on for your prayers neither of which neglect since you have blood on your hands and great need for heavens help  so hugh arose yawning and stumbled heavily to the chamber for he was still faint with sleep which would not leave him till he had plunged his head into a basin of icy water this done he knelt and prayed as he had been bidden with a very earnest heart and afterward came back to the guesthall  seeing folk gathered there as he entered he laid hand on sword not his own with which he had killed his cousin but a long and knightly weapon that sir andrew had given him with the armour drawing it he advanced boldly for he thought that his enemies might have found him out and that his best safety lay in courage thus he appeared in the ring of the lamplight clad in gleaming steel and with raised weapon  what son asked a testy voice which he knew for that of his own father is it not enough to have killed your cousin would you fall on your brothers and me also that you come at us clad in mail and with bare steel in hand  hearing these words hugh sheathed the sword and advancing toward the speaker a handsome portly man who wore a merchants robe lined with rich fur sank to his knee before him  your pardon my father he said sir andrew here will have told you the story also that i am not to blame for this bloodshedding  i think you need to ask it replied master de cressi and if you and that lean henchman of yours are not to blame then say who is  now a tall slim figure glided up to them it was eve clothed in her own robe again and beautiful as ever after her short rest  sir i am to blame she said in her full low voice my need was sore and i sent a messenger to hugh bidding him meet me in the blythburgh marsh there we were set on and there john clavering my brother smote hugh in the face would you a de cressi have had him take the blow and yield me up to the frenchman  by god and my forefathers no least of all from one of your stocksaving your presence answered the merchant in truth had he done so dead or living from that day i would have called him no son of mine yet red eve you and he and your lovemakings have brought much trouble on me and my house look now what it means a feud to the death between our families of which no man can foresee the end moreover how can you marry seeing that a brothers blood runs between you  it is on johns head she answered sadly not on hughs hand i warned him and hugh spared him once what more could we do  i know not eve i only know what you have done you and hugh and grey dick four dead and two wounded thats the bill i must discharge as best i may doubtless too soon there will be more to follow whether they be claverings or de cressis well we must take things as god sends them and leave him to balance the account  but there is no time to lose if hughs neck is to escape a halter speak you father andrew who are wise and old and have this matter in hand oh hugh hugh you were born a fighter not a merchant like your brethren and he pointed to three young men who all this while had stood silently behind him looking upon their youngest brother with grave disapproval yes the old norman blood comes out in you and the norman mail suits you well he added with a flash of pride and so theres an endor a beginning now sir andrew speak  master de cressi said the old priest your son hugh rides to london on an errand of mine which i think will save his neck from that halter whereof you spoke but now are those four mounted men that you promised me ready to companion him  they will be within an hour father but not before since six good horses cannot be laid hands on in the dead of night being stabled without the gates but what is this message of yours and to whom does hugh go  to his grace edward the king none less geoffrey de cressi with that which shall earn pardon for him and dick the archer or so i believe as for what it is i may not tell you or any man it has to do with great matters of state that are for the kings ear alone and i charge you every one on your honour and your safety to make no mention of this mission without these walls do you swear geoffrey de cressi and you his sons  then one by one they swore to be secret as the grave and eve swore also though of her he had sought no promise when this was finished sir andrew asked if any of his brothers accompanied hugh saying that if so they must arm  no answered master de cressi one of the family is enough to risk as well as four of our best servants my sons bide here with me who may need their help though they are not trained to arms  perhaps it is as well said sir andrew drily though were i their agewell let that be now son hugh before you eat do you and eve come with me into the church  at these words hugh flushed red with joy and opened his lips to speak  nay nay broke in sir andrew with a frown for a different purpose to that which is in your mind man is this a time for marrying and giving in marriage and if it were could i marry you who are stained with newshed blood tis that you both may be absolved from the guilt of that blood and learn the penance which god decrees to you through the mouth of me his unworthy minister in payment of its shedding thus you son may go forth upon your great adventure with a clean heart and you daughter may await what shall befall with a quiet mind say are you willing  now they bowed their heads and answered that they were though eve whispered to hugh that she misdoubted her of this talk of penance  so do i he replied beneath his breath but he is a merciful confessor and loves us from some it might be harder  they passed down the stairs followed by master de cressi and his sons into the entrance hall where grey dick stood watching by the door  whither go they he asked of sir andrew for their road is mine  to confession at gods altar answered the old priest do you come also richard  oh he replied i hoped it had been to breakfast as for confession i have naught upon my soul save that i shot too low at the frenchman  bide where you are o man of blood said sir andrew sternly and pray that a better mood be given to you before it is too late  ay father he answered unabashed ill pray and it is as well that one should wait to watch the door lest you should all presently become men of blood against your will  turning to the right sir andrew led them down steps to a passage underground that joined the temple to the church of the holy virgin and st john it was but short and at the end of it they found a massive door which he unbolted and passing this door entered the great building whereof the silence and the icy cold struck them like blows they had but two lanterns between them one of which master de cressi and his elder sons took with them to the nave of the church bearing the other sir andrew departed into the vestry leaving hugh and eve seated together in the darkness of the chancel stalls  presently his light reappeared in the confessional where he sat robed and thither at his summons went first hugh and then eve when their tales were told those who watched in the nave of the splendid buildingwhich reared by the knights templar was already following that great order to decay and ruinsaw the star of light he bore ascend to the high altar here he set it down and advancing to the rail addressed the two shadowy figures that knelt before him  son and daughter he said you have made confession with contrite hearts and the church has given you absolution for your sins yet penance remains and because those sins though grievous in themselves were not altogether of your own making it shall be light hugh de cressi and eve clavering who are bound together by lawful love between man and woman and the solemn oath of betrothal which you here renew before god this is the penance that i lay upon you by virtue of the authority in me vested as a priest of christ because between you runs the blood of john clavering the cousin of one of you and the brother of the other slain by you hugh de cressi in mortal combat but yester eve i decree and enjoin that for a full year from this day you shall not be bound together as man and wife in the holy bonds of matrimony nor converse after the fashion of affianced lovers if you obey this her command faithfully then by my mouth the church declares that after the year has gone by you may lawfully be wed where and when you will moreover she pronounces her solemn blessing on you both and her dreadful curse upon any and upon all who shall dare to sunder you against your desires and of this blessing and this curse let all the congregation take notice  now hugh and eve rose and vanished into the darkness when they had gone the priest celebrated a short mass but two or three prayers and a blessing which done all of them returned to the preceptory as they had come  here food was waiting for them prepared by the old sister agnes it was a somewhat silent meal of which no one ate very much except grey dick who remarked aloud that as this might be his last breakfast it should be plentiful since shriven or unshriven it was better to die upon a full stomach  master de cressi called him an impious knave then he asked him if he had plenty of arrows because if not he would find four dozen of the best that could be made in norwich done up in a cloak on the grey horse he was to ride and a spare bow also  i thank you for the arrows master but as for the bow i use none but my own the black bow which the sea brought to me and death alone shall part from me perchance both will be wanted since the claverings will scarcely let us out of the sanctuary if they can help it still it is true they may not know where we lie hid and that is our best chance of eating more good breakfasts this side the grave  a pest on your evil talk said de cressi with an uneasy laugh for he loved hugh best of all his sons and was afraid of him get through safely man and though i like not your grim face and bloody ways you shall lose little by it i promise you he added in a whisper that if you bring my boy safe home again you shall not want for all your life ay and if there is need ill pay your bloodscot for you  thank you master thank you ill remember and for my part promise you this that if he does not return safe dick the archer never will but i think ill live to shoot more than your four dozen of arrows  as he spoke there came a knock upon the outer door and every one sprang up  fear not said sir andrew doubtless it will be the men with the horses ill go look come you with me richard  presently he returned saying that it was so and that master de cressis servants were waiting with the beasts in the courtyard also that they brought tidings that some of the clavering party were now at the mayors house rousing him from his sleep doubtless to lay information of the slayings and ask for warrant to take those who wrought them should they be in the borough  then we had best be going said hugh since soon they will be here with or without their warrant  ay answered sir andrew here are the papers take them hugh and hide them well and if any accident should befall you try to pass them on to richard that they may be delivered into the kings hands at westminster say that sir andrew arnold sends you on business that has to do with his graces safety and neither of you will be refused a hearing then act as he may command you and maybe ere long we shall see you back at dunwich pardoned  i think it is the claverings and their french lord who need pardon not i said hugh but be that as it may what of eve  fear not for eve son for here she bides in sanctuary until the frenchman is out of england or perchance he added grimly under english soil  ay ay well guard the maid broke in master de cressi come to saddle ere you be trapped  so they descended to a back entrance and through it into the courtyard where the four armed men waited with six good horses one of them hughs own here he bade farewell to his brothers to his father who kissed him on the brow and to sir andrew who stretched his hand above his head in blessing then he turned to eve and was about to embrace her even before that company when sir andrew looked at him and remembering the penance that had been laid upon him he but pressed her hand whispering  god be with you sweetheart  he is with us all but i would that you could be with me also she answered in the same low voice still man must forth to battle and woman must wait and watch for that is the worlds way whateer befalls remember that dead or living ill be wife to no man but you begone now ere my heart fails me and guard yourself well remembering that you bear in your breast not one life but two  then hugh swung himself to the saddle of which grey dick had already tested the girths and stirrup leathers in another minute the six of them were clattering over the stones of middlegate street while the burgesses of dunwich peeped from their window places wondering what knight with armed men rode through their town thus early  just as the grey dawn broke they passed the gate which there being peace in the land was already open fifteen minutes later they were on the lonely westleton heath where for a while naught was to be heard save the scream of the curlew and the rush of the wings of the wildduck passing landward from the sea presently however another sound reached their ears that of horses galloping behind them grey dick pulled rein and listened  seven i think not more he said now master do you stand or run for these will be clavering horses  hugh thought for a moment his aim was not to fight but to get through to london yet if he fled the pursuers would raise the country on them as they came so that in the end they must be taken since those who followed would find fresh horses  it seems best to stand he said  so say i answered grey dick and led the way to a little hillock by the roadside on which grew some windbent firs  here they dismounted and gave their horses into the keeping of one man while grey dick and the others drew their bows from the cases and strung them scarcely had they done so when the mist lifting in the morning breeze showed them their pursuersseven of them as dick had saidheaded by one of the french knights and riding scattered between two and three hundred yards away at the same moment a shout told them that they had been seen  hark now all said hugh i would shed no more blood if it may be so who have earned enough of penance therefore shoot at the horses not at the riders who without them will be helpless and let no man harm a clavering unless it be to save his own life  poor sport grunted grey dick  nevertheless when the norman knight who led came within two hundred yards shouting to them in french to surrender dick lifted his great bow drew and loosed carelessly as though he shot at hazard the others holding their bows till the claverings were nearer yet there was little of hazard when grey dick shot save to that at which he aimed away rushed the arrow rising high and as it seemed bearing somewhat to the left of the knight yet when it drew near to that knight the wind told on it and bent it inward as he knew it would fair and full it struck upon the horses chest piercing through to the heart so that down the poor beast came throwing its rider to the ground  a good shot enough grumbled grey dick still it is a shame to slay nags of such a breed and let the rogues who ride them go  but his companions only stared at him almost in awe while the other clavering men rode on before they had covered fifty paces again the great bow twanged and again a horse was seen to rear itself up shaking the rider from its back and then plunge away to die now hughs servingmen also lifted their bows but grey dick hissed  leave them to me this is fine work and youd muddle it  ere the words had ceased to echo another horse was down  then as those who remained still came on urged by the knight who ran shouting behind them all loosed and though some arrows went wide the end of it was that ere they reached the little mound every clavering horse was dead or sore wounded while on the heath stood or lay seven helpless men  now said grey dick let us go and talk with these footsoldiers  so they went out all of them except he who had the horses and hugh called aloud that the first man of the claverings who lifted a bow or drew a sword should die without mercy and he pointed to grey dick who stood beside him arrow on string  the claverings began to talk together excitedly  throw down your weapons commanded hugh  still they hesitated then without further warning dick sent an artful arrow through the cap of one of them lifting it from his head and instantly set another shaft to his string after this down went the swords and bows  daggers and knives too if it please you masters  then these followed  now hugh spoke a word to his men who going to the dead and dying horses took from them the stirrupleathers and bridlereins and therewith bound the claverings back to back but the french knight in acknowledgment of his rank they trussed up by himself having first relieved him of his purse by way of fine as it chanced however hugh turned and saw them in the act  gods truth would you make common thieves of us he said angrily their weapons and harness are ours by right of war but ill hunt the man who steals their money out of my company  so the purse was restored when it was safe in the knights pouch again hugh saluted him begging his pardon that it should have been touched  but how are you named sir he added  sir pierre de la roche is my name replied the knight sadly and in french  then sir pierre de la roche said hugh here you and your people must bide until some come to set you free which as this place is lonely and little crossed in winter may be today or may be tomorrow when at length you get back to blythburgh manor however or to dunwich town i trust it to your honour to declare that hugh de cressi has dealt well with you for whereas he might have slain you every one as you would have slain him and his if you could he has harmed no hair of your heads as for your horses these to his sorrow he was obliged to kill lest they should be used to ride him down will you do this of your courtesy  ay answered the knight since to your gentleness we owe our lives but with your leave i will add that we were overcome not by men but by a deviland he nodded toward grey dicksince no one who is only man can have such hellish skill in archery as we saw yesterday and now again this morning moreover he went on contemplating dicks ashen hair and cold eyes set wide apart in the rocky face like to those of a suffolk horse the mans air shows that he is in league with satan  ill not render your words into our english talk sir pierre replied hugh lest he of whom you speak should take them amiss and send you where you might learn them false for know had he been what you say the arrow that lies in your horses heart would have nailed the breastplate to your own now take a message from me to your lord sir edmund acour the traitor tell him that i shall return ere long and that if he should dare to attempt ill toward the lady eve who is my betrothed or toward my father and brethren or any of my house i promise in grey dicks name and my own to kill him or those who may aid him as i would kill a forest wolf that had slunk into my sheepfold farewell there is bracken and furze yonder where you may lie warm till some pass your way mount men  so they rode forward bearing all the clavering weapons with them which a mile or two further on grey dick hid in an empty foxs earth where he knew he could find them again only he kept the french knights beautiful dagger that was made of spanish steel inlaid with gold and used it to his lifes end  here it may be told that it was not until thirtysix hours had gone by as hugh learned afterward that a countryman brought this knight and his companions more dead than alive to dunwich in his wain as he was travelling across westleton heath with a load of corn to be ground at the dunwich mill it seemed that he heard voices calling feebly and guided by them found these unhappy men half buried in the snow that had fallen on that day and so rescued them from death  but when sir edmund acour knew the story of their overthrow and of the message that hugh had sent to him he raved at them and especially at sir pierre de la roche saying that the worst of young de cressis crimes against him was that he had left such cowardly hounds alive upon the earth so he went on madly till sir john clavering checked him bidding him wait to revile these men until he and not his horse had met grey dicks arrows and hugh de cressis sword  for he added it may happen then that you will fare no better than they have done or than did john my son    on the morning of the third day after they left dunwich having been much delayed by foul weather and fouler roads hugh de cressi and his company came at length to london they had suffered no further adventure on their way for though the times were rough and they met many evillooking fellows none ventured to lift hand against six men so well armed and sturdy guided by one of their number who had often been to london on master de cressis business they rode straight to westminster having stabled their horses at an inn near by and cleaned the mire of the road from their mail and garments they went up to the palace where hugh told his errand to an officer whom he found on duty at the gate  then it is a fools errand said the captain seeing that his grace rode yesterday to his castle at windsor to hunt and revel and will be gone eight days at the least  then to windsor i must follow answered hugh    chapter v  grey dick shows his archery  so sorely did the horses need rest that hugh and his people could not ride from london till the following morning and evening was closing in before they found themselves drawing near the gate of windsor castle in the marketplace of the little town they pulled rein while one of them went to search for a good inn at which they might lie for the place seemed to be very full of people suddenly as they stood there wondering at the mighty newbuilt keep which towered above them a trumpet was blown and from round a corner appeared a gay procession of noblelooking men and with them some ladies who carried hawk on wrist all mounted on splendid horses  now the people who had gathered to study the strangers or tout for their custom took off their bonnets and bent low saying the king the king god save him  which is his grace asked hugh of one of them whereon the man pointed to a royaleyed and bearded knight still in early middle life who rode toward him talking to a gallant youth at his side  now a thought came into hughs mind that the present time is always the best time to strike leaping from his horse he advanced bowing and stood in the pathway of the king seeing this two of the fine court lords spurred their horses and rode straight at him thinking to drive him back but he held his ground for their insolence made him angry and catching the bridle of one of the horses threw it on its haunches so sharply that the knight who rode it rolled from his saddle into the mire whereupon every one laughed in a moment he was on his feet again and shouting  out of the road jackanapes dressed in your grandfathers mail unless you would stop there in the stocks do you know whose path you block  that of his grace answered hugh for whom i have a message that he will be glad to hear and popinjay this for yourself were it not for his presence it is you who should stop upon the road till you were carried thence  now noting this disturbance the king spoke to the youth at his side who came forward and said in a pleasant courteous voice addressing hugh  sir why do you make trouble in these streets and tumble the good sir ambrose lacey from his horse with such scant ceremony  sir answered hugh because the good sir ambrose tried to ride his horse over me for no offence save that i would deliver a message to his grace which he will wish to hear  this is scarcely a time for the giving of messages replied the young man but what is your name and who sends the message i am the prince edward he added modestly so you may speak to me without fear  my name is hugh de cressi your highness and i am sent by the reverend father sir andrew arnold of dunwich and have followed his grace from westminster whither i and my men rode first  now the prince went to the king and spoke to him and returning presently said  my father says that he knows both the names you give well enough and holds them dear he bids that you and your people should follow him to the castle where you will be entertained with your horses sir ambrose he added the king desires that you should forget your choler since he saw what passed and deems that this young stranger did well to check your horse follow on hugh de cressi the officers will show you where you and your men may lodge  so hugh obeyed and rode with the rest of the train and his folks through the gates of windsor castle nor did they do so unobserved since many of the court had no love for sir ambrose and were glad to see him tumbled in the mire  after they had stabled their beasts as hugh followed by grey dick was advancing toward a hall which he was told that he might enter an officer came up  his grace desires your presence before you sup he said  pointing to grey dick at whom the officer looked doubtfully hugh asked that he might accompany him as he had much to do with the message after some argument they were led through various passages to a chamber at the door of which the officer wished to take away dicks bow but he would not give it up  the bow and i do not part he said in his croaking voice for we are husband and wife and live and sleep together as the married should  as dick spoke the door was opened and prince edward appeared  and do you eat together also good fellow he asked having overheard the talk  ay sir we feed full together replied dick grimly or so thought some on blythburgh marsh a few days gone  i should like to hear that tale said the prince meanwhile since both my father and i love archers let him pass with his bow only keep his arrows lest it should happen to grow hungry here  then they entered the chamber led by the prince it was a fine place with a vaulted stone roof and windows of coloured glass that looked like the chancel of a church only at the head of it where the altar should have been was a kind of dais on this dais were set some highbacked oaken chairs with many lanterns behind them in which burned tapers that together with a great wood fire gave light to the chamber  in one of these chairs sat a gracious lady who was embroidering something silken in a frame this was queen philippa and talking to her stood the tall king clad in a velvet robe lined with fur behind seated at a little table on which lay parchments was a man in a priests robe writing there was no one else in the room  hugh and dick advanced to the foot of the dais and stood there bowing  who are these asked the king of the prince oh i remember the man who overthrew sir ambrose and said he had a message  ay sire answered the prince and this dustcoloured fellow is his servant who will not part with his bow which he calls his wife and says he sleeps with  i would all englishmen did the same broke in the king say man can you shoot straight  i know not sire replied grey dick but perhaps straighter than most for god who withheld all else from me gave me this gift at least if i be not made drunk overnight ill match myself against any man at this court noble or simple and stake twenty angels on it  twenty angels have you so much fellow  nay sire nor more than one but as i know i shall win what does that matter  son said the king see that this man is kept sober tonight and tomorrow we will have a shooting match but sirrah if you prove yourself to be a boaster you shall be whipped round the walls for i love not tall words and small deeds and now young master de cressi what is this message of yours  hugh thrust his hand into his bosom and produced a sealed packet which was addressed to his grace king edward of england sent from andrew arnold priest by the hand of hugh de cressi  can you read the king asked of hugh when he had spelt out this superscription  ay sire at least if the writing be that of sir andrew arnold for he was my master  a learned one and a brave hugh de cressi well break seal we listen  hugh obeyed and read as follows  your grace  mayhap sire you will remember me andrew arnold late master of the templars in this town of dunwich in whose house by your warrant for certain services rendered to your grandsire your sire and to yourself i still dwell on as a priest ordained sire the bearer of this hugh de cressi my godchild is the son of geoffrey de cressi of this town the great woolmerchant with whom your highness has had dealings  in truth i have interrupted the king with a laugh also i think the account is still openagainst myself well it shall be paid some day when i have conquered france forward  sire this hugh is enamoured of eve clavering daughter of sir john clavering of blythburgh a cousin of his house a very beauteous maiden commonly known as red eve and she in turn is enamoured of and betrothed to him  here queen philippa suddenly became interested  why is the lady called red eve sir she asked in her soft voice because her cheeks are red  no madam answered hugh blushing because she always loves to wear red garments  ah then she is dark  that is so madam her eyes and hair are black as ashbuds  gods truth lady interrupted king edward is this young mans message of the colour of the eyes of his mistress which without doubt being in love he describes falsely on with the letter  out of this matter continued hugh rose a feud yesterday during which hugh de cressi killed his cousin john fighting à outrance and his servant richard the archer who accompanies him commonly known as grey dick slew three men with as many arrows two of them being normans whose names are unknown to us and the third a grieve to sir john clavering called thomas of kessland also he killed a horse and when another frenchman tried to grasp his master sent a shaft through the palm of his hand  by st george said the king but here is shooting were they near to you grey dick  not so far away sire only the light was very bad or i should have had the fourth i aimed low sire fearing to miss his skull and he jerked up his horses head to take the arrow  a good trick ive played it myself well let us have done with the letter and then well come to archery  sire read on hugh i ask your royal pardon to hugh de cressi and richard the archer for these slayings believing that when you have read these letters it will be granted  that remains to be seen muttered the king  sire sir edmund acour who has lands here in suffolk count de noyon in normandy and seigneur of cattrina in italy  i know the man exclaimed edward to the queen and so do you a handsome knight and a pleasant but one of whom i have always misdoubted me  is also enamoured of eve clavering and with her fathers will seeks to make her his wife though she hates him and by the charter of dunwich of which she is a citizen has the right to wed whom she will  it is well there are not many such charters the old storybrave men done to death for the sake of a woman who is rightly named red eve mused the king  my liege i pray that you will read the letter herein enclosed hugh de cressi will tell you how it came to my hand since i lack time to write all the story if it seems good to your grace i pray you scotch this snake while he is in your garden lest he should live to sting you when you walk abroad if it please you to give your royal warrant to the bearer of this letter and to address the same to such of your subjects in dunwich as you may think good i doubt not but that men can be found to execute the same thus would a great and traitorous plot be brought to nothing to your own glory and the discomfiture of your foes in france who hope to lay their murderous hands upon the throne of england your humble servant and subject  andrew arnold   whats this exclaimed the king starting from his seat to lay hands upon the throne of england quick with the other letter man  i was charged that it is for your graces eye alone said hugh as he unfolded the paper is it your pleasure that i read it aloud if i can for it is writ in french  give it me said the king philippa come help me with this crabbed stuff  then they withdrew to the side of the dais and standing under a lantern spelled out sir edmund acours letter to the duke of normandy word by word  the king finished the letter and still holding it in his hand stood for a minute silent then his rage broke out  he of england he quoted thats your husband edward lady who is to be overthrown and killed that philips son may take his seat and be crowned king at westminster which god is to bring about before this year is out yes and my cities are to be sacked and my people slain and this french dog edmund acour who has sworn fealty to me is to be rewarded with wide english lands and high english titles well by gods blood i swear that dead or living he shall be lifted higher than he hopes though not by normandy or my brother of france let me think let me think if i send menatarms hell hear of it and slip away did not good old sir andrew call him a snake now wheres this girl red eve  in sanctuary sire at the temple church in dunwich answered hugh  ah and shes a great heiress now for you killed her brother and acour although he has wide possessions in sundry lands was ever a spendthrift and deep in debt no hell not leave unless he can get the girl and old sir andrew will guard her well with the power of the church and with his own right arm if need be for hes still more knight than priest so theres no hurry tell me all you know of this story hugh de cressi omitting nothing however small nay have no fear if you can vouch for your fellow there all of us in this chamber are loyal to england speak out man  so hugh began and told of the de cressis and the claverings and their feud and of how he and eve had always loved each other he told of their meeting in the reeds of blythburgh fen and of the death of john de clavering at his hand and of the others at the hand of grey dick and of the escape of acour from the fourth arrow he told how he and eve had swum the blyth in flood though the ice cut them and hid on the moor while grey dick led the claverings astray and came at last safe to sanctuary he told how acours letter had been won from his messenger by sir andrews loyal guile he told of the penance that sir andrew had laid upon them because of the newshed blood of john clavering of the flight from dunwich and the shooting of the horses of the clavering men and of their ride to london and to windsor he told everything save only the tale of what sir andrew had seen in the house of murgh in far cathay  when at last he had finished and though it was long none there grew weary of that story the king turned to the clerk and said  brother peter make out a full pardon to hugh de cressi of dunwich and richard archer his servant for all slayings or other deeds wrought by them contrary to our general peace draw it wide and bring the same to me for execution ere i sleep tonight make out a commission also to the mayor of dunwichnay ill think that matter over and instruct you further hugh de cressi you have our thanks and if you go on as you have begun you shall have more ere long for i need such men about me you also strange and deathlike man named grey dick shall not lack our favour if it proves that you can shoot but half as well as you have boasted and unless you lie both of you as it seems that you have done and now to supper though in truth this news does not kindle appetite son see that this gentleman is well served and that none mock him more about the fashion of his armour above all sir ambrose for ill not suffer it plate and damascene do not make a man and this it seems was borrowed from as brave ay and as learned a knight as ever bestrode a horse in war come lady and taking the queen by the hand he left the chamber  that evening hugh ate his food seated among the knights of the household at a high table in the great hall at the head of which for the king supped in private was placed the young prince edward he noted that now none laughed at him about the fashion of his mail or his country ways indeed when after supper sir ambrose lacey came to him and asked his pardon for the talk that he had used to him in the windsor streethe was sure that some word had been sent round that his business had brought him favour with the king and that he must be treated with all courtesy several of those who sat round him tried to discover what that business was but of this he would say nothing parrying their questions with others about the wars in france and listening with open ears to the tales of great deeds done there  ah would that i could see such things he said  to which one of them answered  well why not therell be chance enough ere long and many of us would be glad of a square built like you  now at lower tables in that vast hall hughs servants and with them grey dick sat among the menatarms of the kings guard who were all chosen for their courage and skill in archery these soldiers noting the strangefaced ashenhaired fellow who ate with his bow resting on the bench beside him inquired about him from the other dunwich men and soon heard enough to cause them to open their eyes when the ale had got hold of them they opened their mouths also and crowding round dick asked if it were true that he could shoot well  as well as another he answered and would say no more  then they looked at his bow and saw that it was oldfashioned like his masters mail and of some foreign make and wood but a mighty weapon such as few could handle and hold straight lastly they began to challenge him to a match upon the morrow to which he answered who also had been drinking ale and was growing angry that hed give the best of them five points in fifty  now they mocked for among them were some famous archers and asked at what range  at any ye will answered grey dick from twelve score yards down to one score yards now trouble me no longer who if i must shoot tomorrow would sleep first and drink no more of your strong ale that breeds bad humours in one reared upon dyke water  then seizing his bow he glided away in his curious stoatlike fashion to the hole where he had been shown that he should sleep  a braggart said one  i am not so sure answered a grizzled captain of archers who had fought in many wars braggarts make a noise but this fellow only spoke when we squeezed him and perhaps what came out of those thin lips was truth at least from his look id sooner not find him against me bow to bow  then they fell to betting which of them would beat grey dick by the heaviest points    next morning about nine oclock the king sent a messenger to hugh bidding him and his servant richard wait upon them they went with this messenger who led them to a little chamber where his grace sat attended only by the clerk brother peter and a darkbrowed minister whose name he never learned  hugh de cressi and richard archer said edward motioning to the minister to hand hugh a parchment to which hung a great seal here is the pardon which i promised you no need to stay to read it since it is as wide as windsor keep and woe betide him who lifts hand against either of you for aught you may have done or left undone in the past contrary to the laws of our realm yet remember well that this grace runs not to the future now that matter is ended and we come to one that is greater because of the faith put in you by our loyal and beloved subject sir andrew arnold your godsire and because we like the fashion of you hugh de cressi and hold you brave and honest it has pleased us to give you a commission under which we direct the mayor of dunwich and all true and lawful men of that town and hundred to aid you in the taking or if need be in the slaying of our subject sir edmund acour count of noyon and seigneur of cattrina we command you to bring this man before us alive or dead that his cause may be judged of our courts and the truth of the matter alleged against him by the reverend father sir andrew arnold therein determined nevertheless we command you not to wound or kill the said knight unless he resists the authority of us by you conveyed and you cannot otherwise hold him safe from escaping from out this our realm this commission you will presently go forth to execute keeping its tenor and your aim secret until the moment comes to strike and as you perform your duty of which you will return and make report to us so shall we judge and reward you do you understand  sire answered hugh bowing i understand and i will obey to my last breath  good when the parchments are engrossed my officer here will read them to you and explain aught that may need it meanwhile we have an hour or two during which your horses can eat for there are no fresh beasts here to give you and it is best to avoid doubts that you should return as you came only showing your powers if any should attempt to arrest you so let us have done with these heavy matters and disport us for a while this servant of yours has made a common boast that he will outshoot any of our picked archers and now we are ready to go forth and put him to the proof of the butts let him know however that notwithstanding our words of yesterday we shall not hold him to blame if he fails since many a man of higher degree promises more at night than he can perform in the morning  sire ill do my best i can no more said grey dick only i pray that none may be suffered to hang about or pester me at the butts since i am a lonely man who love not company when i use my art  that shall be so said the king and now to the sport  the sport grumbled grey dick when he and hugh were alone together why it is other sport we should be seeking with acour and his knaves for targets go to the king master and show him that while we linger here the frenchman may slip away or work more and worse treasons  i cannot dick the parchments are not written out and his grace is bent upon this pleasure match moreover man all these archers hereyes and their betters alsowould say that you had fled because you were an empty boaster who dared not face the trial  theyd say that would they snarled grey dick yes theyd say that which would be bitter hearing for you and me well they shall not say it yet i tell you master he added in a burst of words although i know not why id rather bear their scorn and be away on the road to dunwich  it may not be dick replied hugh shaking his head doubtfully see here they come to fetch us    in a glade of the forest of windsor situated near to the castle and measuring some twentyfive score yards of open level ground stood grey dick a strange uncouth figure at whom the archers of the guard laughed nudging each other in his bony hand however he held that at which they did not laugh namely the great black bow six feet six inches long which he said had come to him from the sea and was fashioned not of yew but of some heavy closegrained wood grown perhaps in southern or even in far eastern lands still one of them who had tried to draw this bow to his ear and could not said aloud that the suffolk man would do naught with that clumsy pole whereat grey dick who heard him grinning showing his white teeth like an angry dog  near by on horseback and on foot were the king the young prince edward and many knights and ladies while on the other side stood scores of soldiers and other folk from the castle who came to see this ugly fellow well beaten at his own game  dick whispered hugh shoot now as you never shot before teach them a lesson for the honour of suffolk  let me be master he grumbled i told you i would do my best  then he sat himself down on the grass and began to examine his arrows one by one to all appearance taking no heed of anything else  presently came the first test at a distance of five score yards was set a little clout or target of white wood not more than two feet square this clout had a red mark or eye three inches across painted in its centre and stood not very high above the sward  now richard said the king three of the best archers that we have about us have been chosen to shoot against you and each other by their fellows say will you draw first or last  last sire he answered that i may know their mettle  then a man stepped forward a strong and gallant looking fellow and loosed his three arrows the first missed the clout the second pierced the white wood and the third hit the red eye  the clout having been changed and the old one brought to the king with the arrows in it the second man took his turn this time all three of the arrows hit the mark one of them being in the red again it was changed and forth came the great archer of the guard a tall and cleareyed man named jack green and whom it was said none had ever beaten he drew and the arrow went home in the red on its left edge he drew again and the arrow went home in the red on its right edge he drew a third time and the arrow went home straight in the very centre of the red where was a little black spot  now a great laugh went up since clearly the suffolk man was beaten ere ever he began  your dick may do as well he can do no better said the king when the target was brought to him  grey dick looked at it  a boon your grace said dick grant that this clout may be set up again with the arrows fast any may know them from mine since they are grey whereas those i make are black for i am a fletcher in my spare hours and love my own handiwork  so be it said the king wondering and the clout was replaced upon its stand  now grey dick stretched himself looked at the clout looked at his bow and set a blackwinged arrow on the string then he drew it seemed but lightly and carelessly as though he thought the distance small away flew the shaft and sank into the red a good inch within the leftmost arrow of jack green  ah said the onlookers a lucky shot indeed  again he drew and again the arrow sank into the red a good inch within the rightmost shot of jack green  oh said the onlookers this man is an archer but jacks last he cannot best let the devil help him how he will  in the devils name then be silent wheezed grey dick with a flash of his halfopened eye  ay be silentbe silent said the king we do not see such shooting every day  now dick set his foot apart and arrow on string thrice he lifted his bow and thrice let it sink again perhaps because he felt some breath of wind stir the still air a fourth time he lifted and drew not as he had before but straight to the ear then loosed at once  away rushed the yardlong shaft and folk noted that it scarcely seemed to rise as arrows do or at least not half so high it rushed it smote and there was silence for none could see exactly what had happened then he who stood near the target to mark ran forward and screamed out  by gods name he has shattered jack greens centre arrow and shot clean through the clout  then from all sides rose the old archer cry he he he he while the young prince threw his cap on high and the king said  would that there were more such men as this in england jack green it seems that you are beaten  nay said grey dick seating himself again upon the grass there is naught to choose between us in this round what next your grace  only hugh who watched him saw the big veins swell beneath the pale skin of his forehead as they ever did when he was moved  the war game said the king that is if you will for here rough knocks may be going set it out one of you  then a captain of the archers explained this sport in short it was that man should stand against man clad in leather jerkins and wearing a vizor to protect the face and shoot at each other with blunt arrows rubbed with chalk he who first took what would have been a mortal wound to be held worsted  i like not blunted arrows said grey dick or for the matter of that any other arrows save my own against how many must i play the three  the captain nodded  then by your leave i will take them all at once  now some said that this was not fair but in the end dick won his point and those archers whom he had beaten among them jack green were placed against him standing five yards apart and blunted arrows served out to all dick set one of them on the string and laid the two others in front of them then a knight rode to halfway between them but a little to one side and shouted loose  as the word struck his ear dick shot with wonderful swiftness and almost as the arrow left the bow flung himself down grasping another as he fell next instant three shafts whistled over where he had stood but his found its mark on the body of him at whom he had aimed causing the man to stagger backward and throw down his bow as he was bound to do if hit  next instant dick was up again and his second arrow flew striking full and fair before ever he at whom it was aimed had drawn  now there remained jack green alone and as dick set the third arrow but before he could draw jack green shot  beat said dick and stood quite still  at him rushed the swift shaft and passed over his shoulder within a hairbreadth of his ear then came dicks turn on jack greens cap was an archers plume  mark the plume lords he said and lo the feather leapt from that cap  now there was silence no one spoke but dick drew out three more arrows  tell me captain he said is your ground marked out in scores and what is the farthest that any one of you has sent a flighting shot  ay answered the officer and twenty score and one yard is the farthest nor has that been done for many a day  dick steadied himself and seemed to fill his lungs with air then stretching his long arms to the full he drew the great bow till the horns looked as though they came quite close together and loosed high and far flew that shaft mens eyes could scarcely follow it and all must wait long before a man came running to say where it had fallen  twenty score and two yards he cried  not much to win by grunted dick though enough i have done twenty and one score once but that was somewhat downhill  then while the silence still reigned he set the second arrow on the string and waited as though he knew not what to do presently about fifty paces from him a wood dove flew from out a tree and as such birds do at the first breath of spring for the day was mild and sunny hovered a moment in the air ere it dipped toward a great fir where doubtless it had built for years never poor fowl was it destined to build again for as it turned its beak downward dicks shaft pierced it through and through and bore it onward to the earth  still in the midst of a great silence dick took up his quiver and emptied it on the ground then gave it to the captain of the archers saying  and you will step sixty nay seventy paces and set this mouth upward in the grass where a man may see it well  the captain did so propping the quiver straight with stones and a bit of wood then having studied all things with his eyes dick shot upward but softly making a gentle curve the arrow turned in the air as it drew near the quiver and fell into its mouth striking it flat  ill done grumbled dick had i shot well it should have been pinned to earth well yon shadow baulked me and it might have been worse  then he unstrung his bow and slipped it into its case  now at length the silence was broken and in good earnest men especially those of dunwich screamed and shouted hurling up their caps jack green for all jealousy was forgotten at the sight of this wondrous skill ran to dick clasped him in his arms and dragging the badge from off his breast tried to pin it to his rough doublet the young prince came and clapped him on the shoulder saying  be my man be my man  but dick only growled paws off what have i done that i have not done a score of times before with no fine folk to watch me i shot to please my master and for the honour of suffolk not for you and because some dogs keep their tails too tightly curled  a sulky fellow said the prince but by heaven i like him  then the king pushed his horse through the throng and all fell back before his grace  richard archer he said never has such marksmanship as yours been seen in england since we sat upon the throne nor shall it go unrewarded the twenty angels that you said you would stake last night shall be paid to you by the treasurer of our household moreover here is a gift from edward of england the friend of archers that you may be pleased to wear and taking his velvet cap from off his head the king unpinned from it a golden arrow of which the barbed head was cut from a ruby and gave it to him  i thank you sire said dick his pale skin flushing with pride and pleasure ill wear it while i live and may the sight of it mean death to many of your enemies  without doubt it will and that ere long richard for know you that soon we sail again for france whence the tempest held us back and it is my pleasure that you sail with us therefore i name you one of our fletchers with place about our person in our bodyguard of archers jack green will show you your quarters and instruct you in your duties and soon you shall match your skill against his again but next time with frenchmen for your targets  sire said dick very slowly take back your arrow for i cannot do as you will  why man are you a frenchman asked the king angrily for he was not wont to have his favours thus refused  my mother never told me so sire although i dont know for certain who my father may have been still i think not since i hate the sight of that breed as a farmers dog hates rats but sire i have a good master and do not wish to change him for one who saving your presence may prove a worse since kings favour on monday has been known to mean kings halter on tuesday did you not promise to whip me round your walls last night unless i shot as well as i thought i could and now do you not change your face and give me golden arrows  at these bold words a roar of laughter went up from all who heard them in which the king himself joined heartily enough  silence he cried presently this yeomans tongue is as sharp as his shafts i am pierced let us hear whom he will hit next  you again sire i think went on dick because after the fashion of kings you are unjust you praise me for my shooting whereas you should praise god seeing that it is no merit of mine but a gift he gave me at my birth in place of much which he withheld moreover my master there and he pointed to hugh who has just done you better service than hitting a clout in the red and a dow beneath the wing you forget altogether though i tell you he can shoot almost as well as i for i taught him  dick dick broke in hugh in an agony of shame taking no heed dick went on imperturbably and is the best man with a sword in suffolk as the ghost of john clavering knows today lastly sire you send this master of mine upon a certain business where straight arrows may be wanted as well as sharp swords and yet youd keep me here whittling them out of ashwood who if i could have had my will would have been on the road these two hours gone is that a kings wisdom  by st george exclaimed edward i think that i should make you councillor as well as fletcher since without doubt man you have a bitter wit and what is more rare do not fear to speak the truth as you see it moreover in this matter you see it well go with hugh de cressi on the business which i have given him to do and when it is finished should both or either of you live neglect not our command to rejoin us here orif we have crossed the seain france edward of england needs the service of such a sword and such a bow  you shall have them both sire broke in hugh for what they are worth moreover i pray your grace be not angry with grey dicks words for if god gave him a quick eye he also gave him a rough tongue  not i hugh de cressi for know we love what is rough if it be also honest it is smooth false words of treachery that we hate such words as are ever on the lips of one whom we send you forth to bring to his account now to your duty farewell till we meet again whether it be here or where all men true or traitors must foot their bill at last    chapter vi  the snare  about noon of the day on which hugh and his company had ridden for london another company entered dunwichnamely sir john clavering and many of his folk though with him were neither sir edmund acour nor any of his french train sir johns temper had never been of the best for he was a man who whatever his prosperity found life hard and made it harder for all those about him but seldom had he been angrier than he was this day when his rage was mingled with real sorrow for the loss of his only son slain in a fight brought about by the daughter of one of them and the sister of the other and urged for honours sake by himself the father of them both  moreover the marriage on which he had set his heart between eve and the glittering french lord whose future seemed so great had been brought to naught and this turbulent hothearted eve had fled into sanctuary her lover too the youngest son of a merchant had ridden away to london doubtless upon some mission which boded no good to him or his leaving a blood feud behind him between the wealthy de cressis and all the clavering kin  there was but one drop of comfort in his cup by now as he hoped hugh and his deathshead grey dick a spawn of satan that all the country feared and who men said was a de cressi bastard by a witch were surely slain or taken by those who followed upon their heels  sir john rode to the preceptory and hammered fiercely on its oaken door presently it was opened by sir andrew arnold himself who stood in the entrance grey and grim a long sword girt about his loins and armour gleaming beneath his monkish robe  what would you sir john clavering that you knock at this holy house thus rudely he asked  my daughter priest who they say has sheltered here  they say well knight she has sheltered here beneath the wings of st mary and st john begone and leave her in peace  i make no more of such wings than if they were those of farmyard geese roared the furious man bring her or i will pluck her forth  do so replied sir andrew if you live to pass this consecrated sword and he laid his hand upon its hilt take with her also the curse of the mother of god and his beloved apostle and that of the whole church of christ by me declared upon your head in this world and upon your soul in the world to come man this is sanctuary and if you dare to set foot within it in violence may your body perish and your soul scorch everlastingly in the fires of hell and you he added raising his voice till it rang like a trumpet addressing the followers of sir john on you also let the curse of excommunication fall now slay me and enter if you will but then every drop of blood in these veins shall find a separate tongue and cry out for vengeance on you before the judgment seat of god where presently i summon you to meet me  then he crossed himself drew the great sword and holding it in his left hand stretched out his right toward them in malediction  the clavering men heard and saw they looked at each other and as though by common consent turned and rode away crossing themselves also in truth they had no stomach for the curse of the church when it was thundered forth from the lips of such a monk as sir andrew arnold who they knew well had been one of the greatest and holiest warriors of his generation and so said rumour was a white wizard to boot with all the magic of the east at his command  your men have gone sir john said the old priest will you follow them or will you enter  now fear drove out the knights rage and he spoke in another voice  sir andrew why do you bring all these wrongs upon me my boy is dead at the hand of hugh de cressi your godson and he has robbed me of my daughter whom i have affianced to a better and a nobler man now you give her sanctuary and threaten me with the curse of the church because i would claim her my own flesh and blood ay and my heiress too today tell me as one man to another why do you do these things  and tell me sir john clavering why for the sake of pelf and of honours that you will never harvest do you seek to part those who love each other and whom god has willed to bring together why would you sell your child to a gilded knave whom she hates nay stop me not id call him that and more to his face and none have ever known me lie why did you suffer this frenchman or your dead son or both of them to try to burn out hugh de cressi and red eve as though they were rats in rubbish  would you know father then ill tell you because i wish to see my daughter set high among lords and princes and not the wife of a merchants lad who by law may wear cloth only and rabbit fur because also i hate him and all his kin and if this is true of yesterday how much more true is it now that he has killed my son and by the arrows of that wolfman who dogs his heels slain my guests and my grieve think not ill rest till i have vengeance of him and all his cursed house ill appeal to the king and if he will not give me justice ill take it for myself ay though you are old i tell you you shall live to see the de cressi vault crowded with the de cressi dead  sir andrew hid his eyes for a moment with his hand then let it fall and spoke in a changed voice  it comes upon me that you speak truth sir john for since i met a certain great master in the east at times i have a gift of foresight i think that much sorrow draws near this land ay and others i think that many vaults and many churchyards too will ere long be filled with dead also that the tomb of the claverings at blythburgh will soon be opened mayhap the end of this world draws near to all men as surely it draws near to you and me i know notyet truth was in your lips just now and in mine as well i think oh man man he went on after a pause appeal not unto the worlds cæsar lest cæsar render different judgment to that which you desire get you home and on your knees appeal unto god to forgive you your proud vengeanceseeking heart sickness draws near to you death draws near to you and after death hellor heaven i have finished  as he heard these words sir johns swarthy face grew pale and for a little while his rage died down then it flared up again  dont dream to frighten me with your spells old wizard he said im a hale man yet though i do lose my breath at times when my mind is vexed with wrongs and ill square my own account with god without your help or counsel so youll not give me my daughter  nay here she bides in sanctuary for so long as it shall please her  does she in truth perhaps you married her to this merchant fellow ere he rode this morning  nay sir john they betrothed themselves before the altar and in presence of his kin no more moreover if you would know because of your sons blood which runs between them i after thought and prayer speaking in the name of the church swore them to this penancethat for a year from yesterday they should not wed nor play the part of lovers  i thank you priest for this small grace answered sir john with a bitter laugh and in my turn i swear this that after the year they shall not wed since the one of them will be clay and the other the wife of the man whom i have chosen now play no tricks on me lest i burn this sanctuary of yours about your head and throw your old carcass to roast among the flames  sir andrew made no reply only resting his long sword on the threshold he leant upon its hilt and fixed his clear grey eyes upon claverings face what sir john saw in those eyes he never told but it was something which scared him at least that shortening of the breath of which he had spoken seemed to take a hold of him for he swayed upon his horse as though he were about to fall then recovering turned and rode straight for blythburgh    it was the second night after that day when sir andrew had looked john clavering in the eyes  secretly and in darkness those three whom grey dick had killed were borne into the nave of blythburgh church and there laid in the grave which had been made ready for them till now their corpses had been kept above ground in the hope that the body of john clavering the younger might be added to their number but search as they would upon seashore and riverbank nothing of him was ever seen again this funeral was celebrated in the darkness since neither sir john nor acour desired that all men should see three bodies that had been slain by one archer aided by a merchants lad standing alone against a score and know to say naught of the wounded that there was yet another to be added to the tale therefore they interred them by night with no notice of the ceremony  it was a melancholy scene the nave of the great church lighted only with the torches borne by the six monks of the black augustines from the neighbouring priory of st osyth the candles little stars of light burning far away upon the altar the bearers of the household of the claverings and the uncoffined corpses lying on their biers by the edge of the yawning graves the mourners in their mail the low voice of the celebrating priest a frenchman father nicholas chaplain to acour who hurried through the latin service as though he wished to be done with it the deep shadows of the groined roof whereon the rain patteredsuch were the features of this interment it was done at last and the poor dead but a few days before so full of vigour and of passion were left to their last sleep in the unremembered grave then the mourners marched back to the manor across the middle marsh and sought their beds in a sad silence  shortly after daybreak they were called from them again by the news that those who had followed hugh de cressi had returned quickly they rose thinking that these came back with tidings of accomplished vengeance to find themselves face to face with seven starved and miserable men who all their horses being dead had walked hither from dunwich  the wretched story was learned at length and then followed that violent scene which has been told already when acour cursed his followers as cowards and clavering sobered perhaps by the sadness of the midnight burial or by the memory of arnolds words reproved him lastly stung by the taunts that were heaped upon them sir pierre de la roche gave hughs messagethat if they lifted hand against his love or his house he would kill them like ravening wolves which i think he certainly will do for none can conquer him and his henchman he added shortly  then sir johns rage flared up again like fire when fresh fuel is thrown on ashes he cursed hugh and grey dick he cursed his daughter he even cursed acour and asked for the second time how it came about that he who had brought all this trouble on him was given the evil name of traitor  i know not answered sir edmund fiercely and laying his hand upon his sword but this i know that you or any man will do well not to repeat it if you value life  do you threaten me asked sir john because if so you will do well to begone out of this house of shame and woe lest you be borne out feet first nay nay i forgot he added slowly clasping his head in his hands you are my daughters affianced are you not and will give her high place and many famous titles and her son shall be called clavering that the old name may not die but be great in england in france and in italy you must bide to marry her lest that cuckoo hugh de cressi that cuckoo with the sharp bill should creep into my nest ill not be worsted by a stripling clad in merchants cloth who slew my only son take not my words ill noble noyon for i am overdone with grief for the past and fear for the future you must bide to marry her by fair means or by foul draw her from the sanctuary and marry her whether she say you yea or nay you have my leave noble noyon and so speaking he swayed and fell prone upon the floor  at first they thought that he was dead but the chaplain nicholas who was a leech bled him and he came to himself again although he still wandered in his talk and lay abed  then acour and nicholas took counsel together  what is to be done said sir edmund for i am on fire for this maid and all her scorn and hate do but fan my flame moreover she is now very rich for that old hothead cannot live long his violent humours will kill him and as you know father although i have great possessions my costs are large and i have still greater debts lastly shall de noyon and his knights be worsted by a woolmerchants younger son a mere prentice lad and his henchman a common archer of the fens show me how to get her nicholas and ill make an abbot of you yet this sanctuary now will it hold if we stormed the place and took her would the holy father give us absolution do you think  no my lord answered the foxfaced nicholas the church is great because the church is one and what the priest does the pope upholds especially when that priest is no mean man this holy monk sir andrew arnold has reputation throughout europe and though he seems so humble because of his wisdom is in the counsel of many great men whose fathers or grandfathers were guided by him long ago commit what crime you will dip yourself to the lips in blood and you may find forgiveness but touch not an ancient and acknowledged sanctuary of the church since for this offence there will be none  what then nicholas must i give up the chase and fly to speak truth things seem to threaten me why has that hugh twice called me traitor have any of my letters fallen into strange hands think you i have written several and you know my mission here  it is possible lord all things are possible but i think not i think that he only draws the bow at a hazard which is more than grey dick does he added with a chuckle these brute english hate us french whom they know to be their masters in all that makes a man and traitor to their fool king is the least of the words they throw at us  well priest my mother was english as my wife will be therefore stay your tongue on that matter and tell me how i am to make her my wife answered acour haughtily  the chaplain cringed and bowed rubbing his thin hands together  i thought you wished to speak of the english my lord otherwise i should not have venturedbut as to the lady eve something comes to me why does she stay in sanctuary who herself has committed no crime is it not such is her madness because she would be out of reach of you and your endearments now if she believed you gone far enough away let us say to france and knew that her father lay ill why then and he paused  you mean that she might come out of sanctuary of her own accord  yes lord and we might set a springe to catch this bird so rare and shy and though shed flutter flutter flutter and peck peck peck what could she do when you smoothed her plumage with your loving hand and a priest was waiting to say the word that should cause her to forget her doubts and that merchant bumpkin  ah nicholas you have a good wit and if all goes well you shall certainly be an abbot but would her father do you think  lord that beefeating knight is in such a rage that he would do anything what did he say just before the stroke took him that you were to marry her by fair means or by foul yes and he told me an hour ago that if only he knew she was your wife he would die happy oh you have his warrant for anything you do to bring about this end still there is no need to tell him too much lest it should cause his good name to be aspersed by the vulgar many it seems love this red eve for her high spirit and are friends to the de cressis an openhanded race who know how to bind folk to them listen how it must be done    that day it was given out that sir edmund acour those of his knights who remained alive and all his following were about to leave for london and lay their cause before the king having learned that hugh de cressi had gone thither to prejudice his grace on his own behalf it was added moreover that they would not return to suffolk but proposed when they had found justice or the promise of it to take ship at dover for france next morning accordingly they rode away from blythburgh manor and passed through dunwich with much pomp where the citizens of that town who were friends of the de cressis stared at them with no kind eyes indeed one of these as they crossed the marketplace called to them to be careful not to meet hugh de cressi and grey dick upon their journey lest there should be more midnight burials and menatarms turned into footsoldiers whereat all about him laughed rudely  but acour did not laugh he ground his teeth and said into the ear of nicholas  register this vow for me priest that in payment for that jest ill sack and burn dunwich when our army comes and give its men and children to the sword and its women to the soldiers  it shall be done lord answered the chaplain and should your heart soften at the appointed time ill put you in memory of this solemn oath  at the great house of the mayor of dunwich sir edmund drew rein and demanded to see him presently this mayor a timid uncertainlooking man came in his robes of office and asked anxiously what might be the cause of this message and why an armed band halted at his gate  for no ill purpose sir answered acour though little of justice have i found at your hands who therefore must seek it at the court of my liege lord king edward all i ask of you is that you will cause this letter to be delivered safely to the lady eve clavering who lies in sanctuary at the preceptory of st mary and st john it is one of farewell since it seems that this lady who by her own will and her fathers was my affianced wishes to break troth and i am not a man who needs an unwilling bride id deliver it myself only that old knave half priest and half knight but neither good  youd best speak no ill of sir andrew arnold here said a voice in the crowd  only the master of the preceptory went on acour changing his tone somewhat might take fright and think i wished to violate his sanctuary if i came there with thirty spears at my back  and no fool either said the voice seeing that they are french spears and his is an english sanctuary  therefore continued acour i pray you deliver the letter perchance when we meet again master mayor he added with a venomous glance of his dark eyes you will have some boon to ask of me and be sure ill grant itif i can  then without waiting for an answer for the mob of sturdy fishermen many of whom had served in the french wars looked threatening he and his following rode away through the ipswich gate and out on to the moorlands beyond which some of them knew but too well  all the rest of that day they rode slowly but when night came having halted their horses at a farm and given it out that they meant to push on to woodbridge they turned up a bytrack on the lonely heath and unseen by any made their through the darkness to a certain empty house in the marshes not far from beccles town this house called frog hall was part of acours estate and because of the ague prevalent there in autumn had been long unattended nor did any visit it at this season of the year when no cattle grazed upon these salt marshes  here then he and his people lay hid cursing their fortunes since notwithstanding the provisions that they had conveyed thither in secret the place was icy cold in the bitter easterly winds which tore over it from the sea so lonely was it also that the frenchmen swore that their comrades slain by grey dick haunted them at nights bidding them prepare to join the number of the dead indeed had not acour vowed that he would hang the first man who attempted to desert some of them would have left him to make the best of their way back to france for always as they crouched by the smoking hearth they dreamed of grey dick and his terrible arrows  sir edmund acours letter came safely into the hands of eve brought to her by the mayor himself it read thus  lady  you will no more of me so however much you should live to ask it i will have no more of you i go hang your merchant lout and afterward away to france who wish to have done with your cold suffolk where you may buy my lands cheap if you will yet should master hugh de cressi chance to escape me i counsel you to marry him for i can wish you no worse fate seeing what you will be than to remember what you might have been meanwhile it is my duty as a christian to tell you in case you should desire to speak to him ere it be too late that your father lies at the point of death from a sickness brought on by his grief at the slaying of his son and your cruel desertion of him and calls for you in his ravings may god forgive you as i try to do all the evil that you have wrought which perhaps is not done with yet unless fate should bring us together again for as aught i know it may i bid you farewell forever would that i had never seen your face but well are you named red eve who like the false helen in a story you have never heard were born to bring brave men to their deaths again farewell  de noyon  who is this helen asked eve of sir andrew when the letter had been read  a fair grecian daughter over whom nations fought when the world was young because of her beauty  ah well she did not make herself beautiful did she and perchance was more sinned against than sinning since women having but one life to live must follow their own hearts but this helen has been dead a long while so let her rest if rest she may and now it seems that acour is away and that my father lies very sick what shall i do return to him  first i will make sure that the frenchman has gone and then we will see daughter  so sir andrew sent out messengers who reported it to be true that acour had ridden straight to london to see the king and then sail for dover also they said that no frenchmen were left at blythburgh save those who would never leave the place again and that sir john clavering lay sick in his bed at the manor  god fights for us said sir andrew with a little laugh this acours greeting at court may be warmer than he thinks and at the least you and dunwich are well rid of him though i had sooner that you stayed here tomorrow daughter you shall ride to blythburgh should your father die as i think he will ere long it might grieve you in the after years to remember that you had bid him no farewell if he recovers or is harsh with you it will be easy for you to seek sanctuary again    chapter vii  the love philtre  so it came about that on the morrow eve and sir andrew accompanied only by a single serving man fearing no guile since it seemed certain that the frenchmen were so far away rode across the moor to blythburgh at the manorhouse they found the drawbridge up the watchman at the gate said also that his orders were to admit none for the frenchmen being gone there were but few to guard the place  what good fellow asked eve not even the daughter of the house who has heard that her father lies so sick  ay he lies sick lady the man replied but such are his orders yet if you will bide here a while ill go and learn his mind  so he went and returned presently saying that sir john commanded that his daughter was to be admitted but that if sir andrew attempted to enter he should be driven back by force  will you go in or will you return with me asked her companion of eve  gods truth she answered am i one to run away from my father however bad his humour ill go in and set my case before him for after all he loves me in his own fashion and when he understands will i think relent  your heart is your best guide daughter and it would be an ill task for me to stand between sire and child enter then for i am sure that the saints and your own innocence will protect you from all harm at the worst you can come or send to me for help  so they parted and the bridge having been lowered eve walked boldly to her fathers sleeping chamber where she was told he lay as she approached the door she met several of the household leaving it with scared faces who scarcely stayed to salute her among these were two servants of her dead brother john men whom she had never liked and a woman the wife of one of them whom she liked least of all  pushing open the door which was shut behind her she advanced toward sir john who was not as she had thought in bed but clad in a furred robe and standing by the hearth on which burnt a fire he watched her come but said no word and the look of him frightened her somewhat  father she said i heard that you were sick and alone  ay he broke in sick very sick here and he laid his hand upon his heart where grief strikes a man alone too since you and your fellow have done my only son to death murdered my guests and caused them to depart from so bloody a house  now eve who had come expecting to find her father at the point of death and was prepared to plead with him at these violent words took fire as was her nature  you know well that you speak what is not true she said you and your frenchmen strove to burn us out of middle marsh my brother john struck hugh de cressi as though he were a dog and used words toward him that no knave would bear let alone one better born than we are moreover afterward once he spared his life and grey dick standing alone against a crowd did but use his skill to save us is it murder then to protect our honour and to save ourselves from death and am i wrong to refuse to marry a fine french knave when i chance to love an honest man  and pray am i your father girl that you dare to scold at me thus shouted sir john growing purple with wrath if i choose a husband for you by what right do you refuse him saying that you love a dunwich shopboy down on your knees and beg my pardon or you shall have the whipping you have earned  now eves black eyes glittered dangerously  ill would it go with any man who dared to lay a hand upon me she said drawing herself up and grasping the dagger in her girdle yes very ill even though he were my own father look at me and say am i one to threaten ay and before you answer bear in mind that there are those at my call who can strike hard and that among them i think youll find the king of england  she paused  what hellish plot is this that you hatch against me asked sir john with some note of doubt in his voice what have i to fear from my liege lord the king of england  only sir that you consort with and would wed me to one who although you may not know it has i am told much to fear from him so much that i wonder that he has ridden to seek his graces presence well you are ill and i am angered and together we are but as steel and flint from the meeting of which comes fire that may burn us both therefore since being better than i thought you need me not and have only cruel words for greeting ill bid you farewell and get me back to those who are kindlier god be with you and give you your health again  ah said or rather snarled sir john i thought as much and am ready for the trick youd win back to sanctuary would you and the company of that old wizard andrew arnold thence to make a mock of me well not one step do you take upon that road while i live and pushing past her he opened the door and shouted aloud  apparently the men and woman whom eve had met in the passage were still waiting there for instantly they all reappeared  now fellows said sir john and you jane mell take this rebellious girl of mine to the chamber in the prisoners tower whence i think shell find it hard to fly to sanctuary there lock her fast feeding her with the bread and water of affliction to tame her proud spirit and suffering none to go near her save this woman jane mell stay give me that bodkin which she wears lest she who has learned bloody ways of late should do some of you or herself a mischief  as he spoke one of the men deftly snatched the dagger from eves girdle and handed it to sir john who threw it into the farthest corner of the room then he turned and said  now girl will you go or must you be dragged  she raised her head slowly and looked him in the eyes mad as he was with passion there was something in her face that frightened him  can you be my father she said in a strained quiet voice oh glad am i that my mother did not live to see this hour  then she wheeled round and addressed the men  hearken fellows he who lays a finger on me dies soon or late assuredly he dies as he would not wish to die yes even if you murder me for i have friends who will learn the truth and pay back coin for coin with interest a hundredfold now ill go stand clear knaves and pray to god that never again may red eve cross the threshold of her prison pray also that never again may you look on hugh de cressis sword or hear grey dicks arrows sing or face the curse of old sir andrew  so proud and commanding was her mien and so terrible the import of her words that these rough hinds shrank away from her and the woman hid her face in her hands but sir john thundered threats and oaths at them so that slowly and unwillingly they ringed eve round then with head held high she walked thence in the midst of them  the prisoners chamber beneath the leads of the lofty tower was cold and unfurnished save for a stool and a trucklebed it had a great door of oak locked and barred on the outer side with a grille in it through which the poor wretch within could be observed there was no window only high up beneath the ceiling were slits like loopholes that not a child could have passed such was the place to which eve was led  here they left her at nightfall the door was opened and jane mell entered bearing a loaf of bread and a jug of water which she set down upon the floor  would you aught else she asked  ay woman answered eve my thick red woollen cloak from my chamber and hood to match also water to wash me for this place is cold and foul and i would die warm and clean  first i must get leave from my lord your father said the woman in a surly voice  get it then and be swift said eve or leave it ungotten i care little  mell went and within half an hour returned with the garments the water and some other things setting them down without a word she departed locking and bolting the door behind her  while there remained a few rays of light to see by eve ate and drank heartily for she needed food then having prayed according to her custom she laid herself down and slept as a child sleeps for she was very strong of will and one who had always taught herself to make the best of evil fortune when she woke the daws were cawing around the tower and the sun shone through the loopholes she rose refreshed and ate the remainder of her bread then combed her hair and dressed herself as best she could  two or three hours later the door was opened and her father entered glancing at him she saw that little sleep had visited him that night for he looked old and very weary so weary that she motioned to him to sit upon the stool this he did breathing heavily and muttering something about the steepness of the tower stairs presently he spoke  eve he said is your proud spirit broken yet  no she answered nor ever will be living or dead you may kill my body but my spirit is me and that you will never kill as god gave it so i will return it to him again  he stared at her with something of wonder and more of admiration in his look  christs truth he said how proud i could be of you if only youd let me i deem your courage comes from your mother but she never had your shape and beauty and now you are the only one left and you hate me with all your proud heart you the heiress of the claverings  whose estate is this she answered pointing to the bare stone walls think you my father that such treatment as i have met with at your hands of late would breed love in the humblest heart what devil drives you on to deal with me as you have done  no devil girl but a desire for your own good and he added with a burst of truth for the greatness of my house after i am gone which will be soon for your old wizard spoke rightly when he said that i stand near to death  will marrying me to a man i hate be for my good and make your house great i tell you sir it would kill me and bring the claverings to an end do you desire also that your broad lands should go to patch a spendthrift frenchmans cloak but what matters your desire seeing that ill not do it who love another man worth a score of him one too who will sit higher than any count of noyon ever stood  pish he said tis but a girls whim you speak folly being young and headstrong now to have done with all this mummers talk will you swear to me by our saviour and on the welfare of your soul to break with hugh de cressi once and forever for if so ill let you free to leave me if you will and dwell where it pleases you  she opened her lips to answer but he held up his hand saying  wait ere you speak i have not done if you take my offer ill not even press sir edmund acour on you that matter shall stand the chance of time and tide only while you live you must have no more to do with the man who slew your brother now will you swear  not i she answered how can i who but a few days ago before gods altar and his priest vowed myself to this same hugh de cressi for all his life  sir john rose from the stool and walked or rather tottered to the door  then stay here till you rot he said quite quietly for ill give you no burial as for this hugh i would have spared him but you have signed his deathwarrant  he was gone the heavy door shut the bars clanged into their sockets thus these two parted for when they met once more no word passed between them and although she knew not how these things would end eve felt that parting to be dreadful turning her face to the wall for a while she wept then when the woman mell came with her bread and water wiped away her tears and faced her calmly after all she could have answered no otherwise her soul was pure of sin and for the rest god must rule it at least she would die clean and honest  that night she was wakened from her sleep by the clatter of horses hoofs on the courtyard stones she could hear no more because a wind blew that drowned all sound of voices for a while a wild hope had filled her that hugh had come or perchance sir andrew with the dunwich folk but presently she remembered that this was foolish since these would never have been admitted within the moat so sighing sadly she turned to rest again thinking to herself that doubtless her father had called in some of his vassal tenants from the outlying lands to guard the manor in case it should be attacked  next morning the woman jane mell brought her better garments to wear of her best indeed and though she wondered why they were sent for the lack of anything else to do she arrayed herself in them and braided her hair with the help of a silver mirror that was among the garments a little later this woman appeared again bearing not bread and water but good food and a cup of wine the food she ate with thankfulness but the wine she would not drink because she knew that it was french and had heard acour praise it  the morning wore away to noon and again the door opened and there stood before hersir edmund acour himself gallantly dressed as she noticed vaguely in closefitting tunic of velvet long shoes that turned up at the toes and a cap in which was set a single nodding plume she rose from her stool and set her back against the wall with a prayer to god in her heart but no word upon her lips for she felt that her best refuge was silence he drew the cap from his head and began to speak  lady he said you will wonder to see me here after my letter to you bidding you farewell but you will remember that in this letter i wrote that fate might bring us together again and it has done so through no fault or wish of mine the truth is that when i was near to london i heard that danger awaited me there on account of certain false accusations such danger that i must return again to suffolk and seek a ship at some eastern port well i came here last night and learned that you were back out of sanctuary and also that you had quarrelled with your father who in his anger had imprisoned you in this poor place an ill deed as i think but in truth he is so distraught with grief and racked with sickness that he scarce knows what he does  now he paused but as eve made no answer went on  pity for your lot yes and my love for you that eats my heart out caused me to seek your fathers leave to visit you and see if perchance i could not soften your wrath against me  again he paused and again there was no answer  moreover he added i have news for you which i fear you will think sad and which believe me i pray you it pains me to give though the man was my rival and my enemy hugh de cressi to whom you held yourself affianced is dead  she quivered a little at the words but still made no answer for her will was very strong  i had the story he continued from two of his own men whom we met flying back to dunwich from london it seems that messengers from your father reached the court of the king before this hugh telling him of the slaying in blythburgh marsh then came hugh himself whereon the king seized him and his henchman the archer and at once put them on their trial as the murderers of john clavering of my knights and thomas of kessland which they admitted boldly thereon his grace who was beside himself with rage said that in a time of war when every man was needed to fight the french he was determined by a signal example to put a stop to the shedding of blood in these private feuds so he ordered the merchant to the block and his henchman the archer to the gallows giving them but one hour to make their peace with god moreover he went on searching her cold impassive face with his eyes i did not escape his wrath for he gave command that i was to be seized wherever i might be found and cast into prison till i could be put upon my trial and my knights with me of your fathers case he is considering since his only son has been slain and he holds him in regard therefore it is that i am obliged to avoid london and take refuge here  still eve remained silent and in his heart acour cursed her stubbornness  lady he proceeded though with somewhat less assurancefor now he must leave lies and get to pleading and never did a suit seem more hopeless these things being so through no fault of mine whose hands are innocent of any share in this young mans end i come to pray of you the sword of death having cut all your oaths that you will have pity on my love and take me as your husband as is your fathers wish and my hearts desire let not your young life be swallowed up in grief but make it joyous in my company i can give you greatness i can give you wealth but most of all i can give you such tender adoration as never woman had before oh sweet eve your answer and he cast himself upon the ground before her and snatching the hem of her robe pressed it to his lips  then at length eve spoke in a voice that rang like steel  get you gone knave whose spurs should be hacked from your heels by scullions get you gone traitor and liar for well i know that hugh de cressi is not dead who had a certain tale to tell of you to the king of england get you back to the duke of normandy and there ask the price of your betrayal of your liege lord edward and show him the plans of our eastern coast and the shores where his army may land in safety  acour sprang to his feet and his face went white as ashes thrice he strove to speak but could not then with a curse he turned and left the chamber    the hunts up said father nicholas when he had heard all this tale a little later and now lord i think that you had better away to france unless you desire to stop without companions in the church yonder  ay priest ill away but by gods blood ill take that red eve with me for one thing she knows too much to leave her behind for a second i mean to pay her back and for a third although you may think it strange im mad for her i tell you she looked wondrous standing with her back against that wall her marble face never wincing when i told her all the lie about young de cressis deathwhich will be holy truth when i get a chance at himwatching me out of those great dark eyes of hers  doubtless lord but how did she look when she called you knave and traitor i think you said those were her wicked words oh he added with a ring of earnestness in his smooth voice let this red eve be at bed or board shes no mate for you something fights at her side be it angel or devil or just raw chance at the least shell prove your ruin unless you let her be  then ill be ruined nicholas for ill not leave her for a while at any rate what de noyon whom they call danger of dames beaten by a country girl who has never seen london or paris id sooner die  as well may chance if the country lad and the country archer come back with edwards warrant in their pouch answered the priest shrugging his lean shoulders well lord what is your plan  to carry her off cant we manage nine stone of womanhood between us  if she were dead it might be done though hardlyover these suffolk roads but being very much alive with a voice to scream with hands to fight with a brain to think with and friends who know her from here to yarmouth or to hull and monsieur grey dicks arrows pricking us behind perchancewell i dont know  friend said acour tapping him on the shoulder meaningly there must be some way there are always ways and i pray you to hunt them out come find me one or stay here alone to explain affairs first to this dick whom you have so much upon the brain and afterward to edward of england or his officers  father nicholas looked at the great counts face then he looked at the ground and having studied it a while without result turned his beady eyes to the heavens where it would seem that he found inspiration  i am a stranger to love thank the saints he said but as you know lord i am a master leech and amongst other things have studied certain medicines which breed that passion in the human animal  love philtres queried acour doubtfully  yes that kind of thing one dose and those who hate become enamoured and those who are enamoured hate  then in gods or satans name give her one only be careful it is the right sort for if you made a mistake so that she hated me any more than she does at present i know not what would happen also if you kill her ill dig a sword point through you how would the stuff work  shell seem somewhat stupid for a while perhaps not speak but only smile kindly that will last twelve hours or so plenty of time for you to be married and afterward when the grosser part of the potion passes off leaving only its divine essence why afterward shell love you furiously  a powerful medicine truly that can change the nature of woman moreover id rather that she loved mewell as happy brides do still i put up with the fury provided it be of the good kind and now how is it to be done  leave that to me lord said nicholas with a cunning smile give me a purse of gold not less than ten pieces for some is needed to melt in the mixture and more to bribe that woman and others for the rest hold yourself ready to become a husband before sunset tomorrow go see sir john and tell him that the lady softens send men on to kings lynn also to bid them have our ship prepared to sail the minute we appear which with good fortune should be within fortyeight hours from now above all forget not that i run great risk to soul and body for your sake and that there are abbeys vacant in normandy now farewell i must to my work for this medicine takes much skill such as no other leech has save myself ay and much prayer also that naught may hinder its powerful working  prayer to the devil i think said his master looking after him with a shrug of his shoulders gods truth if any one had told me three months gone that de noyon would live to seek the aid of priests and potions to win a womans favour id have named him liar to his face what would those who have gone before her think of this story i wonder  then with a bitter laugh he turned and went about his business which was to lie to the father as he had lied to the daughter only in this second case he found one more willing to listen and easier to deceive    on the following morning as it chanced eve had no relish for the food that was brought to her for confinement in that narrow place had robbed her of her appetite also she had suffered much from grievous fear and doubt for whatever she might say to acour how could she be sure that his story was not true how could she be sure that her lover did not in fact now lie dead at the headsmans hands such things often happened when kings were wroth and would not listen or perhaps acour himself had found and murdered him or hired others to do the deed she did not know and imprisoned here without a friend what means had she of coming at the truth oh if only she could escape if only she could speak with sir andrew for one brief minute she poor fool who had walked into this trap of her own will  she sent away the food and bade the woman mell bring her milk for that would be easy to swallow and give her sustenance after some hours it came mell explaining that she had been obliged to send for it to the farmsteading as none drank milk in the manorhouse being thirsty eve took the pitcher and drained it to the last drop then threw it down saying that the vessel was foul and made the milk taste ill  the woman did not answer only smiled a little as she left the chamber and eve wondered why she smiled  a while later she grew very sleepy and as it seemed to her had strange dreams in her sleep she dreamed of her childhood when she and hugh played together upon the dunwich shore she dreamed of her mother and thought dimly that she was warning her of something she heard voices about her and thought that they were calling her to be free yes and followed them readily enough or so it seemed in her dream followed them out of that hateful prison for the bolts clanged behind her down stairs and into the courtyard where the suns light almost blinded her and the fresh air struck her hot brow like ice then there were more voices and people moving to and fro and the drone of a priest praying and a touch upon her hand from which she shrank and oh she wished that dream were done for it was long long it wearied her and grasped her heart with a cold clutch of fear    chapter viii  too late  it was past three oclock on this same day when eve had drunk the milk and some hours after she began to dream that hugh de cressi and his men safe and sound but weary halted their tired horses at the door of the preceptory of the templars in dunwich  best go on to his worship the mayor and serve the kings writ upon him master grumbled grey dick as they rode up middlegate street you wasted good time in a shooting bout at windsor against my will and now youll waste more time in a talking match at dunwich and the sun grows low and the frenchmen may have heard and be on the wing and who can see to lay a shaft at night  nay man answered hugh testily first i must know how she fares  the lady eve will fare neither better nor worse for your knowing about her but one with whom you should talk may fare further for doubtless his spies are out but have your way and leave me to thank god that no woman ever found a chance to clog my leg perhaps because i was not born an ass  it is doubtful if hugh heard these pungent and practical remarks for ere dick had finished speaking them he was off his horse and hammering at the preceptory door some while passed before any answer came for sir andrew was walking in the garden beyond the church in no happy mind because of certain rumours that had reached him and the old nun agnes spying armed men and not knowing who they were was afraid to open so it came about that fifteen minutes or more went by before at length hugh and his godsire stood face to face  how is eve and where why is she not with you father he burst out  one question at a time son for whose safe return i thank god i know not how she is and she is not with me because she is not here she has returned to her father at blythburgh  why gasped hugh you swore to keep her safe  peace and you shall learn and as shortly as he could he told him  is that all asked hugh doubtfully for he saw trouble in sir andrews face  not quite son only today i have learned that acour and his folk never went to london and are back again at blythburgh manor  so much the better father for now i have the kings warrant addressed to the mayor and all his graces subject in dunwich to take these frenchmen living or dead  ah but i have learned also that her father holds eve a prisoner suffering her to speak with none andone lamb among those wolvesoh god why didst thou suffer my wisdom to fail me doubtless for some good purposewhere is my faith yet we must act hie you there he called to one of the menatarms go to master de cressis house and bid him meet us by the marketcross mounted and armed with all his sons and people and you get out my horse mother agnes bring my armour since i have no other squire well go to the mayor now while i don my harness tell me all thats passed wasting no words  another halfhour almost had gone by before hugh met his father two of his brothers and some men riding into the marketplace they greeted in haste but thankfulness and something of the tale was told while they passed on to the house of the mayor who as they thought had already been warned of their coming by messengers but here disappointment awaited them for this officer a man of wealth and honour was as it chanced absent on a visit to norwich whence it was said that he would not return for three full days  now what shall we do asked sir andrew his face falling it is certain that the burgesses of dunwich will not draw sword in an unknown quarrel except upon the direct order of their chief for there is no time to collect them and publish the kings warrant it would seem that we must wait till tomorrow and prepare tonight  not i answered hugh the warrant is to me as well as to the mayor ill leave it with his clerk which is good delivery and away to blythburgh manor on the instant with any who will follow me or without them come dick for night draws on and weve lost much time  now his father tried to dissuade him but he would not listen for the fear in his heart urged him forward so the end of it was that the whole party of themthirteen men in all counting those that master de cressi brought rode away across the heath to blythburgh though the horses of hughs party being very weary not so fast as he could have wished  just as the sun sank they mounted the slope of the farther hill on the crest of which stood the manorhouse backed by winds  the drawbridge is down thanks be to god said sir andrew which shows that no attack is feared i doubt me son we shall find acour flown  that we shall know presently answered hugh  now dismount all and follow me  they obeyed though some of them who knew old sir johns temper seemed not to like the business leaving two of their people with the horses they crossed the bridge thinking to themselves that the great house seemed strangely silent and deserted now they were in the outer court on one side of which stood the chapel and still there was no one to be seen dick tapped hugh upon the shoulder pointing to a window of this chapel that lay in the shadow through which came a faint glimmering of light as though tapers burned upon the altar  i think theres a burying yonder he whispered at which all men gather  hugh blanched for might it not be eve whom they buried but sir andrew noting it said  nay nay sir john was sick come let us look  the door of the chapel was open and they walked through it as quietly as they could to find the place which was not very large filled with people of these they took no heed for the last rays of the sunlight flowing through the western window showed them a scene that held their eyes  a priest stood before the lighted altar holding his hands in benediction over a pair who kneeled at its rail one of these wore a red cloak down which her dark hair streamed she leaned heavily against the rail as a person might who is faint with sleep or with the ardour of her orisons it was red eve no other  at her side clad in gleaming mail kneeled a knight close by eve stood her father looking at her with a troubled air and behind the knight were other knights and menatarms in the little nave were all the people of the manor and with them those that dwelt around every one of them intently watching the pair before the altar  the priest perceived them at first just as the last word of the blessing passed his lips  why do armed strangers disturb gods house he asked in a warning voice  the knight at the altar rails sprang up and turned round hugh saw that it was acour but even then he noted that the woman at his side she who wore eves garment never stirred from her knees  sir john clavering glared down the chapel and all the other people turned to look at them now hugh and his company halted in the open space where the nave joined the chancel and said answering the priest  i come hither with my companions bearing the warrant of the king to seize edmund acour count de noyon and convey him to london there to stand his trial on a charge of high treason toward his liege lord edward of england yield you sir edmund acour  at these bold words the french knights and squires drew their swords and ringed themselves round their captain whereon hugh and his party also drew their swords  stay cried old sir andrew in his ringing voice let no blood be shed in the holy house of god you men of suffolk know that you harbour a foul traitor in your bosoms one who plots to deliver you to the french lift no hand on his behalf lest on you also should fall the vengeance of the king who has issued his commands to all his officers and people to seize acour living or dead  now a silence fell upon the place for none liked this talk of the kings warrant and in the midst of it hugh asked  do you yield sir edmund acour or must we and the burgesses of dunwich who gather without seize you and your people  acour turned and began to talk rapidly with the priest nicholas while the congregation stared at each other then sir john clavering who all this while had been listening like a man in a dream suddenly stepped forward  hugh de cressi he said tell me does the kings writ run against john clavering  nay answered hugh i told his grace that you were an honest man deceived by a knave  then what do you slayer of my son in my house know that i have just married my daughter to this knight whom you name traitor and that i here defend him to the last who is now my kin begone and seek elsewhere or stay and die  how have you married her asked hugh in a hollow voice not of her own will surely rise eve and tell us the truth  eve stirred resting her hands upon the altar rails slowly she raised herself to her feet and turned her white face toward him  who spoke she said was it hugh that acour swore is dead oh where am i hugh hugh what passes  your honour it seems eve they say you are married to this traitor  i married and in this red robe why that betokens blood as blood there must be if i am wed to any man save you and she laughed a dreadful laugh  in the name of christ thundered old sir andrew tell me john clavering what means this play yonder woman is no willing wife shes drugged or mad man have you doctored your own daughter  doctored my daughter i i were you not a priest id tear out your tongue for those words shes married and of her own will else would she have stood silent at this altar  it shall be inquired of later hugh answered coldly now yield you sir edmund acour the kings business comes first  nay shouted clavering springing forward and drawing his sword in my house my business comes first acour is my daughters husband and so shall stay till death or pope part them out of this hugh de cressi with all your accursed chapman tribe  hugh walked toward acour taking no heed then suddenly sir john lifted his sword and smote with all his strength the blow caught hugh on the skull and down he fell his mail clattering on the stones and lay still with a whine of rage grey dick leapt at clavering drawing from his side the archers axe he always wore but old sir andrew caught and held him in his arms  vengeance is gods not ours he said look  as he spoke sir john began to sway to and fro he let fall his murdering sword he pressed his hands upon his heart he threw them high then suddenly his knees gave beneath him he sank to the floor a huddled heap and sat there resting against the altar rail over which his head hung backward open mouthed and eyed  the last light of the sky went out only that of the tapers remained eve awake at last sent up shriek after shriek sir andrew bending over the two fallen men the murderer and the murdered began to shrive them swiftly ere the last beat of life should have left their pulses his father brothers and grey dick clustered round hugh and lifted him the foxfaced priest nicholas whispered quick words into the ears of acour and his knights acour nodded and took a step toward eve who just then fell swooning and was grasped by grey dick with his left hand for in his right he still held the axe  no no hissed nicholas dragging sir edmund back life is more than any woman then some one overset the tapers so that the place was plunged in gloom and through it none saw acour and his train creep out by the chancel door and hurry to their horses which waited saddled in the inner yard  the frightened congregation fled from the nave with white faces each seeking his own place or any other that was far from blythburgh manor for did not their dead masters guilt cling to them and would they not also be held guilty of the murder of the kings officer and swing for it from the gallows so it came about that when at last lights were brought hughs people found themselves alone  the frenchmen have fled cried grey dick follow me men and with most of them he ran out and began to search the manor till at length they found a woman who told them that thirty minutes gone acour and all his following had ridden through the back gates and vanished at full gallop into the darkness of the woods  with these tidings dick returned to the chapel  master de cressi said sir andrew when he had heard it back with some of your people to dunwich and raise the burgesses warning them that the kings wrath will be great if these traitors escape the land send swift messengers to all the ports discover where acour rides and follow him in force and if you come up with him take him dead or living stop not to talk man begone nay bide here richard and those who rode with you to london for acour may return again and some must be left to guard the lady eve and your master quick or dead  de cressi his two sons and servants went and presently were riding for dunwich faster than ever they rode before but as it proved acour was too swift for them when at length a messenger galloped into lynn whither they learned that he had fled it was to find that his ship which awaited him with sails hoisted had cleared the port three hours before with a wind behind her which blew straight for flanders  ah said grey dick when he heard the news this is what comes of wasting arrows upon targets which should have been saved for traitors hearts with those three hours of daylight in hand wed have ringed the rogues in or run them down well the devils will be done he does but spare his own till a better day  but when the king heard the news he was very wroth not with hugh de cressi but with the burgesses of dunwich whose mayor although he was blameless lost his office over the matter nor was there any other chosen afterward in his place as those who read the records of that ancient port may discover for themselves    when master de cressi and his people were gone having first searched the great manorhouse and found none in it save a few servingmen and women whom he swore to put to death if they disobeyed him grey dick raised the drawbridge then all being made safe he set a watch upon the walls and saw that there was wood in the iron cradle on the topmost tower in case it should be needful to light the beacon and bring aid but it was not since the sun rose before any dared to draw near those walls and then those that came proved to be friendly folk from dunwich bearing the ill news that the frenchmen were clean away  about midnight the door of the chamber in which sir andrew knelt by a bed whereon lay hugh de cressi opened and the tall eve entered bearing a taper in her hand for now her mind had returned to her and she knew all  is he dead father she asked in a small strange voice then still as any statue awaited the answer that was more to her than life  nay daughter down on your knees and give thanks god by the skill i gained in eastern lands has stayed the flow of his lifes blood and i say that he will live  then he showed her how her fathers sword had glanced from the short hood of chainmail which he had given hugh stunning him but leaving the skull unbroken biting into the neck below it had severed the outer vein only this he had tied with a thread of silk and burned with a hot iron leaving a scar that hugh bore to his death but staunching the flow of blood  how know you that he will live asked eve again seeing that he lies like one that is sped  i know it daughter question me no more as for his stillness it is that which follows a heavy blow perhaps it may hold him fast many days since certainly he will be sick for long yet fear nothing he will live  now eve uttered a great sigh her breast heaved and colour returned to her lips she knelt down and gave thanks as the old priestknight had bidden her then she rose took his hand and kissed it  yet one more question father she said it is of myself that knave drugged me i drank milk and save some dreams remember no more till i heard hughs voice calling now they tell me that i have stood at the altar with de noyon and that his priest read the mass of marriage over us andlook oh i never noted it till nowthere is a ring upon my hand and she cast it on the floor tell me father according to the churchs law is that man mymy husband  sir andrews eloquent dark eyes that ever shadowed forth the thoughts which passed within him grew very troubled  i cannot tell you he answered awkwardly after thinking a while this priest nicholas though i hold him a foul villain is doubtless still a priest clothed with all the authority of our lord himself since the unworthiness of the minister does not invalidate the sacrament were it otherwise indeed few would be well baptized or wed or shriven moreover although i suspect that himself he mixed the draught yet he may not have known that you were drugged and you stood silent and it would appear consenting the ceremony alas was completed i myself heard him give the benediction your father assisted thereat and gave you to the groom in the presence of a congregation the drugging is a matter of surmise and evidence which may not be forthcoming since you are the only witness and where is the proof i fear me daughter that according to the churchs law you are de noyons lawful wife  the churchs law she broke in how about gods law there lies the only man to whom i owe a bond and ill die a hundred deaths before any other shall even touch my hand ay if need be ill kill myself and reason out the case with st peter in the gates  hush hush speak not so madly the knot that the church ties it can unloose this matter must to his holiness the pope it shall be my business to lay it before him yea letters shall go to avignon by the first safe hand moreover it well may happen that god himself will free you by the sword of his servant death this lord of yours if indeed he be your lord is a foul traitor the king of england seeks his life and there is another who will seek it also ere very long and he glanced at the senseless form of hugh fret not yourself overmuch daughter be grateful rather that matters are no worse and that you remain as you always were another hour and you might have been snatched away beyond our finding what is not ended can still be mended now go seek the rest you need for i would not have two sick folk on my hands oh seek it with a thankful heart and forget not to pray for the soul of your erring father for after all he loved you and strove for your welfare according to his lights  it may be so answered eve and ill pray for him as is my duty ill pray also that i may never find such another friend as my father showed himself to me    then she bent for a moment over hugh stretching out her hands above him as though in blessing and departed as silently as she had come  three days went by before hugh found his mind again and after that for two weeks he was so feeble that he must lie quite still and scarcely talk at all sir andrew who nursed him continually with the help of grey dick who brought his master possets bow on back and axe at side but never opened his grim mouth told his patient that eve was safe and sound but that he must not see her until he grew strong again  so hugh strove to grow strong and nature helping him not in vain at length there came a day when he might rise from his bed and sit on a bench in the pleasant spring sunshine by the open window walk he could not however not only on account of his weakness but because of another hurt now discovered for the first time which in the end gave him more trouble than did the dreadful and dangerous blow of claverings sword it seemed that when he had fallen suddenly beneath that murderous stroke all his muscles relaxed as though he were dead and his left ankle bent up under him wrenching its sinews in such a fashion that for the rest of his life he walked a little lame especially was this so in the spring season though whether because he had received his hurt at that time or owing to the quality of the air none could ever tell him  yet on that happy day he thought little of these harms who felt the lifeblood running once more strongly through his veins and who awaited eves longpromised advent at length she came stately kind and beautiful for now her grief and terror had passed by leaving her as she was before her woes fell upon her she came and in sir andrews presence for he would not leave them the tale was told  hugh learned for the first time all the truth of her imprisonment and of her shameful drugging he learned of the burying of sir john clavering and of her naming as sole heiress to his great estates to these however acour had not been ashamed to submit some shadowy claim made in right of his lawful wife dame eve acour countess de noyon which claim had been sent by him from france addressed to all whom it might concern he learned of the kings wrath at the escape of this same acour and of his graces seizure of that false knights lands in suffolk which however proved to be so heavily mortgaged that no one would grow rich upon them  lastly he learned that king edward in a letter written by one of his secretaries to sir andrew arnold and received only that morning said that he held him hugh de cressi not to blame for acours escape it commanded also that if he recovered from his wound for the giving of which sir john clavering should have paid sharply if he had lived he and the archer his servant should join him either in england or in france whither he purposed shortly to proceed with all his host but the mayor and men of dunwich he did not hold free of blame  the letter added moreover that the king was advised that edmund acour on reaching normandy had openly thrown off his allegiance to the crown of england and there was engaged in raising forces to make war upon him further that this acour alleged himself to be the lawfully married husband of eve clavering the heiress of sir john clavering a point upon which his grace demanded information since if this were true he purposed to escheat the clavering lands with this brief and stern announcement the letter ended  by gods mercy eve tell me are you this fellows wife exclaimed hugh  not so she answered can a woman who is dunwich born be wed without consent and can a woman whose will is foully drugged out of her give consent to that which she hates why if so there is no justice in the world  tis a rare jewel in these evil days daughter said sir andrew with a sigh still fret not yourself son hugh a full statement of the case drawn by skilled clerks and testified to by many witnesses has gone forward already to his holiness the pope of which statement true copies have been sent to the king and to the bishops of norwich and of canterbury yet be warned that in such matters the law ecclesiastic moves but slowly and then only when its wheels are greased with gold  well answered hugh with a fierce laugh there remains another law which moves more swiftly and its wheels are greased with vengeance the law of the sword if you are married eve i swear that before very long you shall be widowed or i dead ill not let de noyon slip a second time even if he stands before the holiest altar in christendom  id have killed him in the chapel yonder muttered grey dick who had entered with his masters food and not been sent away only he added looking reproachfully at sir andrew my hand was stayed by a certain holy priests command to which alack i listened  and did well to listen man since otherwise by now you would be excommunicate  i could mock at that said dick sullenly who make confession in my own way and do not wish to be married and care not the worth of a horseshoe nail how and where i am buried provided those i hate are buried first  richard archer graceless wight that you are said sir andrew i say you stand in danger of your soul  ay father and so the frenchman acour stood in danger of his body but you saved it so perhaps if there is need at the last you will do as much for my soul if not it must take its chance and snatching at the dishcover angrily he turned and left the chamber  well commented sir andrew shaking his head sadly if the fellows heart is hard it is honest so may he be forgiven who has something to forgive like the rest of us now hearken to me son and daughter wrong grievous and dreadful has been done to you both yet until death or the church levels it a wall that you may not climb stands between you and when you meet it must be as friendsno more  now i begin to wish that i had learned in grey dicks school said hugh but whatever she thought eve set her lips and said nothing    chapter ix  crecy field  it was saturday the 26th of august in the year 1346 the harassed english hostbut a little host after all retreating for its life from parishad forced the passage of the somme by the ford which a forgotten traitor gobin agache by name revealed to them now it stood at bay upon the plain of crecy there to conquer or to die  will the french fight today what think you asked hugh of grey dick who had just descended from an appletree which grew in the garden of a burntout cottage here he had been engaged on the twofold business of surveying the disposition of the english army and in gathering a pocketful of fruit which remained upon the trees topmost boughs  i think that these are very good apples answered dick speaking with his mouth full eat while you get the chance master for who knows the next you set your teeth in may be of the kind that grew upon the tree of life in a very old garden and he handed him two of the best then he turned to certain archers who clustered round with outstretched hands saying why should i give you my apples fellows seeing that you were too lazy to climb and get them for yourselves none of you ever gave me anything when i was hungry after the sack of caen in which my master being squeamish would take no part therefore i went to bed supperless because as i remember you said i had not earned it still as i dont want to fight the french with a bellyache go scramble for them  then with a quick motion he flung the apples to a distance all save one which he presented to a tall man who stood near adding  take this jack green in token of fellowship since i have nothing else to offer you i beat you at windsor didnt i when we shot a match before the king now show your skill and beat me and ill say thank you keep count of your arrows shot jack and ill keep count of mine and when the battle is over he who has grassed most frenchmen shall be called the better man  then im that already lad answered the great yeoman with a grin as he set his teeth in the apple for look you having served at court ive learned how to lie and shall swear i never wasted shaft whereas you being country born may own to a miss or two for shames sake or likelier still those french will have one or both of us in their bag if all tales are true there is such a countless host of them that we few english shall not see the sky for arrows  dick shrugged his shoulders and was about to answer when suddenly a sound of shouting deep and glad rose from the serried companies upon their left then the voice of an officer was heard calling  line line the king comes  another minute and over the crest of a little rise appeared edward of england clad in full armour he wore a surtout embroidered with the arms of england and france but his helm hung at his saddlebow that all might see his face he was mounted not on his war steed but on a small white ambling palfrey and in his hand he bore a short baton with him came two marshalls gaily dressed and a slim young man clad from head to foot in plain black armour and wearing a great ruby in his helm whom all knew for edward prince of wales  on he rode acknowledging the cheering of his soldiers with smiles and courtly bows till at length he pulled rein just in front of the triple line of archers among whom were mingled some knights and menatarms for the order of battle was not yet fully set just then on the plain beneath riding from out the shelter of some trees and as they thought beyond the reach of arrows appeared four splendid french knights and with them a few squires there they halted taking stock it would seem of the disposition of the english army  who are those that wear such fine feathers asked the king  one is the lord of bazeilles answered a marshall i can see the monk upon his crest but the blazons of the others i cannot read they spy upon us sire may we sally out and take them  nay answered edward their horses are fresher than ours let them go for pray god we shall see them closer soon  so the french knights having stared their full turned and rode away slowly but one of their squires did otherwise dismounting from his horse which he left with another squire to hold he ran forward a few paces to the crest of a little knoll thence he made gestures of contempt and scorn toward the english army as he did so shouting foul words of which a few floated to them in the stillness  now said edward if i had an archer who could reach that varlet ill swear that his name should not be forgotten in england but alas it may not be for none cam make an arrow fly true so far  instantly grey dick stepped forward  sire may i try he asked stringing his great black bow as he spoke  who are you said the king who seem to have been rolled in ashes and wear my own gold arrow in your cap ah i remember the suffolk man who showed us all how to shoot at windsor he who is called grey dick yes try grey dick try if you think that you can reach so far yet for the honour of st george man do not miss for all the host will see fate riding on your shaft  for one moment dick hesitated such awful words seemed to shake even his iron nerve  ive seen you do as much dick said the quiet voice of hugh de cressi behind him still judge you  then dick ground his heels into the turf and laid his weight against the bow while all men watched breathless he drew it to an arc he drew it till the string was level with his ear he loosed then slewing round straightened himself and stared down at the earth as he said afterward he feared to watch that arrow  away it sped while all men gazed high high it flew the sunlight glinting on its polished barb down it came at length and the king muttered short but while the word passed his lips that shaft seemed to recover itself as though by magic and again rushed on he of the foul words and gestures saw it coming and turned to fly as he leapt forward the war arrow struck him full in the small of the back just where the spine ends severing it so that he fell all of a heap like an ox beneath the axe and lay a still and huddled shape  from all the english right who saw this wondrous deed there went up such a shout that their comrades to the left and rear thought for a moment that battle had been joined the king and the prince stared amazed hugh flung his arms about dicks neck and kissed him jack green cried  no archer but a wizard mere man could not have sent a true shaft so far  then would to heaven i had more such wizards said the king god be with you grey dick for you have put new heart into my and all our company mark each of you that he smote him in the back smote him running what reward would you have man  none answered dick in a surly voice my reward is that whatever happens yon filthy french knave will never mock honest english folk again or so i think though the arrow barely reached him yet sire he added after a pause you might knight my master hugh de cressi if you will since but for him i should have feared to risk that shot  then turning aside dick unstrung his bow and pulling the remains of the apple out of his pouch began to munch it unconcernedly  hugh de cressi said the king ah yes i mind me of him and of the rogue acour and the maid red eve well hugh i am told you fought gallantly at blanchetague two days gone and were among the last to cross the somme also we have other debts to pay you come hither sir and give me your sword  your pardon my liege said hugh colouring but ill not be knighted for my henchmans feats or at all until i have done some of my own  ah well master hugh said the king thats a right spirit after the battle perhaps if it should please god that we live to meet again in honour de cressi he added musingly why this place is called crecy and here i think is another good omen at crecy shall de cressi gain great honour for himself and for st george of england you are luck bringers you two let them not be separated in the battle lest the luck should leave them see to it if it please you my lord of warwick young de cressi can draw a bow let him fight amongst the archers and have liberty to join the menatarms when the time comes or stay set them near my son the prince for there surely the fight will be hottest  and now you men of england whatever your degree my brothers of england gentle and simple philip rolls down upon us with all the might of france our heritage which he has stolen our heritage and yours well well show him today or tomorrow or whenever it may be that englishmen put not their faith in numbers but in justice and their own great hearts oh my brothers and my friends let not edward whom you are pleased to serve as your lawful king be whipped off the field of crecy and out of france stand to your banners stand to your king stand to st george and god die where you are if need be as i will never threaten and then show your backs like that knave the archer shot but now look i give my son into your keeping and he pointed to the young prince who all this while sat upon his horse upright and silent the hope of england shall be your leader but if he flies why then cut him down and fight without him but hell not fly and youll not fly no you and he together will this day earn a name that shall be told of when the world is grey with age great is the chance that life has given you pluck it pluck it from the land of opportunity and dead or living become a song forever in the mouths of men unborn think not of prisoners think not of ransoms and of wealth think not of me or of yourselves but think of englands honour and for that strike home for england watches you today  we will we will fear not king we will shouted the host in answer  with a glad smile edward took his young sons hand and shook it then rode away followed by his marshals  de cressi he said as he passed hugh the knave acour your foe and mine is with philip of france he has done me much damage de cressi more than i can stop to tell avenge it if you can your luck is great you may find the chance god be with you and all my lords farewell you have your orders son edward fare you well also meet me again with honour or never more  it was not yet noon when king edward spoke these words and long hours were to go by before the battle joined indeed most thought that no blow would be struck that day since it was known that philip had slept at abbeville whence for a great army the march was somewhat long still when all was made ready the english sat them down in their ranks bows and helmets at side ate their midday meal with appetite and waited whatever fate might send them  in obedience to the kings command hugh and grey dick had been attached to the immediate person of the prince of wales who had about him besides his own knights a small band of chosen archers and another band of menatarms picked for their strength and courage these soldiers were all dismounted since the order had gone forth that knight and squire must fight afoot every horse having been sent to the rear for that day the english expected to receive charges not to make them this indeed would have been impossible seeing that all along their front the wild welsh had laboured for hours digging pits into which horses might plunge and fall  there then the princes battle sat a small force after all perhaps twelve hundred knights and menatarms with three or four thousand archers and to their rear as many of the savage knifearmed welsh who fought that day under the banner of their country the red dragon of merlin grey dicks place was on the extreme left of the archer bodyguard and hughs on the extreme right of that of the menatarms so that they were but a few yards apart and could talk together from time to time they spoke of sundry things but mostly of home for in this hour of danger through which both of them could hardly hope to live even if one did their thoughts turned thither as was but natural  i wonder how it fares with the lady eve said hugh with a sigh for of her no news had come to him since they had parted some months before after he recovered from the wound which clavering gave him  well enough doubtless why not replied dick she is strong and healthy she has many friends and servants to guard her and no enemy there to harm her for her great foe is yonder and he nodded towards abbeville oh without doubt well enough it is she who should wonder how it fares with us let us hope that having naught else to do she remembers us in her prayers since in such a case even one womans prayers are worth something for does not a single feather sometimes turn the scale  i think that eve would rather fight than pray answered hugh with a smile like old sir andrew who would give half his remaining days to sit here with us this afternoon well he is better where he is dick that knave acour sent only insolent words in answer to my challenge which i despatched to him by the knight i took and spared at caen  why should he do more master he can find plenty of ways of dying without risking a single combat with one whom he has wronged and who is therefore very dangerous you remember his crest mastera silver swan painted on his shield i knew it and that is why i shot that poor fowl just before you killed young clavering on the banks of blythe to teach him that swans are not proof against arrows watch for the swan crest master when the battle joins and so will i i promise you  ay ill watch said hugh grimly god help all swans that come my way let us pray that this one has not taken wing for if so i too must learn to fly  thus they talked of these and other things amongst the hum of the great camp which was like to that of bees on a limetree in summer and whilst they talked the blue august sky became suddenly overcast dense and heavy clouds hid up its face a cold and fitful wind began to blow increasing presently to a gale which caused the planted standards blazoned with lions rampant and with fleursdelis and the pennons of a hundred knights set here and there among the long battle lines first to flap and waver and then to stand out straight as though they were cut of iron  a word of command was called from rank to rank  sheath bows it said and instantly thousands of slender points were lifted and sank again vanishing into the leathern cases which the archers bore  scarcely were these snug when the storm broke first fell a few heavy drops to be followed by such a torrent that all who had cloaks were glad to wear them from the black clouds above leapt lightnings that were succeeded by the deep and solemn roll of thunder a darkness fell upon the field so great that men wondered what it might portend for their minds were strained that which at other times would have passed without remark now became portentous indeed afterward some declared that through it they had seen angels or demons in the air and others that they had heard a voice prophesying woe and death to whom they knew not  it is nothing but a harvest tempest said dick presently as he shook the wet from him like a dog and looked to the covering of his quiver see the clouds break  as he spoke a single red ray from the westering sun shot through a rift in the sky and lay across the english host like a sword of light whereof the point hung over the eastern plain save for this flaming sword all else was dark and silent also for the rain and thunder had died away only thousands of crows frightened from the woods wheeled to and fro above their black wings turning to the redness of blood as they crossed and recrossed that splendid path of light and their hoarse cries filling the solemn air with clamour the sight and sounds were strange nor did the thickestheaded fellow crouched upon crecys fateful plain ever forget them till his dying day  the sky cleared by slow degrees the multitudes of crows wheeled off toward the east and vanished the sun shone out again in quiet glory  pray god the french fight us today said hugh as he took off his cloak and rolled it up  why master  because dick it is written that the rain falls on the just and the unjust and the unjust that is the french or rather the italians whom they hire use these newfangled crossbows which as you know cannot be cased like ours and therefore stretch their strings in wet  master remarked dick i did not think you had so much witthat is since you fell in love for before then you were sharp enough well you are right and a little matter like that may turn a battle not but what i had thought of it already  hugh was about to answer with spirit when a sound of distant shouting broke upon their ears a very mighty sound and next instant some outposts were seen galloping in calling arm arm the french the french  suddenly there appeared thousands of crossbow men in thick wavering lines and behind them the points of thousands of spears whose bearers as yet were hidden by the living screen of the italian archers yes before them was the mighty host of france glittering in the splendid light of the westering sun which shone full into their faces  the irregular lines halted perhaps there was something in the aspect of those bands of englishmen still seated in silence on the ground with never a horse among them that gave them pause then as though at a word of command the genoese crossbow men set up a terrific shout  do they think to make us run at a noise like hares said hugh contemptuously  but grey dick made no answer for already his pale eyes were fixed upon the foe with a stare that hugh thought was terrible and his long fingers were playing with the button of his bowcase the genoese advanced a little way then again stood and shouted but still the english sat silent  a third time they advanced and shouted more loudly than before then began to wind up their crossbows  from somewhere in the english centre rose a heavy thudding sound which was new to war it came from the mouths of cannons now for the first time fired on a field of battle and at the report of them the genoese frightened fell back a little seeing that the balls fell short and did but hop toward them slowly they took courage again and began to loose their bolts  youre right master exclaimed grey dick in a fierce chuckle their strings are wet and he pointed to the quarrels that like the cannon balls struck short some within fifty paces of those who shot them so that no man was hurt  now came a swift command and the english ranks rose to their feet uncased their bows and strung them all as though with a single hand a second command and every bow was bent a third and with a noise that was half hiss and half moan thousands of arrows leapt forward forward they leapt and swift and terrible they fell among the ranks of the advancing genoese yes and ere ever one had found its billet its quivermate was hastening on its path thenoh the sunlight showed it allthe genoese rolled over by scores their frail armour bitten through and through by the grey english arrows by scores that grew to hundreds that grew till the poor helpless men who were yet unhurt among them wailed out in their fear and after one short hesitant moment surged back upon the long lines of menatarms behind  from these arose a great shout trahison trahison tuez tuez next instant the appalling sight was seen of the chivalry of france falling upon their friends whose only crime was that their bowstrings were wet and butchering them where they stood so awful and unexpected was this spectacle that for a little while the english archers all except grey dick and a few others cast in the same iron mould ceased to ply their bows and watched amazed  the long shafts began to fly again raining alike upon the slaughterers and the slaughtered a few minutes five perhaps and this terrible scene was over for of the seven thousand genoese but a tithe remained upon their feet and the interminable french lines clad in sparkling steel and waving lance and sword charged down upon the little english band  now for the feast screamed grey dick that was but a snack to sharp the appetite and as he said the words a gorgeous knight died with his arrow through the heart  it came the charge came nothing could stop it down went man and horse line upon line of them swept to death by the pitiless english arrows but still more rushed on they fell in the pits that had been dug they died beneath the shafts and the hoofs of those that followed but still they struggled on shouting philip and st denis and waving their golden banner the oriflamme of france  the charge crept up as a reluctant outworn wave creeps to a resisting rock it foamed upon the rock the archers ceased to shoot and drew their axes the menatarms leapt forward the battle had joined at last breast to breast they wrestled now hughs sword was red and red was grey dicks axe fight as they would the english were borne back the young prince waved his arm screaming something and at that sight the english line checked its retreat stood still and next plunged forward with a roar of  england and the prince  that assault was over backward rolled the ride of men those who were left living after them went the dark welsh their commanders ordered them to stand the earl of warwick ordered them to stand the prince himself ordered them to stand running in front of them only to be swept aside like a straw before a draught of wind out they broke grinning and gnashing their teeth great knives in their hands  the red dragon of merlin which a giant bore led them on it sank it fell it rose again the giant was down but another had it they scrambled over the mass of dead and dying they got among the living beyond with eerie screams they houghed the horses and when the riders fell hacked open the lacings of their helms and unheeding of any cries for mercy drove the great knives home at length all were dead and they returned again waving those red knives and singing some fierce chant in their unknown tongue  the battle was not over yet fresh horses of frenchmen gathered out of arrow range and charged again under the banners of blois alencon lorraine and flanders forward they swept and with them came one who looked like a king for he wore a crown upon his helm the hawkeyed dick noted him and that his bridle was bound to those of the knights who rode upon his either side on them he rained shafts from his great black bow for grey dick never shot without an aim and after the battle one of his marked arrows was found fixed in the throat of the blind king of bohemia  this second charge could not be stayed step by step the english knights were beaten back the line of archers was broken through his guard formed round the prince hugh among them heavy horses swept on to them beneath the hoofs of one of these hugh was felled but stabbing it from below caused the poor beast to leap aside he gained his feet again the prince was down a splendid knightit was the count of flanderswho had sprung from his horse stood over him his sword point at his throat and called on him to yield up ran robert fitzsimmon the standard bearer shouting  to the son of the king to the son of the king  he struck down a knight with the pole of his standard hugh sprang like a wildcat at louis of flanders and drove his sword through his throat richard de beaumont flung the great banner of wales over the prince hiding him till more help came to beat back the foe then the prince struggled from the ground gasping  i thank you friends and once more the french retreated the welsh banner rose again and that danger was over  the earl of warwick ran up hugh noted that his armour was covered with blood  john of norwich he cried to an aged knight who stood leaning on his sword take one with you away to the king and pray him for aid the french gather again we are outworn with blows the young prince is in danger of his life or liberty begone  old johns eyes fell on hugh  come with me you suffolk man he said and away they went  now what would you give he gasped as they ran to be drinking a stoup of ale with me in my tower of mettingham as you have done before this red day dawned what would you give young hugh de cressi  nothing at all answered hugh rather would i die upon this field in glory than drink all the ale in suffolk for a hundred years  well said young man grunted john so do i think would i though i have never longed for a quart of liquor more  they came to a windmill and climbed its steep stairs on the top stage amid the corn sacks stood edward of england looking through the windowplaces  your business sir john he said scarcely turning his head  the old knight told it shortly  my son is not dead and is not wounded replied the king and i have none to send to his aid bid him win his spurs the day shall yet be his look he added pointing through the windowplace our banners have not given back a spears throw and in front of them the field is paved with dead i tell you the french break back de norwich back de cressi and bid the prince to charge  some one thrust a cup of wine into hughs hand he swallowed it glancing at the wild scene below and presently was running with sir john toward the spot where they saw the princes banner flying they came to warwick and told him the kings answer  my father speaks well said the prince let none share our glory this day my lord form up the lines and when my banner is lifted thrice give the word to charge linger not the dark is near and either france or england must go down ere night  forward rolled the french in their last desperate onset horse and foot mingled together forward they rolled almost in silence the arrows playing on their dense host but not as they did at first for many a quiver was empty once twice thrice the princes banner bowed and lifted and as it rose for the third time there rang out a shout of  charge for st george and edward  then england that all these long hours had stood still suddenly hurled herself upon the foe hugh leaping over a heap of dead and dying saw in front of him a knight who wore a helmet shaped like a wolfs head and had a wolf painted upon his shield the wolf knight charged at him as though he sought him alone an arrow from behindit was grey dickssank up to the feathers in the horses neck and down it came the rider shook himself clear and began to fight hugh was beaten to his knee beneath a heavy blow that his helm turned he rose unhurt and rushed at the knight who in avoiding his onset caught his spur on the body of a dead man and fell backward  hugh leapt on to him striving to thrust his sword up beneath his gorget and make an end of him  grace said the knight in french i yield me  we take no prisoners answered hugh as he thrust again  pity then said the knight you are brave would you butcher a fallen man if you had tripped i would have spared you show mercy some day your case may be mine and it will be repaid to you  hugh hesitated although now the point of his sword was through the lacing of the gorget  for your ladys sake pity gasped the knight as he felt its point  you know by what name to conjure said hugh doubtfully well get you gone if you can and pray for one hugh de cressi for he gives you your life  the knight seemed to start then struggled to his feet and seizing a loose horse by the bridle swung himself to the saddle and galloped off into the shadows  master croaked a voice into hughs ear ive seen the swan follow me my arrows are all gone or id have shot him  gods truth show him to me gasped hugh and away they leapt together  soon they had outrun even the slaughtering welsh and found themselves mingled with fugitives from the french army but in the gathering twilight none seemed to take any note of them indeed every man was engaged in saving his own life and thought that this was the purpose of these two also some three hundred yards away certain french knights mounted often two upon one horse or afoot were flying from that awful field striking out to the right in order to clear themselves of the cumbering horde of fugitives one of these knights lagged behind evidently because his horse was wounded he turned to look back and a last ray from the dying sun lit upon him  look said dick and hugh saw that on the knights shield was blazoned a white swan and that he wore upon his helmet a swan for a crest the knight who had not seen them spurred his horse but it would not or could not move then he called to his companions for help but they took no heed finding himself alone he dismounted hastily examined the horses wound and having unbuckled a cloak from his saddle cast down his shield in order that he might run more lightly  thanks to god he is mine muttered hugh touch him not dick unless i fall and then do you take up the quarrel till you fall  so speaking he leapt upon the man out of the shadow of some thorns that grew there  lift your shield and fight said hugh advancing on him with raised sword i am hugh de cressi  then sir i yield myself your prisoner answered the knight seeing that you are two and i but one  not so i take no prisoners who seek vengeance not ransom and least of all from you my companion shall not touch you unless i fall swift now the light dies and i would kill you fighting  the knight picked up his shield  i know you he said i am not he you think  and i know you answered hugh now no words of them there have been enough between us and he smote at him  for two minutes or more they fought for the armour of both was good and one was full of rage and the other of despair there was little fine swordplay about this desperate duel the light was too low for it they struck and warded that was all while grey dick stood by and watched grimly some more fugitives came up but seeing that blows passed veered off to the left for of blows they had known enough that day the swan knight missed a great stroke for hugh leapt aside then as the frenchman staggered forward struck at him with all his strength the heavy sword grasped in both hands for hugh had thrown aside his shield caught his foe where neck joins shoulder and sank through his mail deep into the flesh beneath down he went it was finished  unlace his helm dick grasped hugh i would see his face for the last time and if he still lives  dick obeyed cutting the lashings of the helm  by the saints he said presently in a startled voice if this be sir edmund acour he has strangely changed  i am not acour lord of noyon said the dying man in a hollow voice had you given me time i would have told you so  then in christs name who are you asked hugh that wear de noyons cognizance  i am pierre de la roche one of his knights you have seen me in england i was with him there and you made me prisoner on dunwich heath he bade me change arms with him before the battle promising me great reward because he knew that if he were taken edward of england would hang him as a traitor whereas me they might ransom also he feared your vengeance  well of a truth you have the reward said dick looking at his ghastly wound  where then is acour gasped hugh  i know not he fled from the battle an hour ago with the king of france but i who was doomed would not fly oh that i could find a priest to shrive me  whither does he fly asked hugh again  i know not he said that if the battle went against us he would seek his castle in italy where edward cannot reach him  what armour did he wear asked dick  mine minea wolf upon his shield a wolfs head for crest  hugh reeled as though an arrow had passed through him  the wolf knight acour he groaned and i spared his life  a very foolish deed for which you now pay the price said dick as though to himself  we met in the battle and he told me said de la roche speaking very slowly for he grew weak yes he told me and laughed truly we are fates fools all of us and he smiled a ghastly smile and died  hugh hid his face in his hands and sobbed in his helpless rage  the innocent slain he said by me and the guilty sparedby me oh god my cup is full take his arms man that one day i may show them to acour and let us be going ere we share this poor knights fate ah who could have guessed it was thus that i and sir pierre should meet and part again    chapter x  the kings champion  back over that fearful field whereof the silence was broken only by the groans of the wounded and the dying walked hugh and grey dick they came to the great rampart of dead men and horses that surrounded the english line and climbed it as though it were a wall on the further side bonfires had been lit to lighten the darkness and by the flare of them they saw edward of england embracing and blessing his son the black prince who unhelmeted bowed low before him in his bloodstained mail  who were they besides sir robert fitzsimmon and richard de beaumont who helped you when you were down my son asked the king  the prince looked about him  i know not sire many but here is one of them and he pointed to hugh who just then appeared within the circle of the firelight i think that he slew the count louis of flanders  ah said the king our young merchant of dunwicha gallant man kneel you down merchant of dunwich  hugh knelt and the king taking the red sword from his hand struck him with it on the shoulder saying  rise sir hugh de cressi for now i give you that boon which your deathfaced servant asked before the battle you have served us or rather england well both of you but whose armour is that the archer carries sir hugh  sir edmund acours lord de noyon sire only alack another man was within the armour  your meaning said the king briefly and in few words hugh told the tale  a strange story sir hugh it would seem that god fought against you in this matter also i am wroth my orders were that none of my men should sally out though i fear me that you are not the only one who has broken them and for your great deeds i forgive you  sire said hugh dropping to his knee again a boon this de noyon your enemy and mine has cheated and mocked me grant to me and my servant richard the archer permission to follow after him and be avenged upon him  what is this you ask sir hugh that you and your brave henchman should wander off into the depths of france there to perish in a dungeon or be hanged like felons nay nay we need good men and have none to spare for private quarrels as for this traitor de noyon and his plot that egg is broken ere it was hatched and we fear him no more you follow me sir hugh and your servant with you whom we make a captain of our archers until calais is taken leave not our person for any cause and ask no more such boons lest you lose our favour nay we have no more words for you since many others seek them stand back sir hugh what say you my lord of warwick ay it is a gruesome task but let the welshmen out those wounded will be well rid of their pain and christ have mercy on their souls forget not when it is finished to gather all men that they may give thanks to god for his great mercies    well nigh a year had gone for once again the sun shone in the brazen august heavens calais had fallen at last only that day six of her noblest citizens had come forth bearing the keys of the fortress clad in white shirts with ropes about their necks and been rescued from instant death at the hands of the headsman by the prayer of queen philippa  in his tent sat hugh de cressi who after so much war and hardship looked older than his years perhaps because of a red scar across the forehead which he had come by during the siege with him was his father master de cressi who had sailed across from dunwich with a cargo of provisions whereof if the truth were known he had made no small profit for they were sold every pound of them before they left the ships hold though it is true the money remained to be collected  you say that eve is well my father  aye well enough son never saw i woman better or more beautiful though she wears but a sad face i asked her if she would not sail with me and visit you but she answered nay how can i who am another mans wife sir hugh your son should have killed the wolf and let the poor swan go when the wolf is dead then perchance i will visit him but meanwhile say to him that red eves heart is where it always was and that like all dunwich she joys greatly in his fame and is honoured in his honour moreover to grey dick here she sends many messages and a present of wines and spiced foods for his stomach and of six score arrows made after his own pattern for his quiver  but for me no gift father said hugh  nothing son save her love which she said was enough also in all this press of business and in my joy at finding you safe i had almost forgotten it there is a letter from the holy father sir andrew i have it somewhere in my pouch amid the bills of exchange and he began to hunt through the parchments which he carried in a bag within his robe  at length the letter was found it ran thus  to sir hugh de cressi knight my beloved godson  with what rejoicings i and another have heard of your knightly deeds through the letters that you have sent to us and from the mouths of wounded soldiers returned from the war your honoured father will tell you i thank god for them and pray him that this may find you unhurt and growing ever in glory  my son i have no good news for you the pope at avignon having studied the matter if indeed it ever reached his own ears writes by one of his secretaries to say that he will not dissolve the alleged marriage between the count of noyon and the lady eve of clavering until the parties have appeared before him and set out their cause to his face therefore eve cannot come to you nor must you come to her while de noyon lives unless the mind of his holiness can be changed should france become more quiet so that english folk can travel there in safety perchance eve and i will journey to avignon to lay her plaint before the holy father but as yet this seems scarcely possible moreover i trust that the traitor acour may meet his end in this way or in that and so save us the necessity for as you know such cases take long to try and the cost of them is great moreover at the court of avignon the cause of one of our country must indeed be good just now when the other party to it is of the blood of france  soon i hope to write to you again who at present have no more to say save that notwithstanding my years i am well and strong and would that i sat with you before the walls of calais gods blessing and mine be on you and to richard the archer greetings dunwich has heard how he shot the foultongued frenchman before the great battle closed and the townsfolk lit a bonfire on the walls and feasted all the archers in his honour  andrew arnold  i have found another letter said master de cressi when hugh had finished reading which i remember sir andrew charged me to give to you also and he handed him a paper addressed in a large childish hand  hugh broke its silk eagerly for he knew that writing  hugh it began simply clement the pope will not void my false marriage unless i appear before him and this as yet i cannot do because of the french wars moreover he sets the curse of the church upon me and any man with whom i shall dare to remarry until this be done for myself i would defy the church but not for you or for children that might come to us moreover the holy father sir andrew forbids it saying that god will right all in his season and that we must not make him wroth therefore hugh lover you are but husband you may not be while de noyon lives or until the pope gives his dispensation of divorce which latter may be long in winning for the knave de noyon has been whispering in his ear hugh this is my counsel get you to the king again and crave his leave to follow de noyon for if once you twain can come face to face i know well how the fray will end then when he is dead return to one who waits for you through this world and the next  hugh i am proud of your great deeds no longer can they mock you as the merchants son sir hugh god be with you as are my prayers and love  eve clavering  i forgot to tell you that sir andrew is disturbed in heart he looks into a crystal which he says he brought with him from the east and swears he sees strange sights there pictures of woe such as have not been since the beginning of the world of this woe he preaches to the folk of dunwich warning them of judgment to come and they listen affrighted because they know him to be a holy man who has a gift from god yet he says that you and i eve need fear nothing may it be so hughe  now when he had thought awhile and hidden up eves letter hugh turned to his father and asked him what were these sermons that sir andrew preached  i heard but one of them son answered master de cressi though there have been three by the holy mother it frightened me so much that i needed no more of that medicine nor to tell truth when i got home again could i remember all he said save that it was of some frightful ill which comes upon the world from the east and will leave it desolate  and what think folk of such talk father  indeed son they know not what to think most say that he is mad others say that he is inspired of god yet others declare that he is a wizard and that his familiar brings him tidings from cathay where once he dwelt or perchance from hell itself these went to the bishop who summoned sir andrew and was closeted with him for three hours afterward he called in the complainers and bade them cease their scandal of wizardry since he was sure that what the holy father said came from above and not from below he added that they would do well to mend their lives and prepare to render their account as for his part he should also since the air was thick with doom then he gave his benediction to the old knight and turned away weeping and since that hour none talk of wizardry but all of judgment men in dunwich who have quarrelled from boyhood forgive each other and sing psalms instead of swearing oaths and i have been paid debts that have been owing to me for years all because of these sermons  an awesome tale truly said hugh yet like this bishop i believe that what sir andrew says will come to pass for i know well that he is not as other men are  that night by special leave hugh waited on the king and with him grey dick who was ever his shadow  what is it now sir hugh de cressi asked edward  sire after the great battle nigh upon a year ago you told me that i must serve you till calais fell i have served as best i could and calais has fallen now i ask your leave to go seek my enemyand yourssir edmund acour count de noyon  then you must go far sir hugh for i have tidings that this rogue who was not ashamed to wear another mans armour and so save himself from your sword is away to italy this six months gone where as the seigneur de cattrina he has estates near venice but tell me how things stand doubtless that red eve of yoursstrangely enough i thought of her at crecy when the sky grew so wondrous at nightfallis at the bottom of them  that is so sire and he told him all the tale  a strange case truly sir hugh said the king when he had heard it out ill write to clement for you both but i doubt me whether you and your eve will get justice from him being english england and englishmen find little favour at avignon just now and mayhap philip has already written on behalf of de noyon at the best his holiness will shear you close and keep you waiting while he weighs the wool no red eve is right this is a knot soonest severed by the sword if you should find him de noyon could scarce refuse to meet you for you shall fight him as the champion of our cause as well as of your own hes at venice for our envoy there reported it to me trying to raise a fresh force of archers for the french  you have leave to go sir hugh who deserve much more having served us well went on the king well give you letters to sir geoffrey carleon who represents us there and through him to the doge farewell to you sir hugh de cressi and to you captain richard the archer when all this game is played return and make report to us of your adventures and of how de noyon died the queen will love to hear the tale and your nuptials and red eves shall be celebrated at westminster in our presence for you have earned no less master secretary get your tools i will dictate the letters after they are signed tomorrow see them into the hands of sir hugh with others that i will give him for safe carriage for alas i have creditors at venice make out an open patent also to show that he and this captain travel as our messengers charging all that do us service to forward them upon their journey    three days later hugh and grey dick in the character of royal messengers from the king of england to the doge of venice took passage in a great vessel bound for genoa with a cargo of wool and other goods on board this ship before he sailed hugh handed to his father letters for eve and for sir andrew arnold also he received from him money in plenty for his faring and bills of exchange upon certain merchants of italy which would bring him more should it be needed  their parting was very sad since the prophecies of sir andrew had taken no small hold upon master de cressis mind  i fear me greatly dear son he said that we part to meet no more well such is the lot of parents they breed those children that heaven decrees to them with toil and thought and fears they rear them up from infancy learning to love them more than their own souls for their sakes fighting a hard world then the sons go forth north and south and the daughters find husbands and joys and sorrows of their own and both half forget them as is natures way last of all those parents die as also is natures way and the half forgetfulness becomes whole as surely as the young moon grows to full well well this is a lesson that each generation must learn in turn as you will know ere all is done although you are my youngest ill not shame to say i have loved you best of all hugh moreover ive made such provision as i can for you who have raised up the old name to honour and who as i hope will once more blend the de cressis and the claverings the foes of three generations into a single house  speak not so father answered hugh who was moved almost to tears mayhap it is i who shall die while you live on to a green old age at least know that i am not forgetful of your love and kindness seeing that after eve you are dearer to me than any on the earth  ay ay after eve and eves children still youll have a kind thought for me now and then the old merchant who so often thwarted you when you were a wayward ladfor your own good as he held for what more can a father hope but let us not weep before all these stranger men farewell son hugh of whom i am so proud farewell son hugh and he embraced him and went across the gangway for the sailors were already singing their chanty at the anchor  i never had a father than i can mind said grey dick aloud to himself after his fashion yet now i wish i had for id like to think on his last words when there was nothing else to do its an ugly world as i see it but theres beauty in such love as this the man for the maid and the maid for the manpish they want each other but the father and the motherthey give all and take nothing oh theres beauty in such love as this so perhaps god made it only then how did he also make crecy field and calais siege and my black bow and me the death who draws it    the voyage to genoa was very long for at this season of the year the winds were light and for the most part contrary at length however hugh and dick came there safe and sound having landed and bid farewell to the captain and crew of the ship they waited on the head of a great trading house with which master de cressi had dealings  this signor who could speak french gave them lodging and welcomed them well both for the sake of hughs father and because they came as messengers from the king of england on the morrow of their arrival he took them to a great lord in authority who was called a duke this duke when he learned that one was a knight and the other a captain archer of the english army and that they both had fought at crecy where so many of his countrymenthe genoese bowmenhad been slain looked on them somewhat sourly  had he known all the part they played in that battle in truth his welcome would have been rough but hugh with the guile of the serpent told him that the brave genoese had been slain not by the english arrows for which even with their wet strings they were quite a match here dick who was standing to one side grinned faintly and stroked the case of his black bow as though to bid it keep its memories to itself but by the cowardly french their allies indeed hughs tale of that horrible and treacherous slaughter was so moving that the duke burst into tears and swore that he would cut the throat of every frenchman on whom he could lay hands  after this he began to extol the merits of the crossbow as against the long arm of the english and hugh agreed that there was much in what he said but grey dick who was no courtier did not agree indeed of a sudden he broke in offering in his bad french to fight any crossbow man in genoa at six score yards so that the duke might learn which was the better weapon but hugh trod on his foot and explained that he meant something quite different being no master of the french tongue so that cloud passed by  the end of it was that this duke or doge whose name they learned was simon boccanera gave them safe conduct through all his dominion with an order for relays of horses also he made use of them to take a letter to the doge of venice between which town and genoa although they hated each other bitterly there was at the moment some kind of hollow truce so having drunk a cup of wine with him they bade him farewell  next morning the horses arrived and with them two led beasts to carry their baggage in charge of a genoese guide so they departed on their long ride of something over two hundred english miles which they hoped to cover in about a week in fact it took them ten days for the roads were very rough and the packbeasts slow once too after they had entered the territory of venice they were set on in a defile by four thieves and might have met their end had not grey dicks eyes been so sharp as it was he saw them coming and having his bow at hand for he did not like the look of the country or its inhabitants leaped to earth and shot two of them with as many arrows whereon the other two ran away before they went however they shot also and killed a packbeast so that the englishmen were obliged to throw away some of their gear and go on with the one that remained  at length on the eleventh afternoon they saw the lovely city of venice sparkling like a cluster of jewels set upon its many islands amid the blue waters of the adriatic having crossed some two miles of open water by a ferry which plied for the convenience of travellers they entered the town through the western gate and inquired as best they could for now they had no guide the genoese having left them long before for the house of sir geoffrey carleon the english envoy for a long while they could make no one understand indeed the whole place seemed to be asleep perhaps because of the dreadful heat which lay over it like a cloud and seemed to burn them to the very bones  perplexed and outworn at last hugh produced a piece of gold and held it before a number of men who were watching them idly again explaining in french that he wished to be led to the house of the english ambassador the sight of the money seemed to wake their wits for two or three of the fellows ran forward quarrelling with each other till one of them getting the mastery seized hughs tired horse by the bridle and dragged it down a side street to the banks of a broad canal  here he called something aloud and presently two men appeared rowing a large flatbottomed punt from a dock where it was hidden into this boat the horses and packbeast were driven much against their will hugh and dick having followed them the three italians began to punt them along the canal which was bordered with tall houses a mile or so farther on it entered another canal where the houses were much finer and built in a style of which they had never seen the like with beautiful and fantastic arches supported upon pillars  at length to their great joy they came opposite to a house over the gateway of which stirless in the still air hung a flag whereon were blazoned the leopards of england here the boatmen pulling in their poles save one to which they made the punt fast in midstream showed by their gestures that they desired to be paid hugh handed the piece of gold to the man who had led them to the boat whereon he was seized with a fit of uncontrollable fury he swore he raved he took the piece of gold and cast it down on the bilgeboards he spat on it and his two companions did likewise  surely they are mad said hugh  mad or no i like not the looks of them answered dick have a care they are drawing their knives and as he spoke one of the rogues struck him in the face while another strove to snatch away the pouch that hung at his side  now grey dick awoke as it were to the man who had tried to take his pouch he dealt such a buffet that he plunged into the canal but him who had struck him he seized by the arm and twisted it till the knife fell from his hand then gripping his neck in an iron grasp he forced him downward and rubbed his nose backward and forward upon the rough edge of the boat for the italian was but as a child to him when he put out his strength  in vain did his victim yell for mercy he showed him none till at length wearying of the game he dealt him such a kick that he also flew over the thwarts to join his fellowbully in the water  then seeing how it had gone with his companions who sorely damaged swam to the farther side of the canal and vanished the third man he whom they had first met sheathed his knife with many bows and cringes he pulled up the pole and pushed the punt to the steps of the house over which the flag hung where people were gathering drawn by the clamour  does sir geoffrey carleon dwell here asked hugh in a loud voice whereon a gentleman with a pale face and a grizzled beard who appeared to be sick for he was leaning on a staff hobbled from out the porch saying  ay ay that is my name who are you that make this tumult at my gates another turbulent englishman ill be bound  ay sir an englishman called sir hugh de cressi and his companion richard the archer whom these rogues have tried to rob and murder messengers from his grace king edward  now sir geoffrey changed his tone  your pardon if i spoke roughly sir hugh but we poor envoys have to do with many rufflers from our own land enter i pray you my servants will see to your gear and horses but first what is the trouble between you and these fellows  hugh told him briefly  ah he said a common trick with foreigners well for you that night had not fallen since otherwise they might have rowed you up some back waterway and there done you to death the canals of venice hide the traces of many such foul deeds mother of heaven he added why this boatman is none other than giuseppe the noted bravo and he turned and in italian bade his servants seize the man  but giuseppe had heard enough springing into the water he swam like a duck for the farther bank of the canal and gaining it ran swiftly for some alley where he vanished  hes gone said sir geoffrey and as well hunt with a lantern for a rat in a sewer as for him well we have his boat which shall be sent to the magistrate with letters of complaint only sir hugh be careful to wear mail when you walk about at night lest that villain and his mates should come to collect their fare with a stiletto now enter and fear not for your goods my folk are honest gods name how fearful is this heat none have known its like steward give me your arm    an hour later and hugh clad in fresh garments of sweet linen bathed and shaved sat at table in a great cool room with sir geoffrey and his lady a middleaged and anxiousfaced woman while grey dick ate at a lower board with certain of the envoys household  i have read the letters which concern the business of his grace the king said sir geoffrey who was toying languidly with some southern fruits for he would touch no meat they have to do with moneys that his grace owes to great bankers of this city but does not yet find it convenient to discharge i have seen their like before and tomorrow must deal with them as best i mayno pleasant business for these usurers grow urgent and he sighed but he added the king says that you sir hugh de cressi whom he names his brave trusty and most well beloved knight and companion in war and he bowed courteously to hugh have another business which he commands me to forward by every means in my power and that without fail what is this business sir hugh  it is set out sir geoffrey in a letter from his grace to the doge of venice which i am to ask you to deliver here it is be pleased to read it it is open  the envoy took the letter and read it lifting his eyebrows as he did so  by st markhes the right saint to swear by in venicehe exclaimed when he had finished this is a strange affair you have travelled hither to offer single combat to edmund acour count of noyon and seigneur of cattrina the doge is urged by his friendship to the throne of england to bring about this combat to the death seeing that de noyon has broken his oath of homage has plotted to overthrow king edward has fought against him and that therefore you are his graces champion as well as the avenger of certain private wrongs which you will explain thats the letter well i think the doge will listen to it because he scarce dare do otherwise who wishes no quarrel with our country just now when it is victorious also this de noyon whom we call cattrina here has allied himself with certain great men of the republic with whom he is connected by blood who are secret enemies to the doge through them he strives to stir up trouble between venice and england and to raise mercenaries to serve the flag of france as did the genoese to their sorrow therefore i think that in the doge you will find a friend i think also that the matter being brought forward with such authority the seigneur de cattrina will scarcely care to refuse your challenge if you can show that you have good cause for quarrel against him since in such affairs the venetians are punctilious but now tell me the tale that i may judge better  so hugh told him all  a strange story and a good cause said sir geoffrey when he had done only this cattrina is dangerous had he known you came to venice mayhap you had never lived to reach my house go armed young knight especially after the sun sinks ill away to write to the doge setting out the heads of the matter and asking audience the messenger shall leave ere i sleep if sleep i may in this heat bide you here and talk with my lady if it so pleases you for i would show you my letter ere we bid goodnight and the thing is pressing we must catch cattrina before he gets wind of your presence in venice    chapter xi  the challenge  how long is it since you have seen england sir hugh asked dame carleon languidly  some eighteen months lady although in truth it seems more for many things have happened to me in that time  eighteen months only why tis four long years since i looked upon the downs of sussex which are my home the dear downs of sussex that i shall see never again  why say you so lady who should have many years of life before you  because they are done sir hugh oh in my heart i feel that they are done that should not grieve me since my only child is buried in this glittering southern city whereof i hate the sounds and sights that men call so beautiful yet i would that i might have been laid at last in the kind earth of sussex where for generations my forbears have been borne to rest and suddenly she began to weep  what ails you lady you are not well  oh i know not i think it is the heat or some presage of woe to come not to me only but to all men look nature herself is sick and she led him to the broad balcony of the chamber and pointed to long lines of curious mist which in the bright moonlight they could see creeping toward venice from the ocean although what wind there was appeared to be off land  those fogs are unnatural she went on at this season of the year there should be none and these come not from the lagoons but up from the sea where no such vapours were ever known to rise the physicians say that they foretell sickness whereof terrible rumours have for some time past reached us from the east though none know whether these be true or false  the east is a large place where there is always sickness lady or so i have heard  ay ay it is the home of death and i think that he travels to us thence and not only i not only i half the folk in venice think the same though why they cannot tell listen  as she spoke the sound of solemn chanting broke upon hughs ear nearer it grew and nearer till presently there emerged from a side street a procession of black monks who bore in front of them a crucifix of white ivory along the narrow margin which lay between the houses and the canal they marched followed by a great multitude of silent people  it is a dirge for the dead that they sing said dame carleon and yet they bury no man oh months ago i would have escaped from this city and we had leave to go but then came orders from the king that we must bide here because of his creditors so here we bide for good and all hush i hear my husband coming say nothing of my talk it angers him rest you well sir hugh  truly that lady has a cheerful mind grumbled grey dick when she had gone leaving them alone upon the balcony ten minutes more of her and i think i should go hang myself or squat upon these stones and howl at the moon like a dog or those whimpering friars  hugh made no answer for he was thinking of his fathers tale of the prophecies of sir andrew arnold and how they grew sad in dunwich also in truth like lady carleon he found it in his heart to wish that he too were clear of venice which he had reached with so much toil  bah he said presently this place stinks foully it puts me in mind of some woman most beauteous indeed but three days dead let us go in    on the following morning while they sat at breakfast there came a messenger from the doge of venice whose name hugh learned was andrea dandolo bearing a letter sealed with a great seal this letter when opened was found to be from some high officer it stated that the doge would hold a court at noon after which it was his pleasure to receive the english knight who came as a messenger from the mighty monarch king edward and to talk with him on matters set out in the letter of sir geoffrey carleon the writing added that the seigneur of cattrina who in france was known as the count de noyon and in england as sir edmund acour would be present at the court and doubtless ready to answer all questions that might be put to him  then at last we shall come face to face said hugh with a fierce laugh  yes master put in dick but youve done that several times before and always ended back to back pray the saints such may not be the finish of this meeting also  then he turned and went to clean his masters armour for in this martial dress notwithstanding the great heat hugh determined to appear before the doge it was good armour not that save for the sword which sir arnold had given him whereat the court at windsor had laughed as out of date but mail of a newer fashion some of it from the bodies of knights who fell at crecy after which battle such wares had been cheap  still dick could have wished that it had been better for so fine an occasion seeing that it was marked with many a battle dint and that right across the cressi cognizance which hugh had painted on his shield after he was knighteda golden star rising from an argent oceanwas a scar left by the battleaxe of a calais manatarms moreover hugh or rather dick took with him other armour namely that of the knight sir pierre de la roche whom hugh had killed at crecy thinking that he was edmund acour whose mail pierre wore  for the rest dick clad himself in his uniform of a captain of archers of king edwards guard wearing a green tunic over his mail shirt and a steellined cap from which rose a herons plume pinned thereto with his graces golden arrow  all being ready they started in a painted barge accompanied by sir geoffrey carleon who wore his velvet robe of office and grumbled at its weight and warmth a row of some fifteen minutes along the great canal brought them to a splendid portal upon the mole with marble steps hence they were conducted by guards across a courtyard where stood many gaily dressed people who watched them curiously especially grey dick whose pale sinister face caused them to make a certain sign with their fingers to avert the evil eye as sir geoffrey explained to them leaving this courtyard they went up more steps and along great corridors into the finest apartment that they had ever seen it was a glitter of gold and marble and rich with paintings  here on a kind of throne sat the doge dandolo an imperiallooking man magnificently attired guards stood like statues behind him while in front talking together and moving from place to place were gathered all the great nobles of venice with their beauteous ladies from time to time the doge summoned one or other of these who was called to him by a blackrobed secretary advancing with bows the courtier talked to him a while then was dismissed by a gracious motion of the hand  as the englishmen entered this hall a herald called their names thus from a written slip of paper  the cavalier geoffrey carleon ambassador of england the cavalier hugh de cressi messenger from the king of england and the captain richard archer his companion  now all talk was hushed and every eye turned to scan these strangers of whose business it would seem something was already known  a fine man said one lady to another of hugh but why does he come here in dinted armour  oh he is english and the english are barbarians who like to be ready to cut some ones throat answered her companion but holy jesus look at the long fellow with the deaths head who walks behind him and carries his luggage in a sack his face makes my back creep  fortunately neither hugh nor dick understood these and other such sayings which sir geoffrey repeated to them afterward and therefore walked on with their host unconcerned once however grey dick nudged his master and whispered in his ear  be glad our man is here it is he who mocks us to those popinjays nay turn not to look you will see plenty of his sweet face presently  now they stood before the chair of state from which the doge rose and advanced two steps to greet the ambassador of england when these courtesies were over sir geoffrey presented hugh to him to whom he bowed and dick whose salute he acknowledged with a wave of his jewelled hand afterward they talked all crowding round to listen sir geoffrey himself who spoke italian well acting as the interpreter  you come hither cavalier de cressi said the doge on behalf of his royal grace king edward who speaks of you in his letter in terms of which any knight may well be proud we understand that this captain with you is your companion and he glanced curiously at dick out of the corners of his dark eyes adding if those are gifts which he bears in that leathern sack and the long case in his hand let our servants relieve him of them  let his servants leave me alone growled grey dick when this was translated say to this fine lord sir knight that the gifts in the sack are not for him and that which the case scatters he would scarcely care to have  sir geoffrey made some explanation in a low voice and with a smile the doge waved the matter by then said  will the noble cavalier be so good as to set out his business unless it is for our private ear alone  hugh answered that it was for the public ear of all venice and especially for that of the lord who was called sir edmund acour in england the count de noyon in france and the seigneur of cattrina in italy  will you pleased to point out this lord to us said the doge glancing at the gorgeous throng which was gathered behind them  i cannot illustrious doge answered hugh that is with certainty as it chances i have seen his face but twiceonce in a marsh when i had other things to think of who must watch my enemys sword and once at eve in the corner of a dark chapel where he had just gone through the rite of marriage with a lady whom he had drugged which lady was my affianced wife often afterward i sought to see that face especially in the great fray of crecy but failed in a case which with your leave i will narrate to you  now when all that company understood the meaning of these outspoken words they swayed to and fro and whispered like reeds in an evening wind presently above this whispering a soft yet penetrating voice was heard to say  if this english knight desires to study the poor face of acour de noyon and cattrina he who owns it is much honoured and prays your excellencys leave to wait upon his pleasure  so saying a tall and noblelooking man who wore the badge of a white swan worked in pearls upon his rich tunic stepped forward out of the ring of courtiers and bowed first to the doge and next to hugh  de cressi looked at his handsome face with its quick dark eyes and little squarecut black beard and answered  i thank you sir edmund acour for i take it you are he now i shall never forget you again for though a man may shift his armour he cannot change his countenancea saying at which de noyon coloured a little and looked down uneasily  cavalier de cressi he whom you seek is before you we ourselves vouch for his identity said the doge now be pleased to set out your case  my private case i thrust to one side answered hugh sir geoffrey interpreting all the time for it is a matter between this count a certain lady and myself and can wait that which i have to lay before you illustrious has to do with my master the king of england as whose champion i am here today i accuse this lord of the three names of black treachery to his august liege edward all details of which treason i am prepared to furnish and on behalf of that most puissant monarch i challenge him to single combat as i am empowered and commissioned to do  why should i fight the king of englands bravoes inquired acour in a languid voice of those who stood about him a question at which they laughed  if the charge of treason is not sufficient went on hugh ill add to it one of cowardice at the battle of crecy as a man here will bear me witness and he pointed to dick i overcame in single combat a knight who wore upon his shield the cognizance of a wolf and on his helm a wolfs head which were the arms of sir pierre de la roche at this knights prayer i spared his life for that day we took no prisoners and let him go afterward i fought with another knight carrying the cognizance of a white swan the arms of the count de noyon and slew him in fair and single fight but before he died he told me that he bore that armour by command of his lord the count de noyon and that the said count fought that day in his mail because he feared the vengeance of the king of england and my own thus it came about that the wolf who fought paid the price for the swan who fled away hid in the armour of his friend whom he left to die for him  there followed a great silence for all those noble lords and ladies who thought little of treason which to most of them was a very familiar thing were not a little stirred by this tale of cowardice and false arms the doge said  noble cattrina you have heard the story of the english knight what do you answer to it  only that it is a lie illustrious like everything else that he has told us replied acour with a shrug of his broad shoulders  you said that you had a witness cavalier de cressi said the doge where is he  here answered hugh stand forward dick and tell what you saw  dick obeyed and in his low rasping voice with more detail than hugh had given set out the story of those two combats at crecy of the sparing of the wolf knight and the slaying of the swan knight  what say you now noble cattrina asked the doge  i say that the man lies even better than his master answered acour coolly and all the court laughed  illustrious said hugh doubtless you have some herald at your court i pray that he may fetch his book and tell us what are the arms of de noyon and cattrina with all their colourings and details  the doge beckoned to an officer in a broidered tabard who with bows without needing to fetch any book described the crest and arms of cattrina in full particular he added that to his knowledge these were borne by no other family or man in italy france or england  then you would know them if you saw them said hugh  certainly cavalier on it i stake my repute as a herald  now while all wondered what this talk might mean the doge and acour most of any although the latter grew uneasy fearing he knew not what hugh whispered to dick then dick loosed the mouth of the leather sack he carried and out of it tumbled on to the marble floor a whole suit of bloodstained armour  whence came these asked hugh of dick  off the body of the night sir pierre de la roche whom you slew at crecy i stripped him of them myself  whose crest and cognizance are these herald asked hugh again lifting the helm and shield and holding them on high that all might see  the herald stepped forward and examined them  without doubt he said slowly they are those of the lord of cattrina moreover he added five years ago i limned yonder swan upon this very shield with my own hand i did it as a favour to cattrina there who said that he would trust the task to none but an artist  now the silence grew intense so much so that the rustle of a ladys dress sounded loud in the great hall  what say you now my lord of cattrina asked the doge  i say that there is some mistake illustrious even if there were none he added slowly for their own good and lawful purposes knights have changed armour before today  there is no mistake cried hugh in a ringing voice this signor of so many names is a signor of many coats also which he can change to save his skin he wore that of sir pierre de la roche to protect himself from the vengeance of the king of england and of the english squire whom he had wronged he took mercy from the hand of that squire who as he knew well would have shown him none had he guessed the truth he left the poor knight whom he had bribed to be his double to die beneath that same squires hand who thought him named de noyon therefore the blood of this de la roche is on his head yet these are small matters of private conduct and one that is greater overtops them this false lord as sir edmund acour swore fealty to edward of england yet while he was bound by that sacred oath he plotted to depose edward and to set up on his throne the duke of normandy  the king of england learned of that plot through me and gave me charge to kill or capture the traitor but when we came face to face in a consecrated church where i thought it sacrilege to draw sword he who had just done me bitter wrong stayed not to answer the wrong he slunk away into the darkness leaving me felled by a treacherous blow thence he fled to france and stirred up war against his liege lord under the oriflamme of king philip now that this banner is in the dust he has fled again to venice and here as i have heard broods more mischief once when after the sack of caen i sent him my challenge he returned to me an insolent answer that he did not fight with merchants sonshe who could take mercy from the hand of a merchants son  now that for deeds done a king has made me knight and now that this king under his seal and sign has named me his champion in your presence illustrious and in that of all your court i challenge cattrina again to single combat to the death with lance and sword and dagger yes and i name him coward and scullion if he refuses this king edwards gage and mine and drawing the gauntlet from his left hand hugh cast it clattering to the marble floor at de noyons feet  a babel of talk broke out in the great hall and with it some vivas and clapping of hands for hugh had spoken boldly and well moreover the spectators read truth in his grey eyes a dark figure in priests robeit was that of father nicholas the secretary who had brewed red eves potionglided up to cattrina and whispered swiftly in his ear then the doge lifted his hand and there was silence  my lord of cattrina he said sir hugh de cressi speaking as the champion of our ally the king of england has challenged you to single combat à outrance what say you  i illustrious he answered in his rich voice drawling out his words like one who is weary oh of course i say that if yon brawler wishes to find a grave in fair venice which is more than he deserves i am not the man to thwart him seeing that his cutthroat king  as the ambassador of that king i protest broke in sir geoffrey it is an insult that such a word should be used before me  i accept the protest of his excellency who forgot his noble presence replied cattrina bowing back seeing that his king who is not a cutthroathere a titter of laughter went through the company though it was evident from the frown upon his face that the doge liked the jest illhas chosen to make a knight of this de cressi or so he says which will show you friends all how hard it must be to find gentlemen in england  again the company tittered though dicks grey face turned scarlet and he bit upon his pale lip until the blood ran  as you accept the challenge broke in the doge shortly cease from gibes my lord which more befit an angry womans mouth than that of one whose life is about to be put to hazard and take up the gage of his grace of england  cattrina looked round and bade a page who waited on his person obey the doges command saying  your pardon most illustrious if i do not touch that glove myself as it seems somewhat foul i think it must have served its owner in his useful labours at the dyers vat before his master made him noble  now it was hughs turn to colour but when he understood the insult grey dick could contain himself no more  ay sir cheat and traitor he said in his hissing voice the vat in which it has been dipped was that of the lifeblood of your dupe sir pierre de la roche and of many a nobler norman oh did we not stand where we do id thrust it down your false throat and with it twist out your slanderous tongue  peace peace cried the doge while those present who understood english translated dicks wild words to their neighbours and cattrina laughed mockingly at the success of his sneer have i not said that such words are unseemly ah i thought it well my lord you have brought it on yourself  for while he spoke the page a mincing young man tied up with bows and ribbon like a woman had lifted the glove holding it between his thumb and forefinger he returned it to hugh with a low mock bow being careful as he did so as all might see to tread upon dicks foot and hustle him next moment two things happened the first was that dropping his cased bow grey dick seized that young in his iron grip and hurled him into the air so that he fell heavily on the marble floor and lay there stunned the blood running from his nose and mouth the second was that seizing his gauntlet hugh strode to where cattrina stood and struck him with it across the face saying  let your lips kiss what your fingers are too fine to touch  with an oath cattrina drew his sword and out flashed hughs in answer as he cried  ay here and now if you will here and now  then the guard rushed in and forced them apart  is this a place for brawling cried dandolo in wrath adding yet i cannot blame the englishmen overmuch seeing that they were sore affronted as i saw with my eyes and heard with my ears be silent my lord of cattrina after your fashion you make trouble at my court andhearken allblood so hot had best be quickly cooled lest one or other of these knights should take a fever moreover the noble cattrina has but today asked my leave to ride from venice tomorrow having urgent business at avignon at the court of pope clement so i decree that this combat à outrance shall take place in our presence on the campo del marte tomorrow three hours before noon ere the sun grows too hot to all the details of the combat our heralds will attend forthwith officer take soldiers and escort the ambassador and the champion of his grace of england together with this captain of archers back to their own door set guards there and see that none molest them by word or deed under pain of fine and strait imprisonment sir geoffrey carleon your requests are granted be pleased to write it to the most puissant edward whom you serve and for this time fare you well why what is it captain ambrosio he added irritably addressing a rawboned lanternjawed giant of a man clad in the splendid uniform of the guard who stepped before his throne and saluted  most illustrious said ambrosio in bad guttural italian my mother was a swiss  then congratulations to the swiss ambrosio but what of it  very illustrious replied the captain in his hollow voice the swiss are brave and do not swallow insults that lad whom the englishman kicked or smote or tossed like a bull and he pointed to the poor page who still senseless was being carried from the hall is my youngest brother who resembles our venetian father somewhat more than i do  we see it we see it indeed are you sure that the father was and the doge checked himself the point captain we would dine  illustrious i would avenge my brother and myself on the englishman whom i will beat to a jelly said the giant i crave leave to fight him tomorrow when the lord cattrina fights his master and advancing toward grey dick he made as though he would pull his nose  what is it he wants asked grey dick staring up at the great fellow with a look in his eyes that caused ambrosio to cease flourishing his fists  the challenge was translated to him and its reason oh said dick tell him i am much obliged and that i will fight him with the bow or with the axe and dagger or with all three then we will see whether he beats me to a jelly or whether i cut him into collops who as i think needs shortening  now the captain ambrosio consulted with his friends who with much earnestness prayed him have nothing to do with arrows they pointed out that there his bulk would put him at a disadvantage especially in dealing with an english archer who had an eye like a snake and a face like that of death itself  in short one and all they recommended the battleaxe and the dagger as his most appropriate weaponssince his adversary refused swords the battleaxe with which to knock him down as he could easily do being so strong and the dagger with which to finish him  when this was explained to grey dick he assented to the proposal with a kind of unholy joy that was almost alarming to those who saw it moreover as neither of them had gauntlets to throw down or pick up he stretched out his hand to seal the bargain which incautiously enough the huge halfbreed swiss accepted  dicks grasp indeed was so firm and long that presently the giant was observed first to move uneasily secondly to begin to dance and thirdly to shout out with pain  what is the matter asked his friends  the matter is he groaned as dick let go that this son of satan has a blacksmiths vise in place of a hand and he showed his great fingers from beneath the nails of which the blood was oozing  his venetian companions of the guard looked at them then they looked at grey dick and gave him a wide berth also ambrosio said something about having offered to fight a man and not a fiend but it was too late to retract for the doge taking as was natural no share in this small matter had already left his throne  then escorted by sir geoffrey and the city guards hugh and grey dick passed through that splendid company away home to dinner dick carrying his bowcase in one hand and the sack of armour which de noyon had not thought fit to claim in the other  in the midst of dead silence they departed for now no one seemed to find either of them a fit subject for jest indeed there were some who said as they watched the pair pass the door that cattrina and the giant would do well to consult a lawyer and a priest that night    chapter xii  the man from the east  in a great cool room of his splendid venetian palace sir edmund acour seigneur of cattrina sat in consultation with the priest nicholas clearly he was ill at ease his face and his quick impatient movements showed it  you arrange badly he said in a voice quite devoid of its ordinary melodious tones everything goes wrong how is it you did not know that this accursed englishman and his deathshead were coming here what is the use of a spy who never spies man they should have been met upon the road for who can be held answerable for what brigands do or at the least i might have started for avignon two days earlier  am i omnipotent lord that i should be held able to read the minds of men in far countries and to follow their footsteps asked the aggrieved nicholas still it might have been guessed that this bulldog of a briton would hang to your heels till you kick out his brains or he pulls you down bah the sight of that archer who cannot miss always gives me a cold pain in the stomach as though an arrowpoint were working through my vitals i pity yonder poor fool of a swiss tomorrow for what chance has he against a fisheyed wizard  ten thousand curses on the swiss said acour he thrust himself into the affair and will deserve all he gets i pity myself you know i am no coward as not a few have learned before today but i have little luck against this englishman i tell you that there at crecy i went down before him like a ninepin and he spared my life my god he spared my life being a fool like all his breed and now the tale is known against me and that of the changed armour too why could not de la roche die without speaking the faithless hound whom i had fed so well so so regrets are vain de cressi is here and must be faced or i be shamed  you may be killed as well as shamed nicholas suggested unpleasantly it is certain that either you or that englishman will die tomorrow since hes set for no fancy tilting with waving of ladies kerchiefs and tinsel crowns of victory and so forth merchant bred or not he is a sturdy fighter as we all learned in france moreover his heart is full with wrong and the man whose quarrel is just is always to be feared  a pest on you snarled cattrina have you the evil eye that you then croak disaster in my ears look you priest i must come through this game unharmed death is a companion i do not seek just yet who have too much to live forpower and wealth and high renown if my plans succeed and as you should know they are well laid moreover there is that english girl red eve my wife from whose sweet side you made me flee i tell you nicholas i burn for her and had rather taste her hate than the love of any other woman on the earth now too the pope has summoned me to avignon and her also to lay our causes before him being bold mayhap she will come for his holiness has sent her safeconduct under his own hand nor has he mentionedfor i saw a copy of the briefthat the same business will take me to avignon about this time well if she comes she will not go away again alone the french roads are too rough for ladies to travel unescorted and if she does not come at least our marriage will be declared valid and ill take her when and where i can and her wealth with her which will be useful  only then lord you must not die nor even be wounded tomorrow it is the englishman who should die for whatever the pope may decree i think that while de cressi lives the slumbrous eyes of that eve of yours will find a way to charm you to a sleep that has no wakening she is not a fairhaired toy that weeps forgets and at last grows happy in her babe shes a woman to make men or break them oh when her sense came back to her for a flash she looked me cold yonder in that english chapel and it seemed to me that gods curse was in her stare  youve caught the terror nicholas like so many just now in venice why today ive not met a man or woman who is not afraid of something they know not whatsave the englishman and his deathshead i think tis the unwholesome air of this strange season and all the signs and omens we hear of on every side that conjure vapours to the brain  yes ive the terror said nicholas with something like a groan every sin i ever didand most of them have been for you lordseems to haunt my sleep yes and to walk with me when i wake preaching woe at me with fiery tongues that repentance or absolution cannot quench or still  yet nicholas i think that you must add one more to their count or a share of it which should weigh light among so many either i or de cressi must pack for our last journey and if we meet face to face tomorrow how know i that it will be de cressi better far that we should not meet  lord lord you cannot fly he is king edwards champion so proclaimed before all whose names are written in the golden book of venice he would cry your shame in every court and so would they theres not a knight in europe but would spit upon you as a dastard or a common wench but would turn you her back you cannot fly  nay fool but he can dieand before tomorrow what makes your brain so dull nicholas it is not its wont  ah i seenot flight murder i had forgotten it is not a usual sauce to a banquet of honour even in italy and therefore perhaps the safer to serve but how is it to be done poison he is in carleons house carleon has faithful servants though perhaps a basket of rare fruitsbut then he might not eat them those englishmen live mostly on halfraw meat the signora would probably eat them and the others  nay no more of your drugs your skill in them is too well known come these men have been watched since they set foot in venice have they offended none besides myself and the swiss  a look of intelligence crept into the eyes of nicholas  now that you mention it lord they have there is a certain boatman and bravo called giuseppe with him and his mates they quarrelled about their fare and threw them into the canal in front of the ambassadors house just because they drew a knife or two a woman i know told me of it hes a great villain this giuseppe who would do anything for ten pieces also revengeful and a hater of cold water  send for him nicholas or send this woman to himthat may be safer ten pieces ill pay him fifty  ay lord but the englishman may not give him a chance only fools would go out walking in venice along after dark if they should happen to have enemies here and the house is watched by the doges guards yet one can try fortune loves the brave and englishmen are very great fools they might stroll abroad to see the moon rise over the adriatic  try nicholas try as you never tried before succeed too lest you and i should part company and you never be named abbot after all    the afternoon of the day of their reception by the doge was well filled for hugh and dick scarcely had they eaten with their host when the marshal and his officers arrived with the articles of the morrows combat very fully drawn up each of which must be considered with the help of sir geoffrey carleon lest they should hide some trick before they confirmed them with their signatures not that hugh was overanxious about the details as he said to sir geoffrey all he sought was to come face to face with his enemy even if he had but a club for a weapon  at length these articles were signed and the marshal departed with his fee for they must be paid for as though they were a legal document next hugh must try various horses from sir geoffreys stable and choose one of them as his war steed for the morrow since the beast he had ridden to venice was in no condition to bear a fullarmed knight in the end he selected a grey gelding quiet of temperament and rather heavy of build which it was reported had been used by its former owner in several tournaments and there borne itself handsomely this done well or ill his armour must be seen to and dicks also such as it was his lance tested and all their other weapons sharpened on a whetstone that sir geoffrey borrowed for this was a task that grey dick would leave to no other hand  at length all was prepared as well as possible in such haste and they went to supper with lady carleon who now she understood that they were to fight for their lives on the morrow was more mournful even than she had been on the previous night when at last she asked what they desired as to their funerals and if they had any tokens to be sent to friends in england hugh whose thoughts were already sad enough could bear no more of it so he rose saying that he would seek sir geoffrey who was already in his cabinet engaged upon a letter to king edward descriptive of these events and other business but when they were out of the room he said that he must have fresh air or he would faint which was not strange seeing that heat prevailed on this night in venice of an intensity unknown there at this season of the year  whither shall we go asked dick mopping his brow guards stand at the door and i doubt will not let us pass  i wish to see the place where we are to fight tomorrow answered hugh so as to form my judgment of it if only we may come there  at this moment an english lad of sir geoffreys household chanced to pass by having come to ask as to the feeding of the horse which hugh should ride dick caught him by the arm and asked whether he could get them out of the house secretly so that the guards would not see them and conduct them to the spot called the place of arms where they understood they were to fight  the lad whose name was david day replied somewhat doubtfully that he could do so by a back door near the kitchen and guide them also but that they must protect him from the anger of sir geoffrey this hugh promised to do so presently they started carrying their weapons but wearing no mail because of the intense heat although dick reminded his master how they had been told that they should not venture forth without body armour  i have a sword and you have bow and axe answered hugh so well risk it in leatherlined mail we should surely melt  so they put on some light cloaks made of black silk with hoods to them such as the venetians wore at their masques for david knew where these were to be found slipping out quite unobserved by the kitchen door into a little courtyard they passed into an unlighted back street through a postern gate whereof the lad had the key at the end of the street they came to a canal where david who talked italian perfectly hailed a boat into which they entered without exciting remark for this sharp youth pointed to their cloaks and told the boatman that they were gallants engaged upon some amorous adventure  on they rowed down the silent lanes of water through the slumbrous city of palaces turning here turning there till soon they lost all knowledge of the direction in which they headed at length david whispered to them that they drew near the place where they must land everybody seemed to speak in a whisper that heavy night even the folk generally so light of heart and quick of tongue who sat on the steps or beneath the porticoes of their houses gasping for air and the passersby on the rivas or footwalks that bordered the canals at a sign from david the boat turned inward and grated against the steps of a marble quay he paid the boatman who seemed to have no energy left to dispute the fare telling him in the same low voice that if he cared to wait he might perhaps row them back within an hour or so then they climbed steps and entered a narrow street where there was no canal on either side of which stood tall houses or dark frowning gateways  just as they stepped into the shadow of this street they heard the prow of another boat grate against the marble steps behind them and caught the faint sound of talk apparently between their rower and others in the second boat  forward sir hugh said day a little nervously this part of venice has no good name for many wicked deeds are done here but soon we shall be through it  so they stepped out briskly and when they were about halfway down the street heard other steps behind them they turned and looked back through the gloom whereon the sound of the following steps died away they pushed on again and so unless the echo deceived them did those quick stealthy steps then as though by common consent though no one gave the word they broke into a run and gained the end of the street which they now saw led into a large open space lit by the light of the great moon that broke suddenly through the veil of cloud or mist again as though by common consent they wheeled round hugh drawing his sword and perceived emerging from the street six or seven cloaked fellows who on catching sight of the flash of steel halted and melted back into the gloom  who follow us so fast asked hugh  thieves i think answered david even more nervously than before adding but if so we are safe from them here  yes sure enough said grey dick for i can shoot by moonlight and drawing the black bow from its case which he threw to the lad to carry he strung it after which they saw no more of their pursuers  having waited a while they began to examine the spot where they found themselves which day told them was that place of arms where they must fight on the morrow it was large and level having been used as a drilling ground for generations perhaps it measured four hundred yards square and almost in the centre of it rose a stand of painted timber roofed with canvas and ornamented with gilded flagstaffs from which hung banners on this stand david said the doge and nobles would take their seats to see the fray for in front of it the charging knights must meet  they walked up and down the course taking note of everything and especially of how the sun would shine upon them and the foothold of the soil which appeared to be formed of fine trodden sand  i ask no better ground to fight on said hugh at length though it is strange to think he added with a sigh that here within a dozen hours or so two men must bid the world farewell  ay answered dick who alone seemed untouched by the melancholy of that night here will die the knave with three names and the big fool of a halfbred swiss and descend to greet their ancestors in a place that is even hotter than this venice with but a sorry tale to tell them by st george i wish it were nine of the clock tomorrow  brag not dick said hugh with a sad smile for war is an uncertain game and who knows which of us will be talking with his ancestors and praying the mercy of his maker by this time tomorrow night  then having learned all they could they walked across the ground to the quay that bordered it on the seaward side here as they guessed from the stone pillars to which ships were made fast was one of the harbours of venice although as it happened none lay at that quay this night yet as they looked they saw one coming in watched curiously by groups of men gathered on the wall  never knew i vessel make harbour in such a fashion exclaimed dick presently see she sails stern first  hugh studied her and saw that she was a great decked galley of many oars such as the venetians used in trading to the east highbowed and pooped but the strange thing was that none worked these oars which although they were lashed swung to and fro aimlessly some yet whole and some with their blades broken off and their shafts bundles of jagged splinters certain sails were still set on the ships mast in tatters for the most part though a few remained sound and it was by these that she moved for with the moonrise a faint wind had sprung up lastly she showed no light at peak or poop and no sound of officers command or of boatswains whistle came from her deck only slowly and yet as though of set purpose she drifted in toward the quay  those who watched her sailors such as ever linger about harbours seeking their bread from the waters though among these were mingled people from the town who had come to this open place to escape the heat began to talk together affrightedly but always in the dread whisper that was the voice of this fearful knight yes even the hoarsethroated sailormen whispered like a dying woman  shes no ship said one shes the wraith of a ship when i was a lad i saw such a craft in the indian seas and afterward we foundered and i and the cooks mate alone were saved  pshaw answered another shes a ship right enough look at the weed and barnacles on her sides when she heaves only where in christs name are her crew  yes said a third and how could she win through all the secret channels without a pilot  what use would be a pilot said a fourth if there are none to work the rudder and shift the sails do i not know who am of the trade  at least she is coming straight to the quay exclaimed a fifth though what sends her satan alone knows for the tide is slack and this wind would scarce move a sponge boat stand by with the hawser or shell swing round and stave herself against the pier  so they talked and all the while the great galley drifted onward with a slow majestic motion her decks hid in shadow for a sail cut off the light of the low moon from them presently too even this was gone for the veil of cloud crept again over the moons face obscuring everything  then of a sudden a meteor blazed out in the sky such a meteor as no living man had ever seen in venice for the size of it was that of the sun it seemed to rise out of the ocean to the east and to travel very slowly across the whole arc of the firmament till at last it burst with a terrible noise over the city and vanished while it shone the light it gave was that of midday only pale blue in colour turning all it touched to a livid and unnatural white  it showed the placid sea and fish leaping on its silver face halfamile or more away it showed the distant land with every rock and house and bush it showed the wharf and the watchers on it among them hugh noted a man embracing his sweetheart as he thought under cover of the cloud but most of all it showed that galley down to her last rope and even the lines of caulking on her deck oh and now they saw the rowers for they lay in heaps about the oars some of them even hung over these limply moving to and fro as they swung while others were stretched upon the benches as though they slept they were deadall dead the wind following the meteor and blowing straight on shore told them that they were certainly all dead three hundred men and more upon that great ship and all dead  nay not all for now on the high poop stood a single figure who seemed to wear a strange red headdress and about his shoulders a black robe straight and silent he stood a very fearful figure and in his hand a coil of rope the sight of him sent those watchers mad they ceased from their whisperings they raved aloud  it is satan they shouted satan who comes to drag the folk of venice down to hell kill him ere he lands kill him  even grey dick went mad like a dog when he meets a ghost his pale hair rose upon his head his cold quiet eyes started he set an arrow on the string of the black bow drew it to his ear and loosed at the figure on the poop but that arrow never left the string it shattered to flinders where it was and fell tinkling to the marble floor only the barb of it turned and wounded grey dick in the chin yes and stuck there for a while for his right arm was numbed so that he could not lift his hand to pull it forth  truly i have shot at the fiend and hit that at which i did not aim muttered grey dick and sat himself down on a post of the quay to consider the matter only as it seemed to him he who stood on the poop of the ship not ten yards away smiled a little  unheeding of the clamour this man upon the poop suddenly lifted the coil of rope and threw it shoreward it was a thick and heavy rope with a noose at its end so heavy that none would have believed that one mortal could handle it yet it shot from him till it stood out stiff as an iron bar yes and the noose fell over one of the stone posts on the quay and caught there now the rope grew straighter still stretching and groaning like a thing in pain as it took the weight of the great drifting ship she stayed she swung round slowly and ranged herself broadside on against the quay as a berthed ship does then down the ladder on her side came the man deliberately he set his whitesandalled feet upon the quay advanced a few paces into the full light of the bright moon and stood still as though to suffer himself to be seen of every eye  truly he was worth the seeing hugh noted his garments first and particularly the headdress which caught his glance and held it for never had he known such a one before it was a cap fitting tight to the skull only running across the crown of it was a stiff raised ridge of leather perhaps jagged and pointed something like the comb of a cock this comb of brilliant red was surmounted at its highest point by a ball of black of the size of a small apple the cap itself was yellow except its lowest band which stood out from it and was also black in the centre of this band upon the forehead glowed a stone like a ruby  such was the headdress the broad shoulders beneath were covered with a cape of long and glossy fur blacker than coal on to either shoulder of which drooped earrings made of rings of green stone which afterward hugh came to know was jade the cape of fur which hung down to the knees and was set over a kind of surplice of yellow silk was open in front revealing its wearers naked bosom that was clothed only with row upon row of round gems of the size of a hazel nut these like the fur were black but shone with a strange and lustrous sheen the mans thick arms were naked but on his hands he wore white leather gloves made without division like a sock as though to match the white sandals on his feet  this was the mans attire now for him who wore it he was tall but not taller than are many other men he was broad but not broader than many other men and yet he looked stronger than all the men in the world on his brow which was prominent smooth black hair parted in the middle was plastered back as that of women sometimes is making hard lines against the yellow skin below he had very thin eyebrows that ran upward on either side of a bowshaped wrinkle in the centre of his forehead the eyes beneath were small and palepaler even than those of grey dickyet their glance was like the points of thrusting swords with those little eyes alone he seemed to smile for the rest of his countenance did not move the nose was long and broad at the end with wide spreading nostrils and a deep furrow on either side the mouth was thinlipped and turned downward at the corners and the chin was like a piece of iron quite hairless and lean as that of a man long dead  there he stood like some wild vision of a dream smiling with those small unblinking eyes that seemed to take in all present one by one there he stood in the moonlit silence for the mob was quiet enough now for a little while that yet was not silence because of a soughing noise which seemed to proceed from the air about his head  then suddenly the tumult broke out again with its cries of kill the devil tear the wizard to pieces death is behind him he brings death kill kill kill  a score of knives flashed in the air only this time grey dick set no arrow on his string their holders ran forward then the man lifted his hand in which was no weapon and they stopped  now he spoke in a low voice so cold that to hughs excited fancy the words seemed to tinkle like falling ice as one by one they came from his lips he spoke in italianperfect italian of veniceand young day whose teeth where chattering with fear translated his words  is this your welcome to a stranger he said the companions of whose voyage have unhappily met with misfortune here with a faint motion of his fingerless glove he indicated the dead who lay all about the decks of that fatal ship would you men of venice kill a poor unarmed stranger who has travelled to visit you from the farthest east and seen much sorrow on his way  ay we would sorcerer shouted one our brothers were in that ship which we know and you have murdered them  how did you learn italian in the farthest east asked another  then for the second time like hounds closing in on a stag at bay they sprang toward him with their poised knives  again he lifted his hand again the semicircle halted as though it must and again he spoke  are there none here who will befriend a stranger in a strange land none who are ashamed to see a poor unarmed stranger from the east done to death by these wolves who call themselves children of the white christ of mercy  now hugh touched dick upon the shoulder  rise and come he said it is our fate and dick obeyed  only after he had translated the mans words david fell down flat upon the quay and lay there  they stepped to the yellowcapped man and stood on each side of him hugh drawing his sword and dick the battleaxe that he carried beneath his robe of silk  we will said hugh shortly in english  now there are three of us went on the man the stranger from the east has found defenders from the west on defenders for i do not fight thus and he folded his arms across his broad breast and smiled with the awful eyes  hugh and dick knew no italian yet they both of them understood and with a shout leaped forward toward those hungry knives but their holders never waited for them some sudden panic seized them all so that they turned and ranran straight across the wide place of arms and vanished into the network of narrow streets by which it was surrounded    chapter xiii  murghs arrow  hugh and dick came back something seemed to call them back although no blow had been struck the man stood where they had left him staring at nothing in particular apparently he was engaged in meditation  thanking his gods because they have saved him from sudden death muttered grey dick if hes got any gods he added doubtfully  now the three or rather the four of them for david day had recovered and once more stood upon his feet from time to time glancing at the strangers costume with a frightened eye were left alone upon the great place with no company save the shipful of dead behind them and the wild white moon above the silence that save for the soughing sound for which they could not account was intense oppressed them as also did the heat  grey dick coughed but the man took no notice then he dropped his axe with a clatter on the marble flooring of the quay and picked it up again but still the man took no notice evidently his eastern imperturbability was not to be disturbed by such trifles what was worse or so thought dick his master hugh had fallen into a very similar mood he stood there staring at the man while the man stared over or through himat nothing in particular  grey dick felt aggrieved an arrow had burst to pieces unaccountably in his bow numbing his arm and wounding him on the chin and now he was outpaced at his own game of cold silence he grew angry and dug david in the ribs with his elbow  tell that foreigner he said that my master and i have saved his life those italian cutthroats have run away and if he is a gentleman he should say thank you  david hesitated whereon dick gave him another dig harder than the first and asked if he heard what he said then david obeyed addressing the man as most illustrious as though he were the doge and ending his speech with a humble apology in case he should have interrupted his pious thanksgiving  the man seemed to awake taking no notice of day he addressed himself to dick speaking in english and using just that dialect of it to which he dick had been accustomed from his childhood in the neighbourhood of dunwich not even the familiar suffolk whine was forgotten  you and your master have saved my life have you he said well neighbour why did you try to save my life by shooting at me with that great black bow of yours which i see is made of eastern woods he stared at the case in which it was now again hidden as though tanned leather were no obstacle to his sight then went on do not answer i will tell you why you shot at me because you were afraid of me and fear is ever cruel is it not only something happened to your arrow something that has never happened to any arrow of yours before oh yes you have saved me from the italian cutthroats and being a gentleman i thank you very much only why did the arrow burst in your bow and he smiled with those dreadful eyes of his  now feeling overwhelmed for the second time that night grey dick sat himself down upon a quay post it was clear to him that to argue with this person in a yellow cap who talked suffolk so well was quite useless why then waste breath which was probably his last  everybody seemed to be falling into meditation again when the man shifting his head slowly began to consider hugh  what is your name and which is your country o my second saviour he asked still speaking in english only now the english was of a different and more refined sort to that which he had used when he addressed dick such english for instance as came from the lips of sir geoffrey carleon or from those of the lords of edwards court  i am sir hugh de cressi of dunwich in the county of suffolk in england answered hugh slowly  england i have heard of england and dunwich i have heard of dunwich indeed i travel thither having an appointment with an old friend in that town  now a light came into hughs bewildered face but he said nothing  i seem to have touched some chord of recollection in your mind o my saviour of dunwich said the man look at me and tell me who am i  hugh looked and shook his head  i never saw you before nor any one at all like you he answered  no no you never saw me though i have been very near to you once or twice yet your pardon look again  hugh obeyed and this time for a second only perceived that the mans head was surrounded by a multitude of doves two endless lines of doves one line black and the other line white stretched from his right shoulder and from his left shoulder till miles away they melted into the lofty gloom of the sky that was full of the soughing sound of their wings  now he knew and for the first time in his life fell upon his knees to a man or to what bore the semblance of man  you are named murgh gate of the gods he said murgh whom old sir andrew saw in that courtyard over which the iron dragons watch in the country called cathay that courtyard with the pool of water and the many doors  ay answered the man in a new voice a great voice that seemed to fill the air like the mutter of distant thunder i am murgh gateway of the gods and since you have striven to defend murgh he who is the friend of all men although they know it not will above all be your friend and the friend of those you love  he stretched out his long arms and laid his whitegloved hands for an instant one of them upon hughs head and one on the shoulder of grey dick who sat upon the pillar of stone  hugh muttered i thank you not knowing what else to say but in his heart he wondered what kind of friendship this mighty and awful being would show to him and his perhaps he might hold that the truest kindness would be to remove him and them from the miseries of a sinful world  if murgh read his thoughts he only answered them with that smile of his cold eyes which was more awful than the frown of any mortal man turning his head slowly he began to contemplate dick sitting on his stone  if i had a son he said by that face of yours you might be he  perchance answered dick since i never knew for certain who my father was only i have always heard that life begets not death  death you honour me with a great name well life and death are one and you and i are one with the moon and the stars above us and many other things and beings that you cannot see therefore the begetter and the begotten are one in the hand that holds them all  ay answered dick and so my bow and i are one ive often thought it only you nearly made me one with my own arrow which is closer kinship than i seek and he touched the cut upon his chin since you are so wise my father or my son tell me what is this hand that holds them all  gladly only if i do first i must ask you to die thensay in a minute or twoyou shall know  dick peered at him doubtfully and said  if that be so i think ill wait for the answer which i am sure to learn soon or late  ah many men have thought the same and you have sent some to seek it have you not being so good an archer for instance that was a long shaft you shot before crecy fray at the filthy fool who mocked your english host doubtless now he knows the answer to your riddle  who told you of that asked dick springing up  a friend of mine who was in the battle he said also that your name was richard the archer  a friend i believe that you were there yourself as if you are death you may well have been  perhaps you are right richard have i not just told you that we all are one yes even the slayer and the slain therefore if my frienddid you call him deathwas there i was there if you were there i was there and it was my hand that drew yonder great black bow of yours and my eye that guided the straight shaft which laid the foulmouthed jester low why did you not say as much yourself when your master here bade farewell to his father in the ship at calais what were the words oh i remember them you wondered how one i may not name and he bowed his solemn head came to make that black bow and yours and you the death that draw it  now at length grey dicks courage gave out  of no man upon earth am i afraid he said but from you o god or devil who read the secret hearts of men and hear their secret words my blood flows backward as it did when first my eyes fell on you you would kill me because i dared to shoot at you well kill but do not torture it is unworthy of a knight even if he took his accolade in hell and he placed his hands before his eyes and stood before him with bent head waiting for the end  why give me such high names richard the fatherless when you have heard two humbler ones call me murgh as do my friends or call me the gate as do those who as yet know me less well but talk not of gods or devils lest suddenly one of them should answer you nay man have no fear those who seek death he often flees as i think he flees from you tonight yet let us see if we cannot send a longer shaft you and i than that which we loosed on crecy field give me the bow  dick although he had never suffered living man to shoot with it before handed him the black bow and with it a war shaft which he drew from his quiver  tell me archer dick have you any enemy in this town of venice because if so we might try a shot at him  one or two gate murgh answered dick still whatever your half of me may do my bit of you does not love to strike down men by magic in the dark  well said and better thought then bethink you of something that belongs to an enemy which will serve as well for a test of shooting ah i thank you well thought again yes i see the mark though tis far is it not now set your mind on it but stay first will you know this arrow again  surely answered dick i made it myself moreover though two of the feathers are black the third is white with four black spots and a little splash of brown look on it sir hugh it cannot be mistook  hugh looked and nodded speak he could not for the life of him  then murgh began to play a little with the bow and oh strange and dreadful was the music that came from its string beneath the touch of his gloved fingers it sang like a harp and wailed like a woman so fearfully indeed that the lad day who all this while stood by aghast stopped his ears with his fingers and hugh groaned then this awful archer swiftly set the arrow on the string  now think with your mind and shoot with your heart he said in his cold voice and so saying drew and loosed as though at a hazard  out toward venice leaped the shaft with a rushing sound like to that of wings and as it seemed to the watchers light went with it for it travelled like a beam of light far over the city it travelled describing a mighty arc such as no arrow ever flew before then sank down and vanished behind some palace tower  a very good bow said the shooter as he handed it back to dick never have i used a better who have used thousands made of many a substance indeed i think that i remember it did you chance to find it years ago by the seashore yes well it was a gift of mine to a famous archer who died upon a ship nay it is not strained i can judge of the breaking strength of a bow whether or no i can judge of the flight of an arrow you will learn hereafter but that this one flew fast and far cannot be doubted sincedid you watchers note itits speed made it shine like fire this is caused by the rubbing of the air when aught travels through it very quickly this night you have seen a meteor glow in the same fashion only because the air fretted it in its passage in the east whence i come we produce fire just so and now let us be going for i have much to do tonight and would look upon this fair venice ere i sleep ill lead the way having seen a map of the town which a traveller brought to the east i studied it and now it comes back to my mind stay let that youth give me his garment and he pointed to david day who wore a silk cloak like the others since my foreign dress might excite remark as it did but now  in a moment day had stripped himself of his light silkhooded gown and in another moment it was on the person of murgh though how it got there when they came to think of it afterward none could remember still the yellow and red headdress the coalblack silky furs the yellow skirt the gleaming pearls all vanished beneath it nothing remained visible except the white fingerless gloveswhy were they fingerless and what lay beneath them hugh wonderedand the white shoes  forward they went across the place of arms past the timber stand ornamented with banners which murgh stayed to contemplate for an instant until they came to the mouth of the street up which men had followed them apparently with evil intent  sir murgh said hugh stepping forward you had best let me and my companion grey dick walk first down this place lest you should come to harm when we passed it a while ago we thought that we heard robbers behind us and in venice as we are told such men use knives  thank you for your warning sir hugh and even beneath the shadow of the silk hood hugh thought that he saw his eyes smile and seeing remembered all the folly of such talk  yet ill risk these robbers do you two and the lad keep behind me he added in a sterner voice  so they advanced down the narrow street the man called murgh going first hugh grey dick and the lad following meekly behind him as they entered its shadows a low whistle sounded but nothing happened for a while when they had traversed about half its length however men five or six of them in all darted out of the gloom of a gateway and rushed at them the faint light showed that they were masked and gleamed upon the blue steel of the daggers in their hands two of these men struck at murgh with their knives while the others tried to pass him doubtless to attack his companions but failed why they failed hugh and dick never knew all they saw was that murgh stretched out his whitegloved hands and they fell back  the men who had struck at him fell back also their daggers dropping to the ground and fled away followed by their companions all except one whom murgh had seized hugh noted that he was a tall thin fellow and that unlike the rest he had drawn no weapon although it was at his signal that the other bravoes had rushed on this man murgh seemed to hold with one hand while with the other he ripped the mask off his face turning him so that the light shone on him  hugh and dick saw the face and knew it for that of the priest who had accompanied acour to england it was he who had drugged red eve and read the mass of marriage over her while she was drugged  who are you asked murgh in his light cold voice by your shaven head a priest i thinkone who serves some god of love and mercy and yet you come upon this ill errand as a captain of assassins why do you seek to do murder o priest of the god of mercy  now some power seemed to drag the answer from father nicholas  because i must he said i have sold myself and must pay the price step leads to step and he who runs may not stop upon them  no priest nicholas since ever they grow more narrow and more steep yet at the foot of them is the dark abyss and murderer nicholas you have reached the last of all your steps look at me and with one hand he threw back the hood  next instant they saw nicholas rush staggering down the street screaming with terror as he went then as all the bravoes had gone they continued their march filled with reflections till they came to the little landingstage where they had left the boat it was still there though the boatman had gone  let us borrow this boat said murgh as from my study of the map i know these waterpaths i will be steersman and that tonguetied lad shall row and tell me if i go wrong first i will take you to the house where i think you said you lodged and thence to go seek friends of my own in this city who will show me hospitality  they glided on down the long canals in utter silence that was broken only by the soft dipping of the oars the night was somewhat cooler now for the bursting of the great meteor seemed to have cleared the air or perhaps the gentle breeze that had sprung up blowing from the open sea tempered its stifling heat  so it came about that although it grew late many people were gathered on the rivas or on the balconies of the fine houses which they passed for the most part doubtless discussing the travelling star that had been seen in the sky or perhaps they had already heard rumours of the strange visitor who had come to venice although however fast such news may fly this seemed scarcely probable at the least there they were men and women talking earnestly together and about them the three englishmen noted a strange thing  as their boat slipped by some influence seemed to pass from it to the minds of all these people their talk died out and was succeeded by a morne and heavy silence they looked at it as though wondering why a sight so usual should draw their eyes then after a few irresolute moments the groups on the footpaths separated and went their ways without bidding each other good night as they went many of them made the sign with their fingers that these italians believed could avert evil which gave them the appearance of all pointing at the boat or its occupants those in the balconies did the same thing and disappeared through the open windowplaces  more than any of the wonderful things that he had done perhaps this effect of the eastern strangers presence struck terror and foreboding to hughs heart  at length they came to the end of that little street where they had hired the boat for although none had told him the way thither their dread steersman brought them without fault the lad david laid down his oars and mounted the steps that led to the street which was quite deserted even the bordering houses being in darkness  hugh de cressi and richard the fatherless said murgh you have seen wonderful things this night and made a strange friend as you may think by chance although truly in all the wide universe there is no room for such a thing as chance now my counsel to you and your companion is that you speak no word of these matters lest you should be set upon as wizards we part but we shall meet again twice more and after many years a third time but that third meeting do not seek for it will be when the last grains of sand are running from the glass also you may see me at other times but if so unless i speak to you do not speak to me now go your ways fearing nothing however great may seem your peril i say to youfear nothing soon you will hear ill things spoken of me yetand here a touch of human wistfulness came into his inhuman voicei pray you believe them not when i am named murgh the fiend and murgh the sword then think of me as murgh the helper what i do is decreed by that which is greater than i and if you could understand it leads by terrible ways to a goal of good as all things do richard the archer i will answer the riddle that you asked yourself upon the ship at calais the strength which made your black bow an instrument of doom made you who loose its shafts and me who can outshoot you far as the arrow travels whither it is sent and there does its appointed work so do you travel and so do i and many another thing seen and unseen and therefore i told you truly that although we differ in degree yet we are one yes even murgh the eating fire murgh the gate and that bent wand of yours are one in the hand that shaped and holds us both  then divesting himself of the long robe which he had borrowed from the lad he handed it to hugh and taking the oars rowed away clad in his rich fantastic garb which now as at first could be seen by all he rowed away and for a while the three whom he had left behind heard the soughing of the innumerable wings that went ever with him after which came silence  silence but not for long for presently from the borders of the great canal into which his skiff must enter rose shouts of fear and rage near by at first then farther and farther off till these too were lost in silence  oh sir hugh sobbed poor david day who and what is that dreadful man  i think his name is death answered hugh solemnly while dick nodded his head but said nothing  then we must die went on david in his terror and i am not fit to die  i think not said hugh again be comforted death has passed us by only be warned also and as he bade you say nothing of all that you have heard and seen  by death himself ill say nothing for my lifes sake he replied faintly for he was shaking in every limb  then they walked up the street to the yard door as they went hugh asked dick what it was that he had in his mind as a mark for the arrow that murgh had shot that arrow which to his charmed sight had seemed to rush over venice like a flake of fire  ill not tell you master answered dick lest you should think me madder than i am which tonight would be very mad indeed stay though ill tell david here that he may be a witness to my folly and he called the young man to him and spoke with him apart  then they unlocked the courtyard gate and entered the house by the kitchen door as it chanced quite unobserved for now all the servants were abed indeed of that household none ever knew that they had been outside its walls this night since no one saw them go or return and sir geoffrey and his lady thought that they had retired to their chamber  they came to the door of their room david still with them for the place where he slept was at the end of this same passage  bide here a while said dick to him my master and i may have a word to say to you presently  then they lit tapers from a little roman lamp that burned all night in the passage and entered the room dick walked at once to the windowplace looked and laughed a little  the arrow has missed he said or rather he added doubtfully the target is gone  what target asked hugh wearily for now he desired sleep more than he had ever done in all his life then he turned the taper in his hand and started back suddenly pointing to something which hung upon his bedpost that stood opposite to the window  who nails his helm upon my bed he said is this a challenge from some knight of venice  dick stepped forward and looked  an omen not a challenge i think come and see for yourself he said  this is what hugh saw fixed to the post by a shaft which pierced it and the carved olivewood from side to side was the helm that they had stripped from the body of sir pierre de la roche the helm of sir edmund acour which sir pierre had worn at crecy and dick had tumbled out of his sack in the presence of the doge before cattrinas face on his return to the house of sir geoffrey carleon he had set it down in the centre of the open windowplace and left it there when they went out to survey the ground where they must fight upon the morrow  having studied it for a moment dick went to the door and called to david  friend he said standing between him and the bed so that he could see nothing what was it that just now i told you was in my mind when yonder murgh asked me at what target he should shoot with my bow on the place of arms  a knights helm answered david which stood in the window of your room at the ambassadors housea knights helmet that had a swan for its crest  you hear said dick to hugh now come both of you and see what is that which hangs upon the bedpost answer you david for perchance my sight is bewitched  a knights helm answered david bearing the crest of a floating swan and held there by an arrow which has pierced it through  what was the arrow like which i gave this night to one murgh master asked dick again  it was a war shaft having two black feathers and the third white but chequered with four black spots and a smear of brown answered hugh  then is that the same arrow master which this murgh loosed from more than a mile away  hugh examined it with care thrice he examined it point and shaft and feathers then in a low voice he answered  yes    chapter xiv  at the place of arms  notwithstanding all that has been told hugh and dick never slept more soundly than they did that night nor was their rest broken by any dreams at half past five in the morningfor they must be stirring earlydavid came to call them he too it seemed had slept well also in the light of day the worst of his fear had left him  i am wondering sir hugh he said looking at him curiously whether i saw certain things last night down yonder at the place of arms and in the boat or whether i thought i saw them  doubtless you thought you saw them david answered hugh adding with meaning and it is not always well to talk of things we think that we have seen  the lad who was sharp enough nodded but as he turned to hand hugh some garment his eye fell upon the swancrested helm that was still nailed by the long warshaft with two black feathers and one white to the carved olivewood post of the bed  it must have been a mighty arm that shot this arrow sir hugh he said reflectively which could pierce a casque of milan steel from side to side and a hardwood post beyond well for the owner of the helm that his head was not inside of it  very well and a very mighty arm david so mighty that i should say nothing about it for fear lest it should set another arrow upon another string and shoot again  gods truth not i exclaimed david and for your comfort sir know that none saw us leave this house or reënter it last night  then hugh and dick clothed themselves and saw to their weapons and mail but this they did not don as yet fearing lest the weight of it should weary them in that great heat although the day was so young this heat was terrible more oppressive indeed than any they had yet known in venice  when they were ready david left them to see to the horse which de cressi would ride in his combat with cattrina hugh as became a godfearing knight whom sir andrew arnold had instructed from childhood crossed himself knelt down and said his prayers which that morning were long and earnest indeed he would have confessed himself also if he could only there was no priest at hand who knew his language sir geoffreys chaplain being away after watching him a while even grey dick whose prayers were few followed his example kneeling in front of his bow as though it were an image that he worshipped when they had risen again he said  you grieve that there is none to shrive us master but i hold otherwise since when it was told what company we kept last night absolution might be lacking this would weigh on you if not on me who after what i have learned of father nicholas and others love but one priest and he far away  yet it is well to have the blessings of holy church ere such a business as ours dick that is if it can be come by  mayhap master but for my part i am content with that of murgh which he gave us you may remember or so i understood him moreover did he not teach that he and all are but ministers of him above therefore i go straight to the head of the stair and he nodded toward the sky i am content to skip all those steps which are called priests and altars and popes and saints and suchlike folk living or dead if murghs wisdom be true as i think these are but garnishings to the dish which can well be spared by the hungry soul  that may be hugh answered dubiously for his faith in such matters was that of his time yet were i you dick id not preach that philosophy too loud lest the priests and popes should have something to say to it the saints also for aught i know since i have always heard that they love not to be left out of our account with heaven  well if so answered dick ill quote st murgh to them who is a very fitting patron for an archer then once again he glanced at the helm and the arrow with something not unlike fear in his cold eye  presently they went down to the eating chamber where they had been told that breakfast would be ready for them at seven of the clock there they found sir geoffrey awaiting them  i trust that you have slept well sir hugh he said you were a wise knight to go to rest so early having before you such a trial of your strength and manhood and so to speak the honour of our king upon your hands  very well indeed thank you sir answered hugh and you  oh ill extremely ill i do not know what is the matter with me or venice either whereof the very air seems poisoned feel the heat and see the haze it is most unnatural moreover although in your bed doubtless you saw it not a great ball of fire blazed and burnt over the city last night so bright was it that even in a darkened room each of us could see the colour of the others eyes later too as i watched at the window there came a thin streak of flame that seemed to alight on or about this very house indeed i thought i heard a sound as of iron striking upon iron but could find no cause for it  wondrous happenings sir said grey dick glad am i that we were not with you lest the sight of them should have made us fearful on this morning of combat  wondrous happenings indeed friend richard said sir geoffrey excitedly but you have not heard the half of them the herald who has just been here with the final articles of your fray signed by the doge and cattrina has told me much that i can scarce believe he says that the great galley from this port which is called light of the east drifted up to the quay at the place of arms last night on her return voyage from cyprus filled with dead and with no living thing aboard her save the devil himself in a yellow robe and a manyhued headdress like a cockscomb with a red eye he swears that this fiend landed and that the mob set on him whereon two some say three other devils clad in long black gowns appeared out of the water and drove them back also it seems that this same cockscombed satan stole a boat and rowed about the city afterward but now none can find him although they have got the boat  then they should be well satisfied said hugh since its owner has lost nothing but the hire which with satan at the oars is better than might be hoped perhaps he was not there after all sir geoffrey  i know not but at least the galley light of the east is there for ever since the dawn they have been taking the dead out of her to bury them of these they say things too terrible to repeat for no doctor can tell of what sickness they died never having seen its like for my part i pray it may not be catching were i the doge i would have towed her out to sea and scuttled her cargo and all well well enough of these wild tales of which god alone knows the truth come eat if you can in this heat we must be on the place of arms by halfpast eight you and the captain go thither in my own boat sir hugh your horse david day takes on presently now while you breakfast ill explain to you these articles one by one for they are writ in italian which you cannot read see you forget them not these venetians are punctilious of such forms and ceremonies especially when the case is that of combat to the death which is rare among them    the articles which were lengthy had been read and the breakfast or so much as they could eat of it consumed at last hugh accompanied by a venetian squire of high birth sent by the doge to bear his casque and other armour stood in the vestibule waiting for the ambassadors barge of state with him was grey dick accompanied by no one and carrying the mail shirt in which he was to fight like a housewifes parcel beneath his arm although he wore bow on back axe and dagger at side and iron cap upon his head  presently while they lingered thus out from a sidedoor appeared lady carleon clothed in a white garment such as women wear when their dressing is half done down which her grey hair hung dishevelled  i am come thus unkempt sir hugh she said for not feeling well i could not rise early to bid you goodbye since i am sure that we shall not meet again however much that blackbrowed doge may press it i cannot go down yonder to see my countrymen butchered in this heat oh oh and she pressed her hand upon her heart  whats the matter madam asked hugh anxiously  a pain in my breast that is all as though some one drove a dagger through me there there tis gone  i thank you for your goodness lady carleon said hugh when she was herself again then paused for he knew not what to add  not so sir hugh not so tis for your sakes in truth since you remember you never told me what you would wish doneafterward your possessions alsowhere are they to be sent doubtless you have money and other things of value be sure that they shall be sealed up ill see to it myself buthow shall i dispose of them  madame i will tell you when i return said hugh shortly  nay nay sir hugh pray do not return those who are gone had best keep gone i think who always have had a loathing of ghosts therefore i beg you tell me now but do not come back shining like a saint and gibbering like a monkey at dead of night because if you do i am sure i shall not understand and if there is an error who will set it straight  hugh leaned against a marble pillar in the hall and looked at his hostess helplessly while sir geoffrey catching her drift at length broke in  cease such illomened talk wife think you that it is of a kind to give brave men a stomach in a fight to the end  i know not geoffrey but surely tis better to have these matters settled for as you often say death is always near us  ay madam broke in grey dick who could bear no more of it death is always near to all of us and especially so in venice just now therefore i pray you tell mein case we should live and you should die you and all about youwhether you have any commands to give as to what should be done with your gold and articles of value or any messages to leave for friends in england  then having uttered this grim jest dick took his master by the arm and drew him through the door  afterward for a reason that shall be told he was sorry that it had ever passed his lips still in the boat sir geoffrey applauded him saying that his ladys melancholy had grown beyond all bearing and that she did little but prate to him about his will and what colour of marble he desired for his tomb  after a journey that seemed long to hugh who wished to have this business over they came to the place of arms their route there however was not the same which they had followed on the previous night leaving the short way through the low part of the town untraversed they rowed from one of the canals into the harbour itself where they were joined by many other boats which waited for them and so on to the quay hugh saw at once that the death ship light of the east was gone and incautiously said as much to sir geoffrey  yes he answered one of my rowers tells me that they have towed her to an island out at sea since the stench from her holds was more than could be borne but how did you know that she lay at this particular quay sir hugh  i thought you said so he answered carelessly adding to change the subject look our fray will not lack for spectators and he pointed to the thousands gathered upon the great tiltingground  no no all venice will be there for these people love a show especially if there be death in it  mayhap they will see more of him than they wish before all is done muttered grey dick pausing from the task of whetting his axes edge with a little stone which he carried in his pouch then he replaced the axe in its hanger and drawing hughs sword from its sheath began to give some final touches to its razor edge saying father sir andrew arnold blessed it which should be enough but milan steel is hard and his old battle blade will bite none the worse for an extra sharpening go for his throat master go for his throat the mail is always thinnest there  god above us what a grim man exclaimed sir geoffrey and so thought all in that boat and in those around them at least they looked at dick askance as he whetted and whetted and then plucking out one of the pale hairs from his head drew it along the edge of the steel which severed it in twain  there thatll do said grey dick cheerfully as he returned the long sword to its sheath and god help this cattrina i say for he comes to his last battle that is unless he runs away he added after reflection  now they landed and were received by heralds blowing trumpets and conducted through a great multitude of people with much pomp and ceremony to a pavilion which had been pitched for them where they must arm and make ready  this then they did helped or hindered by bowing squires whose language they could not understand  at length when it lacked but a quarter to the hour of nine david day led hughs horse into the wide entrance of the pavilion where they examined its armour bridle selle and trappings  the beast sweats already said hugh and so do i who to tell truth dread this heat more than cattrinas sword pray that they get to the business quickly or i shall melt like butter on a hot plate  then his lance was given to him a lance that was sharp and strong when they had been tested by them both hugh mounted the grey and at the agreed signal of a single blast upon a trumpet walked it slowly from the pavilion dick going at his side on foot  at their coming a shout went up from the assembled thousands for in truth it seemed as sir geoffrey had said as though all the folk in venice were gathered on that place when they had finished shouting the people began to criticise finding much in the appearance of this pair that moved their ready wit indeed there was little show about them for hughs plain armour which lacked all ornament or inlay was worn with war and travel and his horse came along as soberly as if it were going out to plough nor was there anything fine about the apparel of grey dick who wore a loose chain shirt much out of fashionit was that which sir andrew had given to hughan iron cap with earpieces and leather buskins on his legs in his hand was his axe heavy but not over large at his side hung a great knife and on his back was the long black bow and a quiver of arrows  thus arrayed taking no heed of the jests and chatter of the multitude they were led to the front of the bedecked timber stand which they had seen on the previous night in the centre of this stand occupying a kind of tribune sat the doge dandolo in state and with him many nobles and captains while to right and left the whole length of the course for the stand was very long were packed a countless number of the bestborn men and women in venice these however were but a tithe of the spectators who encircled the place of arms in one serried horde which was kept back by a line of soldiers  arriving in front of the doges tribune the pair halted and saluted him whereon he and his escort rose and saluted them in turn then another trumpet blew and from a second pavilion at the other end of the course appeared cattrina wearing a splendid suit of white armour damascened in gold with a silver swan upon the helm and a swan painted on his shield  very fine isnt it said grey dick to his master only this time i hope hes inside the steel ask to see his face before you fight master  on came cattrina on a noble black horse which pawed and caracoled notwithstanding the heat while after him strode a gigantic figure also clad from top to toe in white mail who fiercely brandished a longhandled battleaxe  ambrosio said dick now i ought to feel as much afraid as though that fellow wore a yellow cap and fur cape and pearls like another warrior whom we met last night yet to speak the truth i believe he has the fainter heart of the two also if he swings that chopper about so much hell grow tired  to the multitude however the gallant appearance of this pair whom they looked on as the champions of venice against foreigners appealed not a little amidst clapping of hands and evvivas they advanced to the doges tribune and there made their salutations which the illustrious acknowledged as he had those of the englishmen  then the heralds intervened and again all the articles of combat were read and translated although to these of which they were weary hugh and dick listened little next they were asked if they had any objections to make and with one voice answered none but on the same question being put to their adversaries the swiss ambrosio said that he with whom he must fight appeared to be armed with a bow which was against the articles thereon dick handed the bow and quiver to david bidding him guard them until he asked for them again as he would his own life in the event of his death however david was to give them to sir hugh or if they both should die to his own master sir geoffrey all of these things david promised to do  next followed a long discussion as to whether the four of them were to fight in pairs cattrina and ambrosio against hugh and dick simultaneously or whether ambrosio was to fight alone with dick and cattrina with hugh upon cattrina and ambrosio being asked their wishes the former said that he desired to fight alone as he feared lest the english archer if he overcame ambrosio should turn on him also or perhaps hamstring his horse  then the englishmen were asked what they wished and replied that they did not care how it was arranged being ready to fight either together or separately as the doge might decree  the end of it was that after long consultations with sundry experts in such matters the most illustrious decided that the captains ambrosio and richard the archer should first engage on foot and when that business was settled the two knights should take their place in the arena  so the end of it was that more than half an hour after the combat should have begun dick and the gigantic ambrosio found themselves standing face to face waiting for the signal to engage the swiss shouting threats and defiance and grey dick grinning and watching him out of his halfshut eyes  at length it came in the shape of a single blast upon a trumpet now seeing that dick stood quite still not even raising his axe the swiss advanced and struck a mighty blow at him which dick avoided by stepping aside recovering himself again ambrosio struck this blow dick caught upon his shield then as though he were afraid began to retreat slowly at first but afterward faster till his walk broke into a run  at this sight all that mighty audience set up a hooting coward dog pig of an englishman they yelled and the louder they yelled the more quickly did grey dick run till at last even hugh grew puzzled wondering what was in his mind and hoping that he would change it soon so the audience hooted and grey dick ran and the giant swiss lumbered along after him bellowing triumphantly and brandishing his battleaxe which it was noted never seemed to be quite long enough to reach his flying foe  when this had gone on for two or three minutes grey dick stumbled and fell the swiss who was following fast likewise tripped and fell over him heavily whereon the multitude shouted  foul play a dirty foreign trick  in an instant dick was up again and had leapt upon the prostrate swiss as all thought to kill him but instead the only thing he did was to get behind him and kick him with his foot until he also rose thereat some laughed but others who had bets upon their champion groaned  now the swiss having lost his shield in his fall rushed at dick grasping his axe with both hands as before the englishman avoided the blow but for the first time he struck back catching the giant on the shoulder though not very heavily then with a shout of st george and england he went in at him  hither and thither sprang dick now out of reach of the axe of the swiss and now beneath his guard but ever as he sprang he delivered blow upon blow each harder than the last till there appeared scars and rents in the fine white mail soon it became clear that the great swiss was overmatched and spent he breathed heavily his strokes grew wild he overbalanced recovered himself and at last in his turn began to fly in good earnest  now after him went dick battering at his back but as all might see with the flat of his axe not with its edge yes he was beating him as a man might beat a carpet beating him till he roared with pain  fight ambrosio fight dont fly shouted the crowd and he tried to wheel round only to be knocked prostrate by a single blow upon the head which the englishman delivered with the hammerlike back of his axe  then dick was seen to kneel upon him and cut the lashings of his helmet with his dagger doubtless to give the coup de grâce or so they thought  our man is murdered yelled the common people while those of the better sort remained shamed and silent  dick rose and they groaned thinking that all was done but lo stooping down he helped the breathless swiss whom he had disarmed to his feet then taking him by the nape of the neck which was easy as his helmet was off with one hand while in the other he held his bared knife dick thrust him before him till they reached the tribune of the doge  be pleased to tell the illustrious he said to sir geoffrey that this braggart having surrendered i spared his life and now return him to his brother the page quite unharmed since i did not wish to wound one who was in my power from the first only when he gets home i pray that he will look at his back in a glass and judge which of us it is that has been beaten to a pulp let him return thanks also to his patron saint who put pity in my heart so that i did not cut him into collops as i promised for know sir that when i walked out yonder it was my purpose to hew off his hands and shorten him at the knees stayone word more if yonder boaster has more brothers who really wish to fight ill take them one by one and swear to them that this time ill not give back a step unless im carried  do you indeed yield and accept the englishmans mercy asked the doge in a stern voice  the poor ambrosio making no answer blundered forward among the crowd and there vanished and this was the last that dick ever saw or heard of him but although he waited there a while feeling the edge of his axe and glaring about him none of the captains companions came forward to accept his challenge  at length with a shrug of his shoulders dick turned having taken his bow and quiver from david who could not conceal his indecent joy at the utter humiliation of ambrosio whom he hated with a truly british hate he walked slowly to where hugh sat upon his horse  the jest is done master and now for good earnest since tis your turn the saints save me such another cow hunt in this hells heat had i killed him at once i should be cooler now but it came into my mind to let the hound live indeed to speak truth i thought that i heard the voice of murgh behind me saying spare and knew that i must obey  i hope he will say nothing of the sort to me presently answered hugh if he is here which i doubt why what is it now those goldcoated marshals are talking again  talking they were evidently at the instance of cattrina or his counsellors who had raised some new objections which sir geoffrey stepped forward to explain to them but hugh would not even hear him out  tell the man and all whom it may concern he said in an angry voice that i am ready to fight him as he will on horse or on foot with lance or sword or axe or dagger or any or all of them in mail or without it or if it pleases him stripped to the shirt only let him settle swiftly since unless the sweat runs into my eyes and dims them it seems to me that night is coming before it is noon  you are right answered sir geoffrey this gathering gloom is ominous and fearful i think that some awesome tempest must be about to burst also it seems to me that cattrina has no stomach for this fray else he would not raise so many points of martial law and custom  then wiping his brow with a silken handkerchief he returned to deliver the message  now hugh and dick watching saw that cattrina and those who advised him could find no further loophole for argument they saw moreover that the doge grew angry for he rose in his seat throwing off his velvet robe of office of which it appeared that he could no longer bear the weight and spoke in a hard voice to cattrina and his squires next once more the titles of the combatants were read and their cause of combat and while this went on hugh bade dick bind about his right arm a certain red ribbon that eve had given him saying that he wished to fight wearing his ladys favour  dick obeyed muttering that he thought such humours foolish and that a knight might as well wear a womans petticoat as her ribbon by now so dim had the light grown he could scarce see to tie the knot  indeed the weather was very strange  from the dark lowering sky above a palpable blackness sank downward as though the clouds themselves were falling of their own weight while from the sea great rolls of vapour came sweeping in like waves also this sea itself had found a voice for although it was so calm it moaned like a world in pain the great multitude began to murmur and their faces lifted upward toward the sky grew ghastly white fear they knew not of what had got hold of them a voice cried shrilly  let them fight and have done we would get home ere the tempest bursts  the first trumpet blew and the horses of the knights which whinnied uneasily were led to their stations the second trumpet blew and the knights laid their lances in rest then ere the third trumpet could sound suddenly the darkness of midnight swallowed all the scene  dick groped his way to hughs side bide where you are he said the end of the world is here let us meet it like men and together  ay answered hugh and his voice rang hollow through his closed visor without doubt it is the end of the world and murgh the minister has been sent to open the doors of heaven and hell god have mercy on us all  so they stayed there hearkening to the groans and prayers of the terrified multitude about them dick holding the bridle of the horse which shook from head to foot but never stirred for some minutes they remained thus till suddenly the sky began to lighten but with no natural light the colour of it of the earth beneath and of the air between was a deep terrible red that caused all things to seem as though they were dyed in blood lighter and lighter and redder and redder it grew the long stand and the pavilions became visible and after them the dense deep ring of spectators many of these were kneeling while others who could find no space to kneel held their hands upstretched toward heaven or beat their breasts and wept in the emotional fashion of the country  yet not on them were the eyes of hugh and grey dick fixed but rather on a single figure which stood quite alone in the midst of that great arena where cattrina and his horse should have been where they had been indeed but a little while before the figure was clothed in a red and yellow cap shaped like a cockscomb in black furs a yellow robe and white gloves and sandals yonder it stood fantastic fearful its bare and brawny arms crossed upon its breast its head bowed as though it contemplated the ground there was not an eye of all the tens of thousands of those who were present that did not see it there was not a voice that did not break into a yell of terror and hate till the earth shook with such a sound as might reverberate through the choked abyss of hell  the fiend the fiend the fiend said the shout kill him kill him kill him  the figure looked up the red light shone upon its stony face that seemed one blotch of white amidst its glow then it stooped down and lifted from the sand a knights lance such as cattrina had held it raised the lance and with it pointed four times east and west and north and south holding it finally for a while in the direction of the tribune where sat the doge with all his noble company and of venice beyond lastly with a quick and easy motion it cast the lance toward the sky whence it fell remaining fixed point downward in the earth then a tongue of mist that had crept up from the sea enveloped it and when that mist cleared away the shape was gone  now the red haze thinned and for the first time that morning the sun shone out in a sickly fashion although their nerves were torn by the unnatural darkness and the apparition that followed it which all saw yet none quite believed that they had seen the multitude shouted for the combat to proceed  once more hugh laid his lance in rest thinking that cattrina was there although he could not see him  then the third trumpet rang outin that silence it sounded like the blast of doomand hugh spurred his horse forward a little way but halted for he could perceive no foe advancing against him he stared about him and at last in a rage threw his lance to a squire and turning his horse galloped to the tribune there he pulled it to his haunches and shouted out in a great voice  where is cattrina am i to be fooled who appear here as the champion of the king of england where is cattrina produce cattrina that i may slay him or be slain or chivalry of venice be forever shamed  the doge rose uttering swift commands and heralds ran here and there knights and captains searched the pavilions and every other place where a mounted man might hide but they never found cattrina and returning at length confessed as much with bowed heads  the doge maddened by this ignominy seized the great gold chain upon his beast and burst it in two  cattrina has fled he shouted or satan himself has carried him away at the least let his name be erased from the golden book of venice and until he prove himself innocent let no noble of venice stretch out to him the hand of fellowship men of venice for you cattrina and his house are dead  will none take up his cause and fight for him asked hugh through sir geoffrey and presently at the doges command the challenge was repeated thrice by the herald but to it no answer came of this afterward hugh was glad since it was cattrinas life he sought not that of any other man then hugh spoke again saying  i claim o illustrious that i be written down as victor in this combat to the death bloodless through no fault of mine  it shall be so written noble hugh de cressi said the doge let all venice take notice thereof    as the words left his lips the solid earth began to heave and rock  at the first heave hugh leaped from his horse which screamed aloud and fled away and gripped hold of grey dick at the second the multitude broke out into wild cries prayers and blasphemies and rushed this way and that at the third which came quite slowly and was the greatest of them all the long stand of timber bent its flags toward him as though in salute then with a slow grinding crash fell over entangling all within it beneath its ruin also in the city beyond houses whole streets of them gabled churches and tall towers sank to the earth while where they had been rose up wreathed columns of dust to the south the sea became agitated spouts of foam appeared upon its smooth face it drew back from the land revealing the slime of ages and embedded therein longforgotten wrecks it heaped itself up like a mountain then with a swift and dreadful motion advanced again in one vast wave  in an instant all that multitude were in full flight  hugh and dick fled like the rest and with them david though whither they went they knew not  all they knew was that the ground leapt and quivered beneath their feet while behind them came the horrible seething hiss of water on the crest of which men were tossed up and down like bits of floating wood    chapter xv  the death at work  presently hugh halted taking shelter with his two companions behind the stone wall of a shed that the earthquake had shattered for here they could not be trodden down by the mob of fugitives  the wave has spent itself he said pointing to the line of foam that now retreated toward the ocean taking with it many drowned or drowning men let us return and seek for sir geoffrey it will be shameful if we leave him trapped yonder like a rat  dick nodded and making a wide circuit to avoid the maddened crowd they came safely to the wrecked stand where they had last seen sir geoffrey talking with the doge every minute indeed the mob grew thinner since the most of them had already passed treading the life out of those who fell as they went  from this stand more than three fourths of those who were seated there had already broken out since it had not fallen utterly and by good fortune was open on all sides some however tangled in the canvas roof were still trying to escape other poor creatures had been crushed to death or brokenlimbed lay helpless or worse still were held down beneath the fallen beams  several of these they freed whereon those who were unharmed at once ran away without thanking them but for a long while they could find no trace of sir geoffrey indeed they were near to abandoning their search for the sights and sounds were sickening even to men who were accustomed to those of battlefields when dicks quick ears caught the tones of an english voice calling for help apparently it came from the back of the doges tribune where lay a heap of dead gaily dressed folk who had fallen in the flight and been crushed not by the earthquake but by the feet of their fellows these blackened and disfigured men and women they dragged away with much toil and at last to their joy beneath them all found sir geoffrey carleon in another few minutes he must have died for he was almost suffocated  indeed he would certainly have perished with the others had he not been thrown under a fixed bench whence one leg projected which as they could see at once was crushed and broken they drew him out as gently as they could and gave him water to drink whereof mercifully for them all since by now they were utterly parched with thirst they had discovered a large silver pitcher full standing in the corner of a little antechamber to the tribune it was half hidden with fragments of fine dresses and even jewels torn from the persons of the lords and ladies  i thank you friends he said faintly i prayed them to keep seated but they went mad and would not listen those behind trod down those in front till that doorway was choked and i was hurled beneath the bench oh it was terrible to hear them dying about me and to know that soon i must follow this had it not been for you i should have done for my leg is crushed and there was no air  then having drunk and drunk until even their raging thirst was satisfied they found a plank laying sir geoffrey on it they departed from that human shambles whence the piteous cries of those still imprisoned there whom they could not reach pursued them horribly  thus slowly enough for there were but three of them two hampered by their mail they bore sir geoffrey across the place of arms save for the dead and dying and some ghoullike knaves who plundered them by this time it was almost deserted  indeed a large band of these wretches who had emerged like wolves from their lairs in the lowest quarters of the great city catching sight of the gold chain sir geoffrey wore ran up with drawn daggers to kill and rob them  seeing them come grey dick slipped the black bow from its case and sent an arrow singing through the heart of the oneeyed villain who captained them thereon the rest left him where he fell and ran off to steal and slay elsewhere then without a word dick unstrung the bow and once more laid hold of an end of the plank  they came to the mouth of that street where the bravoes had waylaid them on the previous night only to find that they could not pass this way here most of the houses were thrown down and from their ruins rose smoke and the hideous screams of those who perished it was this part of venice the home of the poorer folk which suffered most from the earthquake that had scarcely touched many of the finer quarters still it was reckoned afterward that in all it took a toll of nearly ten thousand lives  turning from this street they made their way to the banks of a great canal that here ran into the harbour that on which they had been rowed to the place of arms here by good luck they found a small boat floating keep uppermost for it had been overturned by the number of people who crowded into it this boat they righted with much toil and discovered within it a drowned lady also an oar caught beneath the seat after this their dreadful journey was easy at least by comparison for now all the gloom had rolled away the sun shone out and a fresh and pleasant wind blew from the sea toward the land  so at last passing many sad and strange scenes that need not be described they came safely to the steps of the ambassadors beautiful house which was quite uninjured here they found several of his servants wringing their hands and weeping for word had been brought to them that he was dead also in the hall they were met by another woe for there on a couch lay stretched the lady carleon smitten with some dread sickness which caused blood to flow from her mouth and ears a physician was bending over her for by good fortune one had been found  sir geoffrey asked him what ailed his wife he answered that he did not know having never seen the like till that morning when he had been called in to attend three such cases in houses far apart whereof one died within ten minutes of being struck  just then lady carleons senses returned and opening her eyes she saw sir geoffrey whom they had laid down upon another couch close to her  oh they told me that you were dead husband she said crushed or swallowed in the earthquake but i thank god they lied yet what ails you sweetheart that you do not stand upon your feet  little dear wife little he answered in a cheerful voice my foot is somewhat crushed that is all still tis true that had it not been for this brave knight and his squire i must have lain where i was till i perished  now lady carleon raised herself slightly and looked at hugh and dick who stood together bewildered and overwhelmed  heavens blessings be on your heads she exclaimed for these venetians would surely have left him to his doom ah i thought that it was you who must die today but now i know it is i and perchance my lord physician she added after a pause trouble not with me for my hour has come i feel it at my heart tend my lord there who unless this foul sickness takes him also may yet be saved  so they carried them both to their own large sleeping chamber on the upper floor there the surgeon set sir geoffreys broken bone skilfully enough though when he saw the state of the crushed limb he shook his head and said it would be best to cut it off this however sir geoffrey would not suffer to be done  it will kill me i am sure or if not then the pest which that ship light of the east has brought here from cyprus will do its work on me but i care nothing for since you say that my wife must die i would die with her and be at rest  at sunset lady carleon died ere she passed away she sent for hugh and dick her bed by her command had been moved to an open window for she seemed to crave air by it was placed that of sir geoffrey so that the two of them could hold each others hand  i would die looking toward england sir hugh she said with a faint smile though alas i may not sleep in that churchyard on the sussex downs where i had hoped that i might lie at last now sir hugh i pray this of your christian charity and by the english blood which runs in us that you will swear to me that you and your squire will not leave my lord alone among these southern folk but that you will bide with him and nurse him till he recovers or dies as god may will also that you will see me buried by the bones of my childthey will tell you where  wife broke in sir geoffrey this knight is not of our kin doubtless he has business elsewhere how can he bide with me here mayhap for weeks  but lady carleon who could speak no more only looked at hugh who answered  fear nothing here we will stay until he recoversunless he added we ourselves should die  she smiled at him gratefully then turned her face toward sir geoffrey and pressed his hand so presently she passed away the tears running from her faded eyes  when it was over and the women had covered her hugh and dick left the room for they could bear no more  i have seen sad sights said hugh with something like a sob but never before one so sad  ay answered dick that of the wounded dying on crecy field was a may day revel compared to this though it is but one old woman who has gone oh how heavily they parted who have dwelt together these forty years and twas my careless tongue this morning that foretold it as a jest  in the hall they met the physician who rushed wildeyed through the doorway to ask how his patients fared  ah he said to them in french when he knew well signors that noble lady has not gone alone i tell you that scores of whom i know are already dead in venice swept off by this swift and horrible plague death and all his angels stalk through the city they say that he himself appeared last night and this morning on the tilting ground by the quay and by gods mercyif he has any left for usi can well believe it the doge and his council but now have issued a decree that all who perish must be buried at once see to it signors lest the officers come and bear her away to some common grave from which her rank will not protect her  then he went to visit sir geoffrey returning presently he gave them some directions as to his treatment and rushed out as he had rushed in they never saw him again two days later they learned that he himself was dead of the pest  that night they buried lady carleon in her sons grave which dick had helped to prepare for her since no sexton could be bribed to do the work indeed these were all busy enough attending to the interment of the great ones of venice in that churchyard alone they saw six buryings in progress also after the priest had read his hurried office as they left the gates whence lady carleons bearers had already fled affrighted they met more melancholy processions heralded by a torch or two whereof the light fell upon some sheeted and uncoffined form  twixt earthquake and plague murgh the helper is helping very well said grey dick grimly and hugh only groaned in answer    such was the beginning of the awful plague which travelled from the east to venice and all europe and afterward became known by the name of the black death day by day the number of its victims increased the hundreds of yesterday were the thousands of the morrow soon the graveyards were full the plague pits long and deep were full and the dead were taken out to sea by shiploads and there cast into the ocean at length even this could not be done since none were forthcoming who would dare the task for it became known that those who did so themselves would surely die  so where folk fell there they lay in the houses were many of them they cumbered and poisoned the streets and the very churches even the animals sickened and perished until that great city was turned into an open tomb the reek of it tainted the air for miles around so that even those who passed it in ships far out to sea turned faint and presently themselves sickened and died but ere they died they bore on the fatal gift to other lands  moreover starvation fell upon the place though the houses were full of riches these would scarce suffice to buy bread for those who remained alive the doge and some of his council passed laws to lighten the misery of the people but soon few heeded these laws which none were left to enforce the vagabonds and evilminded men who began by robbing the deserted houses of jewels money and plate ended by searching them for food and casting aside their treasures as worthless dross it was even said that some of them did worse things things not to be named since in its extremities nature knows no shame only if bread and meat were scarce wine remained in plenty in the midst of death menyes and womenwho perhaps had deserted their wives their husbands or their children fearing to take the evil from them made the nights horrible by their drunken blasphemies and revellings as sailors sometimes do upon a sinking ship knowing that they must die they wished to die merry    sir geoffrey carleon lived a long while after the death of his wife when he passed away at last ten days or so later it was painlessly of the mortification of his broken limb not of the pest which went by him as though it knew that he was already doomed  all this time hugh grey dick and david day nursed him without ceasing indeed with the exception of a woman so ancient and shrivelled that nothing seemed able to harm her any more no one else was left in the great palazzo for all the rest of the household had perished or fled away this woman who was the grandmother of one of the servants now dead of the plague cooked their food of such provision fortunately there was much laid up in the storerooms for use in the winter since lady carleon had been a good and provident housewife  so those three did not starve although sir geoffrey would touch little of the salted stuff he existed on a few fruits when they could get them and after these were gone on wine mingled with water  at length came the end for two days he had lain senseless one night however david who was watching in his chamber crept into the room where hugh slept hard by and told them that sir geoffrey was awake and calling them they rose and went to him by the light of the moon which shone in at the open window that same window through which lady carleon had looked toward england ere she passed away they saw him lying quietly a happy smile upon his face  friends he said in a weak voice by the mercy of god i go out of this hell to heaven or so i think but if indeed this be not the end of the world i hope that you who have lived so long will continue to live and i have sent for you to bless you and to thank you both in yonder case are certain papers that have to do with the kings business i pray you deliver them to his grace if you can and with them my homage and my thanks for the trust that he has reposed in me tell him what i have not written in the lettersand here he smiled faintlythat i think that few of his creditors in venice will trouble him at present though afterward their heirs if they have left any may do so say too to the doge who i believe still lives that i send him my good wishes and respects also that i grieve that i have not been able to hand him my letters of recall in person since the king who summons me sends none  so much for business but there are two things more i have no relatives living save my wifes sister therefore sir hugh and captain richard i have made you my joint heirs with her my testament duly signed and witnessed is in that case with the other papers my wealth is not great still there are certain land and manors in england a sum of money placed with a merchant in london whose name you will find written in the testament my plate and gold coin here though the former you may not be able to move therefore i charge you to bury it and return for it later on if you can it is of value since all my life i have collected such trinkets i beg you to make provision also for this good lad david should he be spared  he paused a while for he was growing very weak then added  another thing is that i ask you if it be possible to row my body out to sea and there sink it in deep water deep clean water far from this place of stench and pestilence for i would not lie in the common pit at last now kneel down and pray for my passing soul since there is no priest to give me absolution and i must seek it straight from god nay thank me not i have done with the world and its affairs kneel down and pray as i pray for you that you may be spared on earth and that we may meet again in heaven where my wife and others await me  they obeyed weeping yes even grey dick wept a little presently when they looked up they saw that sir geoffrey was dead dead without pain or sorrow of the first he had suffered none for days and the second was far from him who wished to die  leaving the ancient woman in charge of the house which she barred and bolted next morning they took a boat and the three of them rowed the body of the old knight a league out into the quiet sea there after a brief prayer they cast him into the deep weighted with stones so that he might never rise again  then they returned not too soon for they found thieves in the act of breaking into the house probably in search of food these miserable halfstarved men they spared though they could have killed them easily enough they even gave them a pouch full of biscuit and dried meat ere they dismissed them this they did quickly since one of them as they could see was already stricken by the plague and had not long to live when they were gone the old woman being out of the house whence she had fled on hearing the robbers they collected all sir geoffreys and his ladys jewels and plate of which there was much for he lived in state in venice as became an ambassador these they buried in three large iron boxes beneath the flagstones of the cellar the safest place that they could find having thrown the excavated earth into the canal under cover of the dark they replaced these stones and strewed dust over them  wondering whether it would ever be their lot to look upon these chests and their contents again they left the cellar to find the old woman knocking at the back door of the house whither she had returned frightened by the sights and sounds in the city they bade her bring them food which they needed much who had laboured so hard on that sorrowful day and after they had eaten took counsel together  seeing that all three of us are still in health as if there is anything in the promises of murgh we should remain is it not time master asked grey dick that we left this accursed venice now that sir geoffrey is gone there is naught to keep us here  one thing i have to do first answered hugh and it is to learn whether sir edmund acour lord of cattrina is dead or living and if living where he hides himself away while sir geoffrey lay dying we could not leave him to make search but now it is otherwise  ay master though i think youll find the task hard in this hive of pestilence and confusion  i have heard that the plague is at work in cattrinas palace broke in david but when i asked whether he were there or no none could tell me that is not a house where youll be welcomed sir hugh  still i will make bold to knock at his doors tomorrow answered hugh now let us seek what we all needsleep  so on the following morning shortly after sunrise hugh and grey dick guided by david took boat and rowed through most fearful scenes and sounds to the palazzo cattrina a splendid but somewhat dilapidated building situated in a part of the city that like itself had seen more prosperous times the great doors of the place set in a marble archway stood half open over them were cut the cognizance of the floating swan and beneath in letters of faded gold the titles of acour de noyon and cattrina no wonder they were open since the porters lodge was occupied only by a grisly corpse that lay rotting on the floor a heavy key in its hand the courtyard beyond was empty and so save for a dead horse were the stables to the right passing up the steps of the hall that also stood open they entered  here the place was in confusion as though those who dwelt there had left in haste the mouldering remains of a meal lay on the broad oak table a great dowerchest inlaid with ivory but half filled with arms and armour stood wide a silver crucifix that had hung above was torn down and cast upon the floor perchance by thieves who had found it too heavy to bear away the earthquake had thrown over a carved cabinet and some bowls of glazed ware that stood upon it these lay about shattered amidst shields and swords thrown from the walls where pictures of saints or perchance of dead cattrinas hung all awry in short if an army had sacked it this stately hall could scarce have seemed more ruined  hugh and dick crossed it to a stairway of chestnut wood whereof every newelpost was surmounted by the crest of a swan and searched the saloons above where also there was wreck and ruin then still mounting the stair they came to the bedchambers from one of these they retreated hastily since on entering it hundreds of flies buzzing in a corner advised them that something lay there which they did not wish to see  let us be going i grow sick exclaimed hugh  but dick who had the ears of a fox held up his hand and said  hark i hear a voice  following the sound he led his master down two long corridors that ended in a chapel there lying before the altar they found a man clad in a filthy priests robe a dying man who still had the strength to cry for help or mercy although in truth he was wasted to a skeleton since the plague which had taken him was of the most lingering sort indeed little seemed to be left of him save his rolling eyes prominent nose and high cheekbones covered with yellow parchment that had been skin and a stubbly growth of unshaven hair  dick scanned him dick who never forgot a face then stepped forward and said  so once more we meet in a chapel father nicholas say how has it fared with you since you fled through the chancel door of that at blythburgh manor no i forgot that was not the last time we met a man in a yellow cap ripped off your mask in a bystreet near the place of arms one night and said something which it did not please you to hear  water moaned nicholas for christs sake give me water  why should i give you water in payment for your midnight steel yonder in the narrow street what kind of water was it that you gave red eve far away at blythburgh town asked dick in his hissing voice which sounded like that of an angry snake  but hugh who could bear no more of it ran down to the courtyard where he had seen a pitcher standing by a well and brought water  thank god that you have come again said the wretched priest as he snatched at it for i cannot bear to die with this whitefaced devil glaring at me and he pointed to grey dick who leaned against the chancel wall his arms folded on his breast smiling coldly  then he drank greedily hugh holding the pitcher to his lips for his wasted arms could not bear its weight  now said hugh when his thirst was satisfied tell me where is your master cattrina  god or the fiend can say alone when he found that i was smitten with the plague he left me to perish as did the others  and as we shall do unless you tell me whither my enemy has gone and hugh made as though to leave the place  the priest clutched at him with his filthy clawlike hand  for christs sake do not desert me he moaned let one christian soul be near me at the last ere the curse of that wizard with the yellow cap is fulfilled on me for the sake of jesus stay ill tell all i know  speak then and be swift you have no time to spare i think  when the darkness fell there in the place of arms began nicholas while you knights were waiting for the third blast of the trumpet cattrina fled under cover it  as i thought the accursed coward exclaimed hugh bitterly  nay to be just it was not all cowardice the wizard in the yellow cap he who showed himself to the people afterward and called down this black death on venice appeared to him in the darkness and said something to him that turned his heart to water i think it was that if he stayed within five short minutes hed be dead who otherwise if he fled had yet a breathing space of life so he went  ay but whither man whither  here to his house where he disguised himself and bade me prepare to travel with him only then the sickness took me and i could not so he went with some of his people riding for avignon  what to do at avignon  to obtain the confirmation of his marriage with the lady eve clavering it has been promised to him by certain cardinals at court who have the ear of his holiness the pope  ah i thought it what more  only this tidings reached him that the lady clavering with the old templar sir andrew arnold journeys to avignon from england there to obtain the dissolution of their marriage with sir edmund acour count de noyon lord of cattrina in avignon however the cause may go cattrina purposes to snare and make her his which will be easy for there he has many friends and she has none  except god exclaimed hugh grinding his teeth  and sir andrew arnold broke in dick who like some others is i think one of his ministers still we had better be riding master  nay nay cried nicholas in a hoarse scream tarry a while and ill tell you that which will force the pope to void this marriage yes it shall be set in writing and signed by me and witnessed ere i die there is ink and parchment in yonder little room  thats a good thought said hugh dick fetch the tools for if we try to move this fellow he will go farther than we can follow him  dick went and returned presently with an inkhorn a roll of parchment pens and a little table then hugh sat himself down on the altar rail placing the table in front of him and said  say on ill write since you cannot  now nicholas having before his glazing eyes the vision of imminent judgment briefly but clearly told all the truth at last he told how he had drugged red eve giving the name of the bane which he mixed in the milk she drank he told how when her mind was sleeping though her body was awake none knowing the wickedness that had been wrought save he and acour and least of all her father they had led her to the altar like a lamb to the slaughter and there married her to the man she hated he told how although he had fled from england to save his life acour had never ceased to desire her and to plot to get her into his power any more than he had ceased to fear hughs vengeance for this reason he said he had clad himself in the armour of another knight at crecy and in that guise accepted mercy at hughs hand leaving de la roche to die in his place beneath that same hand for this reason also he had commanded him nicholas to bring about the death of hugh de cressi and his squire beneath the daggers of assassins in the streets of venice a fate from which they had been saved only by the wizard in the yellow cap whom no steel could harm  the blackhearted villain hissed dick well for your comfort holy priest ill tell you who that wizard is he is death himself death the sword death the fire death the helper and presently youll meet him again  i knew it i knew it groaned the wretched man oh such is the end of sin whereof we think so little in our day of strength  nay broke in hugh youll meet not the minister but him whom he serves and in his hand are mercies be silent dick for this wretch makes confession and his time is short spare the tool and save your wrath for him who wielded it go now and fetch david day that he may witness also  so dick went and nicholas continued his tale throwing light into many a dark place though there was little more that hugh thought worthy of record  presently david came and started back in horror at the sight of that yellow tortured face set upon a living skeleton then the writing was read and nicholas held up by dick set his signature with a trembling hand to this his confession of the truth this done they signed as witnesses all three of them  now hugh whose pity was stirred wished to move nicholas and lay him on a bed in some chamber and if they could find someone to watch him till the end but the priest refused this charity  let me die before the altar he said where i may set my eyes upon him whom i have betrayed afresh and he pointed to the carved ivory crucifix which hung above it oh be warned be warned my brethren he went on in a wailing voice you are all of you still young you may be led astray as i was by the desire for power by the hope of wealth you may sell yourselves to the wicked as i did i who once was good and strove toward the right if satan tempts you thus then remember nicholas the priest and his dreadful death and see how he pays his servants the plague has taken others yet they have died at peace but i i die in hell before i see its fires  not so said hugh you have repented and i against whom you have sinned perhaps more than all forgive you as i am sure my lady would could she know  then it is more than i do muttered grey dick to himself why should i forgive him because he rots alive as many a better man has done and goes to reap what he has sown who if he had won his way would have sent us before him at the daggers point yet who knows each of us sins in his own fashion and perchance sin is born of the blood and not of the will if ever i meet murgh again ill ask him but perhaps he will not answer  thus reflected dick half to david who feared and did not understand him and half to himself ere ever he had finished with his thoughts which were not such as sir andrew would have approved father nicholas began to die  it was not a pleasant sight this death of his though of its physical part nothing shall be written let that be buried with other records of the great plague only in this case his mind triumphed for a while over the dissolution of his body when there was little left of him save bone and sinew still he found strength to cry out to god for mercy yes and to raise himself and cast what had been arms about the ivory rood and kiss its feet with what had been lips and in his last death struggle to drag it down and pant out his ultimate breath beneath its weight  so there they left him a horrible huddled heap upon which gleamed the ivory crucifix and went their way gasping into the air    chapter xvi  at avignon  hard upon two months had gone by when at length these three hugh grey dick and david day set eyes upon the towers of stately avignon standing red against the sunset and encircled by the blue waters of the rhone terrible beyond imagination had been the journey of these men who followed in the footsteps of murgh they saw him not it is true but always they saw his handiwork death death everywhere death nothing but death  one night they supped at an inn with the host his family and servants twelve folk in all in seeming health when they rose in the morning one old woman and a little child alone remained the rest were dead or dying one day they were surprised and taken by robbers desperate outcasts of the mountains who gave them twentyfour hours to make their peace with heavenere they hanged them because they had slain so many of the band before they were overpowered  but when those twentyfour hours of grace had elapsed it would have been easy for them to hang all who remained of those robbers themselves so they took the best of their horses and their illgotten gold and rode on again leaving the murderers murdered by a stronger power than man  they went through desolate villages where the crops rotted in the fields they went through stricken towns whereof the moan and the stench rose in a foul incense to heaven they crossed rivers where the very fish had died by thousands poisoned of the dead that rolled seaward in their waters the pleasant land had become a hell and untouched unharmed they plodded onward through those deeps of hell but a night or two before they had slept in a city whereof the population or those who remained alive of them seemed to have gone mad in one place they danced and sang and made love in an open square in another bands of naked creatures marched the streets singing hymns and flogging themselves till the blood ran down to their heels while the passersby prostrated themselves before them these were the forerunners of the mad dancers of the following year  in a field outside of this city they came upon even a more dreadful sight here forty or fifty frenzied people most of them drunk were engaged in burning a poor jew his wife and two children upon a great fire made of the staves of winecasks which they had plundered from some neighbouring cellars when hugh and his companions came upon the scene the jew had already burned and this crowd of devils were preparing to cast his wife and children into the flames which they had been forced to see devour their husband and father indeed with yells of brutal laughter they were thrusting the children into two great casks ere they rolled them into the heart of the fire while the wretched mother stood by and shrieked  what do you sirs asked hugh riding up to them  we burn wizards and their spawn sir knight answered the ringleader know that these accursed jews have poisoned the wells of our townwe have witnesses who saw them do itand thus brought the plague upon us moreover she and he pointed to the womanwas seen talking not fourteen days ago to the devil in a yellow cap who appears everywhere before the death begins now roll them in roll them in  hugh drew his sword for this sight was more than his english flesh and blood could bear dick also unsheathed the black bow while young david produced a great knife which he carried  free those children said hugh to the man with whom he had spoken a fat fellow with rolling bloodshot eyes  get you to hell stranger he answered or well throw you on the fire also as a jew in knights dress  free those children said hugh again in a terrible voice or i send you before them be warned i speak truth  be you warned stranger for i speak truth also replied the man mimicking him now friends he added tuck up the devils brats in their warm bed  they were his last words for hugh thrust with his sword and down he went  now a furious clamour arose the mob snatched up burning staves bludgeons knives or whatever they had at hand and prepared to kill the three without waiting for orders dick began to shoot david a bold young man rushed at one of the most violent and stabbed him and hugh who had leapt from his horse set himself back to back with the other two thrice dick shot and at the third deadly arrow these drunken fellows grew sober enough to understand that they wished no more of them  suddenly acting on a common impulse they fled away every one only leaving behind them those who had fallen beneath the arrows and the sword but some who were so full of wine that they could not run tumbled headlong and lay there helpless  woman said hugh when they had departed your husband is lost but you and your children are saved now go your ways and thank whatever god you worship for his small mercies  alas sir knight the poor creature a still young and not unhandsome jewess wailed in answer whither shall i go if i return to that town those christian men will surely murder me and my children as they have already murdered my husband kill us now by the sword or the bowit will be a kindnessbut leave us not here to be tortured by the christian men according to their fashion with us poor jews  are you willing to go to avignon asked hugh after thinking awhile  ay sir knight or anywhere away from these christians indeed at avignon i have a brother who perchance will protect us  then mount my horse said hugh dick and david draw those two youngsters from the tubs and set them on your beasts we can walk  so the children two comely little girls of eight and six years of age or thereabout were dragged out of their dreadful prisons and lifted to the saddle the wretched widow running to the bonfire snatched from it her husbands burntoff hand and hid it in the bosom of her filthy robe then she took some of the white ashes and threw them toward that city muttering curses as she did so  what do you asked hugh curiously  i pray sir to jehovah the god of the jews that for every grain of these ashes he may take a life in payment for that of my murdered husband and i think that he will listen  like enough answered hugh crossing himself but woman can you wonder that we christians hold you sorcerers when we hear such prayers from your lips  she turned with a tragic motion and pointing to the bones of her husband smouldering in the fire answered  and can you wonder sir that we wretched creatures utter such prayers when you our masters do such deeds as this  no answered hugh i cannot let us be going from this shambles  so they went a melancholy procession if ever there one was seen upon this earth as the three englishmen marched behind the horses with their weeping burdens grey dick reflected aloud after his fashion  jew and christian he said the jews killed one man who chanced to be a god though they knew it not and ever since the christians have killed thousands of the jews now which is the most wicked those jews who killed the man who was a god because he said he was a god or those christians who throw a man into a fire to burn before his wifes and childrens eyes a man who never said that he was a god but who they said put poison into their wells which he did not do but which they believed he did because he was one of the race that thirteen hundred years ago killed their god ah well jew and christian i think the same devil dwells in them all but murgh alone knows the truth of the matter if ever we meet again ill ask him of it meanwhile we go to avignon in strange company whereof all the holy priests yonder if any of them still live to say nothing of the people may demand an account of us  so spoke dick as one who seeks an answer but neither of his companions gave him any  on they went through the ruined land unpursued although they had just brought sundry men to their deaths for now neither law nor justice was left and those killed who could and those died who must unwept and unavenged only certain travellers flying they knew not whither flying from doom to doom eyed them with hate and loathing because of their companions those who consorted with jews must they thought be the enemies of every christian soul  well was it for them perhaps that the early winter night was closing in when they reached the wonderful bridge of st bénézet now quite unguarded since a worse foe reigned in avignon than any that it could fear from without they crossed it unnoted for here none lingered in the gloom and rain save one poor woman who called out to them that all she loved were dead and that she went to seek them then before they could interfere she scrambled to the parapet of the bridge and with a wild cry leapt into the foaming waters that rushed beneath  god forgive and rest her muttered hugh crossing himself the others only shrugged their shoulders such dreadful sights fed their eyes daily till they learned to take little note of them  in a deserted place on the farther side of the bridge they halted and hugh said to the jewish widow  woman here is avignon where you tell us there are those who will befriend you so now let us part we have done what we can for you and it is not safe either for you or for us that we should be seen together in this christian city  sir you speak well she answered be pleased ere we separate to meet no more perchance to tell me your names that i may remember them and hand them down among my people from generation to generation  so he told her and thrust onto her a gift of money and the most of such food as remained to them then the poor woman lifted up her arms and said  i rebecca daughter of onias and wife of nathan call down on you hugh de cressi richard archer and david day and on your children forever the blessings of jehovah because you have rescued the widow and her children from the fire and avenged the murder of the husband and the father o god of my people as thou didst save lot and his house from the flames of sodom so save these truehearted and merciful men turn from them the sword of thy wrath when it smites the sinful cities cast the cloak of thy protection about them and all they love prosper their handiwork in peace and in war fulfil their desire upon their enemies and at last let them die full of years and honour and so be gathered into thy eternal bosom thus prayeth rebecca the daughter of onias and thus shall it be  then leading her children she turned and vanished into the darkness  now said dick when she had gone although they were spoken by a jew whom men call accursed because their forefathers fulfilling prophecy or some few of them wrought a great crime when the world was young and thereby brought about the salvation of mankind as we believe those are among the most comfortable words to which my ears have listened especially such of them as dealt with the fulfilling of our desire upon our enemies in war well they are spoke and i doubt not registered in a book which will not be lost so master let us seek a lodging in this city of avignon which for my part i do with a light heart  hugh nodded and his heart also was lightened by those words of blessing and good omen mounting their horses they took a street that led them past the great roches des doms on the crest of which stood the mighty palace of the popes as yet unfinished but still one of the vastest buildings they had ever seen here on the battlements and in front of the gateway burned great fires lit by order of his holiness to purify the air and protect him and his court from the plague  leaving this place on their right they rode slowly along one of the principal streets of the town seeking an inn soon they found one a large place that had a sign on which three shepherds were painted and turned to enter its gateway but when they saw them out of that gateway rushed a mob of frantic people waving swords and cudgels and saying that they would have no strangers there to bring the death among them  let us go on said hugh for here it seems we are not welcome  so they went and tried three other inns in turn at two of them they met with a like greeting but the doors of the third were closed and the place was deserted then for a crowd began to gather round them wearily enough they turned up another street at hazard thus they wended their way back toward the great central rock thinking that there they might find some more hospitable tavern  following this new street they reached a less crowded suburb of the town where large dwellings stood in their own gardens one of these they saw by the flare of some of those fires which burned all about the city in this time of pestilence seemed to be a small castle at least it had a moat round it and a drawbridge which was down seeing that lamps burned in its windows hugh who was worn out with their long journeyings took a sudden resolution  doubtless some knight dwells in this fine house he said to his companions let us go up and declare our names and degree and by virtue of them claim the hospitality which is our right  be it so grumbled dick we cannot be worse treated there than we were at the inns unless the owner adds arrows to the swords and cudgels  they rode across the drawbridge to the gateway of the little castle which was open and finding no one there through a small courtyard to the door which also was open  david dismounted and knocked on it but none answered  an empty house belongs to no one said dick at any rate in these times let us enter  they did so and saw that the place was sumptuously appointed though ancient it was not large having as they afterward discovered been a fortification on an outer wall now demolished which had been turned to the purposes of a dwelling leaving the hall out of which opened the refectory they mounted a stone stair to the upper chambers and entered one of them  here they saw a strange and piteous sight on a bed about which candles still burned lay a young woman who had been very beautiful arrayed in a brides robe  dead of the plague said hugh and deserted at her death well she had better luck than many since she was not left to die alone her dress and these candles show it  ay answered dick but fear took the watchers at last and they are fled well we will fill their place and if they do not return tomorrow give her honourable burial in her own courtyard here be fine lodgings for us master so let us bide in them until the rightful owners cast us out come david and help me raise that drawbridge  fine lodgings these proved to be indeed since as they found no house in avignon was better furnished with all things needful but and this will show how dreadful were the times during these days that they made this their home they never so much as learned the name of that poor lady arrayed in the brides dress and laid out upon her marriage bed  in the butteries and cellar were plentiful provisions of food having eaten of it with thankfulness they chose out one of the bedchambers and slept there quite undisturbed till the morning sun shone in at the windowplaces and awoke them then they arose and digging a shallow grave in the courtyard with some garden tools which they found in a shed they bore out the poor bride and removing only her jewels which were rich enough buried her there in her wedding dress this sad duty finished they washed themselves with water from the well and breakfasted after they had eaten they consulted as to what they should do next  we came here to lay a certain cause before his holiness said hugh let us go up to the palace declare our business and estate and ask audience  so leaving david in charge of the house which they named the brides tower because of the dead lady and the little keep which rose above it and of the horses that they had stalled in the stable they went out and made their way to the great entrance of the popes palace here they found the gates shut and barred with a huge fire burning behind them  still they knocked until some guards appeared armed with crossbows and asked their business they said they desired to see his holiness or at least one of his secretaries whereon the guards asked whence they came they replied from italy and were told that if so they would find no entrance there since the death had come from italy now hugh gave his name and stated his business on hearing which the guards laughed at him  annulment of a false marriage said their captain go lay your petition before death who will do your business swiftly if he has not done it already get you gone you english knight with your whitefaced squire we want no english here at the best of times and least of all if they hail from italy  come on master said dick there are more ways into a house than by the front doorand we wont want to leave our brains to grease its hinges  so they went away wondering whither they should betake themselves or what they could do next as it chanced they had not long to wait for an answer presently a lanternjawed notary in a frayed russet gown who must have been watching their movements approached them and asked them what had been their business at the popes palace hugh told him whereon the lawyer finding that he was a person of high degree became deferential in his manner moreover he announced that he was a notary named basil of tours and one of the legal secretaries of his holiness who just now was living without the gates of the palace by express command in order to attend to the affairs of suitors at the papal court during the great sickness he added however that he was able to communicate with those within and that doubtless it might be in his power to forward the cause of the noble knight sir hugh de cressi in which already he took much interest  there would be a fee suggested dick looking at the man coldly  basil answered with a smirk that fees and legal affairs were inseparable the latter naturally involved the former not that he cared for money he remarked especially in this time of general woe still it would never do for a lawyer however humble to create a precedent which might be used against his craft in better days then he named a sum  hugh handed him double what he asked whereon he began to manifest great zeal in his case indeed he accompanied them to the fortified house that they had named the brides tower which he alleged with or without truth he had never seen before there he wrote down all particulars of the suit  sir edmund acour count de noyon seigneur of cattrina he said presently why i think that a lord of those names had audience with his holiness some while ago just before the pest grew bad in avignon and the gates of the palace were ordered to be shut i know not what passed on the occasion not having been retained in the cause but i will find out and tell you tomorrow  find out also if it pleases you learned basil said hugh whether or no this knight with the three names is still in avignon if so i have a word or two to say to him  i will i will answered the lanternjawed notary yet i think it most unlikely that any one who can buy or beg a horse to ride away on should stay in this old city just now unless indeed the laws of his order bind him to do so that he may minister to the afflicted well if the pest spares me and you tomorrow morning i will be back here at this hour to tell you all that i can gather  how did this sickness begin in avignon asked grey dick  noble squire none know for certain in the autumn we had great rains heavy mists and other things contrary to the usual course of nature such as strange lights shining in the heavens and so forth then after a day of much heat one evening a man clad in a red and yellow cap who wore a cloak of thick black furs and necklaces of black pearls was seen standing in the marketplace indeed i saw him myself there was something so strange and dreadful about the appearance of this man although it is true that some say he was no more than a common mountebank arrayed thus to win pence that the people set upon him they hurled stones at him they attacked him with swords and every other weapon and thought that they had killed him when suddenly he appeared outside the throng unhurt then he stretched out his whitegloved hand toward them and melted into the gloom  only added basil nervously it was noted afterward that all those who had tried to injure the man were among the first to die of the pest thank god i was not one of them indeed i did my best to hold them back which perhaps is the reason why i am alive today  a strange story said hugh though i have heard something like it in other cities through which we have passed well till tomorrow at this hour friend basil  we have learned two things master said dick when the lawyer had bowed himself out first that acour is or has been in avignon and secondly that murgh the messenger murgh the sword has been or is in avignon let us go seek for one of the other of them since for my part i desire to meet them both  so all that day they sought but found neither  next morning basil reappeared according to his promise and informed them that their business was on foot also he said that it was likely to prove more difficult than he anticipated indeed he understood that he who was named de noyon and cattrina having friends among the cardinals had already obtained some provisional ratification of his marriage with the lady eve clavering this ratification it would now be costly and difficult to set aside  hugh answered that if only he could be granted an audience with his holiness he had evidence which would make the justice of his cause plain what he sought was an audience  the notary scratched his lantern jaws and asked how that could be brought about when every gate of the palace was shut because of the plague still perhaps it might be managed he added if a certain sum were forthcoming to bribe various janitors and persons in authority  hugh gave him the sum out of the store of gold they had taken from the robbers in the mountains with something over for himself so basil departed saying that he would return at the same hour on the morrow if the plague spared him and them his patrons as he prayed the saints that it might do  hugh watched him go then turned to dick and said  i mistrust me of that hungry wolf in sheeps clothing who talks so large and yet does nothing let us go out and search avignon again perchance we may meet acour or at least gather some tidings of him  so they went leaving the tower locked and barred who perchance would have been wiser to follow basil a debased and fraudulent lawyer of no character at all this man lived upon such fees as he could wring without authority from those who came to lay their suits before the papal court playing upon their hopes and fears and pretending to a power which he did not possess had they done so they might have seen him turn up a certain side street and when he was sure that none watched him slip into the portal of an ancient house where visitors of rank were accustomed to lodge  mounting some stairs without meeting any one for this house like many others seemed to be deserted in that time of pestilence he knocked upon a door  begone whoever you are growled a voice from within here there are neither sick to be tended nor dead to be borne away  had they been there to hear it hugh and dick might have found that voice familiar  noble lord he replied i am the notary basil and come upon your business  maybe said the voice but how know i that you have not been near some case of foul sickness and will not bring it here  have no fear lord i have been waiting on the healthy not on the sicka task which i leave to others who have more taste that way  then the door was opened cautiously and from the room beyond it came a pungent odour of aromatic essences basil passed in shutting it quickly behind him before him at the further side of the table and near to a blazing fire stood acour himself he was clothed in a long robe and held a piece of linen that was soaked in some strongsmelling substance before his nose and mouth  nay come no nearer he said to the clerk for this infection is most subtle andbe so good as to cast off that filthy cloak of yours and leave it by the door  basil obeyed revealing an undergarment that was still more foul he was not one who wasted money on new apparel  well man said acour surveying him with evident disgust and throwing a handful of dried herbs upon the fire what news now has my cause been laid before his holiness i trust so for know that i grow weary of being cooped up here like a falcon in a cage with the dread of a loathsome death and a handful of frightened servants as companions who do nothing but drone out prayers all day long  yes lord it has i have it straight from clements own secretary and the answer is that his holiness will attend to the matter when the pest has passed away from avignon and not before he adds also that when it does so if ever all the parties to the cause by themselves or by their representatives must appear before him he will give no ex parte judgment upon an issue which from letters that have reached him appears to be complicated and doubtful  mother of heaven exclaimed acour what a fool am i to let you in to tell me such tidings well if that is all you have to say the sooner i am out of this hateful city the better i ride this afternoon or if need be walk on foot  indeed said basil then you leave behind you some who are not so frightened of their health but who bide here upon a very similar errand doubtless as often happens to the bold they will find a way to fulfil it  and who may these be fellow  a bold and warlike knight a squire with hair like tow and a face that might be worn by death himself and a young english serving man  acour started up from the chair in which he had sat down  no need to tell me their names he said but how by hells gate came de cressi and his familiar here  by the road i imagine lord like others at least a few days ago they were seen travelling toward the bridge of st bénézet in the company of certain jews whom i am informed they had rescued from the just reward of their witchcraft i have a note of all the facts which include the slaying of sundry good christians on behalf of the said jews  jews why that is enough to hang them in these times but what do they here and where do they lodge  like your lordship they strive to see the pope they desire that an alleged marriage between one sir edmund acour count of noyon and seigneur of cattrina and one lady eve clavering an englishwoman may be declared null and void as they have been so good as to honour me with their confidence and appoint me their agent i am able to detail the facts therefore i will tell you at once that the case of this knight de cressi appears to be excellent since it includes the written confession of a certain father nicholas of whom perhaps you have heard  the written confession of nicholas have you seen it  not as yet so far i have been trusted with no original documents is it your will that i should try to possess myself of these because if so i will do my best provided and he looked at the pocket of acours robe  how much asked acour the man named a great sum half to be paid down and half on the delivery of the papers  ill double it said acour if you can bring it about that these insolent englishmen dieof the pest  how can i do that lord asked basil with a sour smile such tricks might work backward i might die or you still these men have committed crimes and just now there is a prejudice against jews  ay said acour the englishmen are sorcerers i tell you that in venice they were seen in the company of that fiend of the yellow cap and the fur robe who appears everywhere before the pest  prove it exclaimed basil and the citizens of avignon will rid you of their troubling  then they debated long together and the end of it was that basil departed saying that he would return again on the morrow and make report as to certain matters    chapter xvii  a meeting  hugh grey dick and david trudged up and down through the streets of avignon all that long day they trudged seeking news and finding little again and again they asked at the inns whether a knight who bore the name of acour or de noyon or cattrina was or had been a guest there but none whom they asked seemed to know anything of such a person  they asked it of citizens also of holy priests good men who careless of their own lives followed biers or cartloads of dead destined to the plague pit or the river that they might pronounce over them the last blessings of the church they asked it of physicians some few of whom still remained alive as they hurried from house to house to administer to the sick or dying but all of these either did not answer at all or else shrugged their shoulders and went on their melancholy business only one of them called back that he had no time to waste in replying to foolish questions and that probably the knight they sought was dead long ago or had fled from the city  another man an officer of customs who seemed half dazed with misery and fear said that he remembered the lord cattrina entering avignon with a good many followers since he himself had levied the customary tolls on his company as for how long it was ago he could not say since his recollection failed himso much had happened since so he bade them farewell until they met in heaven which he added doubtless would be soon  the evening drew on wearily enough they had trudged round the great roche des doms looking up at the huge palace of the pope where the fires burned night and day and the guards watched at the shut gates that forbidden palace into which no man might enter leaving it they struck down a street that was new to them which led toward their borrowed dwelling of the brides tower this street was very empty save for a few miserable creatures some of whom lay dead or dying in the gutters others lurked about in doorways or behind the pillars of gates probably for no good purpose they heard the footsteps of a man following them who seemed to keep in the shadow but took no heed since they set him down as some wretched thief who would never dare to attack three armed men it did not occur to them that this was none other than the notary basil clad in a new robe who for purposes of his own was spying upon their movements  they came to a large ruinouslooking house of which the gateway attracted grey dicks sharp eyes  what does that entrance remind you of master he asked  hugh looked at it carelessly and answered  why of the preceptory at dunwich see there are the same arms upon the stone shield doubtless once the knights templar dwelt there sir andrew may have visited this place in his youth  as the words left his lips two men came out of the gateway one of them a physician to judge by the robe and the case of medicines which he carried the other a very tall person wrapped in a long cloak the physician was speaking  she may live or she may die he said she seems strong the pest you say has been on her for four days which is longer than most endure it she has no swellings and has not bled from the lungs though on the other hand she is now insensible which often precedes the end i can say no more it is in the hands of god yes i will ask you to pay me the fee now who knows if you will be alive to do so tomorrow if she dies before then i recommend you to throw her into the river which the pope has blessed it is cleaner burial than the plague pit i presume she is your granddaughtera beautiful woman pity she should be wasted thus but many others are in a like case if she awakes give her good food and if you cannot get thatwine of which there is plenty five gold piecesthank you and he hurried away  little have you told me physician that i did not know already said the tall hooded figure in a deep voice the sound of which thrilled hugh to his marrow yet you are right it is in the hands of god and to those hands i trustnot in vain i think  sir said hugh addressing him out of the shadow in which he stood be pleased to tell me if you will whether you have met in this town a knight of the name of sir edmund acour for of him i am in search  sir edmund acour answered the figure no i have not met him in avignon though it is like enough that he is here yet i have known of this knight far away in england  was it at blythburgh in suffolk perchance asked hugh  ay at blythburgh in suffolk but who are you that speak in english and know of blythburgh in suffolk  oh cried hugh what do you here sir andrew arnold  the old man threw back his hood and stared at him  hugh de cressi by christs holy name he exclaimed yes and richard the archer also the light is bad i did not see your faces welcome hugh thrice welcome and he threw his arms about him and embraced him come enter my lodgings i have much to say to you  one thing i desire to learn most of all father the rest can wait who is the sick lady of whom you spoke to yonder physicianshe that he thought was your granddaughter  who could it be hugh except eve clavering  eve gasped hugh eve dying of the pest  nay son who said so she is ill not dying who i believe will live for many years  you believe father you believe why this foul plague scarce spares one in ten oh why do you believe  god teaches me to do so answered the old knight solemnly i only sent for that physician because he has medicines which i lack but it is not in him and his drugs that i put my trust come let us go in and see her  so they went up the stairs and turned down a long passage into which the light flowed dimly through large open casements  who is that asked hugh suddenly i thought that one brushed past me though i could see nothing  ay broke in the lad david who was following and i felt a cold wind as though some one stirred the air  grey dick also opened his lips to speak then changed his mind and was silent but sir andrew said impatiently  i saw no one therefore there was no one to see enter and he opened the door  now they found themselves in a lighted room beyond which lay another room  bide you here richard with your companion said sir andrew hugh follow me and let us learn whether i have trusted to god in vain  then very gently he opened the door and they passed in together closing it behind them  this is what hugh saw at the far end of the room was a bed near to which stood a lamp that showed sitting up in the bed a beautiful young woman whose dark hair fell all about her her face was flushed but not wasted or made dreadful by the sickness as happened to so many there she sat staring before her with her large dark eyes and a smile upon her sweet lips like one that muses on happy things  see whispered sir andrew she is awakened from her swoon i think i did not trust in vain my son  she caught the tones of his voice and spoke  is that you father she asked dreamily draw near for i have such a strange story to tell you  he obeyed leaving hugh in the shadow and she went on  just now i awoke from my sleep and saw a man standing by my bed  yes yes sir andrew said the physician whom i sent for to see you  do physicians in avignon wear caps of red and yellow and robes of black fur and strings of great black pearls that to tell truth i coveted sorely she asked laughing a little no no if this were a physician he is of the sort that heals souls indeed now that i think of it when i asked him his name and business he answered that the first was the helper and the second to bring peace to those in trouble  well daughter and what else did the man say asked sir andrew soothingly  you think i wander she said interpreting the tone of his voice and not his words but indeed it is not so well he said little only that i had been very ill near to death in truth much nearer than i thought but that now i should recover and within a day or two be quite well and strong again i asked him why he had come to tell me this he replied because he thought that i should like to know that he had met one whom i loved in the city of venice in italy one who was named hugh de cressi yes father he said hugh de cressi who with his squire an archer had befriended him thereand that this hugh was well and would remain so and that soon i should see him again also he added that he had met one whom i hated who was named the lord of cattrina and that if this cattrina threatened me i should do wisely to fly back to england since there i should find peace and safety then suddenly just before you came in he was gone  you have strange dreams eve said sir andrew yet there is truth in their madness now be strong lest joy should kill you as it has done by many a one before  then he turned to the shadow behind him and said come next instant hugh was kneeling at eves bedside and pressing his lips upon her hand    oh they had much to say to each other so much that the half of it remained unsaid still hugh learned that she and sir andrew had come to avignon upon the popes summons to lay this matter of her alleged marriage before him in person when they reached the town they found it already in the grip of the great plague and that to see his holiness was almost impossible since he had shut himself up in his palace and would admit no one yet an interview was promised through sir andrews highplaced friends only then the sickness struck eve and she could not go nor was sir andrew allowed to do so since he was nursing one who lay ill  then hugh began to tell his tale to which eve and sir andrew arnold listened greedily of murgh for sundry reasons he said nothing and of the fight from which acour had fled in venice before the earthquake but little he told them however that he had heard that this acour had been or was in avignon and that he had learned from a notary named basil whom he hugh had retained that acour had won from the pope a confirmation of his marriage  a lie interrupted sir andrew his holiness caused me to be informed expressly that he would give no decision in this cause until all the case was before him  as he said the words a disturbance arose in the outer room and the harsh voice of grey dick was heard saying  back you dog would you thrust yourself into the chamber of the lady of clavering back or i will cast you through the windowplace  sir andrew went to see what was the matter and hugh breaking off his tale followed him to find the notary basil on his knees with grey dick gripping him by the collar of his robe  sir knight said basil recognizing hugh should i your faithful agent be treated thus by this fiercefaced squire of yours  that depends on what you have done sir lawyer answered hugh motioning to dick to loose the man  all i have done sir knight is to follow you into a house where i chanced to see you enter in order to give you some good tidings then this fellow caught me by the throat and said that if i dared to break in upon the privacy of one whom he called red eve and lady clavering he would kill me  he had his orders lawyer  then sir knight he might have executed them less roughly had he but told me that you were alone with some lady i should have understand and withdrawn for a while although to do so would have been to let precious moments slip and the leanfaced knave leered horribly  cease your foul talk and state your business interrupted sir andrew thrusting himself in front of hugh who he feared would strike the fellow  and pray who may you be asked the lawyer glancing up at the tall figure that towered above him  sir andrew threw back his hood revealing his aged hawklike countenance his dark and flashing eyes and his snowwhite hair and beard  if you would learn man he said in his great voice in the world i was known as sir andrew arnold one of the priors of the order of the templars which is a name that you may have heard but now that i have laid aside all worldly pomp and greatness i am but father andrew of dunwich in england  yes yes i have heard the name who has not said the lawyer humbly also you are here as guardian to the lady eve clavering are you not to lay a certain cause before his holiness oh do not start all these matters came to my knowledge who am concerned in every great business in avignon as the chief agent and procurator of the papal court though it is true that this tiding has reached me only within the last few minutes and from the lips of your own people holy father i pray your pardon for breaking in upon you which i did only because the matter is very pressing sir hugh de cressi here has a cause to lay before the pope with which you may be acquainted well for two days i have striven to win him an audience and now through my sole influence behold tis granted see here and he produced a parchment that purported to be signed by the popes secretary and countersigned by a cardinal and read  if the english knight sir hugh de cressi and his squire the captain richard will be in the chamber of audience at the palace at seven of the clock this evening that is within something less than half an hour his holiness will be pleased to receive them as a most special boon having learned that the said sir hugh is a knight much in favour with his grace of england who appointed him his champion in a combat that was lately to be fought at venice  thats true enough though i know not how the pope heard of it interrupted hugh  through me sir knight for i learn everything none have so much power in avignon as i although it often pleases me to seem poor and of no account but let that pass either you must take this opportunity or be content not to see his holiness at all orders have been issued because of the increase of this pest in avignon that from tonight forward none shall be admitted to the palace upon any pretext whatsoever no not even a king  then i had best go said hugh  ay answered sir andrew and return here with your tidings as soon as may be yet he added in a low voice to grey dick i love not the look of this scurvy guide of yours could not your master have found a better attorney  perhaps answered dick that is if one is left alive in avignon being in haste we took the first that came to hand and it seems that he will serve our turn at least if he plays tricks i promise it will be the worse for him and he looked grimly at the rogue who was talking to david day and appeared to hear nothing  so they went and with them david who had witnessed the confession of father nicholas therefore they thought it best that he should accompany them to testify to it if there were need  bid my lady keep a good heart and say that i will be with her again ere long said hugh as they descended the stairs in haste  following the guidance of basil they turned first this way and then that till soon in the gathering darkness they knew not where they were  what was the name of the street in which sir andrew had his lodging asked hugh halting  rue st benezet answered basil forward we have no time to lose  did you tell sir andrew where we dwelt master said dick presently for i did not  by my faith dick no it slipped my mind  then it will be hard for him to find us if he has need master in this rabbit warren of a town still that cant be mended now i wish we were clear of this business for it seems to me that yon fellow is not leading us toward the palace almost am i minded and he looked at basil then checked himself  presently dick wished it still more taking yet another turn they found themselves in an open square or garden that was surrounded by many mean houses in this square great pestfires burned lighting it luridly by the flare of them they saw that hundreds of people were gathered there listening to a madeyed friar who was preaching to them from the top of a winecart as they drew near to the crowd through which basil was leading them hugh heard the friar shouting  men of avignon this pest which kills us is the work not of god but of the jew blasphemers and of the sorcerers who are in league with them i tell you that two such sorcerers who pass as englishmen are in your city now and have been consorting with the jews plotting your destruction one looks like a young knight but the other has the face of death himself and both of them wrought murders in a neighbouring town to protect the jews until you kill the accursed jews this plague will never pass you will die every one of you with your wives and children if you do not kill the jews and their familiars  just then the man rolling his wild eyes about caught sight of hugh and dick  see he screamed there are the wizards who in venice were seen in the company of the enemy of mankind that good christian basil has brought them face to face with you as he promised me that he would  as he heard these words hugh drew his sword and leapt at basil but the rogue was watching with a yell of fear he threw himself among the crowd and there vanished  out weapons and back to back cried hugh for we are snared  so the three of them ranged themselves together facing outward in front of them gleamed grey dicks axe hughs sword and davids great knife in a moment the furious mob was surging round them like the sea howling down with the foreign wizards kill the friends of the jews one solid wall of changing white faces  a man struck at them with a halbert but the blow fell short for he was afraid to come too near grey dick leapt forward and in a moment was back again leaving that man dead smitten through from skull to chin for a while there was silence since this sudden death gave them pause and in it hugh cried out  are blameless men to be murdered thus have we no friends in avignon  some answered a voice from the outer shadow though who spoke they could not see  save the protectors of the jews cried the voice again  then came a rush and a counterrush fighting began around them in which they took no share when it had passed over them like a gust of wind david day was gone killed or trodden down as his companions thought  now master we are alone said grey dick set your shoulders against mine and let us die a death that these dogs of avignon will remember  ay ay answered hugh but dont overreach dick tis ever the archers fault  the mob closed in on them then rolled back like water from a rock leaving some behind again they closed in and again rolled back  bring bows they cried widening out bring bows and shoot them down  ah gasped dick that is a game two can play now that i have arm room  almost before the words had left his lips the great black bow he bore was out and strung next instant the shafts began to rush piercing all before them till at the third arrow those in front of him melted away save such as would stir no more only now missiles began to come in answer from this side and from that although as yet none struck them  unstring your bow dick and let us charge said hugh we have no other chance save flight theyll pelt us under  dick did not seem to hear at least he shot on as one who was not minded to die unavenged an arrow whistled through hughs cap lifting it from his head and another glanced from the mail on his shoulder he ground his teeth with rage for now none would come within reach of his long sword  goodbye friend dick he said i die charging and with a cry of a cressi a cressi he sprang forward  one leap and dick was at his side who had only bided to sheath his bow the mob in front melted away before the flash of the white sword and the gleam of the grey axe still they must have fallen for their pursuers closed in behind them like hunting hounds when they view the quarry and there were none to guard their backs but once more the shrill voice cried  help the friends of the jews save those who saved rebecca and her children  then again there came a rush of darkbrowed men who hissed and whistled as they fought  so fierce was the rush that those who followed them were cut off and dick glancing back over his shoulder saw the madeyed priest their leader go down like an ox beneath the blow of a leaded bludgeon a score of strides and they were out of the range of the firelight another score and they were hidden by the gloom in the mouth of one of the narrow streets  which way now gasped hugh looking back at the square where in the flare of the great fires christians and jews fighting furiously looked like devils struggling in the mouth of hell  as he spoke a shockheaded halfclad lad darted up to them and dick lifted his axe to cut him down  friend he said in a guttural voice not foe i know where you dwell trust and follow me who am of the kin of rebecca wife of nathan  lead on then kin of rebecca exclaimed hugh but know that if you cheat us you die  swift swift cried the lad lest those swine should reach your house before you and catching hugh by the hand he began to run like a hare  down the dark streets they went past the great rock where the fires burned at the gates of the palace of the pope then along more streets and across an open place where thieves and nightbirds peered at them curiously but at the sight of their drawn steel slunk away at length their guide halted  see he said there is your dwelling enter now and up with the bridge hark they come farewell  he was gone from down the street to their left rose shouts and the sound of many running feet but there in front of them loomed the tower against the black and rainy sky they dashed across the little drawbridge that spanned the moat and seizing the cranks wound furiously slowly ah how slowly it rose for it was heavy and they were but two tired men also the chains and cogs were rusty with disuse yet it did rise and as it came home at last the fierce mob thirsting for their blood and guessing where they would refuge appeared in front of it and by the light of some torches which they bore caught sight of them  come in friends mocked grey dick as they ran up and down the edge of the moat howling with rage and disappointment come in if you would sup on arrowheads such as this and he sent one of his deadly shafts through the breast of a redheaded fellow who waved a torch in one hand and a blacksmiths hammer in the other  then they drew back taking the dead man with them but as they went one cried  the jews shall not save you again wizards for if we cannot come at you to kill you well starve you till you die stay there and rot or step forth and be torn to pieces as it pleases you english wizards  then they all slunk back and vanished or seemed to vanish down the mouths of the dark streets that ran into the open place in front of the dwelling which hugh had named the brides tower  now said dick wiping the sweat from his brow as they barred the massive door of the house we are safe for this night at least and can eat and sleep in peace see you master i have taken stock of this old place which must have been built in rough times for scarce a wall of it is less than five feet thick the moat is deep all round fire cannot harm it and it is loopholed for arrows and not commanded by any other building having the open place in front and below the wide fosse of the ancient wall upon which it stands therefore even with this poor garrison of two it can be taken only by storm this while we have bows and arrows will cost them something seeing that we could hold the tower from stair to stair  ay dick answered hugh sadly doubtless we can make a fight for it and take some with us to a quieter world if they are foolish enough to give us a chance but what did that fellow shout as to starving us out how stand we for provisions  foreseeing something of the sort i have reckoned that up master theres good water in the courtyard well and those who owned this tower whoever they may have been laid in great store perchance for the marriage feast or perchance when the plague began knowing that it would bring scarcity the cupboards and the butteries are filled with flour dried flesh wine olives and oil for burning even if these should fail us there are the horses in the stable which we can kill and cook for of forage and fuel i have found enough  then the pope should not be more safe than we dick said hugh with a weary smile if any are safe in avignon today well let us go and eat of all this plenty but oh i wish i had told sir andrew where we dwelt or could be sure in which of that maze of streets he and red eve are lodged dick dick that knave basil has fooled us finely  ay master said dick setting his grim lips but let him pray his saint that before all is done i do not fool him    chapter xviii  the plague pit  seven long days had gone by and still hugh and grey dick held out in their tower fortress though as yet unhurt they were weary indeed since they must watch all night and could only sleep by snatches in the daytime one lying down to rest while the other kept guard  as they had foreseen except by direct assault the place proved impregnable its moat protecting it upon three sides and the sheer wall of the old city terminating in the deep fosse upon the fourth in its little armoury among other weapons they had found a great store of arrows and some good bows whereof hugh took the best and longest thus armed with these they placed themselves behind the loopholes of the embattled gateway whence they could sweep the space before them or if danger threatened them elsewhere there were embrasures whence they could command the bases of the walls lastly also there was the central tower whereof they could hold each landing with the sword  thrice they had been attacked since there seemed to be hundreds of folk in avignon bent upon their destruction but each time their bitter arrows that rarely seemed to miss had repulsed the foe with loss even when an onslaught was delivered on the main gateway at night they had beaten their assailants by letting fall upon them through the machicoulis or overhanging apertures great stones that had been piled up there perhaps generations before when the place was built  still the attacks did not slacken indeed the hate of the citizens of avignon against these two bold englishmen whose courage and resource they attributed to help given to them by the powers of evil seemed to grow from day to day even as the plague grew in the streets of that soreafflicted city from their walls they could see friars preaching a kind of crusade against them they pointed toward the tower with crucifixes invoking their hearers to pull it stone from stone and slay the wizards within the wizards who had conspired with the accursed jews even beneath the eyes of his holiness the pope to bring doom on avignon  the eighth morn broke at length and its first red rays discovered hugh and dick kneeling side by side behind the battlements of the gateway each of them was making petition to heaven in his own fashion for forgiveness of his sins since they were outworn and believed that this day would be their last  what did you pray for dick asked hugh glancing at his companions fierce face which in that half light looked deathlike and unearthly  what did i pray for well for the first part let it be thats betwixt me and whatever power sent me out to do its business on the earth but for the lastill tell you it was that we may go hence with such a guard of dead french as never yet escorted two englishmen from avignon to heavenor hell ay and we will master for today as they shouted to us theyll storm this tower but if our strength holds out theres many a one wholl never win its crest  rather would i have died peacefully dick yet the blood of these hounds will not weigh upon my soul seeing that they seek to murder us for no fault except that we saved a woman and two children from their cruel devilries oh could i but know that red eve and sir andrew were safe away id die a happy man  i think we shall know that and much more before tomorrows dawn master or never know anything again look they gather yonder now let us eat for perhaps later we shall find no time    the afternoon drew on toward evening and still these two lived of all the hundreds of missiles which were shot or hurled at them although a few struck not one of them had pierced their armour so as to do them hurt the walls and battlements or some good fate had protected them thrice had the french come on and thrice they had retreated before those arrows that could not miss and as yet bridge and doors were safe  look said dick as he set down a cup of wine that he had drained for his thirst was raging they send an embassy and he pointed to a priest the same madeyed fellow who preached in the square when the notary basil led them into a trap and to a man with him who bore a white cloth upon a lance shall i shoot them  nay answered hugh why kill crazed folk who think that they serve god in their own fashion we will hear what they have to say  presently the pair stood within speaking distance and the priest called out  hearken you wizards so far your master the devil has protected you but now your hour has come we have authority from those who rule this city and from the church to summon you to surrender and if you will not then to slay you both  that you shameless friar answered hugh you have been striving to do these many days yet it is not we who have been slain although we stand but two men against a multitude but if we surrender what then  then you shall be put upon your trial wizards and if found guilty burned if innocent set free  put upon our trial before our executioners why i think those fires are alight already nay nay mad priest go back and tell those whom you have fooled that if they want us they can come and take us which theyll not do living  then the furious friar began to curse them hurling at them the anathemas of the church till at length dick called to him to begone or he would send an arrow to help him on the road  so they went and presently the sun sank  now let us beware said dick the moon is near her full and will rise soon theyll attack between times when we cannot see to shoot  ay answered hugh moreover now this gateway is no place for us of arrows there are few left nor could we see to use them in the dark the stones too are all spent and therefore they can bridge the moat and batter down the doors unharmed  what then asked dick as we cannot fly where shall we die  on the roof of the old tower i think whence we can hurl ourselves at last and so perhaps escape being taken alive and torment look you dick that tower is mounted by three straight flights of steps the first two of these well hold with such arrows as remain to usthere are three and twenty as i thinkand the last with axe and sword listen they come take a brand from the hall hearth and let us go light the flambeaux  so they went and set fire to the great torches of wood and tallow that were set in their iron holders to light the steps of the tower ere the last of them was burning they heard their enemies ravening without  listen said hugh as they descended to the head of the first flight of stairs they are across the moat  as he spoke the massive doors crashed in beneath the blows of a baulk of timber  now said hugh as they strung their bows six arrows apiece here if we can get off so many and the odd eleven at our next stand ah they come  the mob rushed into the hall below waving torches and swords and hunting it as dogs hunt a covert  the english wizards have hid themselves away cried a voice let us burn the place for so we are sure to catch them  nay nay answered another voice that of the mad friar we must have them beneath the torture that we may learn how to lift the curse from avignon and the names of their accomplices on earth and in hell search search search  little need to search said grey dick stepping out on to the landing devil go join your fellowdevils in that hell you talk of and he sent an arrow through his heart  for a moment there followed the silence of consternation while the mob stood staring at their fallen leader then with a yell of rage they charged the stair and that fray began which was told of in avignon for generations hugh and dick shot their arrows nor could they miss seeing what was their target indeed some of those from the great black bow pinned foe to foe beneath them but so crowded were the assailants on the narrow stair that they could not shoot back they advanced helpless thrust to their doom by the weight of those who pressed behind  now they were near the dead still on their feet being borne forward by the living to whom they served as shields hugh and dick ran to the head of the second flight and thence shot off the arrows that remained  dick loosed the last of them and of this fearful shaft it was said that it slew three men piercing through the body of one the throat of the second and burying its barb in the skull of the third on the lowest step now dick unstrung his bow and thrust it into its case on his shoulder for he was minded that they should go together at the last  shafts have sung their song he said with a fierce laugh now it is the turn of the axe and sword to make another music  then he gripped sir hugh by the hand saying  farewell master oh i hold this a merry death such as the saints grant to few ay and so would you were you as free as i am well doubtless your lady has gone before or at worst soon she will follow after and greet you in the gate of death where murgh sits and keeps his count of passing souls  farewell friend answered hugh be she quick or dead thus red eve would wish that i should die a cressi a cressi he cried and drove his sword through the throat of a soldier who rushed at him    they fought a very good fight as doubtless the dead were telling each other while they passed from that red stair to such rest as they had won they had fought a very good fight and it was hard to say which had done the best hughs white sword or dicks grey axe and now unwounded still save for a bruise or two they stood there in the moonlight upon the stark edge of the tall tower the foe in front and black space beneath there they stood leaning on axe and sword and drawing their breath in great sobs those two great harvestmen who that day had toiled so hard in the rich fields of death  for a while the evergathering crowd of their assailants remained still staring at them then the leaders began to whisper to each other for they scarcely seemed to dare to talk aloud  what shall we do asked one these are not men no men could have fought as they have fought us for seven days and at last have slain us like sparrows in a net and themselves remained unhurt  no answered another and no mortal archer could send his shaft through the bodies of three still it is finished now unless they find wings and fly away so let us take them  yes yes broke in grey dick with his hissing laugh come and take us you curs of avignon having our breath again we are ready to be taken and he lifted his axe and shook it  seize them shouted the leader of the french seize them echoed those who poured up the stairs behind  but there the matter ended since none could find stomach to face that axe and sword so at length they took another counsel  bring bows and shoot them through the legs thus we shall bring them living to their trial commanded the captain of the men of avignon he was their fourth captain on that one day for the other three lay upon the stairs or in the hall  now hugh and dick spoke together few words and swift as to whether they should charge or leap from the wall and have done with it while they spoke a little cloud floated over the face of the moon so that until it had gone the french could not see to shoot  its too risky said hugh if they capture us we must die a death to which i have no mind let us hurl our weapons at them then leap  so be it whispered dick do you aim at the captain on the left and i will take the other ready now i think one creeps near to us  i think so too hugh whispered back i felt the touch of his garments only he seemed to pass us from behind which cannot be  the cloud passed and once again they were bathed in silver light it showed the men of avignon already bending their bows it showed hugh and grey dick lifting axe and sword to hurl them but between them and their mark it showed also a figure that they knew well a stern and terrible figure wearing a strange cap of red and yellow and a cape of rich black fur  o god of heaven tis murgh the helper gasped hugh  ay murgh the fire murgh the sword said dick adding quietly it is true i was wondering whether he would prove as good as his word look now look they see him also  see him they did indeed and for a moment there was silence on that crowded tower top where stood at least a score of men while their fellows packed the hall and stair below by hundreds all stared at murgh and murgh stared back at them with his cold eyes then a voice screamed  satan satan come from hell to guard his own death himself is with you fly men of avignon fly  small need was there for this command already casting down their bows those on the tower top were rushing to the mouth of the stair and since it was blocked with men using their swords upon them to hew a road now those below thinking that it was the english wizards who slew them struck back  presently all that stair and the crowded hall below black as the mouth of the pit for such lights as still burned soon were swept away rang with the screams and curses and stifled groans of the trodden down or dying in the pitchy darkness brother smote brother friend trampled out the life of friend till the steep steps were piled high and the doorways blocked with dead so hideous were the sounds indeed that hugh and grey dick crossed themselves thinking that hell had come to avignon or avignon sunk down to hell but murgh only folded his whitegloved hands upon his breast and smiled  at length save for the moaning of those hurt men who still lived the dreadful tumult sank to silence then murgh turned and spoke in his slow and icy voice  you were about to seek me in the fosse of this high tower were you not hugh de cressi and richard archer a foolish thought in truth and a sinful so sinful that it would have served you well if i had let you come but your strait was sore and your faith was weak and i had no such command therefore i have come to others whose names were written in my book ay and being half human after allfor does not your creed tell you that i was born of sin i rejoice that it is given to me to protect those who would have protected me when i seemed to stand helpless in the hands of cruel men nay thank me not what need have i of your thanks which are due to god alone and question me not for why should i answer your questions even if i know those answers only do my bidding this night seek whom you will in avignon but tomorrow ere the dawn ride away for we three must meet again at a place appointed before this winters snows are passed  o dread lord of death one thing only one began hugh  but murgh held up his whitegloved hand and replied  have i not said that i answer no questions now go forth and follow the promptings of your heart till we meet again  then gliding to the head of the stair he vanished in the shadow  say what shall we do asked hugh in amazed voice  it matters little what we do or leave undone master seeing that we are forefated men whom as i think none can harm until a day that will not dawn tomorrow nor yet awhile therefore let us wash ourselves and eat and borrow new garments if we can find any that are not soiled and then if the horses are still unharmed mount and ride from this accursed avignon for england  nay dick since first we must learn whether or no we leave friends behind us here  ay master if you will but since yonder murgh said nothing of them it was in my mind that they are either dead or fled  not dead i pray dick oh i am sure not dead and i left living when red eve and i met murgh had been with her and promised that she would recover and be strong answered hugh bravely although there was a note of terror in his voice  red eve has other foes in avignon besides the pest muttered grey dick adding still let us have faith it is a good friend to man did not yonder helper chide us for our lack of it  they forced a way down the deadcumbered tower stair crawling through the darkness over the bodies of the fallen they crossed the hall that also was full of dead and of wounded whose pitiful groans echoed from the vaulted roof and climbed another stair to their chamber in the gateway tower here from a spark of fire that still smouldered on the hearth they lit the lamps of oliveoil and by the light of them washed off the stains of battle and refreshed themselves with food and wine these things done dick returned to the hall and presently brought thence two suits of armour and some cloaks which he had taken either from the walls or from off the slain in these they disguised themselves as best they could as de noyon had disguised himself at crecy  then having collected a store of arrows whereof many lay about they departed by the back entrance the great front doorway was so choked with corpses that they could not pass it since here had raged the last fearful struggle to escape going to the little stableyard where they found their horses unharmed in the stalls although frightened by the tumult and stiff from lack of exercise they fed and saddled them and led them out so presently they looked their last upon the brides tower that had sheltered them so well  it has served our turn said hugh glancing back at it from the other side of the deserted square but oh i pray heaven that we may never see that charnelhouse again  as he spoke a figure appeared from the shadow of a doorway and ran toward them thinking it was that of some foe dick lifted his axe to cut him down whereon a voice cried in english  hold i am david  david exclaimed hugh then thanks be to god for know we thought you dead these many days  ay sir answered the young man as i thought you the rumour reached the jews among whom i have been hiding while i recovered of my hurts that the mad monk and his fellows had stormed the tower and killed you both therefore i crept out to learn for myself now i have found you by your voices who never again hoped to look upon you living and he began to sob in his relief and joy  come on lad said grey dick kindly this is no place for greetings  whither go you sir asked david as he walked forward alongside of the horses  to seek that house where we saw sir andrew arnold and the lady eve answered hugh if by any chance it can be found  that is easy sir said david as it happens i passed it not much more than an hour ago and knew it again  did you see any one there asked hugh eagerly  nay the windows were dark also the jew guiding me said he had heard that all who dwelt in that house were dead of the plague still of this matter he knew nothing for certain  hugh groaned but only answered  forward  as they went david told them his story it seemed that when he was struck down in the square where the crazy friar preached and like to be stabbed and trampled to death some of the jews dragged him into the shadow and rescued him afterward they took him to a horrid and squalid quarter called la juiverie into which no christian dare enter here he lay sick of his hurts and unable to get out until that very afternoon the widow rebecca whom they had saved nursing him all the while  did you hear aught of us asked dick  ay at first that you were holding dead brides tower bravely so as soon as i might i came to join you there if i could win in and you still lived but they told me that you had fallen at last  ah said dick well as it chances it was not we who fell but that tale is long still david you are a brave lad who would have come to die with us and my master will thank you when he can give his mind to such things say did you hear aught else  ay dick i heard two days ago that the french lord cattrina whom sir hugh was to have fought at venice had left avignon none knew why or whither he went  doubtless because of the plague and he wished to go where there was none answered dick  but hugh groaned again thinking to himself that acour would scarcely have left avignon if eve were still alive within its walls  after this they went on in silence meeting very few and speaking with none for the part of the great city through which they passed seemed to be almost deserted indeed in this quarter the pest was so fearful that all who remained alive and could do so had fled elsewhere leaving behind them only the sick and those who plundered houses  one thing i forgot to say said david presently the jews told me that they had certain information that the notary knave basil was paid by the lord cattrina to lead us to that square where the fires burned in order that we might be murdered there further our death was to be the signal for the massacre of all the jews only as it chanced their plan went awry  as will basils neck if ever i meet him again muttered grey dick beneath his breath lord what fools we were to trust that man well weve paid the price and please god so shall he  they turned the corner and rode down another street till presently david said  halt yonder is the house see the cognizance above the gateway  hugh and dick leapt from their horses the latter bidding david lead them into the courtyard and hold them there then they entered the house of which the door was ajar and by the shine of the moon that struggled through the windowplaces crept up the stairs and passages till they reached those rooms where sir andrew and eve had lodged  hist said dick and he pointed to a line of light that showed beneath the closed door  hugh pushed it gently and it opened a little they looked through the crack and within saw a man in a dark robe who was seated at a table counting out gold by the light of a lamp just then he lifted his head having felt the draught of air from the open door it was the notary basil  without a word they entered the room closing and bolting the door behind them then dick leapt on basil as a wolf leaps and held him fat while hugh ran past him and threw wide the door of that chamber in which eve had lain sick it was empty back he came again and in a terrible voice said  now sir notary where are the lady eve and sir andrew her guardian  alas sir knight began the knave in a quavering voice both of them are dead  what cried hugh supporting himself against the wall for at this terrible news his knees trembled beneath him have you or your patron cattrina murdered them  murdered them sir knight i do murder i a christian and a man of peace never and the noble lord of cattrina count de noyon why he wished to marry the lady not to murder her indeed he swore that she was his wife  so you know all these things do you villain said grey dick shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat  sir knight went on the frightened fellow blame me not for the acts of god he slew these noble persons not i i myself saw the lovely lady carried from this house wrapped in a red cloak  so you were in the house were you said grey dick shaking him again well whither did they carry her thief of the night  to the plague pit good sir where else in these times  now hugh groaned aloud his eyes closed and he seemed as though he were about to fall grey dick noting it for a moment let go of the notary and turned as though to help his master like a flash basil drew a dagger from under his dirty robe and struck at dicks back the blow was well aimed nor could an unprotected man on whom it fell have escaped death but although basil did not see it because of dicks long cloak beneath this cloak he wore the best of mail and on that mail the slender dagger broke its point falling harmless to the ground next instant dick had him again in his iron grip paying no further heed to hugh who had sunk to the floor a huddled heap he began to speak into the lawyers ear in his slow hissing voice  devil he said whether or no you murdered red eve and sir andrew arnold the saint i cannot say for certain though doubtless i shall learn in time at least a while ago you who had taken our money strove to murder both of us or cause us to be torn in pieces upon yonder square where the fires burned now too you have striven to murder me with that bodkin of yours not knowing fool that i am safe from all men well say your prayers since you too journey to the plague pit for so the gatherers of the dead will think you died  sir gasped the terrified wretch spare me and i will speak  more lies hissed dick into his ear nay go tell them to the father of lies for i have no time to waste in hearkening to them take your pay traitor  a few seconds later basil lay dead upon the floor  grey dick looked at him kneeling down he thrust his hands into the mans pockets and took thence the gold that he had been hiding away when they came upon him no small sum as it chanced  our own come back with interest he said with one of his silent laughs and we shall need monies for our faring why heres a writing also which may tell those who can read it something  he cast it on the table then turned to his master who was awakening from his swoon  dick helped him to his feet  what has passed asked hugh in a hollow voice  murgh answered dick pointing to the dead man on the floor  have you killed him friend  ay sure enough as he strove to kill me and again he pointed this time to the broken dagger  hugh made no answer only seeing the writing on the table took it up and began to read like one who knows not what he does presently his eyes brightened and he said  what does this mean i wonder hearken  rogue you have cheated me as you cheat all men and now i follow her who has gone be sure however that you shall reap your reward in due season de noyon  i know not said dick and the interpreter is silent and he kicked the body of basil perhaps i was a little over hasty who might have squeezed the truth out of him before the end  her who is gone reflected hugh aloud tis red eve who is gone and de noyon is scarcely the man to seek her among passed souls moreover the jews swear that he rode from avignon two days ago come dick let that carrion lie and to the plague pit    an hour later and they stood on the edge of that dreadful place hearing and seeing things which are best left untold a priest came up to them one of those good men who caring nothing for themselves still dared to celebrate the last rites of the church above the poor departed  friends he said you seem to be in trouble can i help you for jesus sake  perchance holy father answered hugh tell us you who watch this dreadful place was a woman wrapped in a red cloak thrown in here two or three days gone  alas yes said the priest with a sigh for i read the office over her and others nay what are you about to do by now she is two fathoms deep and burned away with lime so that none could know her if you enter there the guards will not let you thence living moreover it is useless pray to god to comfort you poor man as i will who am sure it will not be denied  then dick led or rather carried hugh from the brink of that awesome common grave    chapter xix  the doom  it was the last night of february the bitterest night perhaps of all that sad winter when at length hugh de cressi grey dick and david day rode into the town of dunwich only that morning they had landed at yarmouth after a long long journey whereof the perils and the horrors may be guessed but need not be written france through which they had passed seemed to be but one vast grave over which the wail of those who still survived went up without cease to the cold unpitying heavens  here in england the tale was still the same thus in the great seaport of yarmouth scarcely enough people were left alive to inter the unshriven dead nor of these would any stay to speak with them fearing lest they had brought a fresh curse from overseas even the horses that they rode they took from a stable where they whinnied hungrily none being there to feed them leaving in their place a writing of the debt  betwixt yarmouth and dunwich they had travelled through smitten towns and villages where a few wandered fearfully distraught with sorrow or seeking food in the streets the very dogs lay dead and in the fields they saw the carcasses of cattle dragged from the smokeless and deserted steadings and half hidden in a windingsheet of snow for the black plague spared neither man nor beast  at the little port of lowestoft they met a sullen sailorman who stood staring at the beach whereon his fishing boat lay overturned and awash for lack of hands to drag it out of reach of the angry sea they asked him if he knew of how it fared with dunwich  by way of answer he cursed them adding  must i be forever pestered as to dunwich this is the third time of late that i have heard of dunwich from wandering folk begone thither and gather tidings for yourselves which i hope will please you as well as they do me  now if i were not in haste i would stay a while to teach you manners you foulmouthed churl muttered grey dick between his teeth  let the fellow be said hugh wearily the men of lowestoft have ever hated those of dunwich and it seems that a common woe does not soften hearts soon enough we shall learn the truth  ay youll learn it soon enough shouted the brute after them dunwich boats wont steel lowestoft herrings for many a year  so they rode on through kessland which they reached as night was closing in through benacre and wrentham also past houses in which none seemed to dwell  murgh has been here before us i think said dick at length  then i hope that we may overtake him answered hugh with a smile for i need his tidingsor his rest oh dick dick he added i wonder has ever man borne a heavier burden for all this weary while if i were sure it would not be so bad for when earthly hope is done we may turn to other comfort but im not sure basil may have lied the priest by the pit could only swear to the red cloak of which there are many though few be buried in them and dick there are worse things than that perchance acour got her after all  and perchance he didnt answered dick well fret on if you will the thing does not trouble me who for my part am sure enough  of what man of what  of seeing the lady eve ere long  in this world or the next dick  in this i dont reckon of the next mayhap there we shall be blind and not see besides of what use is that world to you where it is written that they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels youll make no good angel im thinking while as for the lady eve shes too human for it as yet  why do you think we shall see her on earth asked hugh ignoring these reflections  because he who is called the helper said as much and whatever he may be he is no liar do you not remember what red eve told you when she awoke from that dream of hers which was no dream and do you not remember what sir andrew told you as to a certain meeting in the snowpest upon it and he wiped some of the driving flakes from his facesir andrew who is a saint and therefore like murgh can be no liar  if you think thus said hugh in a new voice why did you not say so before  because i love not argument master and if i had you would ever have reasoned with me from avignon to yarmouth town and spoilt my sleep of nights oh where is your faith  what is faith dick  the gift of belief master a very great gift seeing what a man believes is and will be true for him however false it may prove for others he who believes nothing sows nothing and therefore reaps nothing good or ill  who taught you these things dick  one whom i am not likely to forget or you either one who is my master at archery and whose words like his arrows though they be few yet strike the heart of hidden truth oh fear not doubtless sorrow waits you yonder and he pointed toward dunwich yet it comes to my lips that theres joy beyond the sorrows the joy of battle and of lovefor those who care for love which i think foolishness there stands a farm and the farmer is a friend of mine or used to be let us go thither and feed these poor beasts and ourselves or i think we will never come to dunwich through this cold and snow moreover he added thoughtfully joy or sorrow or both of them are best met by full men and i wish to look to your harness and my own for sword and axe are rusted with the sea who knows but that we may need them in dunwich or beyond when we meet with murgh as he promised that we should  so they rode up to the house and found dicks friend the farmer lying dead there in his own yard whither his family had dragged him ere they determined to fly the place still there was fodder in the stable and they lit a fire in the kitchen hearth and drank of the wine which they had brought with them from the ship and ate of the bacon which still hung from the rafters this done they lay down to sleep a while about one in the morning however hugh roused dick and david saying that he could rest no more and that something in his heart bade him push on to dunwich  then let us follow your heart master said dick yawning yet i wish it had waited till dawn to move you yes let us follow your heart to good or evil david go you out and saddle up those nags  for dick had worked late at their mail and weapons which now were bright and sharp again and was very weary    it was after three in the morning when at length leaving the heath they rode up to dunwich middlegate expecting to find it shut against them at such an hour but it stood open nor did any challenge them from the guardhouse  they keep an ill watch in dunwich nowadays grumbled dick well perchance there is one here to whom they can trust that business  hugh made no answer only pressed on down the narrow street that was deep and dumb with snow till at length they drew reign before the door of his fathers house in the marketplace the great house where he was born he looked at the windows and noted that although they were unshuttered no friendly light shone in them he called aloud but echo was his only answer echo and the moan of the bitter wind and the sullen roar of the sea  doubtless all men are asleep he said why should it be otherwise at such an hour let us enter and waken them  yes yes answered dick as he dismounted and threw the reins of his horse to david they are like the rest of dunwichasleep  so they entered and began to search the house by the dim light of the moon first they searched the lower chambers then those where hughs father and his brothers had slept and lastly the attics here they found the pallets of the servingfolk upon the floor but none at rest upon them  the house is deserted said hugh heavily  yes yes answered dick again in a cheerful voice doubtless master de cressi and your brothers have moved away to escape the pest  pray god they have escaped it muttered hugh this place stifles me he added let us out  whither shall we go master  to blythburgh manor he answered for there i may win tidings david bide you here and if you can learn aught follow us across the moor the manor cannot be missed  so once more hugh and dick mounted their horses and rode away through the town stopping now and again before some house they knew and calling to its inmates but though they called loudly none answered soon they grew sure that this was because there were none to answer since of those houses many of the doors stood open only one living creature did they see in dunwich as they turned the corner near to the blythburgh gate they met a greyhaired man wrapped up in tattered blankets which were tied about him with haybands he carried in his hand a beautiful flagon of silver doubtless he had stolen it from some church  seeing them he cast this flagon into the snow and began to whimper like a dog  mad tom said dick recognizing the poor fellow tell us thomas where are the folk of dunwich  dead dead all dead he wailed and fled away  stay what of master de cressi called hugh but the tower of the church round which he had vanished only echoed back across the snow what of master de cressi  then at last hugh understood the awful truth  it was that save those who had fled the people of dunwich were slain with the sword of pestilence and all his kin among them    they were on the blythburgh marshes travelling thither by the shortest road the moon was down and the darkness dense for the snowclouds hid the stars  let us bide here a while said grey dick as their horses blundered through the thick reeds it will soon be sunrise and if we go on in this gloom we shall fall into some boghole or into the river which i hear running on our left  so they halted their weary horses and sat still for in his wretchedness hugh cared not what he did  at length the east began to lighten turning the sky to a smoky red then the rim of the sun rising out of the whiteflecked ocean threw athwart the desolate marsh a fierce ray that lay upon the snows like a sword of blood they were standing on the crest of a little mound and dick looking about him knew the place  see he said pointing toward the river that ran near by it is just here that you killed young clavering this day two years ago yonder also i shot the french knights and red eve and you leapt into the blythe and swam it  ay said hugh looking up idly but did you say two years dick nay surely tis a score why he added in a changed voice who may that be in the hollow and he pointed to a tall figure which stood beneath them at a distance halfhidden by the dank snowmists  let us go and see said dick speaking almost in a whisper for there was that about this figure which sent the blood to his throat and cheeks  he drove the spurs into his tired horses sides causing it to leap forward  half a minute later they had ridden down the slope of the hollow a puff of wind that came with the sun drove away the mist dick uttered a choking cry and leapt from his saddle for there calm terrible mighty clothed in his red and yellow cap and robe of ebon furs stood he who was named murgh the fire murgh the sword murgh the helper murgh gateway of the gods  they knelt before him in the snow while screaming in their fright the horses fled away  knight and archer said murgh in his icy voice counting with the thumb of his whitegloved right hand upon the hidden fingers of his left friends you keep your tryst but there are more to come have patience there are more to come  then he became quiet nor dared they ask him any questions only at a motion of his arm they rose from their knees and stood before him  a long while they stood thus in silence till under murghs dreadful gaze hughs brain began to swim he looked about him seeking some natural thing to feed his eyes lo yonder was that which he might watch a hare crouching in its form not ten paces distant see out of the reeds crept a great red fox the hare smelt or saw and leaped away the fox sprang at it too late for the white fangs closed emptily behind its scut then with a little snarl of hungry rage it turned and vanished into the brake  the hare and the fox the dead reeds the rising sun the snowoh who had told him of these things  ah he remembered now and that memory set the blood pulsing in his veins for where these creatures were should be more besides grey dick and himself and the man of many names  he looked toward murgh to see that he had bent himself and with his gloved hand was drawing lines upon the snow those lines when they were done enclosed the shape of a grave  archer said murgh unsheath your axe and dig  as though he understood dick obeyed and began to hollow out a grave in the soft and boggy soil  hugh watched him like one who dreams wondering who was destined to fill that grave presently a sound behind caused him to turn his head  oh certainly he was mad for there over the rise not a dozen yards away came the beautiful ghost of eve clavering clad in her red cloak with her was another ghost that of old sir andrew arnold blood running down the armour beneath his robe and in his hand the hilt of a broken sword  hugh tried to speak but his lips were dumb nor did these ghosts take any heed of him for their eyes were fixed elsewhere to murgh they went and stood before him silent for a while he looked at them then asked in his cold voice  who am i eve clavering  the man who came to visit me in my dream at avignon and told me that i should live she answered slowly  and who say you that i am andrew arnold priest of christ the god  he whom i visited in my youth in far cathay answered the old knight in an awed whisper he who sat beside the pool behind the dragonguarded doors and was named gateway of the gods he who showed to me that we should meet again in such a place and hour as this  whence come you now priest and woman and why  we come from avignon we fled thence from one who would have done this maiden grievous wrong he followed us not an hour gone he overtook us with his knaves he set them on to seize this woman hanging back himself old as i am i slew them both and got my death in it and he touched the great wound in his side with the hilt of the broken sword our horses were the better we fled across the swamp for blythburgh he hunting us and seeking my life and her honour thus we found you as it was appointed  murgh turned his eyes following their glance for the first time they saw hugh de cressi and near him grey dick labouring at the grave eve stretched out her arms and so stood with head thrown back the light of the daybreak shining in her lovely eyes and on her outspread hair hugh opened his lips to speak but murgh lifted his hand and pointed behind them  they turned and there not twenty paces from them clad in armour and seated on a horse was edmund acour count de noyon seigneur of cattrina  he saw then wheeled round to fly  archer to your work said murgh you know it  ere the words had left his lips the great black bow was bent and ere the echoes died away the horse struck in its side by the keen arrow sank dying to the ground  then murgh beckoned to the rider and he came as a man who must but throwing down the bow grey dick once more began to labour at the grave like one who takes no further heed of aught save his allotted task  acour stood before murgh like a criminal before his judge  man said the awful figure addressing him where have you been and what have you done since last we spoke together in the midday dark at venice  now dragged word by slow word from his unwilling lips came the answer of the traitors heart  i fled from the field at venice because i feared this knight and you o spirit of death i journeyed to avignon in france and there strove to possess myself of yonder woman whom here in england with the help of one nicholas i had wed when she was foully drugged i strove to possess myself of her by fraud and by violence but some fate was against me she and that aged priest bribed the knave whom i trusted he caused a dead man and woman dressed in their garments to be borne from their lodging to the plague pit while they fled from avignon disguised  here for a moment grey dick paused from his labours at the grave and looked up at hugh then he fell to them again throwing out the peaty soil with both hands  my enemy and his familiar for man he can scarcely be went on acour pointing first to hugh and then to dick survived all my plans to kill them and instead killed those whom i had sent after them i learned that the woman and the priest were not dead but fled and followed them and after me came my enemy and his familiar twice we passed each other on the road once we slept in the same house i knew them but they knew me not and the fate which blinded me from them saved them also from all my plots to bring them to their doom the woman and the priest took ship to england and i followed in another ship being made mad with desire and with jealous rage for there i knew my enemy would find and win her in the darkness before this very dawn i overtook the woman and the priest at last and set my fellows on to kill the man myself i would strike no blow fearing lest my death should come upon me and so i should be robbed of her but god fought with his aged servant who in his youth was the first of knights he slew my men then fled on with the woman eve of clavering i followed knowing that he was sore wounded and must die and that then the beauty which has lured me to shame and ruin would be mine if only for an hour i followed and here at this place of evil omen where first i saw my foe i found you o incarnate sword of vengeance  murgh unfolded his bare arms and lifted his head which was sunk upon his breast  your pardon he said gently my name is hand of fate and not sword of vengeance there is no vengeance save that which men work upon themselves what fate may be and vengeance may be i know not fully and none will ever know until they have passed the gateway of the gods archer the grave is deep enough come forth now and let us learn who it is decreed shall fill it knights the hour is at hand for you to finish that which you began at crecy and at venice  hugh heard and drew his sword acour drew his sword also then cried out pointing to grey dick  here be two against one if i conquer he will shoot me with his bow  have no fear sir thief and liar hissed grey dick for that shaft will not be needed slay the master if you can and go safe from the squire and he unstrung his black bow and hid it in its case  now hugh stepped to where red eve stood the wounded sir andrew leaning on her shoulder bending down he kissed her on the lips saying  soon very soon my sweet whom i have lost and found again you will be mine on earth or i shall be yours in heaven this then in greeting or farewell  in greeting beloved not in farewell she answered as she kissed him back for if you die know that i follow hard upon your road yet i say that yonder grave was not dug for you  nay not for you son not for you said sir andrew lifting his faint head one fights for you whom you do not see and against him satan and his servant cannot stand and letting fall the sword hilt he stretched out his thin hand and blessed him  now when acour saw that embrace his jealous fury prevailed against his fears with a curse upon his lips he leapt at hugh and smote thinking to take him unawares but hugh was watching and sprang back and then the fray began if fray it can be called  a wild joy shining in his eyes hugh grasped his long sword with both hands and struck so great was that blow that it bit through acours armour beneath his right arm deep into the flesh and sent him staggering back again he struck and wounded him in the shoulder a third time and clove his helm so that the blood poured down into his eyes and blinded him  back reeled acour back to the very edge of the grave and stood there swaying to and fro at the sight of his helplessness hughs fury seemed to leave him his lifted sword sank downward  let god deal with you knave he said for i cannot  for a while there was silence there they stood and stared at the smitten man waiting the end whatever it might be they all stared save murgh who fixed his stony eyes upon the sky  presently it came the sword falling from acours hand into the grave rested there point upward with a last effort he drew his dagger dashing the blood from his eyes he hurled it with all his dying strength not at hugh but at red eve past her ear it hissed severing a little tress of her long hair which floated down on to the snow  then acour threw his arms wide and fell backwardfell backward and vanished in the grave  dick ran to look there he lay dead pierced through back and bosom by the point of his own sword  for one brief flash of time a black doveshaped bird was seen hovering round the head of murgh  finished said dick straightening himself well i had hoped to see a better fight but cowards die as cowards live  leaning on red eves shoulder sir andrew limped to the side of the grave they both looked down on that which lay therein  daughter said the old man through many dangers it has come about as i foretold the bond that in your drugged sleep bound you to this highborn knave is severed by gods sword of death christ have pity on his sinful soul now sir hugh de cressi come hither and be swift for my time is short  hugh obeyed and at a sign took eve by the hand then speaking very low and as quickly as he might for all his life was draining from him through the red wound in his side the old priest spoke the hallowed words that bound these two together till death should part them yes there by the graveside over the body of the dead acour there in the red light of the morning amidst the lonely snows was celebrated the strangest marriage the world has ever seen in natures church it was celebrated with the grim grey archer for a clerk and deaths own fearful minister for congregation  it was done and with uplifted trembling hands sir andrew blessed them boththem and the fruit of their bodies which was to be he blessed them in the name of the allseeing god he served he bade them put aside their grief for those whom they had lost soon he said their short day done the lost would be found again made glorious and with them himself who loving them both on earth would love them through eternity  then while their eyes grew blind with tears and even the fierce archer turned aside his face sir andrew staggered to where he stood who in the land of sunrise had been called gateway of the gods before him he bent his grey and ancient head  o thou who dwellest here below to do the will of heaven to thee i come as once thou badest me he said and was silent  murgh let his eyes rest on him then stretching out his hand he touched him very gently on the breast and as he touched him smiled a sweet and wondrous smile  good and faithful servant he said thy work is done on earth now i whom all men fear though i be their friend and helper am bidden by the lord of life and death to call thee home look up and pass  the old priest obeyed it seemed to those who watched that the radiance on the face of murgh had fallen upon him also he smiled he stretched his arms upward as though to clasp what they might not see then down he sank gently as though upon a bed and lay white and still in the white still snow    the helper turned to the three who remained alive  farewell for a little time he said i must be gone but when we meet again as meet we shall then fear me not for have you not seen that to those who love me i am gentle  hugh de cressi and red eve made no answer for they knew not what to say but grey dick spoke out boldly  sir lord or sir spirit he said save once at the beginning when the arrow burst upon my string i never feared you nor do i fear your gifts and he pointed to the grave and to dead sir andrew which of late have been plentiful throughout the world as we of dunwich know therefore i dare to ask you one question ere we part for a while why do you take one and leave another is it because you must or because every shaft does not hit its mark  now murgh looked him up and down with his sunken eyes then answered  come hither archer and i will lay my hand upon your heart also and you shall learn  nay cried grey dick for now i have the answer to the riddle since i know you cannot lie when we die we still live and know therefore im content to wait  again that smile swept across murghs awful face though that smile was cold as the winter dawn then he turned and slowly walked away toward the west  they watched him go till he became but a blot of fantastic colour that soon vanished on the moorland    hugh spoke to red eve and said  wife let us away from this haunted place and take what joy we can who knows when murgh may return again and make us as are all the others whom we love  ay husband won at last she answered who knows yet after so much fear and sorrow first i would rest a while with you  so hand in hand they went till they too grew small and vanished on the snowy marsh    but grey dick stayed there alone with the dead and presently spoke aloud for company  the woman has him heart and soul he said as is fitting and wheres the room between the two for an archerchurl to lodge mayhap after all i should have done well to take yonder murgh for lord when i had the chance man or god or ghost hes a fellow to my liking and once he had led me through the gates no woman would have dared to come to part us well goodbye hugh de cressi till you are sick of kisses and the long shafts begin to fly again for then you will bethink you of a certain bow and of him who alone can bend it  having spoken thus in his hissing voice whereof the sound resembled that of an arrow in its flight grey dick descended into the grave and trod the earth over acours false and handsome face hiding it from the sight of men forever    then he lifted up the dead sir andrew in his strong arms and slowly bore him thence to burial
