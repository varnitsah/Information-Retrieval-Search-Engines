13155786	a house of pomegranates     contents  the young king the birthday of the infanta the fisherman and his soul the starchild     the young king     to margaret lady brookethe ranee of sarawak   it was the night before the day fixed for his coronation and the young king was sitting alone in his beautiful chamber  his courtiers had all taken their leave of him bowing their heads to the ground according to the ceremonious usage of the day and had retired to the great hall of the palace to receive a few last lessons from the professor of etiquette there being some of them who had still quite natural manners which in a courtier is i need hardly say a very grave offence  the ladfor he was only a lad being but sixteen years of agewas not sorry at their departure and had flung himself back with a deep sigh of relief on the soft cushions of his embroidered couch lying there wildeyed and openmouthed like a brown woodland faun or some young animal of the forest newly snared by the hunters  and indeed it was the hunters who had found him coming upon him almost by chance as barelimbed and pipe in hand he was following the flock of the poor goatherd who had brought him up and whose son he had always fancied himself to be  the child of the old kings only daughter by a secret marriage with one much beneath her in stationa stranger some said who by the wonderful magic of his luteplaying had made the young princess love him while others spoke of an artist from rimini to whom the princess had shown much perhaps too much honour and who had suddenly disappeared from the city leaving his work in the cathedral unfinishedhe had been when but a week old stolen away from his mothers side as she slept and given into the charge of a common peasant and his wife who were without children of their own and lived in a remote part of the forest more than a days ride from the town  grief or the plague as the court physician stated or as some suggested a swift italian poison administered in a cup of spiced wine slew within an hour of her wakening the white girl who had given him birth and as the trusty messenger who bare the child across his saddlebow stooped from his weary horse and knocked at the rude door of the goatherds hut the body of the princess was being lowered into an open grave that had been dug in a deserted churchyard beyond the city gates a grave where it was said that another body was also lying that of a young man of marvellous and foreign beauty whose hands were tied behind him with a knotted cord and whose breast was stabbed with many red wounds  such at least was the story that men whispered to each other certain it was that the old king when on his deathbed whether moved by remorse for his great sin or merely desiring that the kingdom should not pass away from his line had had the lad sent for and in the presence of the council had acknowledged him as his heir  and it seems that from the very first moment of his recognition he had shown signs of that strange passion for beauty that was destined to have so great an influence over his life  those who accompanied him to the suite of rooms set apart for his service often spoke of the cry of pleasure that broke from his lips when he saw the delicate raiment and rich jewels that had been prepared for him and of the almost fierce joy with which he flung aside his rough leathern tunic and coarse sheepskin cloak  he missed indeed at times the fine freedom of his forest life and was always apt to chafe at the tedious court ceremonies that occupied so much of each day but the wonderful palacejoyeuse as they called itof which he now found himself lord seemed to him to be a new world freshfashioned for his delight and as soon as he could escape from the councilboard or audiencechamber he would run down the great staircase with its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry and wander from room to room and from corridor to corridor like one who was seeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain a sort of restoration from sickness  upon these journeys of discovery as he would call themand indeed they were to him real voyages through a marvellous land he would sometimes be accompanied by the slim fairhaired court pages with their floating mantles and gay fluttering ribands but more often he would be alone feeling through a certain quick instinct which was almost a divination that the secrets of art are best learned in secret and that beauty like wisdom loves the lonely worshipper   many curious stories were related about him at this period  it was said that a stout burgomaster who had come to deliver a florid oratorical address on behalf of the citizens of the town had caught sight of him kneeling in real adoration before a great picture that had just been brought from venice and that seemed to herald the worship of some new gods  on another occasion he had been missed for several hours and after a lengthened search had been discovered in a little chamber in one of the northern turrets of the palace gazing as one in a trance at a greek gem carved with the figure of adonis  he had been seen so the tale ran pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of an antique statue that had been discovered in the bed of the river on the occasion of the building of the stone bridge and was inscribed with the name of the bithynian slave of hadrian  he had passed a whole night in noting the effect of the moonlight on a silver image of endymion  all rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him and in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants some to traffic for amber with the rough fisherfolk of the north seas some to egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found only in the tombs of kings and is said to possess magical properties some to persia for silken carpets and painted pottery and others to india to buy gauze and stained ivory moonstones and bracelets of jade sandalwood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool  but what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his coronation the robe of tissued gold and the rubystudded crown and the sceptre with its rows and rings of pearls  indeed it was of this that he was thinking tonight as he lay back on his luxurious couch watching the great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth  the designs which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the time had been submitted to him many months before and he had given orders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out and that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be worthy of their work  he saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar of the cathedral in the fair raiment of a king and a smile played and lingered about his boyish lips and lit up with a bright lustre his dark woodland eyes  after some time he rose from his seat and leaning against the carved penthouse of the chimney looked round at the dimlylit room  the walls were hung with rich tapestries representing the triumph of beauty  a large press inlaid with agate and lapis lazuli filled one corner and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaiced gold on which were placed some delicate goblets of venetian glass and a cup of darkveined onyx  pale poppies were broidered on the silk coverlet of the bed as though they had fallen from the tired hands of sleep and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the velvet canopy from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang like white foam to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling  a laughing narcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head  on the table stood a flat bowl of amethyst  outside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral looming like a bubble over the shadowy houses and the weary sentinels pacing up and down on the misty terrace by the river  far away in an orchard a nightingale was singing  a faint perfume of jasmine came through the open window  he brushed his brown curls back from his forehead and taking up a lute let his fingers stray across the cords  his heavy eyelids drooped and a strange languor came over him  never before had he felt so keenly or with such exquisite joy the magic and the mystery of beautiful things  when midnight sounded from the clocktower he touched a bell and his pages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony pouring rosewater over his hands and strewing flowers on his pillow  a few moments after that they had left the room he fell asleep   and as he slept he dreamed a dream and this was his dream  he thought that he was standing in a long low attic amidst the whir and clatter of many looms  the meagre daylight peered in through the grated windows and showed him the gaunt figures of the weavers bending over their cases  pale sicklylooking children were crouched on the huge crossbeams  as the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the heavy battens and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall and pressed the threads together  their faces were pinched with famine and their thin hands shook and trembled  some haggard women were seated at a table sewing  a horrible odour filled the place  the air was foul and heavy and the walls dripped and streamed with damp  the young king went over to one of the weavers and stood by him and watched him  and the weaver looked at him angrily and said why art thou watching me  art thou a spy set on us by our master  who is thy master asked the young king  our master cried the weaver bitterly  he is a man like myself  indeed there is but this difference between usthat he wears fine clothes while i go in rags and that while i am weak from hunger he suffers not a little from overfeeding  the land is free said the young king and thou art no mans slave  in war answered the weaver the strong make slaves of the weak and in peace the rich make slaves of the poor  we must work to live and they give us such mean wages that we die  we toil for them all day long and they heap up gold in their coffers and our children fade away before their time and the faces of those we love become hard and evil  we tread out the grapes and another drinks the wine  we sow the corn and our own board is empty  we have chains though no eye beholds them and are slaves though men call us free  is it so with all he asked  it is so with all answered the weaver with the young as well as with the old with the women as well as with the men with the little children as well as with those who are stricken in years the merchants grind us down and we must needs do their bidding the priest rides by and tells his beads and no man has care of us through our sunless lanes creeps poverty with her hungry eyes and sin with his sodden face follows close behind her  misery wakes us in the morning and shame sits with us at night  but what are these things to thee  thou art not one of us  thy face is too happy  and he turned away scowling and threw the shuttle across the loom and the young king saw that it was threaded with a thread of gold  and a great terror seized upon him and he said to the weaver what robe is this that thou art weaving  it is the robe for the coronation of the young king he answered what is that to thee  and the young king gave a loud cry and woke and lo he was in his own chamber and through the window he saw the great honeycoloured moon hanging in the dusky air   and he fell asleep again and dreamed and this was his dream  he thought that he was lying on the deck of a huge galley that was being rowed by a hundred slaves  on a carpet by his side the master of the galley was seated  he was black as ebony and his turban was of crimson silk  great earrings of silver dragged down the thick lobes of his ears and in his hands he had a pair of ivory scales  the slaves were naked but for a ragged loincloth and each man was chained to his neighbour  the hot sun beat brightly upon them and the negroes ran up and down the gangway and lashed them with whips of hide  they stretched out their lean arms and pulled the heavy oars through the water  the salt spray flew from the blades  at last they reached a little bay and began to take soundings  a light wind blew from the shore and covered the deck and the great lateen sail with a fine red dust  three arabs mounted on wild asses rode out and threw spears at them  the master of the galley took a painted bow in his hand and shot one of them in the throat he fell heavily into the surf and his companions galloped away  a woman wrapped in a yellow veil followed slowly on a camel looking back now and then at the dead body  as soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail the negroes went into the hold and brought up a long ropeladder heavily weighted with lead  the master of the galley threw it over the side making the ends fast to two iron stanchions  then the negroes seized the youngest of the slaves and knocked his gyves off and filled his nostrils and his ears with wax and tied a big stone round his waist  he crept wearily down the ladder and disappeared into the sea  a few bubbles rose where he sank  some of the other slaves peered curiously over the side  at the prow of the galley sat a sharkcharmer beating monotonously upon a drum  after some time the diver rose up out of the water and clung panting to the ladder with a pearl in his right hand  the negroes seized it from him and thrust him back  the slaves fell asleep over their oars  again and again he came up and each time that he did so he brought with him a beautiful pearl  the master of the galley weighed them and put them into a little bag of green leather  the young king tried to speak but his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth and his lips refused to move  the negroes chattered to each other and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads  two cranes flew round and round the vessel  then the diver came up for the last time and the pearl that he brought with him was fairer than all the pearls of ormuz for it was shaped like the full moon and whiter than the morning star but his face was strangely pale and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils  he quivered for a little and then he was still  the negroes shrugged their shoulders and threw the body overboard  and the master of the galley laughed and reaching out he took the pearl and when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and bowed  it shall be he said for the sceptre of the young king and he made a sign to the negroes to draw up the anchor  and when the young king heard this he gave a great cry and woke and through the window he saw the long grey fingers of the dawn clutching at the fading stars   and he fell asleep again and dreamed and this was his dream  he thought that he was wandering through a dim wood hung with strange fruits and with beautiful poisonous flowers  the adders hissed at him as he went by and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch  huge tortoises lay asleep upon the hot mud the trees were full of apes and peacocks  on and on he went till he reached the outskirts of the wood and there he saw an immense multitude of men toiling in the bed of a driedup river  they swarmed up the crag like ants  they dug deep pits in the ground and went down into them  some of them cleft the rocks with great axes others grabbled in the sand  they tore up the cactus by its roots and trampled on the scarlet blossoms  they hurried about calling to each other and no man was idle  from the darkness of a cavern death and avarice watched them and death said i am weary give me a third of them and let me go but avarice shook her head  they are my servants she answered  and death said to her what hast thou in thy hand  i have three grains of corn she answered what is that to thee  give me one of them cried death to plant in my garden only one of them and i will go away  i will not give thee anything said avarice and she hid her hand in the fold of her raiment  and death laughed and took a cup and dipped it into a pool of water and out of the cup rose ague  she passed through the great multitude and a third of them lay dead  a cold mist followed her and the watersnakes ran by her side  and when avarice saw that a third of the multitude was dead she beat her breast and wept  she beat her barren bosom and cried aloud  thou hast slain a third of my servants she cried get thee gone  there is war in the mountains of tartary and the kings of each side are calling to thee  the afghans have slain the black ox and are marching to battle  they have beaten upon their shields with their spears and have put on their helmets of iron what is my valley to thee that thou shouldst tarry in it  get thee gone and come here no more  nay answered death but till thou hast given me a grain of corn i will not go  but avarice shut her hand and clenched her teeth  i will not give thee anything she muttered  and death laughed and took up a black stone and threw it into the forest and out of a thicket of wild hemlock came fever in a robe of flame  she passed through the multitude and touched them and each man that she touched died  the grass withered beneath her feet as she walked  and avarice shuddered and put ashes on her head  thou art cruel she cried thou art cruel  there is famine in the walled cities of india and the cisterns of samarcand have run dry  there is famine in the walled cities of egypt and the locusts have come up from the desert  the nile has not overflowed its banks and the priests have cursed isis and osiris  get thee gone to those who need thee and leave me my servants  nay answered death but till thou hast given me a grain of corn i will not go  i will not give thee anything said avarice  and death laughed again and he whistled through his fingers and a woman came flying through the air  plague was written upon her forehead and a crowd of lean vultures wheeled round her  she covered the valley with her wings and no man was left alive  and avarice fled shrieking through the forest and death leaped upon his red horse and galloped away and his galloping was faster than the wind  and out of the slime at the bottom of the valley crept dragons and horrible things with scales and the jackals came trotting along the sand sniffing up the air with their nostrils  and the young king wept and said  who were these men and for what were they seeking  for rubies for a kings crown answered one who stood behind him  and the young king started and turning round he saw a man habited as a pilgrim and holding in his hand a mirror of silver  and he grew pale and said  for what king  and the pilgrim answered  look in this mirror and thou shalt see him  and he looked in the mirror and seeing his own face he gave a great cry and woke and the bright sunlight was streaming into the room and from the trees of the garden and pleasaunce the birds were singing   and the chamberlain and the high officers of state came in and made obeisance to him and the pages brought him the robe of tissued gold and set the crown and the sceptre before him  and the young king looked at them and they were beautiful  more beautiful were they than aught that he had ever seen  but he remembered his dreams and he said to his lords  take these things away for i will not wear them  and the courtiers were amazed and some of them laughed for they thought that he was jesting  but he spake sternly to them again and said  take these things away and hide them from me  though it be the day of my coronation i will not wear them  for on the loom of sorrow and by the white hands of pain has this my robe been woven  there is blood in the heart of the ruby and death in the heart of the pearl  and he told them his three dreams  and when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and whispered saying  surely he is mad for what is a dream but a dream and a vision but a vision  they are not real things that one should heed them  and what have we to do with the lives of those who toil for us  shall a man not eat bread till he has seen the sower nor drink wine till he has talked with the vinedresser  and the chamberlain spake to the young king and said my lord i pray thee set aside these black thoughts of thine and put on this fair robe and set this crown upon thy head  for how shall the people know that thou art a king if thou hast not a kings raiment  and the young king looked at him  is it so indeed he questioned  will they not know me for a king if i have not a kings raiment  they will not know thee my lord cried the chamberlain  i had thought that there had been men who were kinglike he answered but it may be as thou sayest  and yet i will not wear this robe nor will i be crowned with this crown but even as i came to the palace so will i go forth from it  and he bade them all leave him save one page whom he kept as his companion a lad a year younger than himself  him he kept for his service and when he had bathed himself in clear water he opened a great painted chest and from it he took the leathern tunic and rough sheepskin cloak that he had worn when he had watched on the hillside the shaggy goats of the goatherd  these he put on and in his hand he took his rude shepherds staff  and the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder and said smiling to him my lord i see thy robe and thy sceptre but where is thy crown  and the young king plucked a spray of wild briar that was climbing over the balcony and bent it and made a circlet of it and set it on his own head  this shall he my crown he answered  and thus attired he passed out of his chamber into the great hall where the nobles were waiting for him  and the nobles made merry and some of them cried out to him my lord the people wait for their king and thou showest them a beggar and others were wroth and said he brings shame upon our state and is unworthy to be our master  but he answered them not a word but passed on and went down the bright porphyry staircase and out through the gates of bronze and mounted upon his horse and rode towards the cathedral the little page running beside him  and the people laughed and said it is the kings fool who is riding by and they mocked him  and he drew rein and said nay but i am the king  and he told them his three dreams  and a man came out of the crowd and spake bitterly to him and said sir knowest thou not that out of the luxury of the rich cometh the life of the poor  by your pomp we are nurtured and your vices give us bread  to toil for a hard master is bitter but to have no master to toil for is more bitter still  thinkest thou that the ravens will feed us  and what cure hast thou for these things  wilt thou say to the buyer thou shalt buy for so much and to the seller thou shalt sell at this price  i trow not therefore go back to thy palace and put on thy purple and fine linen  what hast thou to do with us and what we suffer  are not the rich and the poor brothers asked the young king  ay answered the man and the name of the rich brother is cain  and the young kings eyes filled with tears and he rode on through the murmurs of the people and the little page grew afraid and left him  and when he reached the great portal of the cathedral the soldiers thrust their halberts out and said what dost thou seek here none enters by this door but the king  and his face flushed with anger and he said to them i am the king and waved their halberts aside and passed in  and when the old bishop saw him coming in his goatherds dress he rose up in wonder from his throne and went to meet him and said to him my son is this a kings apparel  and with what crown shall i crown thee and what sceptre shall i place in thy hand surely this should be to thee a day of joy and not a day of abasement  shall joy wear what grief has fashioned said the young king and he told him his three dreams  and when the bishop had heard them he knit his brows and said my son i am an old man and in the winter of my days and i know that many evil things are done in the wide world  the fierce robbers come down from the mountains and carry off the little children and sell them to the moors  the lions lie in wait for the caravans and leap upon the camels  the wild boar roots up the corn in the valley and the foxes gnaw the vines upon the hill the pirates lay waste the seacoast and burn the ships of the fishermen and take their nets from them  in the saltmarshes live the lepers they have houses of wattled reeds and none may come nigh them  the beggars wander through the cities and eat their food with the dogs  canst thou make these things not to be  wilt thou take the leper for thy bedfellow and set the beggar at thy board  shall the lion do thy bidding and the wild boar obey thee is not he who made misery wiser than thou art  wherefore i praise thee not for this that thou hast done but i bid thee ride back to the palace and make thy face glad and put on the raiment that beseemeth a king and with the crown of gold i will crown thee and the sceptre of pearl will i place in thy hand  and as for thy dreams think no more of them  the burden of this world is too great for one man to bear and the worlds sorrow too heavy for one heart to suffer  sayest thou that in this house said the young king and he strode past the bishop and climbed up the steps of the altar and stood before the image of christ  he stood before the image of christ and on his right hand and on his left were the marvellous vessels of gold the chalice with the yellow wine and the vial with the holy oil  he knelt before the image of christ and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine and the smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome  he bowed his head in prayer and the priests in their stiff copes crept away from the altar  and suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside and in entered the nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes and shields of polished steel  where is this dreamer of dreams they cried  where is this king who is apparelled like a beggarthis boy who brings shame upon our state  surely we will slay him for he is unworthy to rule over us  and the young king bowed his head again and prayed and when he had finished his prayer he rose up and turning round he looked at them sadly  and lo through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him and the sunbeams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the robe that had been fashioned for his pleasure  the dead staff blossomed and bare lilies that were whiter than pearls the dry thorn blossomed and bare roses that were redder than rubies  whiter than fine pearls were the lilies and their stems were of bright silver  redder than male rubies were the roses and their leaves were of beaten gold  he stood there in the raiment of a king and the gates of the jewelled shrine flew open and from the crystal of the manyrayed monstrance shone a marvellous and mystical light  he stood there in a kings raiment and the glory of god filled the place and the saints in their carven niches seemed to move  in the fair raiment of a king he stood before them and the organ pealed out its music and the trumpeters blew upon their trumpets and the singing boys sang  and the people fell upon their knees in awe and the nobles sheathed their swords and did homage and the bishops face grew pale and his hands trembled  a greater than i hath crowned thee he cried and he knelt before him  and the young king came down from the high altar and passed home through the midst of the people  but no man dared look upon his face for it was like the face of an angel     the birthday of the infanta     to mrs william h grenfell of taplow courtlady desborough   it was the birthday of the infanta  she was just twelve years of age and the sun was shining brightly in the gardens of the palace  although she was a real princess and the infanta of spain she had only one birthday every year just like the children of quite poor people so it was naturally a matter of great importance to the whole country that she should have a really fine day for the occasion  and a really fine day it certainly was  the tall striped tulips stood straight up upon their stalks like long rows of soldiers and looked defiantly across the grass at the roses and said  we are quite as splendid as you are now  the purple butterflies fluttered about with gold dust on their wings visiting each flower in turn the little lizards crept out of the crevices of the wall and lay basking in the white glare and the pomegranates split and cracked with the heat and showed their bleeding red hearts  even the pale yellow lemons that hung in such profusion from the mouldering trellis and along the dim arcades seemed to have caught a richer colour from the wonderful sunlight and the magnolia trees opened their great globelike blossoms of folded ivory and filled the air with a sweet heavy perfume  the little princess herself walked up and down the terrace with her companions and played at hide and seek round the stone vases and the old mossgrown statues  on ordinary days she was only allowed to play with children of her own rank so she had always to play alone but her birthday was an exception and the king had given orders that she was to invite any of her young friends whom she liked to come and amuse themselves with her  there was a stately grace about these slim spanish children as they glided about the boys with their largeplumed hats and short fluttering cloaks the girls holding up the trains of their long brocaded gowns and shielding the sun from their eyes with huge fans of black and silver  but the infanta was the most graceful of all and the most tastefully attired after the somewhat cumbrous fashion of the day her robe was of grey satin the skirt and the wide puffed sleeves heavily embroidered with silver and the stiff corset studded with rows of fine pearls  two tiny slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath her dress as she walked  pink and pearl was her great gauze fan and in her hair which like an aureole of faded gold stood out stiffly round her pale little face she had a beautiful white rose  from a window in the palace the sad melancholy king watched them behind him stood his brother don pedro of aragon whom he hated and his confessor the grand inquisitor of granada sat by his side  sadder even than usual was the king for as he looked at the infanta bowing with childish gravity to the assembling counters or laughing behind her fan at the grim duchess of albuquerque who always accompanied her he thought of the young queen her mother who but a short time beforeso it seemed to himhad come from the gay country of france and had withered away in the sombre splendour of the spanish court dying just six months after the birth of her child and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice in the orchard or plucked the second years fruit from the old gnarled figtree that stood in the centre of the now grass grown courtyard  so great had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave to hide her from him  she had been embalmed by a moorish physician who in return for this service had been granted his life which for heresy and suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited men said to the holy office and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier in the black marble chapel of the palace just as the monks had borne her in on that windy march day nearly twelve years before  once every month the king wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand went in and knelt by her side calling out mi reina  mi reina and sometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in spain governs every separate action of life and sets limits even to the sorrow of a king he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of grief and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face  today he seemed to see her again as he had seen her first at the castle of fontainebleau when he was but fifteen years of age and she still younger  they had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the papal nuncio in the presence of the french king and all the court and he had returned to the escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow hair and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand as he stepped into his carriage later on had followed the marriage hastily performed at burgos a small town on the frontier between the two countries and the grand public entry into madrid with the customary celebration of high mass at the church of la atocha and a more than usually solemn autodafe in which nearly three hundred heretics amongst whom were many englishmen had been delivered over to the secular arm to be burned  certainly he had loved her madly and to the ruin many thought of his country then at war with england for the possession of the empire of the new world  he had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight for her he had forgotten or seemed to have forgotten all grave affairs of state and with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its servants he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which he sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which she suffered when she died he was for a time like one bereft of reason indeed there is no doubt but that he would have formally abdicated and retired to the great trappist monastery at granada of which he was already titular prior had he not been afraid to leave the little infanta at the mercy of his brother whose cruelty even in spain was notorious and who was suspected by many of having caused the queens death by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her on the occasion of her visiting his castle in aragon  even after the expiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained throughout his whole dominions by royal edict he would never suffer his ministers to speak about any new alliance and when the emperor himself sent to him and offered him the hand of the lovely archduchess of bohemia his niece in marriage he bade the ambassadors tell their master that the king of spain was already wedded to sorrow and that though she was but a barren bride he loved her better than beauty an answer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the netherlands which soon after at the emperors instigation revolted against him under the leadership of some fanatics of the reformed church  his whole married life with its fierce fierycoloured joys and the terrible agony of its sudden ending seemed to come back to him today as he watched the infanta playing on the terrace  she had all the queens pretty petulance of manner the same wilful way of tossing her head the same proud curved beautiful mouth the same wonderful smilevrai sourire de france indeedas she glanced up now and then at the window or stretched out her little hand for the stately spanish gentlemen to kiss  but the shrill laughter of the children grated on his ears and the bright pitiless sunlight mocked his sorrow and a dull odour of strange spices spices such as embalmers use seemed to taintor was it fancythe clear morning air  he buried his face in his hands and when the infanta looked up again the curtains had been drawn and the king had retired  she made a little moue of disappointment and shrugged her shoulders  surely he might have stayed with her on her birthday what did the stupid stateaffairs matter  or had he gone to that gloomy chapel where the candles were always burning and where she was never allowed to enter  how silly of him when the sun was shining so brightly and everybody was so happy  besides he would miss the sham bullfight for which the trumpet was already sounding to say nothing of the puppetshow and the other wonderful things  her uncle and the grand inquisitor were much more sensible  they had come out on the terrace and paid her nice compliments  so she tossed her pretty head and taking don pedro by the hand she walked slowly down the steps towards a long pavilion of purple silk that had been erected at the end of the garden the other children following in strict order of precedence those who had the longest names going first   a procession of noble boys fantastically dressed as toreadors came out to meet her and the young count of tierranueva a wonderfully handsome lad of about fourteen years of age uncovering his head with all the grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of spain led her solemnly in to a little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the arena  the children grouped themselves all round fluttering their big fans and whispering to each other and don pedro and the grand inquisitor stood laughing at the entrance  even the duchessthe camereramayor as she was calleda thin hardfeatured woman with a yellow ruff did not look quite so badtempered as usual and something like a chill smile flitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips  it certainly was a marvellous bullfight and much nicer the infanta thought than the real bullfight that she had been brought to see at seville on the occasion of the visit of the duke of parma to her father  some of the boys pranced about on richly caparisoned hobbyhorses brandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached to them others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull and vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them and as for the bull himself he was just like a live bull though he was only made of wicker work and stretched hide and sometimes insisted on running round the arena on his hind legs which no live bull ever dreams of doing  he made a splendid fight of it too and the children got so excited that they stood up upon the benches and waved their lace handkerchiefs and cried out  bravo toro  bravo toro just as sensibly as if they had been grownup people  at last however after a prolonged combat during which several of the hobbyhorses were gored through and through and their riders dismounted the young count of tierranueva brought the bull to his knees and having obtained permission from the infanta to give the coup de grace he plunged his wooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head came right off and disclosed the laughing face of little monsieur de lorraine the son of the french ambassador at madrid  the arena was then cleared amidst much applause and the dead hobbyhorses dragged solemnly away by two moorish pages in yellow and black liveries and after a short interlude during which a french posturemaster performed upon the tightrope some italian puppets appeared in the semiclassical tragedy of sophonisba on the stage of a small theatre that had been built up for the purpose they acted so well and their gestures were so extremely natural that at the close of the play the eyes of the infanta were quite dim with tears  indeed some of the children really cried and had to be comforted with sweetmeats and the grand inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help saying to don pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made simply out of wood and coloured wax and worked mechanically by wires should be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes  an african juggler followed who brought in a large flat basket covered with a red cloth and having placed it in the centre of the arena he took from his turban a curious reed pipe and blew through it  in a few moments the cloth began to move and as the pipe grew shriller and shriller two green and gold snakes put out their strange wedgeshaped heads and rose slowly up swaying to and fro with the music as a plant sways in the water  the children however were rather frightened at their spotted hoods and quick darting tongues and were much more pleased when the juggler made a tiny orangetree grow out of the sand and bear pretty white blossoms and clusters of real fruit and when he took the fan of the little daughter of the marquess de lastorres and changed it into a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion and sang their delight and amazement knew no bounds  the solemn minuet too performed by the dancing boys from the church of nuestra senora del pilar was charming  the infanta had never before seen this wonderful ceremony which takes place every year at maytime in front of the high altar of the virgin and in her honour and indeed none of the royal family of spain had entered the great cathedral of saragossa since a mad priest supposed by many to have been in the pay of elizabeth of england had tried to administer a poisoned wafer to the prince of the asturias  so she had known only by hearsay of our ladys dance as it was called and it certainly was a beautiful sight  the boys wore oldfashioned court dresses of white velvet and their curious threecornered hats were fringed with silver and surmounted with huge plumes of ostrich feathers the dazzling whiteness of their costumes as they moved about in the sunlight being still more accentuated by their swarthy faces and long black hair  everybody was fascinated by the grave dignity with which they moved through the intricate figures of the dance and by the elaborate grace of their slow gestures and stately bows and when they had finished their performance and doffed their great plumed hats to the infanta she acknowledged their reverence with much courtesy and made a vow that she would send a large wax candle to the shrine of our lady of pilar in return for the pleasure that she had given her  a troop of handsome egyptiansas the gipsies were termed in those daysthen advanced into the arena and sitting down crosslegs in a circle began to play softly upon their zithers moving their bodies to the tune and humming almost below their breath a low dreamy air  when they caught sight of don pedro they scowled at him and some of them looked terrified for only a few weeks before he had had two of their tribe hanged for sorcery in the market place at seville but the pretty infanta charmed them as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her great blue eyes and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could never be cruel to anybody so they played on very gently and just touching the cords of the zithers with their long pointed nails and their heads began to nod as though they were falling asleep  suddenly with a cry so shrill that all the children were startled and don pedros hand clutched at the agate pommel of his dagger they leapt to their feet and whirled madly round the enclosure beating their tambourines and chaunting some wild lovesong in their strange guttural language then at another signal they all flung themselves again to the ground and lay there quite still the dull strumming of the zithers being the only sound that broke the silence  after that they had done this several times they disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown shaggy bear by a chain and carrying on their shoulders some little barbary apes  the bear stood upon his head with the utmost gravity and the wizened apes played all kinds of amusing tricks with two gipsy boys who seemed to be their masters and fought with tiny swords and fired off guns and went through a regular soldiers drill just like the kings own bodyguard  in fact the gipsies were a great success  but the funniest part of the whole mornings entertainment was undoubtedly the dancing of the little dwarf  when he stumbled into the arena waddling on his crooked legs and wagging his huge misshapen head from side to side the children went off into a loud shout of delight and the infanta herself laughed so much that the camerera was obliged to remind her that although there were many precedents in spain for a kings daughter weeping before her equals there were none for a princess of the blood royal making so merry before those who were her inferiors in birth  the dwarf however was really quite irresistible and even at the spanish court always noted for its cultivated passion for the horrible so fantastic a little monster had never been seen  it was his first appearance too  he had been discovered only the day before running wild through the forest by two of the nobles who happened to have been hunting in a remote part of the great corkwood that surrounded the town and had been carried off by them to the palace as a surprise for the infanta his father who was a poor charcoal burner being but too well pleased to get rid of so ugly and useless a child  perhaps the most amusing thing about him was his complete unconsciousness of his own grotesque appearance  indeed he seemed quite happy and full of the highest spirits  when the children laughed he laughed as freely and as joyously as any of them and at the close of each dance he made them each the funniest of bows smiling and nodding at them just as if he was really one of themselves and not a little misshapen thing that nature in some humourous mood had fashioned for others to mock at  as for the infanta she absolutely fascinated him  he could not keep his eyes off her and seemed to dance for her alone and when at the close of the performance remembering how she had seen the great ladies of the court throw bouquets to caffarelli the famous italian treble whom the pope had sent from his own chapel to madrid that he might cure the kings melancholy by the sweetness of his voice she took out of her hair the beautiful white rose and partly for a jest and partly to tease the camerera threw it to him across the arena with her sweetest smile he took the whole matter quite seriously and pressing the flower to his rough coarse lips he put his hand upon his heart and sank on one knee before her grinning from ear to ear and with his little bright eyes sparkling with pleasure  this so upset the gravity of the infanta that she kept on laughing long after the little dwarf had ran out of the arena and expressed a desire to her uncle that the dance should be immediately repeated  the camerera however on the plea that the sun was too hot decided that it would be better that her highness should return without delay to the palace where a wonderful feast had been already prepared for her including a real birthday cake with her own initials worked all over it in painted sugar and a lovely silver flag waving from the top  the infanta accordingly rose up with much dignity and having given orders that the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the hour of siesta and conveyed her thanks to the young count of tierranueva for his charming reception she went back to her apartments the children following in the same order in which they had entered   now when the little dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before the infanta and by her own express command he was so proud that he ran out into the garden kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of pleasure and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight  the flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their beautiful home and when they saw him capering up and down the walks and waving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner they could not restrain their feelings any longer  he is really far too ugly to be allowed to play in any place where we are cried the tulips  he should drink poppyjuice and go to sleep for a thousand years said the great scarlet lilies and they grew quite hot and angry  he is a perfect horror screamed the cactus  why he is twisted and stumpy and his head is completely out of proportion with his legs  really he makes me feel prickly all over and if he comes near me i will sting him with my thorns  and he has actually got one of my best blooms exclaimed the white rosetree  i gave it to the infanta this morning myself as a birthday present and he has stolen it from her  and she called out  thief thief thief at the top of her voice  even the red geraniums who did not usually give themselves airs and were known to have a great many poor relations themselves curled up in disgust when they saw him and when the violets meekly remarked that though he was certainly extremely plain still he could not help it they retorted with a good deal of justice that that was his chief defect and that there was no reason why one should admire a person because he was incurable and indeed some of the violets themselves felt that the ugliness of the little dwarf was almost ostentatious and that he would have shown much better taste if he had looked sad or at least pensive instead of jumping about merrily and throwing himself into such grotesque and silly attitudes  as for the old sundial who was an extremely remarkable individual and had once told the time of day to no less a person than the emperor charles v himself he was so taken aback by the little dwarfs appearance that he almost forgot to mark two whole minutes with his long shadowy finger and could not help saying to the great milkwhite peacock who was sunning herself on the balustrade that every one knew that the children of kings were kings and that the children of charcoalburners were charcoal burners and that it was absurd to pretend that it wasnt so a statement with which the peacock entirely agreed and indeed screamed out certainly certainly in such a loud harsh voice that the goldfish who lived in the basin of the cool splashing fountain put their heads out of the water and asked the huge stone tritons what on earth was the matter  but somehow the birds liked him  they had seen him often in the forest dancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves or crouched up in the hollow of some old oaktree sharing his nuts with the squirrels  they did not mind his being ugly a bit  why even the nightingale herself who sang so sweetly in the orange groves at night that sometimes the moon leaned down to listen was not much to look at after all and besides he had been kind to them and during that terribly bitter winter when there were no berries on the trees and the ground was as hard as iron and the wolves had come down to the very gates of the city to look for food he had never once forgotten them but had always given them crumbs out of his little hunch of black bread and divided with them whatever poor breakfast he had  so they flew round and round him just touching his cheek with their wings as they passed and chattered to each other and the little dwarf was so pleased that he could not help showing them the beautiful white rose and telling them that the infanta herself had given it to him because she loved him  they did not understand a single word of what he was saying but that made no matter for they put their heads on one side and looked wise which is quite as good as understanding a thing and very much easier  the lizards also took an immense fancy to him and when he grew tired of running about and flung himself down on the grass to rest they played and romped all over him and tried to amuse him in the best way they could  every one cannot be as beautiful as a lizard they cried that would be too much to expect  and though it sounds absurd to say so he is really not so ugly after all provided of course that one shuts ones eyes and does not look at him  the lizards were extremely philosophical by nature and often sat thinking for hours and hours together when there was nothing else to do or when the weather was too rainy for them to go out  the flowers however were excessively annoyed at their behaviour and at the behaviour of the birds  it only shows they said what a vulgarising effect this incessant rushing and flying about has  wellbred people always stay exactly in the same place as we do  no one ever saw us hopping up and down the walks or galloping madly through the grass after dragonflies  when we do want change of air we send for the gardener and he carries us to another bed this is dignified and as it should be  but birds and lizards have no sense of repose and indeed birds have not even a permanent address  they are mere vagrants like the gipsies and should be treated in exactly the same manner  so they put their noses in the air and looked very haughty and were quite delighted when after some time they saw the little dwarf scramble up from the grass and make his way across the terrace to the palace  he should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of his natural life they said  look at his hunched back and his crooked legs and they began to titter  but the little dwarf knew nothing of all this  he liked the birds and the lizards immensely and thought that the flowers were the most marvellous things in the whole world except of course the infanta but then she had given him the beautiful white rose and she loved him and that made a great difference  how he wished that he had gone back with her  she would have put him on her right hand and smiled at him and he would have never left her side but would have made her his playmate and taught her all kinds of delightful tricks  for though he had never been in a palace before he knew a great many wonderful things  he could make little cages out of rushes for the grasshoppers to sing in and fashion the long jointed bamboo into the pipe that pan loves to hear  he knew the cry of every bird and could call the starlings from the treetop or the heron from the mere  he knew the trail of every animal and could track the hare by its delicate footprints and the boar by the trampled leaves  all the wild dances he knew the mad dance in red raiment with the autumn the light dance in blue sandals over the corn the dance with white snowwreaths in winter and the blossomdance through the orchards in spring  he knew where the woodpigeons built their nests and once when a fowler had snared the parent birds he had brought up the young ones himself and had built a little dovecot for them in the cleft of a pollard elm  they were quite tame and used to feed out of his hands every morning  she would like them and the rabbits that scurried about in the long fern and the jays with their steely feathers and black bills and the hedgehogs that could curl themselves up into prickly balls and the great wise tortoises that crawled slowly about shaking their heads and nibbling at the young leaves  yes she must certainly come to the forest and play with him  he would give her his own little bed and would watch outside the window till dawn to see that the wild horned cattle did not harm her nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the hut  and at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her and they would go out and dance together all the day long  it was really not a bit lonely in the forest  sometimes a bishop rode through on his white mule reading out of a painted book  sometimes in their green velvet caps and their jerkins of tanned deerskin the falconers passed by with hooded hawks on their wrists  at vintagetime came the grapetreaders with purple hands and feet wreathed with glossy ivy and carrying dripping skins of wine and the charcoalburners sat round their huge braziers at night watching the dry logs charring slowly in the fire and roasting chestnuts in the ashes and the robbers came out of their caves and made merry with them  once too he had seen a beautiful procession winding up the long dusty road to toledo  the monks went in front singing sweetly and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold and then in silver armour with matchlocks and pikes came the soldiers and in their midst walked three barefooted men in strange yellow dresses painted all over with wonderful figures and carrying lighted candles in their hands certainly there was a great deal to look at in the forest and when she was tired he would find a soft bank of moss for her or carry her in his arms for he was very strong though he knew that he was not tall  he would make her a necklace of red bryony berries that would be quite as pretty as the white berries that she wore on her dress and when she was tired of them she could throw them away and he would find her others  he would bring her acorncups and dewdrenched anemones and tiny glowworms to be stars in the pale gold of her hair  but where was she  he asked the white rose and it made him no answer  the whole palace seemed asleep and even where the shutters had not been closed heavy curtains had been drawn across the windows to keep out the glare  he wandered all round looking for some place through which he might gain an entrance and at last he caught sight of a little private door that was lying open  he slipped through and found himself in a splendid hall far more splendid he feared than the forest there was so much more gilding everywhere and even the floor was made of great coloured stones fitted together into a sort of geometrical pattern  but the little infanta was not there only some wonderful white statues that looked down on him from their jasper pedestals with sad blank eyes and strangely smiling lips  at the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet powdered with suns and stars the kings favourite devices and broidered on the colour he loved best  perhaps she was hiding behind that  he would try at any rate  so he stole quietly across and drew it aside  no there was only another room though a prettier room he thought than the one he had just left  the walls were hung with a manyfigured green arras of needlewrought tapestry representing a hunt the work of some flemish artists who had spent more than seven years in its composition  it had once been the chamber of jean le fou as he was called that mad king who was so enamoured of the chase that he had often tried in his delirium to mount the huge rearing horses and to drag down the stag on which the great hounds were leaping sounding his hunting horn and stabbing with his dagger at the pale flying deer  it was now used as the councilroom and on the centre table were lying the red portfolios of the ministers stamped with the gold tulips of spain and with the arms and emblems of the house of hapsburg  the little dwarf looked in wonder all round him and was half afraid to go on  the strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the long glades without making any noise seemed to him like those terrible phantoms of whom he had heard the charcoal burners speakingthe comprachos who hunt only at night and if they meet a man turn him into a hind and chase him  but he thought of the pretty infanta and took courage  he wanted to find her alone and to tell her that he too loved her  perhaps she was in the room beyond  he ran across the soft moorish carpets and opened the door  no she was not here either  the room was quite empty  it was a throneroom used for the reception of foreign ambassadors when the king which of late had not been often consented to give them a personal audience the same room in which many years before envoys had appeared from england to make arrangements for the marriage of their queen then one of the catholic sovereigns of europe with the emperors eldest son  the hangings were of gilt cordovan leather and a heavy gilt chandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the black and white ceiling  underneath a great canopy of gold cloth on which the lions and towers of castile were broidered in seed pearls stood the throne itself covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded with silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls  on the second step of the throne was placed the kneelingstool of the infanta with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue and below that again and beyond the limit of the canopy stood the chair for the papal nuncio who alone had the right to be seated in the kings presence on the occasion of any public ceremonial and whose cardinals hat with its tangled scarlet tassels lay on a purple tabouret in front  on the wall facing the throne hung a lifesized portrait of charles v in hunting dress with a great mastiff by his side and a picture of philip ii receiving the homage of the netherlands occupied the centre of the other wall  between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet inlaid with plates of ivory on which the figures from holbeins dance of death had been gravedby the hand some said of that famous master himself  but the little dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence  he would not have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy nor one white petal of his rose for the throne itself  what he wanted was to see the infanta before she went down to the pavilion and to ask her to come away with him when he had finished his dance here in the palace the air was close and heavy but in the forest the wind blew free and the sunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside  there were flowers too in the forest not so splendid perhaps as the flowers in the garden but more sweetly scented for all that hyacinths in early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens and grassy knolls yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the gnarled roots of the oaktrees bright celandine and blue speedwell and irises lilac and gold  there were grey catkins on the hazels and the foxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled beehaunted cells  the chestnut had its spires of white stars and the hawthorn its pallid moons of beauty  yes  surely she would come if he could only find her  she would come with him to the fair forest and all day long he would dance for her delight  a smile lit up his eyes at the thought and he passed into the next room  of all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful the walls were covered with a pinkflowered lucca damask patterned with birds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver the furniture was of massive silver festooned with florid wreaths and swinging cupids in front of the two large fireplaces stood great screens broidered with parrots and peacocks and the floor which was of seagreen onyx seemed to stretch far away into the distance  nor was he alone  standing under the shadow of the doorway at the extreme end of the room he saw a little figure watching him  his heart trembled a cry of joy broke from his lips and he moved out into the sunlight  as he did so the figure moved out also and he saw it plainly  the infanta  it was a monster the most grotesque monster he had ever beheld  not properly shaped as all other people were but hunchbacked and crookedlimbed with huge lolling head and mane of black hair  the little dwarf frowned and the monster frowned also  he laughed and it laughed with him and held its hands to its sides just as he himself was doing  he made it a mocking bow and it returned him a low reverence  he went towards it and it came to meet him copying each step that he made and stopping when he stopped himself  he shouted with amusement and ran forward and reached out his hand and the hand of the monster touched his and it was as cold as ice  he grew afraid and moved his hand across and the monsters hand followed it quickly  he tried to press on but something smooth and hard stopped him  the face of the monster was now close to his own and seemed full of terror he brushed his hair off his eyes  it imitated him  he struck at it and it returned blow for blow  he loathed it and it made hideous faces at him  he drew back and it retreated  what is it  he thought for a moment and looked round at the rest of the room  it was strange but everything seemed to have its double in this invisible wall of clear water  yes picture for picture was repeated and couch for couch  the sleeping faun that lay in the alcove by the doorway had its twin brother that slumbered and the silver venus that stood in the sunlight held out her arms to a venus as lovely as herself  was it echo  he had called to her once in the valley and she had answered him word for word  could she mock the eye as she mocked the voice  could she make a mimic world just like the real world could the shadows of things have colour and life and movement could it be that  he started and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose he turned round and kissed it  the monster had a rose of its own petal for petal the same  it kissed it with like kisses and pressed it to its heart with horrible gestures  when the truth dawned upon him he gave a wild cry of despair and fell sobbing to the ground  so it was he who was misshapen and hunchbacked foul to look at and grotesque  he himself was the monster and it was at him that all the children had been laughing and the little princess who he had thought loved himshe too had been merely mocking at his ugliness and making merry over his twisted limbs  why had they not left him in the forest where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he was  why had his father not killed him rather than sell him to his shame  the hot tears poured down his cheeks and he tore the white rose to pieces the sprawling monster did the same and scattered the faint petals in the air  it grovelled on the ground and when he looked at it it watched him with a face drawn with pain  he crept away lest he should see it and covered his eyes with his hands  he crawled like some wounded thing into the shadow and lay there moaning  and at that moment the infanta herself came in with her companions through the open window and when they saw the ugly little dwarf lying on the ground and beating the floor with his clenched hands in the most fantastic and exaggerated manner they went off into shouts of happy laughter and stood all round him and watched him  his dancing was funny said the infanta but his acting is funnier still  indeed he is almost as good as the puppets only of course not quite so natural  and she fluttered her big fan and applauded  but the little dwarf never looked up and his sobs grew fainter and fainter and suddenly he gave a curious gasp and clutched his side  and then he fell back again and lay quite still  that is capital said the infanta after a pause but now you must dance for me  yes cried all the children you must get up and dance for you are as clever as the barbary apes and much more ridiculous  but the little dwarf made no answer  and the infanta stamped her foot and called out to her uncle who was walking on the terrace with the chamberlain reading some despatches that had just arrived from mexico where the holy office had recently been established  my funny little dwarf is sulking she cried you must wake him up and tell him to dance for me  they smiled at each other and sauntered in and don pedro stooped down and slapped the dwarf on the cheek with his embroidered glove  you must dance he said petit monsire  you must dance the infanta of spain and the indies wishes to be amused  but the little dwarf never moved  a whipping master should be sent for said don pedro wearily and he went back to the terrace  but the chamberlain looked grave and he knelt beside the little dwarf and put his hand upon his heart and after a few moments he shrugged his shoulders and rose up and having made a low bow to the infanta he said   mi bella princesa your funny little dwarf will never dance again it is a pity for he is so ugly that he might have made the king smile  but why will he not dance again asked the infanta laughing  because his heart is broken answered the chamberlain  and the infanta frowned and her dainty roseleaf lips curled in pretty disdain  for the future let those who come to play with me have no hearts she cried and she ran out into the garden     the fisherman and his soul     to hsh alice princess of monaco   every evening the young fisherman went out upon the sea and threw his nets into the water  when the wind blew from the land he caught nothing or but little at best for it was a bitter and blackwinged wind and rough waves rose up to meet it  but when the wind blew to the shore the fish came in from the deep and swam into the meshes of his nets and he took them to the marketplace and sold them  every evening he went out upon the sea and one evening the net was so heavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat  and he laughed and said to himself surely i have caught all the fish that swim or snared some dull monster that will be a marvel to men or some thing of horror that the great queen will desire and putting forth all his strength he tugged at the coarse ropes till like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze the long veins rose up on his arms  he tugged at the thin ropes and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks and the net rose at last to the top of the water  but no fish at all was in it nor any monster or thing of horror but only a little mermaid lying fast asleep  her hair was as a wet fleece of gold and each separate hair as a thread of fine gold in a cup of glass  her body was as white ivory and her tail was of silver and pearl  silver and pearl was her tail and the green weeds of the sea coiled round it and like seashells were her ears and her lips were like seacoral  the cold waves dashed over her cold breasts and the salt glistened upon her eyelids  so beautiful was she that when the young fisherman saw her he was filled with wonder and he put out his hand and drew the net close to him and leaning over the side he clasped her in his arms  and when he touched her she gave a cry like a startled seagull and woke and looked at him in terror with her mauveamethyst eyes and struggled that she might escape  but he held her tightly to him and would not suffer her to depart  and when she saw that she could in no way escape from him she began to weep and said i pray thee let me go for i am the only daughter of a king and my father is aged and alone  but the young fisherman answered i will not let thee go save thou makest me a promise that whenever i call thee thou wilt come and sing to me for the fish delight to listen to the song of the sea folk and so shall my nets be full  wilt thou in very truth let me go if i promise thee this cried the mermaid  in very truth i will let thee go said the young fisherman  so she made him the promise he desired and sware it by the oath of the seafolk  and he loosened his arms from about her and she sank down into the water trembling with a strange fear   every evening the young fisherman went out upon the sea and called to the mermaid and she rose out of the water and sang to him round and round her swam the dolphins and the wild gulls wheeled above her head  and she sang a marvellous song  for she sang of the seafolk who drive their flocks from cave to cave and carry the little calves on their shoulders of the tritons who have long green beards and hairy breasts and blow through twisted conchs when the king passes by of the palace of the king which is all of amber with a roof of clear emerald and a pavement of bright pearl and of the gardens of the sea where the great filigrane fans of coral wave all day long and the fish dart about like silver birds and the anemones cling to the rocks and the pinks bourgeon in the ribbed yellow sand  she sang of the big whales that come down from the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to their fins of the sirens who tell of such wonderful things that the merchants have to stop their ears with wax lest they should hear them and leap into the water and be drowned of the sunken galleys with their tall masts and the frozen sailors clinging to the rigging and the mackerel swimming in and out of the open portholes of the little barnacles who are great travellers and cling to the keels of the ships and go round and round the world and of the cuttlefish who live in the sides of the cliffs and stretch out their long black arms and can make night come when they will it  she sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her own that is carved out of an opal and steered with a silken sail of the happy mermen who play upon harps and can charm the great kraken to sleep of the little children who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon their backs of the mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their arms to the mariners and of the sealions with their curved tusks and the seahorses with their floating manes  and as she sang all the tunnyfish came in from the deep to listen to her and the young fisherman threw his nets round them and caught them and others he took with a spear  and when his boat was wellladen the mermaid would sink down into the sea smiling at him  yet would she never come near him that he might touch her oftentimes he called to her and prayed of her but she would not and when he sought to seize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive nor did he see her again that day  and each day the sound of her voice became sweeter to his ears  so sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning and had no care of his craft  vermilionfinned and with eyes of bossy gold the tunnies went by in shoals but he heeded them not  his spear lay by his side unused and his baskets of plaited osier were empty with lips parted and eyes dim with wonder he sat idle in his boat and listened listening till the seamists crept round him and the wandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver  and one evening he called to her and said  little mermaid little mermaid i love thee  take me for thy bridegroom for i love thee  but the mermaid shook her head  thou hast a human soul she answered  if only thou wouldst send away thy soul then could i love thee  and the young fisherman said to himself of what use is my soul to me  i cannot see it  i may not touch it  i do not know it surely i will send it away from me and much gladness shall be mine  and a cry of joy broke from his lips and standing up in the painted boat he held out his arms to the mermaid  i will send my soul away he cried and you shall be my bride and i will be thy bridegroom and in the depth of the sea we will dwell together and all that thou hast sung of thou shalt show me and all that thou desirest i will do nor shall our lives be divided  and the little mermaid laughed for pleasure and hid her face in her hands  but how shall i send my soul from me cried the young fisherman tell me how i may do it and lo it shall be done  alas  i know not said the little mermaid  the seafolk have no souls  and she sank down into the deep looking wistfully at him   now early on the next morning before the sun was the span of a mans hand above the hill the young fisherman went to the house of the priest and knocked three times at the door  the novice looked out through the wicket and when he saw who it was he drew back the latch and said to him enter  and the young fisherman passed in and knelt down on the sweet smelling rushes of the floor and cried to the priest who was reading out of the holy book and said to him father i am in love with one of the seafolk and my soul hindereth me from having my desire  tell me how i can send my soul away from me for in truth i have no need of it  of what value is my soul to me  i cannot see it  i may not touch it  i do not know it  and the priest beat his breast and answered alack alack thou art mad or hast eaten of some poisonous herb for the soul is the noblest part of man and was given to us by god that we should nobly use it  there is no thing more precious than a human soul nor any earthly thing that can be weighed with it  it is worth all the gold that is in the world and is more precious than the rubies of the kings  therefore my son think not any more of this matter for it is a sin that may not be forgiven  and as for the seafolk they are lost and they who would traffic with them are lost also  they are as the beasts of the field that know not good from evil and for them the lord has not died  the young fishermans eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter words of the priest and he rose up from his knees and said to him father the fauns live in the forest and are glad and on the rocks sit the mermen with their harps of red gold  let me be as they are i beseech thee for their days are as the days of flowers  and as for my soul what doth my soul profit me if it stand between me and the thing that i love  the love of the body is vile cried the priest knitting his brows and vile and evil are the pagan things god suffers to wander through his world  accursed be the fauns of the woodland and accursed be the singers of the sea  i have heard them at nighttime and they have sought to lure me from my beads  they tap at the window and laugh  they whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys  they tempt me with temptations and when i would pray they make mouths at me  they are lost i tell thee they are lost  for them there is no heaven nor hell and in neither shall they praise gods name  father cried the young fisherman thou knowest not what thou sayest  once in my net i snared the daughter of a king  she is fairer than the morning star and whiter than the moon  for her body i would give my soul and for her love i would surrender heaven  tell me what i ask of thee and let me go in peace  away  away cried the priest  thy leman is lost and thou shalt be lost with her  and he gave him no blessing but drove him from his door  and the young fisherman went down into the marketplace and he walked slowly and with bowed head as one who is in sorrow  and when the merchants saw him coming they began to whisper to each other and one of them came forth to meet him and called him by name and said to him what hast thou to sell  i will sell thee my soul he answered  i pray thee buy it of me for i am weary of it  of what use is my soul to me  i cannot see it  i may not touch it  i do not know it  but the merchants mocked at him and said of what use is a mans soul to us  it is not worth a clipped piece of silver  sell us thy body for a slave and we will clothe thee in seapurple and put a ring upon thy finger and make thee the minion of the great queen  but talk not of the soul for to us it is nought nor has it any value for our service  and the young fisherman said to himself  how strange a thing this is  the priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver  and he passed out of the marketplace and went down to the shore of the sea and began to ponder on what he should do   and at noon he remembered how one of his companions who was a gatherer of samphire had told him of a certain young witch who dwelt in a cave at the head of the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries  and he set to and ran so eager was he to get rid of his soul and a cloud of dust followed him as he sped round the sand of the shore  by the itching of her palm the young witch knew his coming and she laughed and let down her red hair  with her red hair falling around her she stood at the opening of the cave and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that was blossoming  what dye lack  what dye lack she cried as he came panting up the steep and bent down before her  fish for thy net when the wind is foul  i have a little reedpipe and when i blow on it the mullet come sailing into the bay  but it has a price pretty boy it has a price  what dye lack  what dye lack  a storm to wreck the ships and wash the chests of rich treasure ashore  i have more storms than the wind has for i serve one who is stronger than the wind and with a sieve and a pail of water i can send the great galleys to the bottom of the sea  but i have a price pretty boy i have a price  what dye lack  what dye lack  i know a flower that grows in the valley none knows it but i  it has purple leaves and a star in its heart and its juice is as white as milk shouldst thou touch with this flower the hard lips of the queen she would follow thee all over the world  out of the bed of the king she would rise and over the whole world she would follow thee  and it has a price pretty boy it has a price  what dye lack  what dye lack  i can pound a toad in a mortar and make broth of it and stir the broth with a dead mans hand  sprinkle it on thine enemy while he sleeps and he will turn into a black viper and his own mother will slay him  with a wheel i can draw the moon from heaven and in a crystal i can show thee death  what dye lack  what dye lack  tell me thy desire and i will give it thee and thou shalt pay me a price pretty boy thou shalt pay me a price  my desire is but for a little thing said the young fisherman yet hath the priest been wroth with me and driven me forth  it is but for a little thing and the merchants have mocked at me and denied me  therefore am i come to thee though men call thee evil and whatever be thy price i shall pay it  what wouldst thou asked the witch coming near to him  i would send my soul away from me answered the young fisherman  the witch grew pale and shuddered and hid her face in her blue mantle  pretty boy pretty boy she muttered that is a terrible thing to do  he tossed his brown curls and laughed  my soul is nought to me he answered  i cannot see it  i may not touch it  i do not know it  what wilt thou give me if i tell thee asked the witch looking down at him with her beautiful eyes  five pieces of gold he said and my nets and the wattled house where i live and the painted boat in which i sail  only tell me how to get rid of my soul and i will give thee all that i possess  she laughed mockingly at him and struck him with the spray of hemlock  i can turn the autumn leaves into gold she answered and i can weave the pale moonbeams into silver if i will it  he whom i serve is richer than all the kings of this world and has their dominions  what then shall i give thee he cried if thy price be neither gold nor silver  the witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand  thou must dance with me pretty boy she murmured and she smiled at him as she spoke  nought but that cried the young fisherman in wonder and he rose to his feet  nought but that she answered and she smiled at him again  then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together he said and after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which i desire to know  she shook her head  when the moon is full when the moon is full she muttered  then she peered all round and listened  a blue bird rose screaming from its nest and circled over the dunes and three spotted birds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other  there was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth pebbles below  so she reached out her hand and drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to his ear  tonight thou must come to the top of the mountain she whispered  it is a sabbath and he will be there  the young fisherman started and looked at her and she showed her white teeth and laughed  who is he of whom thou speakest he asked  it matters not she answered  go thou tonight and stand under the branches of the hornbeam and wait for my coming  if a black dog run towards thee strike it with a rod of willow and it will go away  if an owl speak to thee make it no answer  when the moon is full i shall be with thee and we will dance together on the grass  but wilt thou swear to me to tell me how i may send my soul from me he made question  she moved out into the sunlight and through her red hair rippled the wind  by the hoofs of the goat i swear it she made answer  thou art the best of the witches cried the young fisherman and i will surely dance with thee tonight on the top of the mountain i would indeed that thou hadst asked of me either gold or silver but such as thy price is thou shalt have it for it is but a little thing  and he doffed his cap to her and bent his head low and ran back to the town filled with a great joy  and the witch watched him as he went and when he had passed from her sight she entered her cave and having taken a mirror from a box of carved cedarwood she set it up on a frame and burned vervain on lighted charcoal before it and peered through the coils of the smoke  and after a time she clenched her hands in anger he should have been mine she muttered i am as fair as she is   and that evening when the moon had risen the young fisherman climbed up to the top of the mountain and stood under the branches of the hornbeam  like a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet and the shadows of the fishingboats moved in the little bay  a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes called to him by his name but he made it no answer  a black dog ran towards him and snarled  he struck it with a rod of willow and it went away whining  at midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats phew they cried as they lit upon the ground there is some one here we know not and they sniffed about and chattered to each other and made signs  last of all came the young witch with her red hair streaming in the wind  she wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks eyes and a little cap of green velvet was on her head  where is he where is he shrieked the witches when they saw her but she only laughed and ran to the hornbeam and taking the fisherman by the hand she led him out into the moonlight and began to dance  round and round they whirled and the young witch jumped so high that he could see the scarlet heels of her shoes  then right across the dancers came the sound of the galloping of a horse but no horse was to be seen and he felt afraid  faster cried the witch and she threw her arms about his neck and her breath was hot upon his face  faster faster she cried and the earth seemed to spin beneath his feet and his brain grew troubled and a great terror fell on him as of some evil thing that was watching him and at last he became aware that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure that had not been there before  it was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet cut in the spanish fashion  his face was strangely pale but his lips were like a proud red flower  he seemed weary and was leaning back toying in a listless manner with the pommel of his dagger  on the grass beside him lay a plumed hat and a pair of ridinggloves gauntleted with gilt lace and sewn with seedpearls wrought into a curious device  a short cloak lined with sables hang from his shoulder and his delicate white hands were gemmed with rings  heavy eyelids drooped over his eyes  the young fisherman watched him as one snared in a spell  at last their eyes met and wherever he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the man were upon him  he heard the witch laugh and caught her by the waist and whirled her madly round and round  suddenly a dog bayed in the wood and the dancers stopped and going up two by two knelt down and kissed the mans hands  as they did so a little smile touched his proud lips as a birds wing touches the water and makes it laugh  but there was disdain in it  he kept looking at the young fisherman  come let us worship whispered the witch and she led him up and a great desire to do as she besought him seized on him and he followed her  but when he came close and without knowing why he did it he made on his breast the sign of the cross and called upon the holy name  no sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew away and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a spasm of pain  the man went over to a little wood and whistled  a jennet with silver trappings came running to meet him as he leapt upon the saddle he turned round and looked at the young fisherman sadly  and the witch with the red hair tried to fly away also but the fisherman caught her by her wrists and held her fast  loose me she cried and let me go  for thou hast named what should not be named and shown the sign that may not be looked at  nay he answered but i will not let thee go till thou hast told me the secret  what secret said the witch wrestling with him like a wild cat and biting her foamflecked lips  thou knowest he made answer  her grassgreen eyes grew dim with tears and she said to the fisherman ask me anything but that  he laughed and held her all the more tightly  and when she saw that she could not free herself she whispered to him surely i am as fair as the daughters of the sea and as comely as those that dwell in the blue waters and she fawned on him and put her face close to his  but he thrust her back frowning and said to her if thou keepest not the promise that thou madest to me i will slay thee for a false witch   she grew grey as a blossom of the judas tree and shuddered  be it so she muttered  it is thy soul and not mine  do with it as thou wilt  and she took from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green vipers skin and gave it to him  what shall this serve me he asked of her wondering  she was silent for a few moments and a look of terror came over her face  then she brushed her hair back from her forehead and smiling strangely she said to him what men call the shadow of the body is not the shadow of the body but is the body of the soul stand on the seashore with thy back to the moon and cut away from around thy feet thy shadow which is thy souls body and bid thy soul leave thee and it will do so  the young fisherman trembled  is this true he murmured  it is true and i would that i had not told thee of it she cried and she clung to his knees weeping  he put her from him and left her in the rank grass and going to the edge of the mountain he placed the knife in his belt and began to climb down  and his soul that was within him called out to him and said lo i have dwelt with thee for all these years and have been thy servant  send me not away from thee now for what evil have i done thee  and the young fisherman laughed  thou hast done me no evil but i have no need of thee he answered  the world is wide and there is heaven also and hell and that dim twilight house that lies between  go wherever thou wilt but trouble me not for my love is calling to me  and his soul besought him piteously but he heeded it not but leapt from crag to crag being surefooted as a wild goat and at last he reached the level ground and the yellow shore of the sea  bronzelimbed and wellknit like a statue wrought by a grecian he stood on the sand with his back to the moon and out of the foam came white arms that beckoned to him and out of the waves rose dim forms that did him homage  before him lay his shadow which was the body of his soul and behind him hung the moon in the honey coloured air  and his soul said to him if indeed thou must drive me from thee send me not forth without a heart  the world is cruel give me thy heart to take with me  he tossed his head and smiled  with what should i love my love if i gave thee my heart he cried  nay but be merciful said his soul  give me thy heart for the world is very cruel and i am afraid  my heart is my loves he answered therefore tarry not but get thee gone  should i not love also asked his soul  get thee gone for i have no need of thee cried the young fisherman and he took the little knife with its handle of green vipers skin and cut away his shadow from around his feet and it rose up and stood before him and looked at him and it was even as himself  he crept back and thrust the knife into his belt and a feeling of awe came over him  get thee gone he murmured and let me see thy face no more  nay but we must meet again said the soul  its voice was low and flutelike and its lips hardly moved while it spake  how shall we meet cried the young fisherman  thou wilt not follow me into the depths of the sea  once every year i will come to this place and call to thee said the soul  it may be that thou wilt have need of me  what need should i have of thee cried the young fisherman but be it as thou wilt and he plunged into the waters and the tritons blew their horns and the little mermaid rose up to meet him and put her arms around his neck and kissed him on the mouth  and the soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them  and when they had sunk down into the sea it went weeping away over the marshes   and after a year was over the soul came down to the shore of the sea and called to the young fisherman and he rose out of the deep and said why dost thou call to me  and the soul answered come nearer that i may speak with thee for i have seen marvellous things  so he came nearer and couched in the shallow water and leaned his head upon his hand and listened   and the soul said to him when i left thee i turned my face to the east and journeyed  from the east cometh everything that is wise six days i journeyed and on the morning of the seventh day i came to a hill that is in the country of the tartars  i sat down under the shade of a tamarisk tree to shelter myself from the sun  the land was dry and burnt up with the heat  the people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling upon a disk of polished copper  when it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the land  when the tartars saw it they strung their painted bows and having leapt upon their little horses they galloped to meet it the women fled screaming to the waggons and hid themselves behind the felt curtains  at twilight the tartars returned but five of them were missing and of those that came back not a few had been wounded  they harnessed their horses to the waggons and drove hastily away three jackals came out of a cave and peered after them  then they sniffed up the air with their nostrils and trotted off in the opposite direction  when the moon rose i saw a campfire burning on the plain and went towards it  a company of merchants were seated round it on carpets  their camels were picketed behind them and the negroes who were their servants were pitching tents of tanned skin upon the sand and making a high wall of the prickly pear  as i came near them the chief of the merchants rose up and drew his sword and asked me my business  i answered that i was a prince in my own land and that i had escaped from the tartars who had sought to make me their slave the chief smiled and showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo  then he asked me who was the prophet of god and i answered him mohammed  when he heard the name of the false prophet he bowed and took me by the hand and placed me by his side  a negro brought me some mares milk in a wooden dish and a piece of lambs flesh roasted  at daybreak we started on our journey  i rode on a redhaired camel by the side of the chief and a runner ran before us carrying a spear  the men of war were on either hand and the mules followed with the merchandise  there were forty camels in the caravan and the mules were twice forty in number  we went from the country of the tartars into the country of those who curse the moon  we saw the gryphons guarding their gold on the white rocks and the scaled dragons sleeping in their caves  as we passed over the mountains we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us and each man tied a veil of gauze before his eyes  as we passed through the valleys the pygmies shot arrows at us from the hollows of the trees and at nighttime we heard the wild men beating on their drums  when we came to the tower of apes we set fruits before them and they did not harm us  when we came to the tower of serpents we gave them warm milk in howls of brass and they let us go by  three times in our journey we came to the banks of the oxus  we crossed it on rafts of wood with great bladders of blown hide  the riverhorses raged against us and sought to slay us  when the camels saw them they trembled  the kings of each city levied tolls on us but would not suffer us to enter their gates  they threw us bread over the walls little maizecakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates  for every hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber  when the dwellers in the villages saw us coming they poisoned the wells and fled to the hillsummits  we fought with the magadae who are born old and grow younger and younger every year and die when they are little children and with the laktroi who say that they are the sons of tigers and paint themselves yellow and black and with the aurantes who bury their dead on the tops of trees and themselves live in dark caverns lest the sun who is their god should slay them and with the krimnians who worship a crocodile and give it earrings of green glass and feed it with butter and fresh fowls and with the agazonbae who are dogfaced and with the sibans who have horses feet and run more swiftly than horses  a third of our company died in battle and a third died of want  the rest murmured against me and said that i had brought them an evil fortune  i took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me  when they saw that i did not sicken they grew afraid  in the fourth month we reached the city of illel  it was night time when we came to the grove that is outside the walls and the air was sultry for the moon was travelling in scorpion  we took the ripe pomegranates from the trees and brake them and drank their sweet juices  then we lay down on our carpets and waited for the dawn  and at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city  it was wrought out of red bronze and carved with seadragons and dragons that have wings  the guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our business  the interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from the island of syria with much merchandise they took hostages and told us that they would open the gate to us at noon and bade us tarry till then  when it was noon they opened the gate and as we entered in the people came crowding out of the houses to look at us and a crier went round the city crying through a shell  we stood in the marketplace and the negroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests of sycamore  and when they had ended their task the merchants set forth their strange wares the waxed linen from egypt and the painted linen from the country of the ethiops the purple sponges from tyre and the blue hangings from sidon the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of glass and the curious vessels of burnt clay  from the roof of a house a company of women watched us  one of them wore a mask of gilded leather  and on the first day the priests came and bartered with us and on the second day came the nobles and on the third day came the craftsmen and the slaves  and this is their custom with all merchants as long as they tarry in the city  and we tarried for a moon and when the moon was waning i wearied and wandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of its god  the priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the green trees and on a pavement of black marble stood the rosered house in which the god had his dwelling  its doors were of powdered lacquer and bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold  the tilted roof was of sea green porcelain and the jutting eaves were festooned with little bells  when the white doves flew past they struck the bells with their wings and made them tinkle  in front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx  i lay down beside it and with my pale fingers i touched the broad leaves  one of the priests came towards me and stood behind me  he had sandals on his feet one of soft serpentskin and the other of birds plumage  on his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver crescents  seven yellows were woven into his robe and his frizzed hair was stained with antimony  after a little while he spake to me and asked me my desire  i told him that my desire was to see the god  the god is hunting said the priest looking strangely at me with his small slanting eyes  tell me in what forest and i will ride with him i answered  he combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long pointed nails  the god is asleep he murmured  tell me on what couch and i will watch by him i answered  the god is at the feast he cried  if the wine be sweet i will drink it with him and if it be bitter i will drink it with him also was my answer  he bowed his head in wonder and taking me by the hand he raised me up and led me into the temple  and in the first chamber i saw an idol seated on a throne of jasper bordered with great orient pearls  it was carved out of ebony and in stature was of the stature of a man  on its forehead was a ruby and thick oil dripped from its hair on to its thighs its feet were red with the blood of a newlyslain kid and its loins girt with a copper belt that was studded with seven beryls  and i said to the priest is this the god  and he answered me this is the god  show me the god i cried or i will surely slay thee  and i touched his hand and it became withered  and the priest besought me saying let my lord heal his servant and i will show him the god  so i breathed with my breath upon his hand and it became whole again and he trembled and led me into the second chamber and i saw an idol standing on a lotus of jade hung with great emeralds it was carved out of ivory and in stature was twice the stature of a man  on its forehead was a chrysolite and its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon  in one hand it held a crooked sceptre of jade and in the other a round crystal  it ware buskins of brass and its thick neck was circled with a circle of selenites  and i said to the priest is this the god  and he answered me this is the god  show me the god i cried or i will surely slay thee  and i touched his eyes and they became blind  and the priest besought me saying let my lord heal his servant and i will show him the god  so i breathed with my breath upon his eyes and the sight came back to them and he trembled again and led me into the third chamber and lo there was no idol in it nor image of any kind but only a mirror of round metal set on an altar of stone  and i said to the priest where is the god  and he answered me  there is no god but this mirror that thou seest for this is the mirror of wisdom  and it reflecteth all things that are in heaven and on earth save only the face of him who looketh into it  this it reflecteth not so that he who looketh into it may be wise  many other mirrors are there but they are mirrors of opinion  this only is the mirror of wisdom and they who possess this mirror know everything nor is there anything hidden from them  and they who possess it not have not wisdom  therefore is it the god and we worship it  and i looked into the mirror and it was even as he had said to me  and i did a strange thing but what i did matters not for in a valley that is but a days journey from this place have i hidden the mirror of wisdom  do but suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant and thou shalt be wiser than all the wise men and wisdom shall be thine  suffer me to enter into thee and none will be as wise as thou  but the young fisherman laughed  love is better than wisdom he cried and the little mermaid loves me  nay but there is nothing better than wisdom said the soul  love is better answered the young fisherman and he plunged into the deep and the soul went weeping away over the marshes   and after the second year was over the soul came down to the shore of the sea and called to the young fisherman and he rose out of the deep and said why dost thou call to me  and the soul answered come nearer that i may speak with thee for i have seen marvellous things  so he came nearer and couched in the shallow water and leaned his head upon his hand and listened  and the soul said to him when i left thee i turned my face to the south and journeyed  from the south cometh everything that is precious  six days i journeyed along the highways that lead to the city of ashter along the dusty reddyed highways by which the pilgrims are wont to go did i journey and on the morning of the seventh day i lifted up my eyes and lo the city lay at my feet for it is in a valley  there are nine gates to this city and in front of each gate stands a bronze horse that neighs when the bedouins come down from the mountains  the walls are cased with copper and the watch towers on the walls are roofed with brass  in every tower stands an archer with a bow in his hand  at sunrise he strikes with an arrow on a gong and at sunset he blows through a horn of horn  when i sought to enter the guards stopped me and asked of me who i was  i made answer that i was a dervish and on my way to the city of mecca where there was a green veil on which the koran was embroidered in silver letters by the hands of the angels  they were filled with wonder and entreated me to pass in  inside it is even as a bazaar  surely thou shouldst have been with me  across the narrow streets the gay lanterns of paper flutter like large butterflies  when the wind blows over the roofs they rise and fall as painted bubbles do  in front of their booths sit the merchants on silken carpets  they have straight black beards and their turbans are covered with golden sequins and long strings of amber and carved peachstones glide through their cool fingers  some of them sell galbanum and nard and curious perfumes from the islands of the indian sea and the thick oil of red roses and myrrh and little nailshaped cloves  when one stops to speak to them they throw pinches of frankincense upon a charcoal brazier and make the air sweet  i saw a syrian who held in his hands a thin rod like a reed  grey threads of smoke came from it and its odour as it burned was as the odour of the pink almond in spring others sell silver bracelets embossed all over with creamy blue turquoise stones and anklets of brass wire fringed with little pearls and tigers claws set in gold and the claws of that gilt cat the leopard set in gold also and earrings of pierced emerald and fingerrings of hollowed jade  from the teahouses comes the sound of the guitar and the opiumsmokers with their white smiling faces look out at the passersby  of a truth thou shouldst have been with me  the winesellers elbow their way through the crowd with great black skins on their shoulders  most of them sell the wine of schiraz which is as sweet as honey  they serve it in little metal cups and strew rose leaves upon it  in the marketplace stand the fruitsellers who sell all kinds of fruit  ripe figs with their bruised purple flesh melons smelling of musk and yellow as topazes citrons and roseapples and clusters of white grapes round redgold oranges and oval lemons of green gold  once i saw an elephant go by  its trunk was painted with vermilion and turmeric and over its ears it had a net of crimson silk cord  it stopped opposite one of the booths and began eating the oranges and the man only laughed thou canst not think how strange a people they are  when they are glad they go to the birdsellers and buy of them a caged bird and set it free that their joy may be greater and when they are sad they scourge themselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less  one evening i met some negroes carrying a heavy palanquin through the bazaar  it was made of gilded bamboo and the poles were of vermilion lacquer studded with brass peacocks  across the windows hung thin curtains of muslin embroidered with beetles wings and with tiny seedpearls and as it passed by a palefaced circassian looked out and smiled at me  i followed behind and the negroes hurried their steps and scowled  but i did not care  i felt a great curiosity come over me  at last they stopped at a square white house  there were no windows to it only a little door like the door of a tomb  they set down the palanquin and knocked three times with a copper hammer  an armenian in a caftan of green leather peered through the wicket and when he saw them he opened and spread a carpet on the ground and the woman stepped out  as she went in she turned round and smiled at me again  i had never seen any one so pale  when the moon rose i returned to the same place and sought for the house but it was no longer there  when i saw that i knew who the woman was and wherefore she had smiled at me  certainly thou shouldst have been with me  on the feast of the new moon the young emperor came forth from his palace and went into the mosque to pray  his hair and beard were dyed with roseleaves and his cheeks were powdered with a fine gold dust  the palms of his feet and hands were yellow with saffron  at sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver and at sunset he returned to it again in a robe of gold  the people flung themselves on the ground and hid their faces but i would not do so  i stood by the stall of a seller of dates and waited  when the emperor saw me he raised his painted eyebrows and stopped  i stood quite still and made him no obeisance  the people marvelled at my boldness and counselled me to flee from the city  i paid no heed to them but went and sat with the sellers of strange gods who by reason of their craft are abominated  when i told them what i had done each of them gave me a god and prayed me to leave them  that night as i lay on a cushion in the teahouse that is in the street of pomegranates the guards of the emperor entered and led me to the palace  as i went in they closed each door behind me and put a chain across it  inside was a great court with an arcade running all round  the walls were of white alabaster set here and there with blue and green tiles  the pillars were of green marble and the pavement of a kind of peachblossom marble  i had never seen anything like it before  as i passed across the court two veiled women looked down from a balcony and cursed me  the guards hastened on and the butts of the lances rang upon the polished floor  they opened a gate of wrought ivory and i found myself in a watered garden of seven terraces  it was planted with tulipcups and moonflowers and silverstudded aloes  like a slim reed of crystal a fountain hung in the dusky air  the cypresstrees were like burntout torches from one of them a nightingale was singing  at the end of the garden stood a little pavilion  as we approached it two eunuchs came out to meet us  their fat bodies swayed as they walked and they glanced curiously at me with their yellowlidded eyes  one of them drew aside the captain of the guard and in a low voice whispered to him  the other kept munching scented pastilles which he took with an affected gesture out of an oval box of lilac enamel  after a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the soldiers  they went back to the palace the eunuchs following slowly behind and plucking the sweet mulberries from the trees as they passed  once the elder of the two turned round and smiled at me with an evil smile  then the captain of the guard motioned me towards the entrance of the pavilion  i walked on without trembling and drawing the heavy curtain aside i entered in  the young emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins and a gerfalcon perched upon his wrist  behind him stood a brass turbaned nubian naked down to the waist and with heavy earrings in his split ears  on a table by the side of the couch lay a mighty scimitar of steel  when the emperor saw me he frowned and said to me what is thy name  knowest thou not that i am emperor of this city  but i made him no answer  he pointed with his finger at the scimitar and the nubian seized it and rushing forward struck at me with great violence  the blade whizzed through me and did me no hurt  the man fell sprawling on the floor and when he rose up his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind the couch  the emperor leapt to his feet and taking a lance from a stand of arms he threw it at me  i caught it in its flight and brake the shaft into two pieces  he shot at me with an arrow but i held up my hands and it stopped in midair  then he drew a dagger from a belt of white leather and stabbed the nubian in the throat lest the slave should tell of his dishonour  the man writhed like a trampled snake and a red foam bubbled from his lips  as soon as he was dead the emperor turned to me and when he had wiped away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled and purple silk he said to me art thou a prophet that i may not harm thee or the son of a prophet that i can do thee no hurt  i pray thee leave my city tonight for while thou art in it i am no longer its lord  and i answered him i will go for half of thy treasure  give me half of thy treasure and i will go away  he took me by the hand and led me out into the garden  when the captain of the guard saw me he wondered  when the eunuchs saw me their knees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear  there is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry and a brasssealed ceiling hung with lamps  the emperor touched one of the walls and it opened and we passed down a corridor that was lit with many torches  in niches upon each side stood great winejars filled to the brim with silver pieces  when we reached the centre of the corridor the emperor spake the word that may not be spoken and a granite door swung back on a secret spring and he put his hands before his face lest his eyes should be dazzled  thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was  there were huge tortoiseshells full of pearls and hollowed moonstones of great size piled up with red rubies  the gold was stored in coffers of elephanthide and the golddust in leather bottles there were opals and sapphires the former in cups of crystal and the latter in cups of jade  round green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of ivory and in one corner were silk bags filled some with turquoisestones and others with beryls  the ivory horns were heaped with purple amethysts and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and sards  the pillars which were of cedar were hung with strings of yellow lynxstones  in the flat oval shields there were carbuncles both winecoloured and coloured like grass  and yet i have told thee but a tithe of what was there  and when the emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he said to me  this is my house of treasure and half that is in it is thine even as i promised to thee  and i will give thee camels and camel drivers and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure to whatever part of the world thou desirest to go  and the thing shall be done tonight for i would not that the sun who is my father should see that there is in my city a man whom i cannot slay  but i answered him the gold that is here is thine and the silver also is thine and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price  as for me i have no need of these  nor shall i take aught from thee but that little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand  and the emperor frowned  it is but a ring of lead he cried nor has it any value  therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my city  nay i answered but i will take nought but that leaden ring for i know what is written within it and for what purpose  and the emperor trembled and besought me and said take all the treasure and go from my city  the half that is mine shall be thine also  and i did a strange thing but what i did matters not for in a cave that is but a days journey from this place have i hidden the ring of riches  it is but a days journey from this place and it waits for thy coming  he who has this ring is richer than all the kings of the world  come therefore and take it and the worlds riches shall be thine  but the young fisherman laughed  love is better than riches he cried and the little mermaid loves me  nay but there is nothing better than riches said the soul  love is better answered the young fisherman and he plunged into the deep and the soul went weeping away over the marshes   and after the third year was over the soul came down to the shore of the sea and called to the young fisherman and he rose out of the deep and said why dost thou call to me  and the soul answered come nearer that i may speak with thee for i have seen marvellous things  so he came nearer and couched in the shallow water and leaned his head upon his hand and listened  and the soul said to him in a city that i know of there is an inn that standeth by a river  i sat there with sailors who drank of two differentcoloured wines and ate bread made of barley and little salt fish served in bay leaves with vinegar  and as we sat and made merry there entered to us an old man bearing a leathern carpet and a lute that had two horns of amber  and when he had laid out the carpet on the floor he struck with a quill on the wire strings of his lute and a girl whose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us  her face was veiled with a veil of gauze but her feet were naked  naked were her feet and they moved over the carpet like little white pigeons  never have i seen anything so marvellous and the city in which she dances is but a days journey from this place  now when the young fisherman heard the words of his soul he remembered that the little mermaid had no feet and could not dance and a great desire came over him and he said to himself it is but a days journey and i can return to my love and he laughed and stood up in the shallow water and strode towards the shore  and when he had reached the dry shore he laughed again and held out his arms to his soul  and his soul gave a great cry of joy and ran to meet him and entered into him and the young fisherman saw stretched before him upon the sand that shadow of the body that is the body of the soul  and his soul said to him let us not tarry but get hence at once for the seagods are jealous and have monsters that do their bidding   so they made haste and all that night they journeyed beneath the moon and all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun and on the evening of the day they came to a city  and the young fisherman said to his soul is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me  and his soul answered him it is not this city but another nevertheless let us enter in  so they entered in and passed through the streets and as they passed through the street of the jewellers the young fisherman saw a fair silver cup set forth in a booth  and his soul said to him take that silver cup and hide it  so he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic and they went hurriedly out of the city  and after that they had gone a league from the city the young fisherman frowned and flung the cup away and said to his soul why didst thou tell me to take this cup and hide it for it was an evil thing to do  but his soul answered him be at peace be at peace  and on the evening of the second day they came to a city and the young fisherman said to his soul is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me  and his soul answered him it is not this city but another nevertheless let us enter in  so they entered in and passed through the streets and as they passed through the street of the sellers of sandals the young fisherman saw a child standing by a jar of water  and his soul said to him smite that child  so he smote the child till it wept and when he had done this they went hurriedly out of the city  and after that they had gone a league from the city the young fisherman grew wroth and said to his soul why didst thou tell me to smite the child for it was an evil thing to do  but his soul answered him be at peace be at peace  and on the evening of the third day they came to a city and the young fisherman said to his soul is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me  and his soul answered him it may be that it is in this city therefore let us enter in  so they entered in and passed through the streets but nowhere could the young fisherman find the river or the inn that stood by its side  and the people of the city looked curiously at him and he grew afraid and said to his soul let us go hence for she who dances with white feet is not here  but his soul answered nay but let us tarry for the night is dark and there will be robbers on the way  so he sat him down in the marketplace and rested and after a time there went by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of tartary and bare a lantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed  and the merchant said to him why dost thou sit in the marketplace seeing that the booths are closed and the bales corded  and the young fisherman answered him i can find no inn in this city nor have i any kinsman who might give me shelter  are we not all kinsmen said the merchant  and did not one god make us  therefore come with me for i have a guestchamber  so the young fisherman rose up and followed the merchant to his house  and when he had passed through a garden of pomegranates and entered into the house the merchant brought him rosewater in a copper dish that he might wash his hands and ripe melons that he might quench his thirst and set a bowl of rice and a piece of roasted kid before him  and after that he had finished the merchant led him to the guest chamber and bade him sleep and be at rest  and the young fisherman gave him thanks and kissed the ring that was on his hand and flung himself down on the carpets of dyed goatshair and when he had covered himself with a covering of black lambs wool he fell asleep  and three hours before dawn and while it was still night his soul waked him and said to him rise up and go to the room of the merchant even to the room in which he sleepeth and slay him and take from him his gold for we have need of it  and the young fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of the merchant and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a curved sword and the tray by the side of the merchant held nine purses of gold  and he reached out his hand and touched the sword and when he touched it the merchant started and awoke and leaping up seized himself the sword and cried to the young fisherman dost thou return evil for good and pay with the shedding of blood for the kindness that i have shown thee  and his soul said to the young fisherman strike him and he struck him so that he swooned and he seized then the nine purses of gold and fled hastily through the garden of pomegranates and set his face to the star that is the star of morning  and when they had gone a league from the city the young fisherman beat his breast and said to his soul why didst thou bid me slay the merchant and take his gold  surely thou art evil  but his soul answered him be at peace be at peace  nay cried the young fisherman i may not be at peace for all that thou hast made me to do i hate  thee also i hate and i bid thee tell me wherefore thou hast wrought with me in this wise  and his soul answered him when thou didst send me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart so i learned to do all these things and love them  what sayest thou murmured the young fisherman  thou knowest answered his soul thou knowest it well  hast thou forgotten that thou gavest me no heart  i trow not  and so trouble not thyself nor me but be at peace for there is no pain that thou shalt not give away nor any pleasure that thou shalt not receive  and when the young fisherman heard these words he trembled and said to his soul nay but thou art evil and hast made me forget my love and hast tempted me with temptations and hast set my feet in the ways of sin  and his soul answered him thou hast not forgotten that when thou didst send me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart  come let us go to another city and make merry for we have nine purses of gold  but the young fisherman took the nine purses of gold and flung them down and trampled on them  nay he cried but i will have nought to do with thee nor will i journey with thee anywhere but even as i sent thee away before so will i send thee away now for thou hast wrought me no good and he turned his back to the moon and with the little knife that had the handle of green vipers skin he strove to cut from his feet that shadow of the body which is the body of the soul  yet his soul stirred not from him nor paid heed to his command but said to him the spell that the witch told thee avails thee no more for i may not leave thee nor mayest thou drive me forth once in his life may a man send his soul away but he who receiveth back his soul must keep it with him for ever and this is his punishment and his reward  and the young fisherman grew pale and clenched his hands and cried she was a false witch in that she told me not that  nay answered his soul but she was true to him she worships and whose servant she will be ever  and when the young fisherman knew that he could no longer get rid of his soul and that it was an evil soul and would abide with him always he fell upon the ground weeping bitterly   and when it was day the young fisherman rose up and said to his soul i will bind my hands that i may not do thy bidding and close my lips that i may not speak thy words and i will return to the place where she whom i love has her dwelling  even to the sea will i return and to the little bay where she is wont to sing and i will call to her and tell her the evil i have done and the evil thou hast wrought on me  and his soul tempted him and said who is thy love that thou shouldst return to her  the world has many fairer than she is there are the dancinggirls of samaris who dance in the manner of all kinds of birds and beasts  their feet are painted with henna and in their hands they have little copper bells  they laugh while they dance and their laughter is as clear as the laughter of water  come with me and i will show them to thee  for what is this trouble of thine about the things of sin  is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater  is there poison in that which is sweet to drink  trouble not thyself but come with me to another city  there is a little city hard by in which there is a garden of tuliptrees  and there dwell in this comely garden white peacocks and peacocks that have blue breasts  their tails when they spread them to the sun are like disks of ivory and like gilt disks  and she who feeds them dances for their pleasure and sometimes she dances on her hands and at other times she dances with her feet  her eyes are coloured with stibium and her nostrils are shaped like the wings of a swallow  from a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a flower that is carved out of a pearl she laughs while she dances and the silver rings that are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver  and so trouble not thyself any more but come with me to this city  but the young fisherman answered not his soul but closed his lips with the seal of silence and with a tight cord bound his hands and journeyed back to the place from which he had come even to the little bay where his love had been wont to sing  and ever did his soul tempt him by the way but he made it no answer nor would he do any of the wickedness that it sought to make him to do so great was the power of the love that was within him  and when he had reached the shore of the sea he loosed the cord from his hands and took the seal of silence from his lips and called to the little mermaid  but she came not to his call though he called to her all day long and besought her  and his soul mocked him and said surely thou hast but little joy out of thy love  thou art as one who in time of death pours water into a broken vessel  thou givest away what thou hast and nought is given to thee in return  it were better for thee to come with me for i know where the valley of pleasure lies and what things are wrought there  but the young fisherman answered not his soul but in a cleft of the rock he built himself a house of wattles and abode there for the space of a year  and every morning he called to the mermaid and every noon he called to her again and at nighttime he spake her name  yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him nor in any place of the sea could he find her though he sought for her in the caves and in the green water in the pools of the tide and in the wells that are at the bottom of the deep  and ever did his soul tempt him with evil and whisper of terrible things  yet did it not prevail against him so great was the power of his love  and after the year was over the soul thought within himself i have tempted my master with evil and his love is stronger than i am  i will tempt him now with good and it may be that he will come with me  so he spake to the young fisherman and said i have told thee of the joy of the world and thou hast turned a deaf ear to me suffer me now to tell thee of the worlds pain and it may be that thou wilt hearken  for of a truth pain is the lord of this world nor is there any one who escapes from its net  there be some who lack raiment and others who lack bread  there be widows who sit in purple and widows who sit in rags  to and fro over the fens go the lepers and they are cruel to each other  the beggars go up and down on the highways and their wallets are empty  through the streets of the cities walks famine and the plague sits at their gates  come let us go forth and mend these things and make them not to be  wherefore shouldst thou tarry here calling to thy love seeing she comes not to thy call  and what is love that thou shouldst set this high store upon it  but the young fisherman answered it nought so great was the power of his love  and every morning he called to the mermaid and every noon he called to her again and at nighttime he spake her name yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him nor in any place of the sea could he find her though he sought for her in the rivers of the sea and in the valleys that are under the waves in the sea that the night makes purple and in the sea that the dawn leaves grey  and after the second year was over the soul said to the young fisherman at nighttime and as he sat in the wattled house alone lo now i have tempted thee with evil and i have tempted thee with good and thy love is stronger than i am  wherefore will i tempt thee no longer but i pray thee to suffer me to enter thy heart that i may be one with thee even as before  surely thou mayest enter said the young fisherman for in the days when with no heart thou didst go through the world thou must have much suffered  alas cried his soul i can find no place of entrance so compassed about with love is this heart of thine  yet i would that i could help thee said the young fisherman  and as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea even the cry that men hear when one of the seafolk is dead  and the young fisherman leapt up and left his wattled house and ran down to the shore  and the black waves came hurrying to the shore bearing with them a burden that was whiter than silver  white as the surf it was and like a flower it tossed on the waves  and the surf took it from the waves and the foam took it from the surf and the shore received it and lying at his feet the young fisherman saw the body of the little mermaid  dead at his feet it was lying  weeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it and he kissed the cold red of the mouth and toyed with the wet amber of the hair  he flung himself down beside it on the sand weeping as one trembling with joy and in his brown arms he held it to his breast  cold were the lips yet he kissed them  salt was the honey of the hair yet he tasted it with a bitter joy  he kissed the closed eyelids and the wild spray that lay upon their cups was less salt than his tears  and to the dead thing he made confession  into the shells of its ears he poured the harsh wine of his tale  he put the little hands round his neck and with his fingers he touched the thin reed of the throat  bitter bitter was his joy and full of strange gladness was his pain  the black sea came nearer and the white foam moaned like a leper with white claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore  from the palace of the seaking came the cry of mourning again and far out upon the sea the great tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns  flee away said his soul for ever doth the sea come nigher and if thou tarriest it will slay thee  flee away for i am afraid seeing that thy heart is closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love  flee away to a place of safety  surely thou wilt not send me without a heart into another world  but the young fisherman listened not to his soul but called on the little mermaid and said love is better than wisdom and more precious than riches and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men  the fires cannot destroy it nor can the waters quench it  i called on thee at dawn and thou didst not come to my call  the moon heard thy name yet hadst thou no heed of me  for evilly had i left thee and to my own hurt had i wandered away  yet ever did thy love abide with me and ever was it strong nor did aught prevail against it though i have looked upon evil and looked upon good  and now that thou art dead surely i will die with thee also  and his soul besought him to depart but he would not so great was his love  and the sea came nearer and sought to cover him with its waves and when he knew that the end was at hand he kissed with mad lips the cold lips of the mermaid and the heart that was within him brake  and as through the fulness of his love his heart did break the soul found an entrance and entered in and was one with him even as before  and the sea covered the young fisherman with its waves   and in the morning the priest went forth to bless the sea for it had been troubled  and with him went the monks and the musicians and the candlebearers and the swingers of censers and a great company  and when the priest reached the shore he saw the young fisherman lying drowned in the surf and clasped in his arms was the body of the little mermaid  and he drew back frowning and having made the sign of the cross he cried aloud and said i will not bless the sea nor anything that is in it  accursed be the seafolk and accursed be all they who traffic with them  and as for him who for loves sake forsook god and so lieth here with his leman slain by gods judgment take up his body and the body of his leman and bury them in the corner of the field of the fullers and set no mark above them nor sign of any kind that none may know the place of their resting  for accursed were they in their lives and accursed shall they be in their deaths also  and the people did as he commanded them and in the corner of the field of the fullers where no sweet herbs grew they dug a deep pit and laid the dead things within it  and when the third year was over and on a day that was a holy day the priest went up to the chapel that he might show to the people the wounds of the lord and speak to them about the wrath of god  and when he had robed himself with his robes and entered in and bowed himself before the altar he saw that the altar was covered with strange flowers that never had been seen before  strange were they to look at and of curious beauty and their beauty troubled him and their odour was sweet in his nostrils  and he felt glad and understood not why he was glad  and after that he had opened the tabernacle and incensed the monstrance that was in it and shown the fair wafer to the people and hid it again behind the veil of veils he began to speak to the people desiring to speak to them of the wrath of god  but the beauty of the white flowers troubled him and their odour was sweet in his nostrils and there came another word into his lips and he spake not of the wrath of god but of the god whose name is love and why he so spake he knew not  and when he had finished his word the people wept and the priest went back to the sacristy and his eyes were full of tears  and the deacons came in and began to unrobe him and took from him the alb and the girdle the maniple and the stole  and he stood as one in a dream  and after that they had unrobed him he looked at them and said what are the flowers that stand on the altar and whence do they come  and they answered him what flowers they are we cannot tell but they come from the corner of the fullers field  and the priest trembled and returned to his own house and prayed  and in the morning while it was still dawn he went forth with the monks and the musicians and the candlebearers and the swingers of censers and a great company and came to the shore of the sea and blessed the sea and all the wild things that are in it  the fauns also he blessed and the little things that dance in the woodland and the brighteyed things that peer through the leaves  all the things in gods world he blessed and the people were filled with joy and wonder  yet never again in the corner of the fullers field grew flowers of any kind but the field remained barren even as before  nor came the seafolk into the bay as they had been wont to do for they went to another part of the sea     the starchild     to miss margot tennantmrs asquith   once upon a time two poor woodcutters were making their way home through a great pineforest  it was winter and a night of bitter cold  the snow lay thick upon the ground and upon the branches of the trees  the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them as they passed  and when they came to the mountain torrent she was hanging motionless in air for the iceking had kissed her  so cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it  ugh snarled the wolf as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs this is perfectly monstrous weather why doesnt the government look to it  weet weet weet twittered the green linnets the old earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud  the earth is going to be married and this is her bridal dress whispered the turtledoves to each other  their little pink feet were quite frostbitten but they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation  nonsense growled the wolf  i tell you that it is all the fault of the government and if you dont believe me i shall eat you the wolf had a thoroughly practical mind and was never at a loss for a good argument  well for my own part said the woodpecker who was a born philosopher i dont care an atomic theory for explanations  if a thing is so it is so and at present it is terribly cold  terribly cold it certainly was  the little squirrels who lived inside the tall firtree kept rubbing each others noses to keep themselves warm and the rabbits curled themselves up in their holes and did not venture even to look out of doors  the only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned owls  their feathers were quite stiff with rime but they did not mind and they rolled their large yellow eyes and called out to each other across the forest tuwhit  tuwhoo  tuwhit  tuwhoo what delightful weather we are having  on and on went the two woodcutters blowing lustily upon their fingers and stamping with their huge ironshod boots upon the caked snow  once they sank into a deep drift and came out as white as millers are when the stones are grinding and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marshwater was frozen and their faggots fell out of their bundles and they had to pick them up and bind them together again and once they thought that they had lost their way and a great terror seized on them for they knew that the snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms but they put their trust in the good saint martin who watches over all travellers and retraced their steps and went warily and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest and saw far down in the valley beneath them the lights of the village in which they dwelt  so overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud and the earth seemed to them like a flower of silver and the moon like a flower of gold  yet after that they had laughed they became sad for they remembered their poverty and one of them said to the other why did we make merry seeing that life is for the rich and not for such as we are  better that we had died of cold in the forest or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us  truly answered his companion much is given to some and little is given to others  injustice has parcelled out the world nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow  but as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened  there fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star  it slipped down the side of the sky passing by the other stars in its course and as they watched it wondering it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willowtrees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stonesthrow away  why there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it they cried and they set to and ran so eager were they for the gold  and one of them ran faster than his mate and outstripped him and forced his way through the willows and came out on the other side and lo there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow so he hastened towards it and stooping down placed his hands upon it and it was a cloak of golden tissue curiously wrought with stars and wrapped in many folds  and he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky and when his comrade had come up they sat them down in the snow and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold  but alas no gold was in it nor silver nor indeed treasure of any kind but only a little child who was asleep  and one of them said to the other  this is a bitter ending to our hope nor have we any good fortune for what doth a child profit to a man  let us leave it here and go our way seeing that we are poor men and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another  but his companion answered him  nay but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow and though i am as poor as thou art and have many mouths to feed and but little in the pot yet will i bring it home with me and my wife shall have care of it  so very tenderly he took up the child and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold and made his way down the hill to the village his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart  and when they came to the village his comrade said to him thou hast the child therefore give me the cloak for it is meet that we should share  but he answered him  nay for the cloak is neither mine nor thine but the childs only and he bade him godspeed and went to his own house and knocked  and when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her she put her arms round his neck and kissed him and took from his back the bundle of faggots and brushed the snow off his boots and bade him come in  but he said to her i have found something in the forest and i have brought it to thee to have care of it and he stirred not from the threshold  what is it she cried  show it to me for the house is bare and we have need of many things  and he drew the cloak back and showed her the sleeping child  alack goodman she murmured have we not children of our own that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth  and who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune  and how shall we tend it  and she was wroth against him  nay but it is a starchild he answered and he told her the strange manner of the finding of it  but she would not be appeased but mocked at him and spoke angrily and cried  our children lack bread and shall we feed the child of another  who is there who careth for us  and who giveth us food  nay but god careth for the sparrows even and feedeth them he answered  do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter she asked  and is it not winter now  and the man answered nothing but stirred not from the threshold  and a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door and made her tremble and she shivered and said to him  wilt thou not close the door  there cometh a bitter wind into the house and i am cold  into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind he asked  and the woman answered him nothing but crept closer to the fire  and after a time she turned round and looked at him and her eyes were full of tears  and he came in swiftly and placed the child in her arms and she kissed it and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying  and on the morrow the woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest and a chain of amber that was round the childs neck his wife took and set it in the chest also   so the starchild was brought up with the children of the woodcutter and sat at the same board with them and was their playmate  and every year he became more beautiful to look at so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder for while they were swarthy and blackhaired he was white and delicate as sawn ivory and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil  his lips also were like the petals of a red flower and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not  yet did his beauty work him evil  for he grew proud and cruel and selfish  the children of the woodcutter and the other children of the village he despised saying that they were of mean parentage while he was noble being sprang from a star and he made himself master over them and called them his servants  no pity had he for the poor or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway and bid them beg their bread elsewhere so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms  indeed he was as one enamoured of beauty and would mock at the weakly and illfavoured and make jest of them and himself he loved and in summer when the winds were still he would lie by the well in the priests orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness  often did the woodcutter and his wife chide him and say  we did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate and have none to succour them  wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity  often did the old priest send for him and seek to teach him the love of living things saying to him  the fly is thy brother  do it no harm  the wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom  snare them not for thy pleasure  god made the blindworm and the mole and each has its place  who art thou to bring pain into gods world  even the cattle of the field praise him  but the starchild heeded not their words but would frown and flout and go back to his companions and lead them  and his companions followed him for he was fair and fleet of foot and could dance and pipe and make music  and wherever the starchild led them they followed and whatever the starchild bade them do that did they  and when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole they laughed and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also  and in all things he ruled them and they became hard of heart even as he was   now there passed one day through the village a poor beggarwoman her garments were torn and ragged and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled and she was in very evil plight  and being weary she sat her down under a chestnuttree to rest  but when the starchild saw her he said to his companions see there sitteth a foul beggarwoman under that fair and greenleaved tree  come let us drive her hence for she is ugly and ill favoured  so he came near and threw stones at her and mocked her and she looked at him with terror in her eyes nor did she move her gaze from him  and when the woodcutter who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by saw what the starchild was doing he ran up and rebuked him and said to him  surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise  and the starchild grew red with anger and stamped his foot upon the ground and said who art thou to question me what i do  i am no son of thine to do thy bidding  thou speakest truly answered the woodcutter yet did i show thee pity when i found thee in the forest  and when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry and fell into a swoon  and the woodcutter carried her to his own house and his wife had care of her and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen they set meat and drink before her and bade her have comfort  but she would neither eat nor drink but said to the woodcutter didst thou not say that the child was found in the forest  and was it not ten years from this day  and the woodcutter answered yea it was in the forest that i found him and it is ten years from this day  and what signs didst thou find with him she cried  bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber  was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars  truly answered the woodcutter it was even as thou sayest and he took the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay and showed them to her  and when she saw them she wept for joy and said he is my little son whom i lost in the forest  i pray thee send for him quickly for in search of him have i wandered over the whole world  so the woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the star child and said to him go into the house and there shalt thou find thy mother who is waiting for thee  so he ran in filled with wonder and great gladness  but when he saw her who was waiting there he laughed scornfully and said why where is my mother  for i see none here but this vile beggarwoman  and the woman answered him i am thy mother  thou art mad to say so cried the starchild angrily  i am no son of thine for thou art a beggar and ugly and in rags therefore get thee hence and let me see thy foul face no more  nay but thou art indeed my little son whom i bare in the forest she cried and she fell on her knees and held out her arms to him  the robbers stole thee from me and left thee to die she murmured but i recognised thee when i saw thee and the signs also have i recognised the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain  therefore i pray thee come with me for over the whole world have i wandered in search of thee  come with me my son for i have need of thy love  but the starchild stirred not from his place but shut the doors of his heart against her nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain  and at last he spoke to her and his voice was hard and bitter if in very truth thou art my mother he said it had been better hadst thou stayed away and not come here to bring me to shame seeing that i thought i was the child of some star and not a beggars child as thou tellest me that i am  therefore get thee hence and let me see thee no more  alas my son she cried wilt thou not kiss me before i go  for i have suffered much to find thee  nay said the starchild but thou art too foul to look at and rather would i kiss the adder or the toad than thee  so the woman rose up and went away into the forest weeping bitterly and when the starchild saw that she had gone he was glad and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them  but when they beheld him coming they mocked him and said why thou art as foul as the toad and as loathsome as the adder  get thee hence for we will not suffer thee to play with us and they drave him out of the garden  and the starchild frowned and said to himself what is this that they say to me  i will go to the well of water and look into it and it shall tell me of my beauty  so he went to the well of water and looked into it and lo his face was as the face of a toad and his body was sealed like an adder  and he flung himself down on the grass and wept and said to himself surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin  for i have denied my mother and driven her away and been proud and cruel to her  wherefore i will go and seek her through the whole world nor will i rest till i have found her  and there came to him the little daughter of the woodcutter and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said what doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness  stay with us and i will not mock at thee  and he said to her nay but i have been cruel to my mother and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me  wherefore i must go hence and wander through the world till i find her and she give me her forgiveness  so he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him but there was no answer  all day long he called to her and when the sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves and the birds and the animals fled from him for they remembered his cruelty and he was alone save for the toad that watched him and the slow adder that crawled past  and in the morning he rose up and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them and took his way through the great wood weeping sorely  and of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they had seen his mother  he said to the mole thou canst go beneath the earth  tell me is my mother there  and the mole answered thou hast blinded mine eyes  how should i know  he said to the linnet thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees and canst see the whole world  tell me canst thou see my mother  and the linnet answered thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure  how should i fly  and to the little squirrel who lived in the firtree and was lonely he said where is my mother  and the squirrel answered thou hast slain mine  dost thou seek to slay thine also  and the starchild wept and bowed his head and prayed forgiveness of gods things and went on through the forest seeking for the beggarwoman  and on the third day he came to the other side of the forest and went down into the plain  and when he passed through the villages the children mocked him and threw stones at him and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn so foul was he to look at and their hired men drave him away and there was none who had pity on him  nor could he hear anywhere of the beggarwoman who was his mother though for the space of three years he wandered over the world and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him and would call to her and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to bleed  but overtake her he could not and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her or any like to her and they made sport of his sorrow  for the space of three years he wandered over the world and in the world there was neither love nor lovingkindness nor charity for him but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride   and one evening he came to the gate of a strongwalled city that stood by a river and weary and footsore though he was he made to enter in  but the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance and said roughly to him what is thy business in the city  i am seeking for my mother he answered and i pray ye to suffer me to pass for it may be that she is in this city  but they mocked at him and one of them wagged a black beard and set down his shield and cried of a truth thy mother will not be merry when she sees thee for thou art more illfavoured than the toad of the marsh or the adder that crawls in the fen  get thee gone  get thee gone  thy mother dwells not in this city  and another who held a yellow banner in his hand said to him who is thy mother and wherefore art thou seeking for her  and he answered my mother is a beggar even as i am and i have treated her evilly and i pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her forgiveness if it be that she tarrieth in this city but they would not and pricked him with their spears  and as he turned away weeping one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance  and they said to him it is a beggar and the child of a beggar and we have driven him away  nay he cried laughing but we will sell the foul thing for a slave and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine  and an old and evilvisaged man who was passing by called out and said i will buy him for that price and when he had paid the price he took the starchild by the hand and led him into the city  and after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree  and the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay  and the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk and bound with it the eyes of the starchild and drave him in front of him  and when the scarf was taken off his eyes the starchild found himself in a dungeon that was lit by a lantern of horn  and the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said eat and some brackish water in a cup and said drink and when he had eaten and drunk the old man went out locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain   and on the morrow the old man who was indeed the subtlest of the magicians of libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the tombs of the nile came in to him and frowned at him and said in a wood that is nigh to the gate of this city of giaours there are three pieces of gold  one is of white gold and another is of yellow gold and the gold of the third one is red  today thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold and if thou bringest it not back i will beat thee with a hundred stripes  get thee away quickly and at sunset i will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden  see that thou bringest the white gold or it shall go ill with thee for thou art my slave and i have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine  and he bound the eyes of the starchild with the scarf of figured silk and led him through the house and through the garden of poppies and up the five steps of brass  and having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street   and the starchild went out of the gate of the city and came to the wood of which the magician had spoken to him  now this wood was very fair to look at from without and seemed full of singing birds and of sweetscented flowers and the star child entered it gladly  yet did its beauty profit him little for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him and evil nettles stung him and the thistle pierced him with her daggers so that he was in sore distress  nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the magician had spoken though he sought for it from morn to noon and from noon to sunset  and at sunset he set his face towards home weeping bitterly for he knew what fate was in store for him  but when he had reached the outskirts of the wood he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain  and forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place and saw there a little hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it  and the starchild had pity on it and released it and said to it i am myself but a slave yet may i give thee thy freedom  and the hare answered him and said  surely thou hast given me freedom and what shall i give thee in return  and the starchild said to it i am seeking for a piece of white gold nor can i anywhere find it and if i bring it not to my master he will beat me  come thou with me said the hare and i will lead thee to it for i know where it is hidden and for what purpose  so the starchild went with the hare and lo in the cleft of a great oaktree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking and he was filled with joy and seized it and said to the hare the service that i did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over and the kindness that i showed thee thou hast repaid a hundredfold  nay answered the hare but as thou dealt with me so i did deal with thee and it ran away swiftly and the starchild went towards the city  now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper over his face hung a cowl of grey linen and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals  and when he saw the starchild coming he struck upon a wooden bowl and clattered his bell and called out to him and said give me a piece of money or i must die of hunger  for they have thrust me out of the city and there is no one who has pity on me  alas cried the starchild i have but one piece of money in my wallet and if i bring it not to my master he will beat me for i am his slave  but the leper entreated him and prayed of him till the starchild had pity and gave him the piece of white gold   and when he came to the magicians house the magician opened to him and brought him in and said to him hast thou the piece of white gold  and the starchild answered i have it not  so the magician fell upon him and beat him and set before him an empty trencher and said eat and an empty cup and said drink and flung him again into the dungeon  and on the morrow the magician came to him and said if today thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold i will surely keep thee as my slave and give thee three hundred stripes  so the starchild went to the wood and all day long he searched for the piece of yellow gold but nowhere could he find it  and at sunset he sat him down and began to weep and as he was weeping there came to him the little hare that he had rescued from the trap  and the hare said to him why art thou weeping  and what dost thou seek in the wood  and the starchild answered i am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here and if i find it not my master will beat me and keep me as a slave  follow me cried the hare and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water  and at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying  how shall i thank thee said the starchild for lo this is the second time that you have succoured me  nay but thou hadst pity on me first said the hare and it ran away swiftly  and the starchild took the piece of yellow gold and put it in his wallet and hurried to the city  but the leper saw him coming and ran to meet him and knelt down and cried give me a piece of money or i shall die of hunger  and the starchild said to him i have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold and if i bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave  but the leper entreated him sore so that the starchild had pity on him and gave him the piece of yellow gold  and when he came to the magicians house the magician opened to him and brought him in and said to him hast thou the piece of yellow gold  and the starchild said to him i have it not  so the magician fell upon him and beat him and loaded him with chains and cast him again into the dungeon  and on the morrow the magician came to him and said if today thou bringest me the piece of red gold i will set thee free but if thou bringest it not i will surely slay thee  so the starchild went to the wood and all day long he searched for the piece of red gold but nowhere could he find it  and at evening he sat him down and wept and as he was weeping there came to him the little hare  and the hare said to him the piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee  therefore weep no more but be glad  how shall i reward thee cried the starchild for lo this is the third time thou hast succoured me  nay but thou hadst pity on me first said the hare and it ran away swiftly  and the starchild entered the cavern and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold  so he put it in his wallet and hurried to the city  and the leper seeing him coming stood in the centre of the road and cried out and said to him give me the piece of red money or i must die and the starchild had pity on him again and gave him the piece of red gold saying thy need is greater than mine  yet was his heart heavy for he knew what evil fate awaited him   but lo as he passed through the gate of the city the guards bowed down and made obeisance to him saying how beautiful is our lord and a crowd of citizens followed him and cried out surely there is none so beautiful in the whole world so that the star child wept and said to himself they are mocking me and making light of my misery  and so large was the concourse of the people that he lost the threads of his way and found himself at last in a great square in which there was a palace of a king  and the gate of the palace opened and the priests and the high officers of the city ran forth to meet him and they abased themselves before him and said thou art our lord for whom we have been waiting and the son of our king  and the starchild answered them and said i am no kings son but the child of a poor beggarwoman  and how say ye that i am beautiful for i know that i am evil to look at  then he whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers and on whose helmet crouched a lion that had wings held up a shield and cried how saith my lord that he is not beautiful  and the starchild looked and lo his face was even as it had been and his comeliness had come back to him and he saw that in his eyes which he had not seen there before  and the priests and the high officers knelt down and said to him it was prophesied of old that on this day should come he who was to rule over us  therefore let our lord take this crown and this sceptre and be in his justice and mercy our king over us  but he said to them i am not worthy for i have denied the mother who bare me nor may i rest till i have found her and known her forgiveness  therefore let me go for i must wander again over the world and may not tarry here though ye bring me the crown and the sceptre  and as he spake he turned his face from them towards the street that led to the gate of the city and lo amongst the crowd that pressed round the soldiers he saw the beggarwoman who was his mother and at her side stood the leper who had sat by the road  and a cry of joy broke from his lips and he ran over and kneeling down he kissed the wounds on his mothers feet and wet them with his tears  he bowed his head in the dust and sobbing as one whose heart might break he said to her  mother i denied thee in the hour of my pride  accept me in the hour of my humility mother i gave thee hatred  do thou give me love  mother i rejected thee  receive thy child now  but the beggarwoman answered him not a word  and he reached out his hands and clasped the white feet of the leper and said to him  thrice did i give thee of my mercy  bid my mother speak to me once  but the leper answered him not a word  and he sobbed again and said  mother my suffering is greater than i can bear  give me thy forgiveness and let me go back to the forest  and the beggarwoman put her hand on his head and said to him rise and the leper put his hand on his head and said to him rise also  and he rose up from his feet and looked at them and lo they were a king and a queen  and the queen said to him this is thy father whom thou hast succoured  and the king said this is thy mother whose feet thou hast washed with thy tears  and they fell on his neck and kissed him and brought him into the palace and clothed him in fair raiment and set the crown upon his head and the sceptre in his hand and over the city that stood by the river he ruled and was its lord  much justice and mercy did he show to all and the evil magician he banished and to the woodcutter and his wife he sent many rich gifts and to their children he gave high honour  nor would he suffer any to be cruel to bird or beast but taught love and lovingkindness and charity and to the poor he gave bread and to the naked he gave raiment and there was peace and plenty in the land  yet ruled he not long so great had been his suffering and so bitter the fire of his testing for after the space of three years he died  and he who came after him ruled evilly
