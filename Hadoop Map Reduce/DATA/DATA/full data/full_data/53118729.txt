boathook  dont talk to me about love because ive suffered enough through it  there ought to be teetotalers for love the same as wot there is for drink and they ought to wear a piece o ribbon to show it the same as the teetotalers do but not an attractive piece o ribbon mind you  ive seen as much mischief caused by love as by drink and the funny thing is one often leads to the other  love arter it is over often leads to drink and drink often leads to love and to a man committing himself for life afore it is over  illustration dont talk to me about love because ive suffered enough through it  sailormen give way to it most they see so little o wimmen that they naturally ave a high opinion of em  wait till they become nightwatchmen and having to be at ome all day see the other side of em  if people ony started life as nightwatchmen there wouldnt be one arf the falling in love that there is now  i remember one chap as nice a fellow as you could wish to meet too he always carried his sweethearts photograph about with im and it was the ony thing that cheered im up during the fourteen years he was cast away on a deserted island  he was picked up at last and taken ome and there she was still single and waiting for im and arter spending fourteen years on a deserted island he got another ten in quod for shooting er because she ad altered so much in er looks  then there was ginger dick a redaired man ive spoken about before he went and fell in love one time when he was lodging in wapping ere with old sam small and peter russet and a nice mess e made of it  they was just back from a vyge and they adnt been ashore a week afore both of em noticed a change for the worse in ginger  he turned quiet and peaceful and lost is taste for beer  he used to play with is food instead of eating it and in place of going out of an evening with sam and peter took to going off by imself  its love ses peter russet shaking his ead and hell be worse afore hes better  whos the gal ses old sam  peter didnt know but when they came ome that night e asked  ginger who was sitting up in bed with a faroff look in is eyes cuddling is knees went on staring but didnt answer  who is it making a fool of you this time ginger ses old sam  you mind your bisness and ill mind mine ses ginger suddenly waking up and looking very fierce  no offence mate ses sam winking at peter  i ony asked in case i might be able to do you a good turn  well you can do that by not letting her know youre a pal o mine ses ginger very nasty  old sam didnt understand at fust and when peter explained to im he wanted to hit im for trying to twist gingers words about  she dont like fat old men ses ginger  ho ses old sam who couldnt think of anything else to say  ho dont she  ho  ho indeed  he undressed imself and got into the bed he shared with peter and kept im awake for hours by telling im in a loud voice about all the gals hed made love to in his life and partikler about one gal that always fainted dead away whenever she saw either a redaired man or a monkey  peter russet found out all about it next day and told sam that it was a barmaid with black air and eyes at the jolly pilots and that she wouldnt ave anything to say to ginger  he spoke to ginger about it agin when they were going to bed that night and to is surprise found that he was quite civil  when e said that he would do anything he could for im ginger was quite affected  i cant eat or drink he ses in a miserable voice i lay awake all last night thinking of her  shes so diffrent to other gals shes gotif i start on you sam small youll know it  you go and make that choking noise to them as likes it  its a bit o eggshell i got in my throat at breakfast this morning ginger ses sam  i wonder whether she lays awake all night thinking of you  i dare say she does ses peter russet giving im a little push  keep your art up ginger ses sam ive known gals to ave the most extordinary likings afore now  dont take no notice of im ses peter holding ginger back  ow are you getting on with her  ginger groaned and sat down on is bed and looked at the floor and sam went and sat on his till it shook so that ginger offered to step over and break is neck for im  i cant elp the bed shaking ses sam it aint my fault  i didnt make it  if being in love is going to make you so disagreeable to your best friends ginger youd better go and live by yourself  i eard something about her today ginger ses peter russet  i met a chap i used to know at bulls wharf and he told me that she used to keep company with a chap named bill lumm a bit of a prizefighter and since she gave im up she wont look at anybody else  was she very fond of im then asks ginger  i dont know ses peter but this chap told me that she wont walk out with anybody agin unless its another prizefighter  her pride wont let her i spose  well thats all right ginger ses sam all youve got to do is to go and be a prizefighter  if i ave any more o your nonsense ses ginger starting up  thats right ses sam jump down anybodys throat when theyre trying to do you a kindness  thats you all over ginger that is  wots to prevent you telling er that youre a prizefighter from australia or somewhere  she wont know no better  he got up off the bed and put his ands up as ginger walked across the room to im but ginger ony wanted to shake ands and arter he ad done that e patted im on the back and smiled at im  ill try it he ses  id tell any lies for er sake  ah you dont know wot love is sam  i used to ses sam and then he sat down agin and began to tell em all the loveaffairs he could remember until at last peter russet got tired and said it was ard to believe looking at im now wot a perfick terror hed been with gals and said that the face hed got now was a judgment on im  sam shut up arter that and got into trouble with peter in the middle o the night by waking im up to tell im something that he ad just thought of about his face  the more ginger thought o sams idea the more he liked it and the very next evening e took peter russet into the private bar o the jolly pilots  he ordered port wine which he thought seemed more ighclass than beer and then peter russet started talking to miss tucker and told her that ginger was a prizefighter from sydney where hed beat everybody that stood up to im  the gal seemed to change toward ginger all in a flash and er beautiful black eyes looked at im so admiring that he felt quite faint  she started talking to im about his fights at once and when at last e plucked up courage to ask er to go for a walk with im on sunday arternoon she seemed quite delighted  itll be a nice change for me she ses smiling  i used to walk out with a prizefighter once before and since i gave im up i began to think i was never going to ave a young man agin  you cant think ow dull its been  must ha been ses ginger  i spose youve got a taste for prizefighters miss ses peter russet  no ses miss tucker i dont think that its that exactly but you see i couldnt ave anybody else  not for their own sakes  illustration miss tucker  why not ses ginger looking puzzled  why not ses miss tucker  why because o bill  hes such a orrid jealous disposition  after i gave im up i walked out with a young fellow named smith fine big strapping chap e was too and i never saw such a change in any man as there was in im after bill ad done with im  i couldnt believe it was im  i told bill he ought to be ashamed of imself  wot did e say  asks ginger  dont ask me wot e said ses miss tucker tossing her ead  not liking to be beat i ad one more try with a young fellow named charlie webb  wot appened to im ses peter russet arter waiting a bit for er to finish  i cant bear to talk of it ses miss tucker holding up gingers glass and giving the counter a wipe down  he met bill and i saw im six weeks afterward just as e was being sent away from the ospital to a seaside home  bill disappeared after that  has he gone far away ses ginger trying to speak in a offand way  oh hes back now ses miss tucker  youll see im fast enough and wotever you do dont let im know youre a prizefighter  why not ses pore ginger  because o the surprise itll be to im ses miss tucker  let im rush on to is doom  hell get a lesson e dont expect the bully dont be afraid of urting im  think o pore smith and charlie webb  i am thinkin of em ses ginger slowlike  isis billvery quick with his ands  rather ses miss tucker but o course he aint up to your mark hes ony known in these parts  she went off to serve a customer and ginger dick tried to catch peters eye but couldnt and when miss tucker came back he said e must be going  sunday afternoon at a quarter past three sharp outside ere she ses never mind about putting on your best clothes because bill is sure to be hanging about  ill take care o that  she reached over the bar and shook ands with im and ginger felt a thrill go up is arm which lasted im all the way ome  he didnt know whether to turn up on sunday or not and if it adnt ha been for sam and peter russet hed ha most likely stayed at home  not that e was a coward being always ready for a scrap and ginrally speaking doing well at it but he made a few inquiries about bill lumm and e saw that e had about as much chance with im as a kitten would ave with a bulldog  sam and peter was delighted and they talked about it as if it was a pantermime and old sam said that when he was a young man hed ha fought six bill lumms afore hed ha given a gal up  he brushed gingers clothes for im with is own hands on sunday afternoon and when ginger started im and peter follered some distance behind to see fair play  the ony person outside the jolly pilots when ginger got there was a man a strongbuilt chap with a thick neck very large ands and a nose which ad seen its best days some time afore  he looked ard at ginger as e came up and then stuck his ands in is trouser pockets and spat on the pavement  ginger walked a little way past and then back agin and just as he was thinking that e might venture to go off as miss tucker adnt come the door opened and out she came  i couldnt find my atpins she ses taking gingers arm and smiling up into is face  before ginger could say anything the man he ad noticed took his ands out of is pockets and stepped up to im  let go o that young ladys arm he ses  shant ses ginger holding it so tight that miss tucker nearly screamed  let go er arm and put your ands up ses the chap agin  illustration let go o that young ladys arm he ses  not ere ses ginger who ad laid awake the night afore thinking

very firm theres one or two gentlemen want to see a bit o my work afore backing me and we can combine bisness with pleasure  he walked off with miss tucker leaving bill lumm standing on the pavement scratching his ead and staring arter im as though e didnt quite know wot to make of it  bill stood there for pretty near five minutes and then arter asking sam and peter who ad been standing by listening whether they wanted anything for themselves walked off to ask is pals wot they knew about the sydney puncher  ginger dick was so quiet and satisfied about the fight that old sam and peter couldnt make im out at all  he wouldnt even practise punching at a bolster that peter rigged up for im and when e got a message from bill lumm naming a quiet place on the lea marshes he agreed to it as comfortable as possible  well i must say ginger that i like your pluck ses peter russet  i always ave said that for ginger es got pluck ses sam  ginger coughed and tried to smile at em in a superior sort o way  i thought youd got more sense he ses at last  you dont think im going do you  wot ses old sam in a shocked voice  youre never going to back out of it ginger  ses peter  i am ses ginger  if you think im going to be smashed up by a prizefighter just to show my pluck youre mistook  you must go ginger ses old sam very severe  its too late to back out of it now  think of the gal  think of er feelings  for the sake of your good name ses peter  i should never speak to you agin ginger ses old sam pursing up is lips  nor me neither ses peter russet  to think of our ginger being called a coward ses old sam with a shudder and afore a gal too  the loveliest gal in wapping ses peter  look ere ses ginger you can shut up both of you  im not going and thats the long and short of it  i dont mind an ordinary man but i draw the line at prizefighters  old sam sat down on the edge of is bed and looked the picture of despair  you must go ginger he ses for my sake  your sake  ses ginger staring  ive got money on it ses sam sos peter  if you dont turn up all betsll be off  good job for you too ses ginger  if i did turn up youd lose it to a dead certainty  old sam coughed and looked at peter and peter e coughed and looked at sam  you dont understand ginger said sam in a soft voice it aint often a chap gets the chance o making a bit o money these ard times  so weve put all our money on bill lumm ses peter  its the safest and easiest way o making money i ever eard of  you see we know youre not a prizefighter and the others dont  pore ginger looked at em and then e called em all the names he could lay is tongue to but with the idea o the money they was going make they didnt mind a bit  they let him ave is say and that night they brought ome two other sailormen wot ad bet agin ginger to share their room and though they ad bet agin im they was so fond of im that it was evident that they wasnt going to leave im till the fight was over  ginger gave up then and at twelve oclock next day they started off to find the place  mr webson the landlord of the jolly pilots a short fat man o fifty wot ad spoke to ginger once or twice went with em and all the way to the station he kept saying wot a jolly spot it was for that sort o thing  perfickly private nice soft green grass to be knocked down on and larks up in the air singing away as if theyd never leave off  they took the train to homerton and being a slack time o the day the porters was surprised to see wot a lot o people was travelling by it so was ginger  there was the landlords of arf the publicouses in wapping all smoking big cigars two dock policemen in plain clothes wot ad got the arternoon offone with a raging toothache and the other with a baby wot wasnt expected to last the day out  they was as full o fun as kittens and the landlord o the jolly pilots pointed out to ginger wot reasonable uman beings policemen was at art  besides them there was quite a lot o sailormen even skippers and mates nearly all of em smoking big cigars too and looking at ginger out of the corner of one eye and at the wapping basher out of the corner of the other  hit ard and hit straight ses the landlord to ginger in a low voice as they got out of the train and walked up the road  ow are you feeling  ive got a cold coming on ses pore ginger looking at the basher who was on in front and a splitting eadache and a sharp pain all down my left leg  i dont think  well its a good job its no worse ses the landlord all youve got to do is to hit ard  if you win its a undered pounds in my pocket and ill stand you a fiver of it  dye understand  they turned down some little streets several of em going diffrent ways and arter crossing the river lea got on to the marshes and as the landlord said the place might ha been made for it  a little chap from mile end was the referee and bill lumm aving peeled stood looking on while ginger took is things off and slowly and carefully folded em up  then they stepped toward each other bill taking longer steps than ginger and shook ands immediately arter which bill knocked ginger head over eels  illustration bill lumm aving peeled stood looking on while ginger took is things off  time was called and the landlord o the jolly pilots who was nursing ginger on is knee said that it was nothing at all and that bleeding at the nose was a sign of ealth  but as it happened ginger was that mad e didnt want any encouragement he ony wanted to kill bill lumm  he got two or three taps in the next round which made his ead ring and then he got ome on the mark and follered it up by a leftanded punch on bills jaw that surprised em bothbill because he didnt think ginger could hit so ard and ginger because e didnt think that prizefighters ad any feelings  they clinched and fell that round and the landlord patted ginger on the back and said that if he ever ad a son he oped hed grow up like im  ginger was surprised at the way e was getting on and so was old sam and peter russet and when ginger knocked bill down in the sixth round sam went as pale as death  ginger was getting marked all over but he stuck to is man and the two dock policemen wot ad put their money on bill lumm began to talk of their dooty and say as ow the fight ought to be stopped  at the tenth round bill couldnt see out of is eyes and kept wasting is strength on the empty air and once on the referee  ginger watched is opportunity and at last with a terrific smash on the point o bills jaw knocked im down and then looked round for the landlords knee  bill made a game try to get up when time  was called but couldnt and the referee who was olding a andkerchief to is nose gave the fight to ginger  it was the proudest moment o ginger dicks life  he sat there like a king smiling orribly and sams voice as he paid is losings sounded to im like music in spite o the words the old man see fit to use  it was so ard to get peter russets money that it amost looked as though there was going to be another prizefight but e paid up at last and went off arter fust telling ginger part of wot he thought of im  there was a lot o quarrelling but the bets was all settled at last and the landlord o the jolly pilots who was in igh feather with the money hed won gave ginger the five pounds hed promised and took him ome in a cab  you done well my lad he ses  no dont smile  it looks as
