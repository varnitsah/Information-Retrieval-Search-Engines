notes to the fourth canto are printed according to precedent at the end of each canto  editorial notes are placed in square brackets notes illustrative of the text are printed immediately below the variants notes illustrative of byrons notes or footnotes are appended to the originals or printed as footnotes byrons own notes to the fourth canto are printed as footnotes to the text  hobhouses historical notes are reprinted without addition or comment but the numerous and intricate references to classical historical and archæological authorities have been carefully verified and in many instances rewritten  in compiling the introductions the additional notes and footnotes i have endeavoured to supply the reader with a compendious manual of reference with the subjectmatter of large portions of the three distinct poems which make up the five hundred stanzas of childe harolds pilgrimage every one is more or less familiar but details and particulars are out of the immediate reach of even the most cultivated readers  the poem may be dealt with in two ways it may be regarded as a repertory or treasury of brilliant passages for selection and quotation or it may be read continuously and with some attention to the style and message of the author it is in the belief that childe harold should be read continuously and that it gains by the closest study reassuming its original freshness and splendour that the text as well as byrons own notes have been somewhat minutely annotated  in the selection and composition of the notes i have in addition to other authorities consulted and made use of the following editions of childe harolds pilgrimage  i Édition classique par james darmesteter docteurèslettres paris 1882  ii byrons childe harold edited with introduction

harold  the first canto of childe harold was begun at janina in albania october 31 1809 and the second canto was finished at smyrna march 28 1810 the dates were duly recorded on the ms but in none of the letters which byron wrote to his mother and his friends from the east does he mention or allude to the composition or existence of such a work in one letter however to his mother january 14 1811 letters 1898 i 308 he informs her that he has mss in his possession which may serve to prolong his memory if his heirs and executors think proper to publish them but for himself he has done with authorship three months later the achievement of hints from horace and the curse of minerva persuaded him to give authorship another trial and in a letter written on board the volage frigate june 28 letters 1898 i 313 he announces to his literary mentor r c dallas who had superintended the publication of english bards and scotch reviewers that he has an imitation of the ars poetica of horace ready for cawthorne byron landed in england on july 2 and on the 15th dallas had the pleasure of shaking hands with him at reddishs hotel st jamess street recollections of the life of lord byron 1824 p 103 there was a crowd of visitors says dallas and no time for conversation but the imitation was placed in his hands he took it home read it and was disappointed disparagement was out of the question but the next morning at breakfast dallas ventured to express some surprise that he had written nothing else an admission or confession followed that he had occasionally written short poems besides a great many stanzas in spensers measure relative to the countries he had visited they are not he added worth troubling you with but you shall have them all with you if you like so says dallas came i by childe harold he took it from a small trunk with a number of verses  dallas was delighted and on the evening of the same day july 16before let us hope and not after he had consulted his ionian friend walter rodwell wright see recollections p 151 and diary of hc robinson 1872 i 17he despatched a letter of enthusiastic approval which gratified byron but did not convince him of the extraordinary merit of his work or of its certainty of success it was however agreed that the ms should be left with dallas that he should arrange for its publication and hold the copyright dallas would have entrusted the poem to cawthorne who had published english bards and scotch reviewers and with whom as byrons intermediary he was in communication but byron objected on the ground that the firm did not stand high enough in the trade and longmans who had been offered but had declined the english bards were in no case to be approached an application to miller of albemarle street came to nothing because miller was lord elgins bookseller and publisher he had just brought out the memorandum on lord elgins pursuits in greece and childe harold denounced and reviled lord elgin but murray of fleet street who had already expressed a wish to publish for lord byron was willing to take the matter into consideration on the first of august byron lost his mother on the third his friend matthews was drowned in the cam and for some weeks he could devote neither time nor thought to the fortunes of his poem but dallas had bestirred himself and on the eighteenth was able to report that he had seen murray again and that murray was anxious that byrons name should appear on the titlepage  to this request byron somewhat reluctantly acceded august 21 and a few days later august 25 he informs dallas that he has sent him exordiums annotations etc for the forthcoming quarto and has written to murray urging him on no account to show the ms to juvenal that is gifford but gifford as a matter of course had been already consulted had read the first canto and had advised murray to publish the poem byron was or pretended to be furious but the solid fact that gifford had commended his work acted like a charm and his fury subsided on the fifth of september letters 1898 ii 24 note he received from murray the first proof and by december 14 the pilgrimage was concluded and all but the preface had been printed and seen through the press  the original draft of the poem which byron took out of the little trunk and gave to dallas had undergone considerable alterations and modifications before this date both dallas and murray took exception to certain stanzas which on personal or patriotic or religious considerations were provocative and objectionable they were apprehensive not only for the sale of the book but for the reputation of its author byron fought his ground inch by inch but finally assented to a compromise he was willing to cut out three stanzas on the convention of cintra which had ceased to be a burning question and four more stanzas at the end of the first canto which reflected on the duke of wellington lord holland and other persons of less note a stanza on beckford in the first canto and two stanzas in the second on lord elgin thomas hope and the dilettanti crew were also omitted stanza ix of the second canto on the immortality of the soul was recast and sure and certain hopelessness exchanged for a pious if hypothetical aspiration but with regard to the general tenor of his politics and metaphysics byron stood firm and awaited the issue  there were additions as well as omissions the first stanza of the first canto stanzas xliii and xc which celebrate the battles of albuera and talavera the stanzas to the memory of charles skinner matthews nos xci xcii and stanzas ix xcv xcvi of the second canto which record byrons grief for the death of an unknown lover or friend apparently letter to dallas october 31 1811 the mysterious thyrza and

a sixth edition identical with the fifth and fourth editions was issued august 11 1813 and on february 1 1814 see letter to murray february 4 1814 childe harold made a seventh appearance the seventh edition was a new departure altogether not only were nine poems added to the twenty already published but a dedication to lady charlotte harley ianthe written in the autumn of 1812 was prefixed to the first canto and ten additional stanzas were inserted towards the end of the second canto childe harold as we have it differs to that extent from the childe harold which in a day and a night made byron famous the dedication to ianthe was the outcome of a visit to eywood and his devotion to ianthes mother lady oxford but the new stanzas were probably written in 1810 in a letter to dallas september 7 1811 letters 1898 ii 28 he writes i had projected an additional canto when i was in the troad and constantinople and if i saw them again it would go on this seems to imply that a beginning had been made in a poem a hitherto unpublished fragment entitled il diavolo inamorato vide post vol iii which is dated august 31 1812 five stanzas and a half viz stanzas lxxiii lines 59 lxxix lxxx lxxxi lxxxii xxvii of the second canto of childe harold are imbedded and these form part of the ten additional stanzas which were first published in the seventh edition there is too the fragment entitled the monk of athos which was first published life of lord byron by the hon roden noel in 1890 which may have formed part of this projected third canto  no further alterations were made in the text of the poem but an eleventh edition of childe harold cantos i ii was published in 1819  the demerits of childe harold lie on the surface but it is difficult for the modern reader familiar with the sight if not the texture of the purple patches and unattracted perhaps demagnetized by a personality once fascinating and always puissant to appreciate the actual worth and magnitude of the poem we are oer informed and as with nature so with art the eye must be couched and the film of association removed before we can see clearly but there is one characteristic feature of childe harold which association and familiarity have been powerless to veil or confuseoriginality of design by what accident asks the quarterly reviewer george agar ellis has it happened that no other english poet before lord byron has thought fit to employ his talents on a subject so well suited to their display the question can only be answered by the assertion that it was the accident of genius which inspired the poet with a new song childe harolds pilgrimage had no progenitors and with the exception of some feeble and forgotten imitations it has had no descendants the materials of the poem the spenserian stanza suggested perhaps by campbells gertrude of wyoming as well as by older models the language the metaphors often appropriated and sometimes stolen from the bible from shakespeare from the classics the sentiments and reflections coeval with reflection and sentiment wear a familiar hue but the poem itself a pilgrimage to scenes and cities of renown a song of travel a rhythmical diorama was byrons own handiworknot an inheritance but a creation  but what of the eponymous hero the sated and melancholy childe with his attendant page and yeoman his backward glances on heartless parasites on laughing dames on goblets and other properties of the monastic dome is childe harold byron masquerading in disguise or is he intended to be a fictitious personage who half unconsciously reveals the authors personality byron deals with the question in a letter to dallas october 31 i by no means intend to identify myself with harold but to deny all connection with him if in parts i may be thought to have drawn from myself believe me it is but in parts and i shall not own even to that he adds with evident sincerity i would not be such a fellow as i have made my hero for all the world again in the preface harold is the child of imagination this pronouncement was not the whole truth but it is truer than it seems he was well aware that byron had sate for the portrait of childe harold he had begun by calling his hero childe burun and the few particulars which he gives of childe buruns past were particulars in the main exact particulars of byrons own history he had no motive for concealment for so little did he know himself he imagined that he was not writing for publication that he had done with authorship even when the mood had passed it was the imitation of the ars poetica not childe harold which he was eager to publish and when childe harold had been offered to and accepted by a publisher he desired and proposed that it should appear anonymously he had not as yet come to the pass of displaying the pageant of his bleeding heart before the eyes of the multitude but though he shrank from the obvious and inevitable conclusion that childe harold was byron in disguise and idly disclaimed all connection it was true that he had intended to draw a fictitious character a being whom he may have feared he might one day become but whom he did not recognize as himself he was not sated he was not cheerless he was not unamiable he was all aquiver with youth and enthusiasm and the joy of great living he had left behind him friends whom he knew were not the flatterers of the festal hourfriends whom he returned to mourn and nobly celebrate byron was not harold but harold was an ideal byron the creature and avenger of his pride which haunted and pursued its presumptuous creator to the bitter end  childe harolds pilgrimage was reviewed or rather advertised by dallas in the literary panorama for march 1812 to the reviewers dismay the article which appeared before the poem was out was shown to byron who was paying a short visit to his old friends at harrow dallas quaked but as it proved no bad advertisement he escaped censure the blunder passed unobserved eclipsed by the dazzling brilliancy of the object which had caused it recollections p 221  of the greater reviews the quarterly no xiii march 1812 was published on may 12 and the edinburgh no 38 june 1812 was

             preface a                      to the first and second cantos   the following poem was written for the most part amidst the scenes which it attemptsb to describe it was begun in albania and the parts relative to spain and portugal were composed from the authors observations in those countries thus much it may be necessary to state for the correctness of the descriptions the scenes attempted to be sketched are in spain portugal epirus acarnania and greece there for the present the poem stops its reception will determine whether the author may venture to conduct his readers to the capital of the east through ionia and phrygia these two cantos are merely experimental  a fictitious character is introduced for the sake of giving some connection to the piece which however makes no pretension to regularity it has been suggested to me by friends on whose opinions i set a high valuecthat in this fictitious character childe harold i may incur the suspicion of having intended some real personage this i beg leave once for all to disclaimharold is the child of imagination for the purpose i have stated  in some very trivial particulars and those merely local there might be grounds for such a notiond but in the main points i should hope none whatevere  it is almost superfluous to mention that the appellation childe2 as childe waters childe childers etc is used as more consonant with the old structure of versification which i have adopted the good night in the beginning of the first canto was suggested by lord maxwells good night3 in the border minstrelsy edited by mr scott  with the different poems4 which have been published on spanish subjects there may be found some slight coincidencef in the first part which treats of the peninsula but it can only be casual as with the exception of a few concluding stanzas the whole of the poem was written in the levant  the stanza of spenser according to one of our most successful poets admits of every variety dr beattie makes the following observation  not long ago i began a poem in the style and stanza of spenser in which i propose to give full scope to my inclination and be either droll or pathetic descriptive or sentimental tender or satirical as the humour strikes me for if i mistake not the measure which i have adopted admits equally of all these kinds of composition5 strengthened in my opinion by such authority and by the example of some in the highest order of italian poets i shall make no apology for attempts at similar variations in the following compositiong satisfied that if they are unsuccessful their failure must be in the execution rather than in the design sanctioned by the practice of ariosto thomson and beattie  london february 1812                             addition to the preface  i have now waited till almost all our periodical journals have distributed their usual portion of criticism to the justice of the generality of their criticisms i have nothing to object it would ill become me to quarrel with their very slight degree of censure when perhaps if they had been less kind they had been more candid returning therefore to all and each my best thanks for their liberality on one point alone i shall venture an observation amongst the many objections justly urged to the very indifferent character of the vagrant childe whom notwithstanding many hints to the contrary i still maintain to be a fictitious personage it has been stated that besides the anachronism he is very unknightly as the times of the knights were times of love honour and so forth6 now it so happens that the good old times when lamour du bon vieux tems lamour antique flourished were the most profligate of all possible centuries those who have any doubts on this subject may consult saintepalaye passim and more particularly vol ii p 697 the vows of chivalry were no better kept than any other vows whatsoever and the songs of the troubadours were not more decent and certainly were much less refined than those of ovid the cours damour parlemens damour ou de courtoisie et de gentilesse had much more of love than of courtesy or gentleness see rolland8 on the same subject with saintepalaye  whatever other objection may be urged to that most unamiable personage childe harold he was so far perfectly knightly in his attributesno waiter but a knight templar9 by the by i fear that sir tristrem and sir lancelot were no better than they should be although very poetical personages and true knights sans peur though not sans réproche if the story of the institution of the garter be not a fable the knights of that order have for several centuries borne the badge of a countess of salisbury of indifferent memory so much for chivalry burke need not have regretted that its days are over though marieantoinette was quite as chaste as most of those in whose honour lances were shivered and knights unhorsed10  before the days of bayard and down to those of sir joseph banks11 the most chaste and celebrated of ancient and modern times few exceptions will be found to this statement and i fear a little investigation will teach us not to regret these monstrous mummeries of the middle ages  i now leave childe harold to live his day such as he is it had been more agreeable and certainly more easy to have drawn an amiable character it had been easy to varnish over his faults to make him do more and express less but he never was intended as an example further than to show that early perversion of mind and morals leads to satiety of past pleasures and disappointment in new ones and that even the beauties of nature and the stimulus of travel except ambition the most powerful of all excitements are lost on a soul so constituted or rather misdirected had i proceeded with the poem this character would have deepened as he drew to the close for the outline which i once meant to fill up for him was with some exceptions the sketch of a modern timon12 perhaps a poetical zeluco13                             childe harolds pilgrimage                               canto the first                               to iantheh14      not in those climes

safe exit from portugal the generals were assailed with loud and indiscriminate censure burrards interference with wellesleys plans was no doubt illjudged and illtimed but the opportunity of pursuit

minutes is divided into three stages or acts in the first act the picadores receive the charge of the bull defending themselves but not as a rule attacking the foe with their lances or garrochas in the second act the chulos who are not mounted wave coloured cloaks or handkerchiefs in the bulls face and endeavour to divert his fury from the picadores in case they have been thrown or worsted in the encounter at the same time the banderilleros are at pains to implant in either side of the bulls neck a number of barbed darts ornamented with cut paper and sometimes charged with detonating powder it is de rigeur to plant the barbs exactly on either side in the third and final act the protagonist the matador or espada is the sole performer his function is to entice the bull towards him

by w scott july 1 1812 of the misapprehension of the term nossa señora de pena it was owing to the want of the tilde or mark over the ñ which alters the signification of the word with it peña

that englishmen were daily butchered and so far from redress being obtained we were requested not to interfere if we perceived any compatriot defending himself against his allies i was once stopped in

of most of the spanish patriotic songs they are chiefly in dispraise of the old king charles the queen and the prince of peace i have heard many of them some of the airs are beautiful godoy the principe de la paz of an ancient but decayed family was born at badajoz on the frontiers of portugal and was originally in the ranks of the spanish guards till his person attracted the queens eyes and raised him to the dukedom of alcudia etc etc it is to this man that the spaniards universally impute the ruin of their country  manuel de godoy 17671851 received the title of principe de la paz prince of the peace in 1795 after the treaty of basle which ceded more than half st domingo to france his tenure of power as prime minister and director of the kings policy coincided with the downfall of spanish power and before the commencement of the peninsular war he was associated in the minds of the people with national corruption and national degradation he was moreover directly instrumental in the betrayal of spain to france by the treaty of fontainebleau october 27 1807 portugal was to be divided between the king of etruria and godoy as prince of the algarves portuguese america was to fall to the king of spain and to bring this about napoleons troops were to enter spain and march directly to lisbon the sole outcome of the treaty was the occupation of portugal and subsequent invasion of spain before byron had begun his pilgrimage godoys public career had come to an end during the insurrection at aranjuez march 1719 1808 when charles iv abdicated in favour of his son ferdinand vii godoy was only preserved from the fury of the populace by a timely imprisonment in the following may by which time ferdinand himself was a prisoner in france he was released at the instance of murat and ordered to accompany charles to bayonne for the express purpose of cajoling his master into a second abdication in favour of napoleon the remainder of his long life was passed first at rome and afterwards at paris in exile and dependence the execration of godoy who was really a mild goodnatured man must in napiers judgment be attributed to spanish venom and spanish prejudice the betrayal of spain was he thinks the outcome of ferdinands intrigues no less than of godoys unpatriotic ambition another and perhaps truer explanation of popular odium is to be found in his supposed atheism and wellknown indifference to the rites of the church which many years before had attracted the attention of the holy office the peasants cursed godoy because the priests triumphed over his downfall

daily on the prado decorated with medals and orders by command of the junta  the story as told by southey who seems to have derived his information from the narrative of the siege of zaragoza by charles richard vaughan mb 1809 is that augustina zaragoza sic a handsome woman of the lower class about twentytwo years of age a vivandiere in the course of her rounds came with provisions to a battery near the portello gate the gunners had all been killed and as the citizens held back augustina sprang over the dead and dying snatched a match from the hand of a dead artilleryman and fired off a twentysix pounder then jumping upon the gun made a solemn vow never to quit it alive during the siege  after the retreat of the french a pension was settled upon augustina and the daily pay of an artilleryman she was also to wear a small shield of honour embroidered upon the sleeve of her gown with zaragoza inscribed upon it southeys peninsular war ii 14 34  napier neither wholly believing

dusky shadow of that early desolation he was destined to walk till his lifes end it is not without cause when a man of great spirit grows melancholy  in connection with this subject it may be noted that lines 6 and 7 of stanza xcv do not bear out byrons contention to dallas letters october 14 and 31 1811 that in these three in memoriam stanzas ix xcv xcvi he is bewailing an event which took place after he returned to newstead the more than friend had ceased to be before the wanderer returned it is evident that byron did not take dallas into his confidence    footnotes  113 99 stanzas ixv form a kind of dramatic prologue to the second canto of the pilgrimage the general meaning is clear enough but the unities are disregarded the scene shifts more than once and there is a moral within a moral the poet begins by invoking athena byron wrote athenæ to look down on the ruins of her holy and beautiful house and bewails her unreturning heroes of the sword and pen he then summons an oriental a son of the morning moslem or light greek possibly a canis venaticus the discoverer or vendor of a sepulchral urn and with an adjuration to spare the sacred relic points to the acropolis the cemetery of dead divinities and then once more to the urn at his feet vanity of vanitiesall is vanity gods and men may come and go but death goes on for ever the scene changes and he feigns to be

barrow and he had perhaps read of the real or pretended excavation by signor ghormezano 1787 of a tumulus at the sigean promontory the minds eye which had conjured up the shattered heaps images a skull of one who kept the world in awe and after moralizing in hamlets vein on the humorous catastrophe of decay the poet concludes with the preacher that there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave after this profession of unfaith before he returns to harold and his pilgrimage he takes up his parable and curses elgin and all his works the passage as a whole suggests the essential difference between painting and poetry as a composition it recalls the frontispiece of a seventeenthcentury classic the pictured scene with its superfluity of accessories is grotesque enough

execration  on this occasion i speak impartially i am not a collector or admirer of collections consequently no rival but i have some early prepossession in favour of greece and do not think the

countryman of alexander who was born at pella in macedon but mr gibbon terms him so and adds pyrrhus to the list in speaking of his exploits  of albania gibbon remarks that a country within sight of italy is less known than the interior of america circumstances of little consequence to mention led mr hobhouse and myself into that country before we visited any other part of the ottoman dominions and with the exception of major leake213 then officially resident at joannina no other englishmen have ever advanced beyond the capital into the interior as that gentleman very lately assured me ali pacha was at that time october 1809 carrying on war against ibrahim pacha whom he had driven to berat a strong fortress which he was then besieging on our arrival at joannina we were invited to tepaleni his highnesss birthplace and favourite serai only one days distance from berat at this juncture the vizier had made it his headquarters after some stay in the capital we accordingly followed but though furnished with every accommodation and escorted by one of the viziers secretaries we were nine days on account of the rains in accomplishing a journey which on our return barely occupied four on our route we passed two cities argyrocastro and libochabo apparently little inferior to yanina in size and no pencil or pen can ever do justice to the scenery in the vicinity of zitza and delvinachi the frontier village of epirus and albania proper  on albania and its inhabitants i am unwilling to descant because this will be done so much better by my fellowtraveller in a work which may probably precede this in publication that i as little wish to follow as i would to anticipate him214 but some few observations are necessary to the text the arnaouts or albanese struck me forcibly by their resemblance to the highlanders of scotland in dress figure and manner of living their very mountains seemed caledonian with a kinder climate the kilt though white the spare active form their dialect celtic in its sound and their hardy habits all carried me back to morven no nation are so detested and dreaded by their neighbours as the albanese the greeks hardly regard them as christians or the turks as moslems and in fact they are a mixture of both and sometimes neither their habits are predatoryall are armed and the redshawled arnaouts the montenegrins chimariots and gegdes are treacherous215 the others differ somewhat in garb and essentially in character as far as my own experience goes i can speak favourably i was attended by two an infidel and a mussulman to constantinople and every other part of turkey which came within my observation and more faithful in peril or indefatigable in service are rarely to be found the infidel was named basilius the moslem dervish tahiri the former a man of middle age and the latter about my own basili was strictly charged by ali pacha in person to attend us and dervish was one of fifty who accompanied us through the forests of acarnania to the banks of achelous and onward to messalonghi in Ætolia there i took him into my own service and never had occasion to repent it till the moment of my departure  when in 1810 after the departure of my friend mr hobhouse for england i was seized with a severe fever in the morea these men saved my life by frightening away my physician whose throat they threatened to cut if i was not cured within a given time to this consolatory assurance of posthumous retribution and a resolute refusal of dr romanellis prescriptions i attributed my recoverygg i had left my last remaining english servant at athens my dragoman was as ill as myself and my poor arnaouts nursed me with an attention which would have done honour to civilization they had a variety of adventures for the moslem dervish being a remarkably handsome man was always squabbling with the husbands of athens insomuch that four of the principal turks paid me a visit of remonstrance at the convent on the subject of his having taken a woman from the bathwhom he had lawfully bought howevera thing quite contrary to etiquette basili also was extremely gallant amongst his own persuasion and had the greatest veneration for the church mixed with the highest contempt of churchmen whom he cuffed upon occasion in a most heterodox manner yet he never passed a church without crossing himself and i remember the risk he ran in entering st sophia in stambol because it had once been a place of his worship on remonstrating with him on his inconsistent proceedings he invariably answered our church is holy our priests are thieves and then he crossed himself as usual and boxed the ears of the first papas who refused to assist in any required operation as was always found to be necessary where a priest had any influence with the cogia bashi216 of his village indeed a more abandoned race of miscreants cannot exist than the lower orders of the greek clergy  when preparations were made for my return my albanians were summoned to receive their pay basili took his with an awkward show of regret at my intended departure and marched away to his quarters with his bag of piastres i sent for dervish but for some time he was not to be found at last he entered just as signor logotheti217 father to the cidevant angloconsul of athens and some other of my greek acquaintances paid me a visit dervish took the money in his hand but on a sudden dashed it to the ground and clasping his hands which he raised to his forehead rushed out of the room weeping bitterly from that moment to the hour of my embarkation he continued his lamentations and all our efforts to console him only produced this answer Μαφεινει mapheinei he leaves me signer logotheti who never wept before for anything less than the loss of a para about the fourth of a farthing melted the padre of the convent my attendants my visitorsand i verily believe that even sternes foolish fat scullion would have left her fishkettle to sympathize with the unaffected and unexpected sorrow of this barbarian218  for my own part when i remembered that a short time before my departure from england a noble and most intimate associate had excused himself from taking leave of me because he had to attend a female relation to a milliners219 i felt no less surprised than humiliated by the present occurrence and the past recollection that dervish would leave me with some regret was to be expected when master and man have been scrambling over the mountains of a dozen provinces together they are unwilling to separate but his present feelings contrasted with his native ferocity improved my opinion of the human heart i believe this almost feudal fidelity is frequent amongst them one day on our journey over parnassus an englishman in my service gave him a push in some dispute about the baggage which he unluckily mistook for a blow he spoke not but sat down leaning his head upon his hands foreseeing the consequences we endeavoured to explain away the affront which produced the following answeri have been a robber i am a soldier no captain ever struck me you are my master i have eaten your bread but by that bread a usual oath had it been otherwise i would have stabbed the dog your servant and gone to the mountains so the affair ended but from that day forward he never thoroughly forgave the thoughtless fellow who insulted him dervish excelled

courage in desultory warfare is unquestionable though they have some cavalry amongst the gegdes i never saw a good arnaout horseman my own preferred the english saddles which however they could never

criminal from the rock into the sea by way of expiation and propitiation birds of all kinds were attached to the victim to break his fall and if he reached the sea uninjured there was a fleet of

tenderly seeing i was once the cause of the husband of ida of athens nearly suffering the bastinado and because the said disdar is a turbulent husband and beats his wife so that i exhort and beseech miss owenson to sue for a separate maintenance in behalf of ida having premised thus much on a matter of such import to the readers of romances i may now leave ida to mention her birthplace  setting aside the magic of the name and all those associations which it would be pedantic and superfluous to recapitulate the very situation of athens would render it the favourite of all who have eyes for art or nature the climate to me at least appeared a perpetual spring during eight months i never passed a day without being as many hours on horseback rain is extremely rare snow never lies in the plains and a cloudy day is an agreeable rarity in spain portugal and every part of the east which i visited except ionia and attica i perceived no such superiority of climate to our own and at constantinople where i passed may june and part of july 1810 you might damn the climate and complain of spleen five days out of seven227  the air of the morea is heavy and unwholesome but the moment you pass the isthmus in the direction of megara the change is strikingly perceptible but i fear hesiod will still be found correct in his description of a boeotian winter228  we found at livadia an esprit fort in a greek bishop of all freethinkers this worthy hypocrite rallied his own religion with great intrepidity but not before his flock and talked of a mass as a coglioneria229 it was impossible to think better of him for this but for a boeotian he was brisk with all his absurdity this phenomenon with the exception indeed of thebes the remains of chæronea the plain of platea orchomenus livadia and its nominal cave of trophonius was the only remarkable thing we saw before we passed mount cithæron  the fountain of dirce turns a mill at least my companion who resolving to be at once cleanly and classical bathed in it pronounced it to be the fountain of dirce230 and any body who thinks it worth while may contradict him at castri we drank of half a dozen streamlets some not of the purest before we decided to our satisfaction which was the true castalian and even that had a villanous twang probably from the snow though it did not throw us into an epic fever like poor dr

than even cintra or istambol not the view from the troad with ida the hellespont and the more distant mount athos can equal it though so superior in extent  i heard much of the beauty of arcadia but excepting the view from the monastery of megaspelion which is inferior to zitza in a command of country and the descent from the mountains on the way from tripolitza to argos arcadia has little to recommend it beyond the name      sternitur et dulces moriens reminiscitur argos                                                         Æneid x 782  virgil could have put this into the mouth of none

crossing the isthmus of corinth he had better ears than have ever been worn in such a journey since  athens says a celebrated topographer is still the most polished city of greece232 perhaps it may of greece but not of the greeks for joannina in epirus is universally allowed amongst themselves to be superior in the wealth refinement learning and dialect of its inhabitants the athenians are remarkable for their cunning and the lower orders are not improperly characterised in that proverb which classes them with the jews of salonica and the turks of the negropont  among the various foreigners resident in athens french italians germans ragusans etc there was never a difference of opinion in their estimate of the greek character though on all other topics they disputed with great acrimony  m fauvel the french consul who has passed thirty years principally at athens and to whose talents as an artist and manners as a gentleman none who have known him can refuse their testimony has frequently declared in my hearing that the greeks do not deserve to be emancipated reasoning on the grounds of their national and individual depravity while he forgot that such depravity is to be attributed to causes which can only be removed by the measure he reprobates  m roque233 a french merchant of respectability long settled in athens asserted with the most amusing gravity sir they are the same canaille that existed in the days of themistocles an alarming remark to the laudator temporis acti the ancients banished themistocles the moderns cheat monsieur roque thus great men have ever been treated  in short all the franks who are fixtures and most of the englishmen germans danes etc of passage came over by degrees to their opinion on much the same grounds that a turk in england would condemn the nation by wholesale because he was wronged by his lacquey and overcharged by his washerwoman  certainly it was not a little staggering when the sieurs fauvel and lusieri the two greatest demagogues of the day who divide between them the power of pericles and the popularity of cleon and puzzle the poor waywode with perpetual differences agreed in the utter condemnation nulla virtute redemptum juvenal lib i sat iv line 2 of the greeks in general and of the athenians in particular for my own humble opinion i am loth to hazard it knowing as i do that there be now in ms no less than five tours of the first magnitude and of the most threatening aspect all in typographical array by persons of wit and honour and regular commonplace books but if i may say this without offence it seems to me rather hard to declare so positively and pertinaciously as almost everybody has declared that the greeks because they are very bad will never be better  eton and sonnini234 have led us astray by their panegyrics and projects but on the other hand de pauw and thornton235 have debased the greeks beyond their demerits  the greeks will never be independent they will never be sovereigns as heretofore and god forbid they ever should but they may be subjects without being slaves our colonies are not independent but they are free and industrious and such may greece be hereafter  at present like the catholics of ireland and the jews throughout the world and such other cudgelled and heterodox people they suffer all the moral and physical ills that can afflict humanity their life is a struggle against truth they are vicious in their own defence they are so unused to kindness that when they occasionally meet with it they look upon it with suspicion as a dog often beaten snaps at your fingers if you attempt to caress him they are ungrateful notoriously abominably ungratefulthis is the general cry now in the name of nemesis for what are they to be grateful where is the human being that ever conferred a benefit on greek or greeks they are to be grateful to the turks for their fetters and to the franks for their broken promises and lying counsels they are to be grateful to the artist who engraves their ruins and to the antiquary who carries them away to the traveller whose janissary flogs them and to the scribbler whose journal abuses them this is the amount of their obligations to foreigners                                 ii             franciscan convent athens january 23 1811236  amongst the remnants of the barbarous policy of the earlier ages are the traces of bondage which yet exist in different countries whose inhabitants however divided in religion and manners almost all agree in oppression  the english have at last compassionated their negroes and under a less bigoted government may probably one day release their catholic brethren but the interposition of foreigners alone can emancipate the greeks who otherwise appear to have as small a chance of redemption from the turks as the jews have from mankind in general  of the ancient greeks we know more than enough at least the younger men of europe devote much of their time to the study of the greek writers and history which would be more usefully spent in mastering their own of the moderns we are perhaps more neglectful than they deserve and while every man of any pretensions to learning is tiring out his youth and often his age in the study of the language and of the harangues of the athenian demagogues in favour of freedom the real or supposed descendants of these sturdy republicans are left to the actual tyranny of their masters although a very slight effort is required to strike off their chains  to talk as the greeks themselves do of their rising again to their pristine superiority would be ridiculous as the rest of the world must resume its barbarism after reasserting the sovereignty of greece but there seems to be no very great obstacle except in the apathy of the franks to their becoming an useful dependency or even a free state with a proper guaranteeunder correction however be it spoken for many and wellinformed men doubt the practicability even of this  the greeks have never lost their hope though they are now more divided in opinion on the subject of their probable deliverers religion recommends the russians but they have twice been deceived and abandoned by that power and the dreadful lesson they received after the muscovite desertion in the morea has never been forgotten the french they dislike although the subjugation of the rest of europe will probably be attended by the deliverance of continental greece the islanders look to the english for succour as they have very lately possessed themselves of the ionian republic corfu excepted237 but whoever appear with arms in their hands will be welcome and when that day arrives heaven have mercy on the ottomans they cannot expect it from the giaours  but instead of considering what they have been and speculating on what they may be let us look at them as they are  and here it is impossible to reconcile the contrariety of opinions some particularly the merchants decrying the greeks in the strongest language others generally travellers turning periods in their eulogy and publishing very curious speculations grafted on their former state which can have no more effect on their present lot than the existence of the incas on the future fortunes of peru  one very ingenious person terms them the natural allies of englishmen another no less ingenious will not allow them to be the allies of anybody and denies their very descent from the ancients a third more ingenious than either builds a greek empire on a russian foundation and realises on paper all the chimeras of catharine ii as to the question of their descent what can it import whether the mainotes238 are the lineal laconians or not or the present athenians as indigenous as the bees of hymettus or as the grasshoppers to which they once likened themselves what englishman cares if he be of a danish saxon norman or trojan blood or who except a welshman is afflicted with a desire of being descended from caractacus  the poor greeks do not so much abound in the good things of this world as to render even their claims to antiquity an object of envy it is very cruel then in mr thornton to disturb them in the possession of all that time has left them viz their pedigree of which they are the more tenacious as it is all they can call their own it would be worth while to publish together and compare the works of messrs thornton and de pauw eton and sonnini paradox on one side and prejudice on the other mr thornton conceives himself to have claims to public confidence from a fourteen years residence at pera perhaps he may on the subject of the turks but this can give him no more insight into the real state of greece and her inhabitants than as many years spent in wapping into that of the western highlands  the greeks of constantinople live in fanal239 and if mr thornton did not oftener cross the golden horn than his brother merchants are accustomed to do i should place no great reliance on his information i actually heard one of these gentlemen boast of their little general intercourse with the city and assert of himself with an air of triumph that he had been but four times at constantinople in as many years  as to mr thorntons voyages in the black sea with greek vessels they gave him the same idea of greece as a cruise to berwick in a scotch smack would of johnny groats house upon what grounds then does he arrogate the right of condemning by wholesale a body of men of whom he can know little it is rather a curious circumstance that mr thornton who so lavishly dispraises pouqueville on every occasion of mentioning the turks has yet recourse to him as authority on the greeks and terms him an impartial observer now dr pouqueville is as little entitled to that appellation as mr thornton to confer it on him  the fact is we are deplorably in want of information on the subject of the greeks and in particular their literature nor is there any probability of our being better acquainted till our intercourse becomes more intimate or their independence confirmed the relations of passing travellers are as little to be depended on as the invectives of angry factors but till something more can be attained we must be content with the little to be acquired from similar sources240  however defective these may be they are preferable to the parodoxes of men who have read superficially of the ancients and seen nothing of the moderns such as de pauw who when he asserts that the british breed of horses is ruined by newmarket and that the spartans241 were cowards in the field242 betrays an equal knowledge of english horses and spartan men his philosophical observations have a much better claim to the title of poetical it could not be expected that he who so liberally condemns some of the most celebrated institutions of the ancient should have mercy on the modern greeks and it fortunately happens that the absurdity of his hypothesis on their forefathers refutes his sentence on themselves  let us trust then that in spite of the prophecies of de pauw and the doubts of mr thornton there is a reasonable hope of the redemption of a race of men who whatever may be the errors of their religion and policy have been amply punished by three centuries and a half of captivity                              iii243                athens franciscan convent march 17 1811            i must have some talk with this learned theban244  some time after my return from constantinople to this city i received the thirtyfirst number of the edinburgh review245 as a great favour and certainly at this distance an acceptable one from the captain of an english frigate off salamis in that number art 3 containing the review of a french translation of strabo246 there are introduced some remarks on the modern greeks and their literature with a short account of coray a cotranslator in the french version on those remarks i mean to ground a few observations and the spot where i now write will i hope be sufficient excuse for introducing them in a work in some degree connected with the subject coray the most celebrated of living greeks at least among the franks was born at scio in the review smyrna is stated i have reason to think incorrectly and besides the translation of beccaria and other works mentioned by the reviewer has published a lexicon in romaic and french if i may trust the assurance of some danish travellers lately arrived from paris but the latest we have seen here in french and greek is that of gregory zolikogloou247 coray has recently been involved in an unpleasant controversy with m gail248 a parisian commentator and editor of some translations from the greek poets in consequence of the institute having awarded him the prize for his version of hippocrates Περὶ ὑδάτων peri\ ydatôn etc to the disparagement and consequently displeasure of the said gail to his exertions literary and patriotic great praise is undoubtedly due but a part of that praise ought not to be withheld from the two brothers zosimado merchants settled in leghorn who sent him to paris and maintained him for the express purpose of elucidating the ancient and adding to the modern researches of his countrymen coray however is not considered by his countrymen equal to some who lived in the two last centuries more particularly dorotheus of mitylene249 whose hellenic writings are so much esteemed by the greeks that meletius250 terms him Μετὰ τὸν Θουκυδίδην καὶ Ξενοφώντα ἄριστος Ἑλλήνων meta\ to thoukydidên kai\ xenophônta aristos ellênôn p 224 ecclesiastical history iv  panagiotes kodrikas the translator of fontenelle and kamarases251 who translated ocellus lucanus on the universe into french christodoulus252 and more particularly psalida253 whom i have conversed with in joannina are also in high repute among their literati the lastmentioned has published in romaic and latin a work on true happiness dedicated to catherine ii but polyzois254 who is stated by the reviewer to be the only modern except coray who has distinguished himself by a knowledge of hellenic if he be the polyzois lampanitziotes of yanina who has published a number of editions in romaic was neither more nor less than an itinerant vender of books with the contents of which he had no concern beyond his name on the title page placed there to secure his property in the publication and he was moreover a man utterly destitute of scholastic acquirements as the name however is not uncommon some other polyzois may have edited the epistles of aristænetus  it is to be regretted that the system of continental blockade has closed the few channels through which the greeks received their publications particularly venice and trieste even the common grammars for children are become too dear for the lower orders amongst their original works the geography of meletius archbishop of athens and a multitude of theological quartos and poetical pamphlets are to be met with their grammars and lexicons of two three and four languages are numerous and excellent their poetry is in rhyme the most singular piece i have lately seen is a satire in dialogue between a russian english and french traveller and the waywode of wallachia or blackbey as they term him an archbishop a merchant255 and cogia bachi or primate in succession to all of whom under the turks the writer attributes their present degeneracy their songs are sometimes pretty and pathetic but their tunes generally unpleasing to the ear of a frank the best is the famous Δεύτε παῖδες τῶν Ἑλλήνων deute paides tôn ellênôn by the unfortunate riga256 but from a catalogue of more than sixty authors now before me only fifteen can be found who have touched on any theme except theology  i am intrusted with a commission by a greek of athens named marmarotouri to make arrangements if possible for printing in london a translation of barthelemis anacharsis in romaic as he has no other opportunity unless he dispatches the ms to vienna by the black sea and danube  the reviewer mentions a school established at hecatonesi257 and suppressed at the instigation of sebastiani258 he means cidonies or in turkish haivali a town on the continent where that institution for a hundred students and three professors still exists it is true that this establishment was disturbed by the porte under the ridiculous pretext that the greeks were constructing a fortress instead of a college but on investigation and the payment of some purses to the divan it has been permitted to continue the principal professor named ueniamin ie benjamin is stated to be a man of talent but a freethinker he was born in lesbos studied in italy and is master of hellenic latin and some frank languages besides a smattering of the sciences  though it is not my intention to enter farther on this topic than may allude to the article in question i cannot but observe that the reviewers lamentation over the fall of the greeks appears singular when he closes it with these words the change is to be attributed to their misfortunes rather than to any physical degradation it may be true that the greeks are not physically degenerated and that constantinople contained on the day when it changed masters as many men of six feet and upwards as in the hour of prosperity but ancient history and modern politics instruct us that something more than physical perfection is necessary to preserve a state in vigour and independence and the greeks in particular are a melancholy example of the near connexion between moral degradation and national decay  the reviewer mentions a plan we believe by potemkin259 for the purification of the romaic and i have endeavoured in vain to procure any tidings or traces of its existence there was an academy in st petersburg for the greeks but it was suppressed by paul and has not been revived by his successor  there is a slip of the pen and it can only be a slip of the pen in p 58 no 31 of the edinburgh review where these words occur we are told that when the capital of the east yielded to solymanit may be presumed that this last word will in a future edition be altered to mahomet ii260 the ladies of constantinople it seems at that period spoke a dialect which would not have disgraced the lips of an athenian i do not know how that might be but am sorry to say that the ladies in general and the athenians in particular are much altered being far from choice either in their dialect or expressions as the whole attic race are barbarous to a proverb      Ὠ Ἀθῆναι πρώτη χώρα Ô athênai prôtê chôra     Τί γαιδάρους τρέφεις τώρα ti gaidarous trepheis tôra261  in gibbon vol x p 161 is the following sentencethe vulgar dialect of the city was gross and barbarous though the compositions of the church and palace sometimes affected to copy the purity of the attic models whatever may be asserted on the subject it is difficult to conceive that the ladies of constantinople in the reign of the last cæsar spoke a purer dialect than anna comnena262 wrote three centuries before and those royal pages are not esteemed the best models of composition although the princess γλῶτταν εἶχεν ἈΚΡΙΒΩΕ Ἀττικιϛούσαν glôttan eichen akribÔe attikisousan263 in the fanal and in yanina the best greek is spoken in the latter there is a flourishing school under the direction of psalida  there is now in athens a pupil of psalidas who is making a tour of observation through greece he is intelligent and better educated than a fellowcommoner of most colleges i mention this as a proof that the spirit of inquiry is not dormant among the greeks  the reviewer mentions mr wright264 the author of the beautiful poem horæ ionicæ as qualified to give details of these nominal romans and degenerate greeks and also of their language but mr wright though a good poet and an able man has made a mistake where he states the albanian dialect of the romaic to approximate nearest to the hellenic for the albanians speak a romaic as notoriously corrupt as the scotch of aberdeenshire or the italian of naples yanina where next to the fanal the greek is purest although the capital of ali pachas dominions is not in albania but epirus and beyond delvinachi in albania proper up to argyrocastro and tepaleen beyond which i did not advance they speak worse greek than even the athenians i was attended for a year and a half by two of these singular mountaineers whose mother tongue is illyric and i never heard them or their countrymen whom i have seen not only at home but to the amount of twenty thousand in the army of vely pacha265 praised for their greek but often laughed at for their provincial barbarisms  i have in my possession about twentyfive letters amongst which some from the bey of corinth written to me by notaras the cogia bachi and others by the dragoman of the caimacam266 of the morea which last governs in vely pachas absence are said to be favourable specimens of their epistolary style i also received some at constantinople from private persons written in a most hyperbolical style but in the true antique character  the reviewer proceeds after some remarks on the tongue in its past and present state to a paradox page 59 on the great mischief the knowledge of his own language has done to coray who it seems is less likely to understand the ancient greek because he is perfect master of the modern this observation follows a paragraph recommending in explicit terms the study of the romaic as a powerful auxiliary not only to the traveller and foreign merchant but also to the classical scholar in short to every body except the only person who can be thoroughly acquainted with its uses and by a parity of reasoning our own language is conjectured to be probably more attainable by foreigners than by ourselves now i am inclined to think that a dutch tyro in our tongue albeit himself of saxon blood would be sadly perplexed with sir tristram267 or any other given auchinleck ms with or without a grammar or glossary and to most apprehensions it seems evident that none but a native can acquire a competent far less complete knowledge of our obsolete idioms we may give the critic credit for his ingenuity but no more believe him than we do smolletts lismahago268 who maintains that the purest english is spoken in edinburgh that coray may err is very possible but if he does the fault is in the man rather than in his mother tongue which is as it ought to be of the greatest aid to the native studenthere the reviewer proceeds to business on strabos translators and here i close my remarks  sir w drummond mr hamilton lord aberdeen dr clarke captain leake mr gell mr walpole269 and many others now in england have all the requisites to furnish details of this fallen people the few observations i have offered i should have left where i made them had not the article in question and above all the spot where i read it induced me to advert to those pages which the advantage of my present situation enabled me to clear or at least to make the attempt  i have endeavoured to waive the personal feelings which rise in despite of me in touching upon any part of the edinburgh review not from a wish to conciliate the favour of its writers or to cancel the remembrance of a syllable i have formerly published but simply from a sense of the impropriety of mixing up private resentments with a disquisition of the present kind and more particularly at this distance of time and place                         additional note on the turks  the difficulties of travelling in turkey have been much exaggerated or rather have considerably diminished of late years the mussulmans have been beaten into a kind of sullen civility very comfortable to voyagers  it is hazardous to say much on the subject of turks and turkey since it is possible to live amongst them twenty years without acquiring information at least from themselves as far as my own slight experience carried me i have no complaint to make but am indebted for many civilities i might almost say for friendship and much hospitality to ali pacha his son vely pacha of the morea and several others of high rank in the provinces suleyman aga late governor of athens and now of thebes was a bon vivant and as social a being as ever sat crosslegged at a tray or a table during the carnival when our english party were masquerading both himself and his successor were more happy to receive masks than any dowager in grosvenorsquare270  on one occasion of his supping at the convent his friend and visitor the cadi271 of thebes was carried from table perfectly qualified for any club in christendom while the worthy waywode himself triumphed in

custom in the east you will rarely find yourself a loser as one worth acceptance is generally returned by another of similar valuea horse or a shawl  in the capital and at court the citizens and courtiers are formed in the same school with those of christianity but there does not exist a more honourable friendly and highspirited character than the true turkish provincial aga or moslem country gentleman it is not meant here to designate the governors of towns but those agas who by a kind of feudal tenure possess lands and houses of more or less extent in greece and asia minor  the lower orders are in as tolerable discipline as the rabble in countries with greater pretensions to civilisation a moslem in walking the streets of our countrytowns would be more incommoded in england than a

etc perhaps in thorntons english the ottomans with all their defects are not a people to be despised equal at least to the spaniards they are superior to the portuguese if it be difficult to pronounce what they are we can at least say what they are not they are not treacherous they are not cowardly they do not burn heretics they are not assassins nor has an enemy advanced to their capital they are faithful to their sultan till he becomes unfit to govern and devout to their god without an inquisition were they driven from st sophia tomorrow and the french or russians enthroned in their stead it would become a question whether europe would gain by the exchange england would certainly be the loser  with regard to that ignorance of which they are so generally and sometimes justly accused it may be doubted always excepting france and england in what useful points of knowledge they are excelled by other nations is it in the common arts of life in their manufactures is a turkish sabre inferior to a toledo or is a turk worse clothed or lodged or fed and taught than a spaniard are their pachas worse educated than a grandee or an effendi273 than a knight of st jago i think not  i remember mahmout the grandson of ali pacha asking whether my fellowtraveller and myself were in the upper or lower house of parliament now this question from a boy of ten years old proved that his education had not been neglected it may be doubted if an english boy at that age knows the difference of the divan from a college of dervises but i am very sure a spaniard does not how little mahmout surrounded as he had been entirely by his turkish tutors had learned that there was such a thing as a parliament it were useless to conjecture unless we suppose that his instructors did not confine his studies to the koran  in all the mosques there are schools established which are very regularly attended and the poor are taught without the church of turkey being put into peril i believe the system is not yet printed though there is such a thing as a turkish press and books printed on the late military institution of the nizam gedidd274 nor have i heard whether the mufti and the mollas have subscribed

turks are ignorant bigots when they thus evince the exact proportion of christian charity which is tolerated in the most prosperous and orthodox of all possible kingdoms but though they allow all this they will not suffer the greeks to participate in their privileges no let them fight their battles and pay their haratch taxes be drubbed in this world and damned in the next and shall we then emancipate our irish helots mahomet forbid we should then be bad mussulmans and worse christians at present we unite the best of bothjesuitical faith and something not much inferior to turkish toleration                                   appendix  amongst an enslaved people obliged to have recourse to foreign presses even for their books of religion it is less to be wondered at that we find so few publications on general subjects than that we find any at all the whole number of the greeks scattered up and down the turkish empire and elsewhere may amount at most to three millions and yet for so scanty a number it is impossible to discover any nation with so great a proportion of books and their authors as the greeks of the present century aye but say the generous advocates of oppression who while they assert the ignorance of the greeks wish to prevent them from dispelling it ay but these are mostly if not all ecclesiastical tracts and consequently good for nothing well and pray what else can they write about it is pleasant enough to hear a frank particularly an englishman who may abuse the government of his own country or a frenchman who may abuse every government except his own and who may range at will over every philosophical religious scientific sceptical or moral subject sneering at the greek legends a greek must not write on politics and cannot touch on science for want of instruction if he doubts he is excommunicated and damned therefore his countrymen are not poisoned with modern philosophy and as to morals thanks to the turks there are no such things what then is left him if he has a turn for scribbling religion and holy biography and it is natural enough that those who have so little in this life should look to the next it is no great wonder then that in a catalogue now before me of fiftyfive greek writers many of whom were lately living not above fifteen should have touched on anything but religion the catalogue alluded to is

begun early in may and finished at ouchy near lausanne on the 27th of june 1816 byron made a fair copy of the first draft of his poem which had been scrawled on loose sheets and engaged the services of claire jane clairmont to make a second transcription her task was completed on the 4th of july the fair copy and claires transcription remained in byrons keeping until the end of august or the beginning of september when he consigned the transcription to his friend mr shelley and the fair copy to scrope davies with instructions to deliver them to murray see letters to murray october 5 9 15 1816 shelley landed at portsmouth september 8 and on the 11th of september he discharged his commission  i was thrilled with delight yesterday writes murray september 12 by the announcement of mr shelley with the ms of childe harold i had no sooner got the quiet possession of it than trembling with auspicious hope  i carried it  to mr gifford he says that what you have heretofore published is nothing to this effort never since my intimacy with mr gifford did i see him so heartily pleased or give one fiftieth part of the praise with one thousandth part of the warmth  the correction of the press was undertaken by gifford not without some remonstrance on the part of shelley who maintained that the revision of the proofs and the retention or alteration of certain particular passages had been entrusted to his discretion letter to murray october 30 1816  when if ever mr davies of inaccurate memory letter to murray december 4 1816 discharged his trust is a matter of uncertainty the original ms byrons fair copy is not forthcoming and it is improbable that murray who had stipulated september 20 for all the original mss copies and scraps ever received it the scraps were sent october 5 in the first instance to geneva and after many wanderings ultimately fell into the possession of mrs leigh from whom they were purchased by the late mr murray  the july number of the quarterly review no xxx was still in the press and possibly for this reason it was not till october 29 that murray inserted the following advertisement in the morning chronicle lord byrons new poems on the 23d of november will be published the prisoners sic of chillon a tale and other poems a third canto of childe harold but a rival was in the field the next day october 30 in the same print another advertisement appeared the r h lord byrons pilgrimage to the holy land printed for j johnston cheapside of whom may be had by the same author a new ed the third of farewell to england with three other poems it was no doubt the success of his first venture which had stimulated the cheapside impostor as byron called him to forgery on a larger scale  the controversy did not end there a second advertisement morning chronicle november 15 of lord byrons pilgrimage etc stating that the copyright of the work was consigned to the publisher exclusively by the noble author himself and for which he gives 500 guineas precedes murrays second announcement of the prisoners of chillon and the third canto of childe harold in which he informs the public that the poems lately advertised are not written by lord byron the only bookseller at present authorised to print lord byrons poems is mr murray further precautions were deemed necessary an injunction in chancery was applied for by byrons agents and representatives see for a report of the case in the morning chronicle november 28 1816 letters vol iv letter to murray december 9 1816 note and granted by the chancellor lord eldon strangely enough sir samuel romilly whom byron did not love was counsel for the plaintiff  in spite of the injunction a volume entitled lord byrons pilgrimage to the holy land a poem in two cantos to which is attached a fragment the tempest was issued in 1817 it is a dull and apparently serious production suggested by but hardly an imitation of childe harold the notes are descriptive of the scenery customs and antiquities of palestine the tempest on the other hand is a parody and by no means a bad parody of byron at his worst eg      there was a sternness in his eye     which chilled the soulone knew not why     but when returning vigour came     and kindled the dark glare to flame     so fierce it flashed one well might swear     a thousand souls were centred there  it is possible that this pilgrimage was the genuine composition of some poetaster who failed to get his poems published under his own name or it may have been the deliberate forgery of john agg or hewson clarke or c f lawler the pseudo peter pindardruids who were in johnstons pay and were prepared to compose pilgrimages to any land holy or unholy which would bring grist to their employers mill see the advertisements at the end of lord byrons pilgrimage etc  the third canto was published not as announced on the 23rd but on the 18th of november murrays auspicious hope of success was amply fulfilled he wrote to lord byron on the 13th of december 1816 informing him that at a dinner at the albion tavern he had sold to the assembled booksellers 7000 of his third canto of childe harold the reviews

to moore march 17 1815 when his héros de roman as he called him had broken open his captives cage and was making victorious progress to the capital in the ode to napoleon buonaparte which was written in april 1814 after the first abdication at fontainebleau the dominant note is astonishment mingled with contempt it is the lamentation over a fallen idol in these stanzas xxxvixlv he bears witness to the mans essential greatness and with manifest reference to his own personality and career attributes his final downfall to the peculiar constitution of his genius and temper a year later 1817 in the fourth canto stanzas lxxxixxcii he passes a severe sentence napoleons greatness is swallowed up in weakness he is a kind of bastard cæsar selfvanquished the creature and victim of vanity finally in the age of bronze sections iiivi there is a reversion to the same theme the tragic irony of the rise and fall of the king of kings and yet of slaves the slave  as a schoolboy at harrow byron fought for the preservation of napoleons bust and he was ever ready in defiance of national feeling and national prejudice to celebrate him as the glorious chief but when it came to the point he did not want him here victorious over england and he could not fail to see with insight quickened by selfknowledge that greatness and genius possess no charm against littleness and commonness and that the glory of the terrestrial meets with its own reward the moral is obvious and as old as history but herein lay the secret of byrons potency that he could remint and issue in fresh splendour the familiar coinage of the worlds wit moreover he lived in a great age when great truths are born again and appear in a new light  299 the stanza was written while napoleon was still under the guardianship of admiral sir

might he hoped be found in solitude face to face with nature but it was not to be even nature was powerless to minister to a mind diseased at the conclusion of his second tour september 29 1816 he is constrained to admit that neither the music of the shepherd the crashing of the avalanche nor the torrent the mountain the glacier the forest nor the cloud have for one moment lightened the weight upon my heart nor enabled me to lose my own wretched identity in the majesty and the power and the glory around above and beneath me life p 315 perhaps wordsworth had this confession in his mind when in 1834 he composed the lines not in the lucid intervals of life of which the following were he notes written with lord byrons character as a past before me and that of others his contemporaries who wrote under like influences                               nor do words     which practised talent readily affords     prove that his hand has touched responsive chords     nor has his gentle beauty

and graceless endeavour without the cross to wear the crown but if nature reserves her balms for the innocent her quality of inspiration is not strained byron too was natures priest      and by that vision splendid     was on his way attended  jc 259 in its own deepnessms  316 the metaphor is derived from a hot spring which appears to boil over at the moment of its coming to the surface as the particles of water when they emerge into the light break and bubble into a seething mass so too does passion chase and beget passion in the hot throng of general interests and individual desires  jd one of a worthless worldto strive where none are strongms  317 the thought which underlies the whole of this passage is that man is the creature and thrall of fate in society in the world he is exposed to the incidence of passion which he can neither resist nor yield to without torture he is overcome by the world and as a last resource he turns to nature and solitude he lifts up his eyes to the hills unexpectant of divine aid but in the hope that by claiming kinship with nature and becoming a portion of that around him he may forego humanity with its burden of penitence and elude the curse there is a further reference to this despairing recourse to nature in the dream viii 10 seq                                         he lived     through that which had been death to many men     and made him friends of mountains with the stars     and the quick spirit of the universe     he held his dialogues and they did teach     to him the magic of their mysteries  je 260 through eternityms  318 shelley seems to have taken byron at his word and in the adonais xxx 3 seq introduces him in the disguise of      the pilgrim of eternity whose fame     over his living head like heaven is bent     an early but enduring monument  notwithstanding the splendour of shelleys verse it is difficult to suppress a smile for better or for worse the sense of the ludicrous has asserted itself and brother cannot take brother quite so seriously as in the brave days of old but to each age its own humour not only did shelley and byron worship at the shrine of rousseau but they took delight in reverently tracing the footsteps of st preux and julie  319 261 the name tigris is derived from the persian tîr sanscrit tigra an arrow if byron ever consulted hofmanns lexicon universale he would have read tigris a velocitate dictus quasi sagitta but most probably he neither had nor sought an authority for his natural and beautiful simile  jf to its young cries and kisses all awakems  320 compare tintern abbey in this line both language and sentiment are undoubtedly wordsworths                           the sounding cataract     haunted me like a passion the tall rock     the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood     their colours and their forms were then to me     an appetite a feeling and a love     that had no need of a remoter charm  but here the resemblance ends with wordsworth the mood passed and he learned      to look on nature not as in the hour     of thoughtless youth but hearing oftentimes     the still sad music of humanity     not harsh nor grating but of amplest power     to chasten and subdue  he would not question nature in search of new and untainted pleasure but rests in her as inclusive of humanity the secret of wordsworth is acquiescence the still sad music of humanity is the keynote of his ethic byron on the other hand is in revolt he has the ardour of a pervert the rancorous scorn of a deserter the hum of human cities is a torture he is

do not coincide with the differences in capacity springing from original constitution that the tendency of the social union as now organized is to deepen the artificial inequalities and make the gulf between those endowed with privileges and wealth and those not so endowed ever wider and wider it was  the influence of rousseau  and those whom he inspired which though it certainly did not produce

mouldering remains were unearthed and deposited in a building  on the shore of the lake near the village of meyriez during three succeeding centuries this depository was several times rebuilt but the illstarred relics were not destined even yet to remain undisturbed at the close of the last century when the armies of the french republic were occupying switzerland a regiment consisting mainly of burgundians under the notion of effacing an insult to their ancestors tore down the bonehouse at morat covered the contents with earth and planted on the mound a tree of liberty but the tree had no roots the rains washed away the earth again the remains were exposed to view and lay bleaching in the sun for a quarter of a century travellers stopped to gaze to moralize and to pilfer postilions and poets scraped off skulls and thighbones at last in 1822 the vestiges were swept together and resepulchred and a simple obelisk of marble was erected to commemorate a victory well deserving of its fame

the colour of the rhone at geneva is blue to a depth of tint which i have never seen equalled in water salt or fresh except in the mediterranean and archipelago  the blueness of the rhone which has been attributed to various causes is due to the comparative purity of the water the yellow and muddy stream during its passage through the lake is enabled to purge itself to a very great extent of the solid matter held in suspensionthe glacial and other detritusand so on leaving its vast natural filteringbed it flows out clear and blue it has regained the proper colour of pure water

comtesse dhoudetot the mistress of st lambert and his long walk every morning for the sake of the single kiss which was the common salutation of french acquaintance rousseaus description of his feelings on this occasion may be considered as the most passionate yet not impure description and expression of love that ever kindled into words which after all must be felt from their very force to

what we read of the emotions then and there produced and those we ourselves experience in the perusal in the closet it is one thing to read the iliad at sigæum and on the tumuli or by the springs with

be attributed to any cause beyond the enthusiasm excited by its vehement faith and doctrines the truth or error of which i presume neither to canvass nor to question i should venture to ascribe it to the practice of preaching in the fields and the unstudied and extemporaneous effusions of its teachers the mussulmans whose erroneous devotion at least in the lower orders is most sincere and therefore impressive are accustomed to repeat their prescribed orisons and prayers wherever they may be at the stated hoursof course frequently in the open air kneeling upon a light mat which they carry for the purpose of a bed or cushion as required the ceremony lasts some minutes during which they are totally absorbed and only living in their supplication nothing can disturb them on me the simple and entire sincerity of these men and the spirit which appeared to be within and upon them made a far greater impression than any general rite which was ever performed in places of worship of which i have seen those of almost every persuasion under the sun including most of our own sectaries and the greek the catholic the armenian the lutheran the jewish and the mahometan many of the negroes of whom there are numbers in the turkish empire are idolaters and have free exercise of their belief and its rites some of these i had a distant view of at patras and from what i could make

of all the scenes most celebrated by rousseau in his héloïse i can safely say that in this there is no exaggeration it would be difficult to see clarens with the scenes around it vevay chillon bôveret st gingo meillerie evian360 and the entrances of the rhone without being forcibly struck with its peculiar adaptation to the persons and events with which it has been peopled but this is not all the feeling with which all around clarens and the opposite rocks of meillerie is invested is of a still higher and more comprehensive order than the mere sympathy with individual passion it is a sense of the existence of love in its most extended and sublime capacity and of our own participation of its good and of its glory it is the great principle of the universe which is there more condensed but not less manifested and of which though knowing ourselves a part we lose our individuality and mingle in the beauty of the wholeif rousseau had never written nor lived the same associations would not less have belonged to such scenes he has added to the interest of his works by their adoption he has shown his sense of their beauty by the selection but they have done that for him which no human being could do for themi had the fortune good or evil as it might be to sail from meillerie361 where we landed for some time to st gingo during a lake storm which added to the magnificence of all around although occasionally accompanied by danger to the boat which was small and overloaded it was over this very part of the lake that rousseau has driven the boat of st preux and madame wolmar to meillerie for shelter during a tempest on gaining the shore at st gingo i found that the wind had been sufficiently strong to blow down some fine old chestnut trees on the lower part of the mountains on the opposite height of clarens is a château362 château des crêtes the hills are covered with vineyards and interspersed with some small but beautiful woods one of these was named the bosquet de julie and it is remarkable that though long ago cut down by the brutal selfishness of the monks of st bernard to whom the land appertained that the ground might be enclosed into a vineyard for the miserable drones of an execrable superstition the inhabitants of clarens still point out the spot where its trees stood calling it by the name which consecrated and survived them rousseau has not been particularly fortunate in the preservation of the local habitations he has given to airy nothings the prior of great st bernard has cut down some of his woods for the sake of a few casks of wine and buonaparte has levelled part of the rocks of meillerie in improving the road to the simplon the road is an excellent one but i cannot quite agree with a remark which i heard made that la route vaut

ninety and eight by the 13th and on july 20 he announces the completion of the fourth and ultimate canto of childe harold it consists of 126 stanzas one stanza xl was appended to the fair copy it suggested a parallel between ariosto the southern scott and scott the northern ariosto and excited some misgiving  in commending his new poem to murray july 20 august 7 byron notes three points in which it differed from its predecessors it is the longest of the four it treats more of works of art than of nature there are no metaphysics in itat least i think not in other words the fourth canto is not a continuation of the third i have parted company with shelley and wordsworth subjectmatter and treatment are alike new  the poem as it stood was complete and as a poem it lost as well as gained by the insertion of additional stanzas and groups of stanzas purple patch on purple patch each by itself so attractive and so splendid the pilgrim finds himself at venice on the bridge of sighs he beholds in a vision the departed glories of a thousand years the long array of shadows the beings of the mind come to him like truth and repeople the vacancy but he is an exile and turns homeward in thought to the inviolate island of the sage and free he is an exile and a sufferer he can and will endure his fate but ever and anon he feels the prick of woe and with the sympathy of despair would stand a ruin amidst ruins a desolate soul in a land of desolation and decay he renews his pilgrimage he passes arquà where they keep the dust of lauras lover lingers for a day at ferrara haunted by memories of torquatos injured shade and as he approaches the fair white walls of florence he reechoes the italia oh italia of filicajas impassioned strains at florence he gazes dazzled and drunk with beauty at the goddess in stone the medicean venus but forbears to describe the indescribable to break the silence of art by naming its mysteries santa croce and the other glories in arnos dome of arts most princely shrine he passes by unsung if not unseen but thrasymenes sheet of silver the living crystal of clitumnus gentlest waters and ternis matchless cataract on whose verge an iris sits and lone soractes ridge not only call forth his spirits homage but receive the homage of his muse  and now the pilgrim has reached his goal rome the wonderful the sepulchre of empire the shrine of art  henceforth the works of man absorb his attention pompeys dread statue the wolf of the capitol the tomb of cecilia metella the palatine the nameless column of the forum trajans pillar egerias grotto the ruined colosseum arches on arches an enormous skeleton the colosseum of the poets vision a multitudinous ring of spectators a bloody circus and a dying gladiator the pantheon s nicola in carcere the scene of the romana caritas st peters vast and wondrous domeare all celebrated in due succession last of all he turns to the vatican to view the laocoon and the apollo belvidere the counterfeit presentments of ideal suffering and ideal beauty his shrine is won but ere he bids us farewell he climbs the alban mount and as the mediterranean once more bursts upon his sight he sums the moral of his argument man and all his works are as a drop of rain in the ocean the image of eternity the throne of the invisible  byron had no sooner completed this fourth and ultimate canto than he began to throw off additional stanzas his letters to murray during the autumn of 1817 announce these successive lengthenings but it is impossible to trace the exact order of their composition on the 7th of august the canto stood at 130 stanzas on the 21st at 133 on the 4th of september at 144 on the 17th at 150 and by november 15 it had reached 167 stanzas of nineteen stanzas which were still to be added sixon the death of the princess charlotte died november 6 1817were written at the beginning of december and two stanzas clxxvii clxxviii were forwarded to murray in the early spring of 1818  of these additions the most notable are four stanzas on venice including stanza xiii on the horses of st mark the sunset on the brenta stanzas xxviixxix the tombs in santa crocethe apostrophe to the all

clxviiclxxii nemi stanzas clxxiii clxxiv the desert and one fair spirit stanzas clxxvii clxxviii  some time during the month of december 1817 byron wrote out a fair copy of the entire canto numbering 184 stanzas ms d and on january 7 1818 hobhouse left venice for england with the whole of the mss viz beppo begun october 1817 and the fourth canto of childe harold together with a work of his own a volume of essays on italian literature the antiquities of rome etc which he had put together during his residence in venice julydecember 1817 and proposed to publish as an appendix to childe harold in his preface to historical illustrations etc 1818 hobhouse explains that on his return to england he considered that this appendix to the canto would be swelled to a disproportioned bulk and that under this impression he determined to divide his material into two parts the result was that such only of the notes as were more immediately connected with the text were printed as historical notes to canto the fourth and that his longer dissertations were published in a separate volume under his own name as historical illustrations to the fourth canto of childe harold to these historical notes an interest attaches apart from any consideration of their own worth and importance but to understand the relation between the poem and the notes it is necessary to retrace the movements of the poet and his annotator  byron and hobhouse left the villa diodati october 5 1816 crossed the simplon and made their way together via milan and verona to venice early in december the friends parted company byron remained at venice and hobhouse proceeded to rome and for the next four months devoted himself to the study of italian literature in connection with archæology and art byron testifies september 14 1817 that his researches were indefatigable that he had more real knowledge of rome and its environs than any englishman who has been there since gibbon hobhouse left rome for naples may 21 returned to rome june 9 arrived at terni july 2 and early in july joined byron on the brenta at la mira the latter half of the year julydecember 1817 was occupied in consulting the best authorities in the ducal library at venice with a view to perfecting his researches and giving them to the world as an illustrative appendix to childe harold it is certain that byron had begun the fourth canto and written some thirty or more stanzas before hobhouse rejoined him at his villa of la mira on the banks of the brenta in july 1817 and it would seem that although he had begun by saying that he was too short a time in rome for it he speedily overcame his misgivings and accomplished as he believed the last fytte of his pilgrimage the first draft was byrons unaided composition but the additional stanzas were largely due to hobhouses suggestions in the course of conversation if not to his written researches hobhouse himself made no secret of it in his preface p 5 to historical illustrations he affirms that both illustrations and notes were for the most part written while the noble author was yet employed in the composition of the poem they were put into the hands of lord byron much in the state in which they now appear and writing to murray december 7 1817 he says i must confess i feel an affection for it canto iv more than ordinary as part of it was begot as it were under my own eyes for although your poets are as shy as elephants and camels  yet i have not unfrequently witnessed his lordships coupleting and some of the stanzas owe their birth to our morning walk or evening ride at la mira forty years later in his revised and enlarged illustrations italy remarks made in several visits from the year 1816 to 1854 by the right hon lord broughton gcb 1859 i p iv he reverts to this collaboration when i rejoined lord byron at la mira  i found him employed upon the fourth canto of childe harold and later in the autumn he showed me the first sketch of the poem it was much shorter than it afterwards became and it did not remark on several objects which appeared to me peculiarly worthy of notice i made a list of these objects and in conversation with him gave him reasons for the selection the result was the poem as it now appears and he then engaged me to write the notes  as the delicate spirit of shelley suffused the third canto of childe harold so the fourth reveals the presence and cooperation of hobhouse to his brotherpoet he owed a fresh conception perhaps a fresh appreciation of nature to his lifelong friend a fresh enthusiasm for art and a host of details dry bones  which he awakened into the fulness of life  the fourth canto was published on tuesday april 28 1818 it was reviewed by sir walter scott in the quarterly review no xxxvii april 1818 and by john wilson in the edinburgh review no 59 june 1818 both numbers were published on the same day september 26 1818                 childe harold canto iv original draft ms m

my dear hobhouse  after an interval of eight years between the composition of the first and last cantos of childe harold the conclusion of the poem is about to be submitted to the public in parting with so old a friend364 it is not extraordinary that i should recur to one still older and betterto one who has beheld the birth and death of the other and to whom i am far more indebted for the social advantages of an enlightened friendship thanthough not ungratefuli can or could be to childe harold for any public favour reflected through the poem on the poetto one whom i have known long and accompanied far whom i have found wakeful over my sickness and kind in my sorrow glad in my prosperity and firm in my adversity true in counsel and trusty in perilto a friend often tried and never found wantingto yourself  in so doing i recur from fiction to truth and in dedicating to you in its complete or at least concluded state a poetical work which is the longest the most thoughtful and comprehensive of my compositions i wish to do honour to myself by the record of many years intimacy with a man of learning of talent of steadiness and of honour it is not for minds like ours to give or to receive flattery yet the praises of sincerity have ever been permitted to the voice of friendship and it is not for you nor even for others but to relieve a heart which has not elsewhere or lately been so much accustomed to the encounter of goodwill as to withstand the shock firmly that i thus attempt to commemorate your good qualities or rather the advantages which i have derived from their exertion even the recurrence of the date of this letter the anniversary of the most unfortunate day of my past existence365 but which cannot poison my future while i retain the resource of your friendship and of my own faculties will henceforth have a more agreeable recollection for both inasmuch as it will remind us of this my attempt to thank you for an indefatigable regard such as few men have experienced and no one could experience without thinking better of his species and of himself  it has been our fortune to traverse together at various periods the countries of chivalry history and fablespain greece asia minor and italy and what athens and constantinople were to us a few years ago venice and rome have been more recently the poem also or the pilgrim or both have accompanied me from first to last and perhaps it may be a pardonable vanity which induces me to reflect with complacency on a composition which in some degree connects me with the spot where it was produced and the objects it would fain describe and however unworthy it may be deemed of those magical and memorable abodes however short it may fall of our distant conceptions and immediate impressions yet as a mark of respect for what is venerable and of feeling for what is glorious it has been to me a source of pleasure in the production and i part with it with a kind of regret which i hardly suspected that events could have left me for imaginary objects  with regard to the conduct of the last canto there will be found less of the pilgrim than in any of the preceding and that little slightly if at all separated from the author speaking in his own person the fact is that i had become weary of drawing a line which every one seemed determined not to perceive like the chinese in goldsmiths citizen of the world366 whom nobody would believe to be a chinese it was in vain that i asserted and imagined that i had drawn a distinction between the author and the pilgrim and the very anxiety to preserve this difference and disappointment at finding it unavailing so far crushed my efforts in the composition that i determined to abandon it altogetherand have done so the opinions which have been or may be formed on that subject are now a matter of indifference the work is to depend on itself and not on the writer and the author who has no resources in his own mind beyond the reputation transient or permanent which is to arise from his literary efforts deserves the fate of authors  in the course of the following canto it was my intention either in the text or in the notes to have touched upon the present state of italian literature and perhaps of manners but the text within the limits i proposed i soon found hardly sufficient for the labyrinth of external objects and the consequent reflections and for the whole of the notes excepting a few of the shortest i am indebted to yourself367 and these were necessarily limited to the elucidation of the text  it is also a delicate and no very grateful task to dissert upon the literature and manners of a nation so dissimilar and requires an attention and impartiality which would induce usthough perhaps no inattentive observers nor ignorant of the language or customs of the people amongst whom we have recently abodeto distrust or at least defer our judgment and more narrowly examine our information the state of literary as well as political party appears to run or to have run so high that for a stranger to steer impartially between them is next to impossible it may be enough then at least for my purpose to quote from their own beautiful languagemi pare che in un paese tutto poetico che vanta la lingua la più nobile ed insieme la più dolce tutte tutte le vie diverse si possono tentare e che sinche la patria di alfieri e di monti non ha perduto lantico valore in tutte essa dovrebbe essere la prima italy has great names stillcanova368 monti ugo foscolo pindemonte visconti morelli cicognara albrizzi mezzofanti mai

one canova  it has been somewhere said by alfieri that la pianta uomo nasce più robusta in italia che in qualunque altra terrae che gli stessi atroci delitti che vi si commettono ne sono una prova without subscribing to the latter part of his proposition a dangerous doctrine the truth of which may be disputed on better grounds namely that the italians are in no respect more ferocious than their neighbours that man must be wilfully blind or ignorantly heedless who is not struck with the extraordinary capacity of this people or if such a word be admissible their capabilities369 the facility of their acquisitions the rapidity of their conceptions the fire of their genius their sense of beauty and amidst all the disadvantages of repeated revolutions the desolation of battles and the despair of ages their still unquenched longing after immortality370the immortality of independence and when we ourselves in riding round the walls of rome heard the simple lament of the labourers chorus roma roma roma roma non è più come era prima371 it was difficult not to contrast this melancholy dirge with the bacchanal roar of the songs of exultation still yelled from the london taverns over the carnage of mont st jean372 and the betrayal of genoa of italy of france and of the world by men whose conduct you yourself have exposed in a work worthy of the better days of our history373 for me      non movero mai corda     ove la turba di sue ciance assorda  what italy has gained by the late transfer of nations it were useless for englishmen to enquire till it becomes ascertained that england has acquired something more than a permanent army and a suspended habeas corpus374 it is enough for them to look at home for what they have done abroad and especially in the south verily they will have their reward and at no very distant period  wishing you my dear hobhouse a safe and agreeable return to that country whose real welfare can be dearer to none than to yourself i dedicate to you this poem in its completed state and repeat once more how truly i am ever      your obliged           and affectionate friend                               byron     canto the fourth375

enchanters wand377       a thousand years their cloudy wings expand       around me and a dying glory smiles       oer the far times when many a subject land       looked to the winged lions marble

reproach which conveyed a tribute to their prowess a more probable explanation is that the byword with its cognates pantaleone the typical masque of italian comedyprogenitor of our pantaloon and pantaloni pantaloons the typical venetian costumederive their origin from the baptismal name pantaleone frequently given to venetian children in honour of st pantaleon of nicomedia physician and

facts of petrarchs life as established by his correspondence a complete series of petrarchs letters was published by giuseppe fracassetti in 1859 inclines to the belief that it was the poets status as a cleric and not a husband and family which proved a bar to his union with laura with regard however to one piece of documentary evidence namely laura de sades will dr garnett admits that if this were producible and on being produced proved genuine the coincidence of the date of the will april 3 1348 with a note in petrarchs handwriting dated april 6 1348 which records the death of laura would

contemporaries the accounts of the ducal court and other documentary evidence have in a great measure exonerated the duke at the expense of the unhappy poet himself briefly tassos intrigues with rival powersthe medici at florence the papal court and the holy office at bolognaaroused the alarm and suspicion of the duke whilst his general demeanour and his outbursts of violence and temper compelled rather than afforded a pretext for his confinement before his final and fatal return to ferrara he had been duly warned that he must submit to be treated as a person of disordered intellect and that if he continued to throw out hints of designs upon his life and of persecution in high places he would be banished from the ducal court and dominions but return he would and at an inauspicious moment when the duke was preoccupied with the ceremonies and festivities of a third marriage no one attended to him or took heed of his arrival and to quote his own words in a fit of madness he broke out into execrations of the ducal court and family and of the people of ferrara for the offence he was shut up in the hospital of sant anna and for many months treated as an ordinary lunatic of the particulars of his treatment during these first eight months of his confinement apart from tassos own letters there is no evidence the accounts of the hospital are lost and the libri di spesa r arch di stato in modena camer ducale casa amministrazione solerti iii docu 47 do not commence till november 20 1579 two years later the libri di spenderia solerti in docu 51 from january 1582 onward show that he was put on a more generous diet and it is known that a certain measure of liberty and other indulgences were gradually accorded there can however be little doubt that for many months his food was neglected and medical attendance withheld his statement that he was denied the rites of the church cannot be gainsaid he was regarded as a lunatic and as such he would not be permitted either to

chivalry war and love were as like as can be and as to the compliment if you knew what the italians think of ariosto you would not hesitate about that if you think scott will dislike it say so and i will expunge byron did not know that when scott was at college at edinburgh he had had the audacity to produce a composition in which he weighed homer against ariosto and pronounced him wanting in the balance or that he made a practice of reading through  the orlando of ariosto once every year see memoirs of the life etc 1871 pp 12 747 but the parallel had suggested itself the keynote of the

the parallel many years before july 6 1812 byron had been at pains to inform him that so august a critic as the prince regent preferred you to every bard past and present and spoke alternately of homer and yourself of the placing and unplacing of poets there is no end byron had already been sharply rebuked by the edinburgh review for describing christabel as a wild and singularly original and beautiful poem and his appreciation of scott provoked the expostulation of a friendlier critic walter scott wrote francis hodgson in his anonymous monitor of childe harold 1818 credite posteri or

course which rome itself had run before it from virtuous industry to wealth from wealth to luxury from luxury to an impatience of discipline and corruption of morals till by a total degeneracy and

for a brief period rienzi accomplished on may 20 1347 he was proclaimed tribune and liberator of the holy roman republic by the authority of the most merciful lord jesus christ of great parts and inspired by lofty aims he was a poor creature at hearta bastard napoleonand success seems to have turned his head after eight months of royal splendour purchased by more than royal exactions the tide of popular feeling turned against him and he was forced to take refuge in the castle of st angelo december 15 1347 years of wandering and captivity followed his first tribunate but at length in 1354 he was permitted to return to rome and once again after a rapid and successful reduction of the neighbouring states he became the chief power in the state but an act of violence accompanied by treachery and above all the necessity of imposing heavier taxes than the city could bear roused popular discontent and during a revolt october 8 1354 after a dastardly attempt to escape and conceal himself he was recognized by the crowd and stabbed to death  petrarch first made his acquaintance in 1340 when he was summoned to rome to be crowned as poet laureate afterwards when rienzi was

of the outer arches of the second and third stories were probably decorated with statues the reverse of an aureus of the reign of titus represents the colosseum with these statues and a quadriga in the centre about onethird of the original structure remains in situ the prime agent of destruction was probably the earthquake petrarchs earthquake of september 1349 when the whole of the western side fell towards the cælian and gave rise to a hill or rather to a chain of hills of loose blocks of travertine and tufa which supplied rome with building materials for subsequent centuries as an instance

and wild flowers books were written on the flora of the coliseum which were said to number 420 species but says professor lanciani these materials for a hortus siccus so dear to the visitors of our ruins were destroyed by rosa in 1871 and the ruins scraped and shaven clean it being feared by him that the action of roots would accelerate the disintegration of the great structure if byron had lived to witness these activities he might have devoted a stanza to the tender mercies of this zealous archæologist  509 426 the whole of this appeal to nemesis stanzas cxxxcxxxviii must be compared with the domestic poems of 1816 the third canto of childe harold especially stanzas lxixlxxv and cxicxviii and with the invocation in the first act of manfred it has been argued that byron inserted these stanzas with the deliberate purpose of diverting sympathy from his wife to himself the appeal no doubt is deliberate and the plea is followed by an indictment but the sincerity of the appeal is attested by its inconsistency unlike orestes who slew his mother to avenge his father he will not so deal with the moral clytemnestra of her lord requiting murder by murder but is resolved to leave the balancing of the scale to the omnipotent timespirit who rights every wrong and will redress his injuries but in making answer to his accusers he outruns nemesis and himself enacts the part of a moral orestes it was true that his hopes were sapped and his name blighted and it was natural if not heroic first to persuade himself that his suffering exceeded his fault that he was more sinned against than sinning and so persuaded to take care that he should not suffer alone the general purport of plea and indictment is plain enough but the exact interpretation of his phrases the

relations between the two parts of the pantheon remain unsolved but on the following points professor lanciani claims to speak with certainty  1 the present pantheon portico included is not the work of agrippa but of hadrian and dates from ad 120124  2 the columns capital and entablature of the portico inscribed with agrippas name may be original and may date from 2725 bc but they were first

from the ruins of the palace and is now in the vatican is the statue which pliny describes m collignon in his histoire de la sculpture grecque gives reasons for assigning the date of the laocoon to the first years of the first century bc it follows that the work is a century later than the frieze of the great altar of pergamos which contains the figure of a young giant caught in the toils of athenas serpenta theme which served as a model for later sculptors of the same school in 1817 the laocoon was in the heyday of its fame and was regarded as the supreme achievement of ancient art since

rout of the gauls when they attacked delphi bc 278 to this theory furtwaengler at one time assented but subsequently came to the conclusion that the stroganoff bronze was a forgery his present contention is that the left hand held a bow as montorsoli imagined whilst the right grasped a branch of laurel of which the leaves are still visible on the trunk which the copyist added to the bronze

                     stanza i lines 1 and 2  the communication between the ducal palace and the prisons of venice is by a gloomy bridge or covered gallery high above the water and divided by a stone wall into a passage and a cell the state dungeons called pozzi or wells were sunk in the thick walls of the palace and the prisoner when taken out to die was conducted across the gallery to the other side and being then led back into the other compartment or cell upon the bridge was there strangled the low portal through which the criminal was taken into this cell is now walled up but the passage is still open and is still known by the name of the bridge of sighs the pozzi are under the flooring of the chamber at the foot of the bridge they were formerly twelve but on the first arrival of the french the venetians hastily blocked or broke up the deeper of these dungeons you may still however descend by a trapdoor and crawl down through holes half choked by rubbish to the depth of two stories below the first range if you are in want of consolation for the extinction of patrician power perhaps you may find it there scarcely a ray of light glimmers into the narrow gallery which leads to the cells and the places of confinement themselves are totally dark a small hole in the wall admitted the damp air of the passages and served for the introduction of the prisoners food a wooden pallet raised a foot from the ground was the only furniture the conductors tell you that a light was not allowed the cells are about five paces in length two and a half in width and seven feet in height they are directly beneath one another and respiration is somewhat difficult in the lower holes only one prisoner was found when the republicans descended into these hideous recesses and he is said to have been confined sixteen years but the inmates of the dungeons beneath had left traces of their repentance or of their despair which are still visible and may perhaps owe something to recent ingenuity some of the detained appear to have offended against and others to have belonged to the sacred body not only from their signatures but from the churches and belfries which they have scratched upon the walls the reader may not object to see a specimen of the records prompted by so terrific a solitude as nearly as they could be copied by more than one pencil three of them are as

followed not corrected the solecisms some of which are however not quite so decided since the letters were evidently scratched in the dark it only need be observed that bestemmia and mangiar may be read in the first inscription which was probably written by a prisoner confined for some act of impiety committed at a funeral that cortellarius is the name of a parish on terra firma near the sea and that the last initials evidently are put for viva la santa chiesa kattolica romana                                 2      in venice tassos echoes are no more                                                      stanza iii line 1  i cannot forbear mentioning a custom in venice which they tell me is particular to the common people of this country of singing stanzas out of tasso they are set to a pretty solemn tune and when one begins in any part of the poet it is odds but he will be answered by somebody else that overhears him so that sometimes you have ten or a dozen in the neighbourhood of one another taking verse after verse and running on with the poem as far as their memories will carry themaddison ad 1700  the wellknown song of the gondoliers of alternate stanzas from tassos jerusalem has died with the independence of venice editions of the poem with the original in one column and the venetian variations on the other as sung by the boatmen were once common and are still to be found the following extract will serve to show the difference between the tuscan epic and the canta alia barcariola                                  original      canto larme pietose e l capitano       che l gran sepolcro liberò di cristo     molto egli oprò col senno e con la mano       molto soffri nel glorioso acquisto     e in van l inferno a lui s oppose e in vano       s armò d

familiar bard  on the 7th of last january the author of childe harold and another englishman the writer of this notice rowed to the lido with two singers one of whom was a carpenter and the other a gondolier the former placed himself at the prow the latter at the stern of the boat a little after leaving the quay of the piazzetta they began to sing and continued their exercise until we arrived at the island they gave us amongst other essays the death of clorinda and the palace of armida and did not sing the venetian but the tuscan verses the carpenter however who was the cleverer of the two and was frequently obliged to prompt his companion told us that he could translate the original he added that he could sing almost three hundred stanzas but had not spirits morbin was the word he used to learn any more or to sing what he already knew a man must have idle time on his hands to acquire or to repeat and said the poor fellow look at my clothes and at me i am starving this speech was more affecting than his performance which habit alone can make attractive the recitative was shrill screaming and monotonous and the gondolier behind assisted his voice by holding his hand to one side of his mouth the carpenter used a quiet action which he evidently endeavoured to restrain but was too much interested in his subject altogether to repress from these men we learnt that singing is not confined to the gondoliers and that although the chant is seldom if ever voluntary there are still several amongst the lower classes who are acquainted with a few stanzas  it does not appear that it is usual for the performers to row and sing at the same time although the verses of the jerusalem are no longer casually heard there is yet much music upon the venetian canals and upon holydays those strangers who are not near or informed enough to distinguish the words may fancy that many of the gondolas still resound with the strains of tasso the writer of some remarks which appeared in the curiosities of literature must excuse his being twice quoted for with the exception of some phrases a little too ambitious and extravagant he has furnished a very exact as well as agreeable description  in venice the gondoliers know by heart long passages from ariosto and tasso and often chant them with a peculiar melody but this talent seems at present on the declineat least after taking some pains i could find no more than two persons who delivered to me in this way a passage from tasso i must add that the late mr berry once chanted to me a passage in tasso in the manner as he assured me of the gondoliers  there are always two concerned who alternately sing the strophes we know the melody eventually by rousseau to whose songs it is printed it has properly no melodious movement and is a sort of medium between the canto fermo and the canto figurato it approaches to the former by recitativical declamation and to the latter by passages and course by which one syllable is detained and embellished  i entered a gondola by moonlight one singer placed himself forwards and the other aft and thus proceeded to st georgio one began the song when he had ended his strophe the other took up the lay and so continued the song alternately throughout the whole of it the same notes invariably returned but according to the subjectmatter of the strophe they laid a greater or a smaller stress sometimes on one and sometimes on another note and indeed changed the enunciation of the whole strophe as the object of the poem altered  on the whole however the sounds were hoarse and screaming they seemed in the manner of all rude uncivilised men to make the excellency of their singing in the force of their voice one seemed desirous of conquering the other by the strength of his lungs and so far from receiving delight from this scene shut up as i was in the box of the gondola i found myself in a very unpleasant situation  my companion to whom i communicated this circumstance being very desirous to keep up the credit of his countrymen assured me that the singing was very delightful when heard at a distance accordingly we got out upon the shore leaving one of the singers in the gondola while the other went to the distance of some hundred paces they now began to sing against one another and i kept walking up and down between them both so as always to leave him who was to begin his part i frequently stood still and hearkened to the one and to the other  here the scene was properly introduced the strong declamatory and as it were shrieking sound met the ear from far and called forth the attention the quickly succeeding transitions which necessarily required to be sung in a lower tone seemed like plaintive strains succeeding the vociferations of emotion or of pain the other who listened attentively immediately began where the former left off answering him in milder or more vehement notes according as the purport of the strophe required the sleepy canals the lofty buildings the splendour of the moon the deep shadows of the few gondolas that moved like spirits hither and thither increased the striking peculiarity of the scene and amidst all these circumstances it was easy to confess the character of this wonderful harmony  it suits perfectly well with an idle solitary mariner lying at length in his vessel at rest on one of these canals waiting for his company or for a fare the tiresomeness of which situation is somewhat alleviated by the songs and poetical stories he has in memory he often raises his voice as loud as he can which extends itself to a vast distance over the tranquil mirror and as all is still around he is as it were in a solitude in the midst of a large and populous town here is no rattling of carriages no noise of foot passengers a silent gondola glides now and then by him of which the splashings of the oars are scarcely to be heard  at a distance he hears another perhaps utterly unknown to him melody and verse immediately attach the two strangers he becomes the responsive echo to the former and exerts himself to be heard as he had heard the other by a tacit convention they alternate verse for verse though the song should last the whole night through they entertain themselves without fatigue the hearers who are passing between the two take part in the amusement  this vocal performance sounds best at a great distance and is then inexpressibly charming as it only fulfills its design in the sentiment of remoteness it is plaintive but not dismal in its sound and at times it is scarcely possible to refrain from tears my companion who otherwise was not a very delicately organised person said quite unexpectedly e singolare come quel canto intenerisce e molto più quando lo cantano meglio  i was told that the women of libo the long row of islands that divides the adriatic from the lagoons555 particularly the women of the extreme districts of malamocca and palestrina sing in like manner the works of tasso to these and similar tunes  they have the custom when their husbands are fishing out at sea to sit along the shore in the evenings and vociferate these songs and continue to do so with great violence till each of them can distinguish the responses of her own husband at a distance556  the love of music and of poetry distinguishes all classes of venetians even amongst the tuneful sons of italy the city itself can occasionally furnish respectable audiences for two and even three operahouses at a time and there are few events in private life that do not call forth a printed and circulated sonnet does a physician or a lawyer take his degree or a clergyman preach his maiden sermon has a surgeon performed an operation would a harlequin announce his departure or his benefit are you to be congratulated on a marriage or a birth or a lawsuit the muses are invoked to furnish the same number of syllables and the individual triumphs blaze abroad in virgin white or partycoloured placards on half the corners of the capital the last curtsy of a favourite prima donna brings down a shower of these poetical tributes from those upper regions from which in our theatres nothing but cupids and snowstorms are accustomed to descend there is a poetry in the very life of a venetian which in its common course is varied with those surprises and changes so recommendable in fiction but so different from the sober monotony of northern existence amusements are raised into duties duties are softened into amusements and every object being considered as equally making a part of the business of life is announced and performed with the same earnest indifference and gay assiduity the venetian gazette constantly closes its columns with the following triple advertisement                                charade       exposition of the most holy sacrament in the church of st                                theatres                       st moses opera                      st benedict

whence they set out and are as before half hidden under the porch window of st marks church their history after a desperate struggle has been satisfactorily explored the decisions and doubts of erizzo and zanetti and lastly of the count leopold cicognara would have given them a roman extraction and a pedigree not more ancient than the reign of nero but m de schlegel stepped in to teach the venetians the value of their own treasures and a greek vindicated at last and for ever the pretension of his countrymen to this noble production557 m mustoxidi has not been left without a reply but as yet he has received no answer it should seem that the horses are irrevocably chian and were transferred to constantinople by theodosius lapidary writing is a favourite play of the italians and has conferred reputation on more than one of their literary characters one of the best specimens of bodonis typography is a respectable volume of inscriptions all written by his friend pacciaudi several

the latin but it may be permitted to observe that the injustice of the venetians in transporting the horses from constantinople ad 1204 was at least equal to that of the french in carrying them to paris ad 1797 and that it would have been more prudent to have avoided all allusions to either robbery an apostolic prince should perhaps have objected to affixing over the principal entrance of a metropolitan church an inscription having a reference to any other triumphs than those of religion nothing less than the pacification of the world can excuse such a solecism

efforts on the part of the italians entirely to throw off the yoke of frederic barbarossa and as fruitless attempts of the emperor to make himself absolute master throughout the whole of his cisalpine dominions the bloody struggles of fourandtwenty years were happily brought to a close in the city of venice the articles of a treaty had been previously agreed upon between pope alexander iii and barbarossa and the former having received a safeconduct had already arrived at venice from ferrara in company with the ambassadors of the king of sicily and the consuls of the lombard league there still remained however many points to adjust and for several days the peace was believed to be impracticable at this juncture it was suddenly reported that the emperor had arrived at chioza a town fifteen miles from the capital the venetians rose tumultuously and insisted upon immediately conducting him to the city the lombards took the alarm and departed towards treviso the pope himself was apprehensive of some disaster if frederic should suddenly advance upon him but was reassured by the prudence and address of sebastian ziani the doge several embassies passed between chioza and the capital until at last the emperor relaxing somewhat of his pretensions laid aside his leonine ferocity and put on the mildness of the lamb558  on saturday the 23rd of july in the year 1177 six venetian galleys transferred frederic in great pomp from chioza to the island of lido a mile from venice early the next morning the pope accompanied by the sicilian ambassadors and by the envoys of lombardy whom he had recalled from the main land together with a great concourse of people repaired from the patriarchal palace to st marks church and solemnly absolved the emperor and his partisans from the excommunication pronounced against him the chancellor of the empire on the part of his master renounced the antipopes and their schismatic adherents immediately the doge with a great suite both of the clergy and laity got on board the galleys and waiting on frederic rowed him in mighty state from the lido to the capital the emperor descended from the galley at the quay of the piazzetta the doge the patriarch his bishops and clergy and the people of venice with their crosses and their standards marched in solemn procession before him to the church of st mark alexander was seated before the vestibule of the basilica attended by his bishops and cardinals by the patriarch of aquileja by the archbishops and bishops of lombardy all of them in state and clothed in their church robes frederic approachedmoved by the holy spirit venerating the almighty in the person of alexander laying aside his imperial dignity and throwing off his mantle he prostrated himself at full length at the feet of the pope alexander with tears in his eyes raised him benignantly from the ground kissed him blessed him and immediately the germans of the train sang with a loud voice we praise thee o lord the emperor then taking the pope by the right hand led him to the church and having received his benediction returned to the ducal palace559 the ceremony of humiliation was repeated the next day the pope himself at the request of frederic said mass at st marks the emperor again laid aside his imperial mantle and taking a wand in his hand officiated as verger driving the laity from the choir and preceding the pontiff to the altar alexander after reciting the gospel preached to the people the emperor put himself close to the pulpit in the attitude of listening and the pontiff touched by this mark of his attention for he knew that frederic did not understand a word he said commanded the patriarch of aquileja to translate the latin discourse into the german tongue the creed was then chanted frederic made his oblation and kissed the popes feet and mass being over led him by the hand to his white horse he held the stirrup and would have led the horses rein to the water side had not the pope accepted of the inclination for the performance and affectionately dismissed him with his benediction such is the substance of the account left by the archbishop of salerno who was present at the ceremony and whose story is confirmed by every subsequent narration it would be not worth so minute a record were it not the triumph of liberty as well as of superstition the states of lombardy owed to it the confirmation of their privileges and alexander had reason to thank the almighty who had enabled an infirm unarmed old man to subdue a terrible and potent sovereign560

recollect the exclamation of the highlander oh for one hour of dundee henry dandolo when elected doge in 1192 was eightyfive years of age when he commanded the venetians at the taking of constantinople he was consequently ninetyseven years old at this age he annexed the fourth and a half of the whole empire of romania561 for so the roman empire was then called to the title and to the territories of the venetian doge the threeeighths of this empire were preserved in the diplomas until the dukedom of giovanni dolfino who made use of the above designation in the year 1357562  dandolo led the attack on constantinople in person two ships the paradise and the pilgrim were tied together and a drawbridge or ladder let down from their higher yards to the walls the doge was one of the first to rush into the city then was completed said the venetians the prophecy of the erythræan sibyla gathering together of the powerful shall be made amidst the waves of the adriatic under a blind leader they shall beset the goatthey shall profane byzantiumthey shall blacken her buildingsher spoils shall be dispersed a new goat shall bleat until they have measured out and run over fiftyfour feet nine inches and a half563 dandolo died on the first day of june 1205 having reigned thirteen years six months and five days and was buried in the church of st sophia at constantinople strangely enough it must sound that the name of the rebel apothecary who received the doges sword and annihilated the ancient government in 17967 was dandolo                                 6      but is not

august 1379 by the united armament of the genoese and francesco da carrara signor of padua the venetians were reduced to the utmost despair an embassy was sent to the conquerors with a blank sheet of paper praying them to prescribe what terms they pleased and leave to venice only her independence the prince of padua was inclined to listen to these proposals but the genoese who after the victory at pola had shouted to venice to venice and long live st george determined to annihilate their rival and peter doria their commanderinchief returned this answer to the suppliants on gods faith gentlemen of venice ye shall have no peace from the signer of padua nor from our commune of genoa until we have first put a rein upon those unbridled horses of yours that are upon the porch of your evangelist st mark when we have bridled them we shall keep you quiet and this is the pleasure of us and of our commune as for these my brothers of genoa that you have brought with you to give up to us i will not have them take them back for in a few days hence i shall come and let them out of prison myself both these and all the others p 727 e vide infra in fact the genoese did advance as far as malamocco within five miles of the capital but their own danger and the pride of their enemies gave courage to the venetians who made prodigious efforts and many individual sacrifices all of them carefully recorded by their historians vettor pisani was put at the head of thirtyfour galleys the genoese broke up from malamocco and retired to chioza in october but they again threatened venice which was reduced to extremities at this time the 1st of january 1380 arrived carlo zeno who had been cruising on the genoese coast with fourteen galleys the venetians were now strong enough to besiege the genoese doria was killed on the 22nd of january by a stone bullet one hundred and ninetyfive pounds weight discharged from a bombard called the trevisan chioza was then closely invested five thousand auxiliaries among whom were some english condottieri commanded by one captain ceccho joined the venetians the genoese in their turn prayed for conditions but none were granted until at last they surrendered at discretion and on the 24th of june 1380 the doge contarini made his triumphal entry into chioza four thousand prisoners nineteen galleys many smaller vessels and barks with all the ammunition and arms and outfit of the expedition fell into the hands of the conquerors who had it not been for the inexorable answer of doria would have gladly reduced their dominion to the city of venice an account of these transactions is found in a work called the war of chioza564 written by daniel chinazzo who was in venice at the time                                 7      thin streets and

century amounted to nearly two hundred thousand souls at the last census taken two years ago 1816 it was no more than about one hundred and three thousand and it diminishes daily the commerce and the official employments which were to be the unexhausted source of venetian grandeur have both expired565 most of the patrician mansions are deserted and would gradually disappear had not the government alarmed by the demolition of seventytwo during the last two years expressly forbidden this sad resource of poverty many remnants of the venetian nobility are now scattered and confounded with the

thought by foreigners to have arrived in the due course of mortality only one sentiment can be expected from the venetians themselves at no time were the subjects of the republic so unanimous in their resolution to rally round the standard of st mark as when it was for the last time unfurled and the cowardice and the treachery of the few patricians who recommended the fatal neutrality were confined to the persons of the traitors themselves the present race cannot be thought to regret the loss of their aristocratical forms and too despotic government they think only on their vanished independence they pine away at the remembrance and on this subject suspend for a moment their gay good humour venice may be said in the words of the scripture to die daily and so general and so apparent is the decline as to become painful to a stranger not reconciled to the sight of a whole nation expiring as it were before his eyes so artificial a creation having lost that principle which called it into life and supported its existence must fall to pieces at once and sink more rapidly than it rose the abhorrence of slavery which drove the venetians to the sea has since their disaster forced them to the land where they may be at least overlooked amongst the crowd of dependents and not present the humiliating spectacle of a whole nation loaded with recent chains their liveliness their affability and that happy indifference which constitution alone can give for philosophy aspires to it in vain have not sunk under circumstances but many peculiarities of costume and manner have by degrees been lost and the nobles with a pride common to all italians who have been masters have not been persuaded to parade their insignificance that splendour which was a proof and a portion of their power they would not degrade into the trappings of their subjection they retired from the space which they had occupied in the eyes of their fellow citizens their continuance in which would have been a symptom of acquiescence and an insult to those who suffered by the common misfortune those who remained in the degraded capital might be said rather to haunt the scenes of their departed power than to live in them the reflection who and what enthrals will hardly bear a comment from one who is nationally the friend and the ally of the conqueror it may however be allowed to say thus much that to those who wish to recover their independence any masters must be an object of detestation and it may be safely foretold that this unprofitable aversion will not have been corrected before venice shall have sunk into the slime of her choked canals                                 8        watering the tree which bears his ladys name     with his melodious tears he gave himself to fame                                               stanza xxx lines 8 and 9  thanks to the critical acumen of a scotchman we now know as little of laura as ever566 the discoveries of the abbé de sade his triumphs his sneers can no longer instruct or amuse we must not however think that these memoirs567 are as much a romance as belisarius or the incas although we are told so by dr beattie a great name but a little authority568 his labour has not been in vain notwithstanding his love has like most other passions made him ridiculous569 the hypothesis which overpowered the struggling italians and carried along less interested critics in its current is run out we have another proof that we can never be sure that the paradox the most singular and therefore having the most agreeable and authentic air will not give place to the reestablished ancient prejudice  it seems then first that laura was born lived died and was buried not in avignon but in the country the fountains of the sorga the thickets of cabrieres may resume their pretensions and the exploded de la bastie again be heard with complacency the hypothesis of the abbé had no stronger props than the parchment sonnet and medal found on the skeleton of the wife of hugo de sade and the manuscript note to the virgil of petrarch now in the ambrosian library if these proofs were both incontestable the poetry was written the medal composed cast and deposited within the space of twelve hours and these deliberate duties were performed round the carcass of one who died of the plague and was hurried to the grave on the day of her death these documents therefore are too decisive they prove not the fact but the forgery either the sonnet or the virgilian note must be a falsification the abbé cites both as incontestably true the consequent deduction is inevitablethey are both evidently false570  secondly laura was never married and was a haughty virgin rather than that tender and prudent wife who honoured avignon by making that town the theatre of an honest french passion and played off for one and twenty years her little machinery of alternate favours and refusals571 upon the first poet of the age it was indeed rather too unfair that a female should be made responsible for eleven children upon the faith of a misinterpreted abbreviation and the decision of a librarian572 it is however satisfactory to think that the love of petrarch was not platonic the happiness which he prayed to possess but once and for a moment was surely not of the mind573 and something so very real as a marriage project with one who has been idly called a shadowy nymph may be perhaps detected in at least six places of his own sonnets the love of petrarch was neither platonic nor poetical and if in one passage of his works he calls it amore veementeissimo ma unico ed onesto he confesses in a letter to a friend that it was guilty and perverse that it absorbed him quite and mastered his heart  in this case however he was perhaps alarmed for the culpability of his wishes for the abbé de sade himself who certainly would not have been scrupulously delicate if he could have proved his descent from petrarch as well as laura is forced into a stout defence of his virtuous grandmother as far as relates to the poet we have no security for the innocence except perhaps in the constancy of his pursuit he assures us in his epistle to posterity that when arrived at his fortieth year he not only had in horror but had lost all recollection and image of any irregularity but the birth of his natural daughter cannot be assigned earlier than his thirtyninth year and either the memory or the morality of the poet must have failed him when he forgot or was guilty of this slip574 the weakest argument for the purity of this love has been drawn from the permanence of its effects which survived the object of his passion the reflection of m de la bastie that virtue alone is capable of making impressions which death cannot efface is one of those which everybody applauds and everybody finds not to be true the moment he examines his own breast or the records of human feeling575 such apophthegms can do nothing for petrarch or for the cause of morality except with the very weak and the very young he that has made even a little progress beyond ignorance and pupilage cannot be edified with anything but truth what is called vindicating the honour of an individual or a nation is the most futile tedious and uninstructive of all writing although it will always meet with more applause than that sober criticism which is attributed to the malicious desire of reducing a great man to the common standard of humanity it is after all not unlikely that our historian was right in retaining his favourite hypothetic salvo which secures the author although it scarcely saves the honour of the still unknown mistress of petrarch576                                 9      they keep his dust in arqua where he died                                                     stanza xxxi line 1  petrarch retired to arquà immediately on his return from the unsuccessful attempt to visit urban v at rome in the year 1370 and with the exception of his celebrated visit to venice in company with francesco novello da carrara he appears to have passed the four last years of his life between that charming solitude and padua for four months previous to his death he was in a state of continual languor and in the morning of july the 19th in the year 1374 was found dead in his library chair with his head resting upon a book the chair is still shown amongst the precious relics of arquà which from the uninterrupted veneration that has been attached to everything relative to this great man from the moment of his death to the present hour have it may be hoped a better chance of authenticity than the shaksperian memorials of stratforduponavon  arquà for the last syllable is accented in pronunciation although the analogy of the english language has been observed in the verse is twelve miles from padua and about three miles on the right of the high road to rovigo in the bosom of the euganean hills after a walk of twenty minutes across a flat wellwooded meadow you come to a little blue lake clear but fathomless and to the foot of a succession of acclivities and hills clothed with vineyards and orchards rich with fir and pomegranate trees and every sunny fruit shrub from the banks of the lake the road winds into the hills and the church of arquà is soon seen between a cleft where two ridges slope towards each other and nearly enclose the village the houses are scattered at intervals on the steep sides of these summits and that of the poet is on the edge of a little knoll overlooking two descents and commanding a view not only of the glowing gardens in the dales immediately beneath but of the wide plains above whose low woods of mulberry and willow thickened into a dark mass by festoons of vines tall single cypresses and the spires of towns are seen in the distance which stretches to the mouths of the po and the shores of the adriatic the climate of these volcanic hills is warmer and the vintage begins a week sooner than in the plains of padua petrarch is laid for he cannot be said to be buried in a sarcophagus of red marble raised on four pilasters on an elevated base and preserved from an association with meaner tombs it stands conspicuously alone but will be soon overshadowed by four lately planted laurels petrarchs fountain for here everything is petrarchs springs and expands itself beneath an artificial arch a little below the church and abounds plentifully in the driest season with that soft water which was the ancient wealth of the euganean hills it would be more attractive were it not in some seasons beset with hornets and wasps no other coincidence could assimilate the tombs of petrarch and archilochus the revolutions of centuries have spared these sequestered valleys and the only violence which has been offered to the ashes of petrarch was prompted not by hate but veneration an attempt was made to rob the sarcophagus of its treasure and one of the arms was stolen by a florentine through a rent which is still visible the injury is not forgotten but has served to identify the poet with the country where he was born but where he would not live a peasant boy of arquà being asked who petrarch was replied that the people of the parsonage knew all about him but that he only knew that he was a florentine  mr forsyth577 was not quite correct in saying that petrarch never returned to tuscany after he had once quitted it when a boy it appears he did pass through florence on his way from parma to rome and on his return in the year 1350 and remained there long enough to form some acquaintance with its most distinguished inhabitants a florentine gentleman ashamed of the aversion of the poet for his native country was eager to point out this trivial error in our accomplished traveller whom he knew and respected for an extraordinary capacity extensive erudition and refined taste joined to that engaging simplicity of manners which has been so frequently recognised as the surest though it is certainly not an indispensable trait of superior genius  every footstep of lauras lover has been anxiously traced and recorded the house in which he lodged is shown in venice the inhabitants of arezzo in order to decide the ancient controversy between their city and the neighbouring ancisa where petrarch was carried when seven months old and remained until his seventh year have designated by a long inscription the spot where their great fellow citizen was born a tablet has been raised to him at parma in the chapel of st agatha at the cathedral because he was archdeacon of that society and was only snatched from his intended sepulture in their church by a foreign death another tablet with a bust has been erected to him at pavia on account of his having passed the autumn of 1368 in that city with his soninlaw brossano the political condition which has for ages precluded the italians from the criticism of the living has concentrated their attention to the illustration of the dead

in which boileau depreciates tasso may serve as well as any other specimen to justify the opinion given of the harmony of french verse      À malherbe à racan préfère théophile     et le clinquant du tasse à tout lor de virgile                                                       sat ix v 176  the biographer serassi578 out of tenderness to the reputation either of the italian or the french poet is eager to observe that the satirist recanted or explained away this censure and subsequently allowed the author of the jerusalem to be a genius sublime vast and happily born for the higher flights of poetry to this we will add that the recantation is far from satisfactory when we examine the whole anecdote as reported by olivet579 the sentence pronounced against him by bouhours580 is recorded only to the confusion of the critic whose palinodia the italian makes no effort to discover and would not perhaps accept as to the opposition which the jerusalem encountered from the cruscan academy who degraded tasso from all competition with ariosto below bojardo and pulci the disgrace of such opposition must also in some measure be laid to the charge of alfonso and the court of ferrara for leonard salviati the principal and nearly the sole origin of this attack was there can be no doubt581 influenced by a hope to acquire the favour of the house of este an object which he thought attainable by exalting the reputation of a native poet at the expense of a rival then a prisoner of state the hopes and efforts of salviati must serve to show the contemporary opinion as to the nature of the poets imprisonment and will fill up the measure of our indignation at the tyrant jailer582 in fact the antagonist of tasso was not disappointed in the reception given to his criticism he was called to the court of ferrara where having endeavoured to heighten his claims to favour by panegyrics on the family of his sovereign583 he was in turn abandoned and expired in neglected poverty the opposition of the cruscans was brought to a close in six years after the commencement of the controversy and if the academy owed its first renown to having almost opened with such a paradox584 it is probable that on the other hand the care of his reputation alleviated rather than aggravated the imprisonment of the injured poet the defence of his father and of himself for both were involved in the censure of salviati found employment for many of his solitary hours and the captive could have been but little embarrassed to reply to accusations where among other delinquencies he was charged with invidiously omitting in his comparison between france and italy to make any mention of the cupola of st maria del fiore at florence585 the late biographer of ariosto seems as if willing to renew the controversy by doubting the interpretation of tassos selfestimation586 related in serassis life of the poet but tiraboschi had before laid that rivalry at rest587 by showing that between ariosto and tasso it is not a question of comparison but of preference                                11      the lightning rent from ariostos bust       the iron crown of laurels mimicked leaves                                               stanza xli lines 1 and 2  before the remains of ariosto were removed from the benedictine church to the library of ferrara his bust which surmounted the tomb was struck by lightning and a crown of iron laurels melted away the event has been recorded by a writer of the last century588 the transfer of these sacred ashes on the 6th of june 1801 was one of the most brilliant spectacles of the shortlived italian republic and to consecrate the memory of the ceremony the once famous fallen intrepidi were revived and reformed into the ariostean academy the large public place through which the procession paraded was then for the first time called ariosto square the author of the orlando is jealously claimed as the homer not of italy but ferrara589 the mother of ariosto was of reggio and the house in which he was born is carefully distinguished by a tablet with these words qui nacque ludovico ariosto il giorno 8 di settembre dell anno 1474 but the ferrarese make light of the accident by which their poet was born abroad and claim him exclusively for their own they possess his bones they show his armchair and his inkstand and his autographs      hic illius anna     hic currus fuit  the house where he lived the room where he died are designated by his own replaced memorial590 and by a recent inscription the ferrarese are more jealous of their claims since the animosity of denina arising from a cause which their apologists mysteriously hint is not unknown to them ventured to degrade their soil and climate to a boeotian in capacity for all spiritual productions a quarto volume has been called forth by the detraction and this supplement to barottis memoirs of the illustrious ferarrese has been considered a triumphant reply to the quadro storico statistico dell alta italia                                12      for the true laurelwreath which glory weaves     is of the tree no bolt of thunder cleaves                                               stanza xli lines 4 and 5  the eagle the sea calf the laurel and the white vine591 were amongst the most approved preservatives against lightning jupiter chose the first augustus cæsar the second and tiberius never failed to wear a wreath of the third when the sky threatened a thunderstorm592 these superstitions may be received without a sneer in a country where the magical properties of the hazel twig have not lost all their credit and perhaps the reader may not be much surprised that a commentator on suetonius has taken upon himself gravely to disprove the imputed virtues of the crown of tiberius by mentioning that a few years before he wrote a laurel was actually struck by lightning at rome593                                13      know that the lightning sanctifies below                                                      stanza xli line 8  the curtian lake and the ruminal figtree in the forum having been touched by lightning were held sacred and the memory of the accident was preserved by a pateal or altar resembling the mouth of a well with a little chapel covering the cavity supposed to be made by the thunderbolt bodies scathed and persons struck dead were thought to be incorruptible594 and a stroke not fatal conferred perpetual dignity upon the man so distinguished by heaven595  those killed by lightning were wrapped in a white garment and buried where they fell the superstition was not confined to the worshippers of jupiter the lombards believed in the omens furnished by lightning and a christian priest confesses that by a diabolical skill in interpreting thunder a seer foretold to agilulf duke of turin an event which came to pass and gave him a queen and a crown596 there was however something equivocal in this sign which the ancient inhabitants of rome did not always consider propitious and as the fears are likely to last longer than the consolations of superstition it is not strange that the romans of the age of leo x should have been so much terrified at some misinterpreted storms as to require the exhortations of a scholar who arrayed all the learning on thunder and lightning to prove the omen favourable beginning with the flash which struck the walls of velitræ and including that which played upon a gate at florence and foretold the pontificate of one of its citizens597                                14      there

of the object with the description proves not only the correctness of the portrait but the peculiar turn of thought and if the term may be used the sexual imagination of the descriptive poet the same conclusion may be deduced from another hint in the same episode of musidora for thomsons notion of the privileges of favoured love must have been either very primitive or rather deficient in delicacy when he made his grateful nymph inform her discreet damon that in some happier moment he might perhaps be the companion of her bath      the time may come you need not fly  the reader will recollect the anecdote told in the life of dr johnson we will not leave the florentine gallery without a word on the whetter it seems strange that the character of that disputed statue should not be entirely decided at least in the mind of any one who has seen a sarcophagus in the vestibule of the basilica of st paul without the walls at rome where the whole group of the fable of marsyas is seen in tolerable preservation and the scythian slave whetting the knife is represented exactly in the same position as this celebrated masterpiece the slave is not naked but it is easier to get rid of this difficulty than to suppose the knife in the hand of the florentine statue an instrument for shaving which it must be if as lanzi supposes the man is no other than the barber of julius cæsar winckelmann illustrating a basrelief of the same subject follows the opinion of leonard agostini and his authority might have been thought conclusive even if the resemblance did not strike the most careless observer598 amongst the bronzes of the same princely collection is still to be seen the inscribed tablet copied and commented upon by mr gibbon599 our historian found some difficulties but did not desist from his illustration he might be vexed to hear that his criticism has been thrown away on an inscription now generally recognised to be a forgery                                15

alfieri is the great name of this age the italians without waiting for the hundred years consider him as a poet good in lawhis memory is the more dear to them because he is the bard of freedom and because as such his tragedies can receive no countenance from any of their sovereigns they are but very seldom and but very few of them allowed to be acted it was observed by cicero that nowhere were the true opinions and feelings of the romans so clearly shown as at the theatre600 in the autumn of 1816 a celebrated improvisatore exhibited his talents at the operahouse of milan the reading of the theses handed in for the subjects of his poetry was received by a very numerous audience for the most part in silence or with laughter but when the assistant unfolding one of the papers exclaimed the apotheosis of victor alfieri the whole theatre burst into a shout and the applause was continued for some moments the lot did not fall on alfieri and the signor sgricci had to pour forth his extemporary commonplaces on the bombardment of algiers the choice indeed is not left to accident quite so much as might be thought from a first view of the ceremony and the police not only takes care to look at the papers beforehand but in case of any prudential afterthought steps in to correct the blindness of chance the proposal for deifying alfieri was received with immediate enthusiasm the rather because it was conjectured there would be no opportunity of carrying it into effect                                17      here machiavellis earth returned to whence it rose                                                      stanza liv line 9  the affectation of simplicity in sepulchral inscriptions which so often leaves us uncertain whether the structure before us is an actual depository or a cenotaph or a simple memorial not of death but life has given to the tomb of machiavelli no information as to the place or time of the birth or death the age or parentage of the historian      tanto nomini nvllvm par elogivm           niccolavs machiavelli  there seems at least no reason why the name should not have been put above the sentence which alludes to it  it will readily be imagined that the prejudices which have passed the name of machiavelli into an epithet proverbial of iniquity exist no longer at florence his memory was persecuted as his life had been for an attachment to liberty incompatible with the new system of despotism which succeeded the fall of the free governments of italy he was put to the torture for being a libertine that is for wishing to restore the republic of florence and such are the undying efforts of those who are interested in the perversion not only of the nature of actions but the meaning of words that what was once patriotism has by degrees come to signify debauch we have ourselves outlived the old meaning of liberality which is now another word for treason in one country and for infatuation in all it seems to have been a strange mistake to accuse the author of the prince as being a pander to tyranny and to think that the inquisition would condemn his work for such a delinquency the fact is that machiavelli as is usual with those against whom no crime can be proved was suspected of and charged with atheism and the first and last most violent opposers of the prince were both jesuits one of whom persuaded the inquisition benchè fosse tardo to prohibit the treatise and the other qualified the secretary of the florentine republic as no better than a fool the father possevin was proved never to have read the book and the father lucchesini not to have understood it it is clear however that such critics must have objected not to the slavery of the doctrines but to the supposed tendency of a lesson which shows how distinct are the interests of a monarch from the happiness of mankind the jesuits are reestablished in italy and the last chapter of the prince may again call forth a particular refutation from those who are employed once more in moulding the minds of the rising generation so as to receive the impressions of despotism the chapter xxvi bears for title esortazione a liberare litalia da barbari and concludes with a libertine excitement to the future redemption of italy non si deve adunque lasciar passare questa occasione acciocchè la italia vegga dopo tanto tempo apparire un suo redentore nè posso esprimere con quale amore ei fusse ricevuto in tutte quelle provincie che hanno patito per queste illuvioni esterne con qual sete di vendetta con che ostinata fede con que pietà con

18      ungrateful florence dante sleeps afar                                                     stanza lvii line 1  dante was born in florence in the year 1261 he fought in two battles was fourteen times ambassador and once prior of the republic when the party of charles of anjou triumphed over the bianchi he was absent on an embassy to pope boniface viii and was condemned to two years banishment and to a fine of 8000 lire on the nonpayment of which he was further punished by the sequestration of all his property the republic however was not content with this satisfaction for in 1772 was discovered in the archives at florence a sentence in which dante is the eleventh of a list of fifteen condemned in 1302 to be burnt alive talis perveniens igne comburatur sic quod moriatur the pretext for this judgment was a proof of unfair barter extortions and illicit gains baracteriarum iniquarum extorsionum et illicitorum lucrorum602 and with such an accusation it is not strange that dante should have always protested his innocence and the injustice of his fellowcitizens his appeal to florence was accompanied by another to the emperor henry and the death of that sovereign in 1313 was the signal for a sentence of irrevocable banishment he had before lingered near tuscany with hopes of recall then travelled into the north of italy where verona had to boast of his longest residence and he finally settled at ravenna which was his ordinary but not constant abode until his death the refusal of the venetians to grant him a public audience on the part of guido novello da polenta his protector is said to have been the principal cause of this event which happened in 1321 he was buried in sacra minorum æde at ravenna in a handsome tomb which was erected by guido restored by bernardo bembo in 1483 prætor for that republic which had refused to hear him again restored by cardinal corsi in 1692 and replaced by a more magnificent sepulchre constructed in 1780 at the expense of the cardinal luigi valenti gonzaga the offence or misfortune of dante was an attachment to a defeated party and as his least favourable biographers allege against him too great a freedom of speech and haughtiness of manner but the next age paid honours almost divine to the exile the florentines having in vain and frequently attempted to recover his body crowned his image in a church603 and his picture is still one of the idols of their cathedral they struck medals they raised statues to him the cities of italy not being able to dispute about his own birth contended for that of his great poem and the florentines thought it for their honour to prove that he had finished the seventh canto before they drove him from his native city fiftyone years after his death they endowed a professorial chair for the expounding of his verses and boccaccio was appointed to this patriotic employment the example was imitated by bologna and pisa and the commentators if they performed but little service to literature augmented the veneration which beheld a sacred or moral allegory in all the images of his mystic muse his birth and his infancy were discovered to have been distinguished above those of ordinary men the author of the decameron his earliest biographer relates that his mother was warned in a dream of the importance of her pregnancy and it was found by others that at ten years of age he had manifested his precocious passion for that wisdom or theology which under the name of beatrice had been mistaken for a substantial mistress when the divine comedy had been recognised as a mere mortal production and at the distance of two centuries when criticism and competition had sobered the judgment of the italians dante was seriously declared superior to homer604 and though the preference appeared to some casuists an heretical blasphemy worthy of the flames the contest was vigorously maintained for nearly fifty years in later times it was made a question which of the lords of verona could boast of having patronised him605 and the jealous scepticism of one writer would not allow ravenna the undoubted possession of his bones even the critical tiraboschi was inclined to believe that the poet had foreseen and foretold one of the discoveries of galileolike the great originals of other nations his popularity has not always maintained the same level the last age seemed inclined to undervalue him as a model and a study and bettinelli one day rebuked his pupil monti for poring over the harsh and obsolete extravagances of the commedia the present generation having recovered from the gallic idolatries of cesarotti has returned to the ancient worship and the danteggiare of the northern italians is thought even indiscreet by the more moderate tuscans  there is still much curious information relative to the life and writings of this great poet which has not as yet been collected even by the italians but the celebrated ugo foscolo meditates to supply this defect and it is not to be regretted that this national work has been reserved for one so devoted to his country and the cause of truth                                19      like scipio buried by the

not buried at liternum whither he had retired to voluntary banishment this tomb was near the seashore and the story of an inscription upon it ingrata patria having given a name to a modern tower is if

chains the avvogadori proposed to behead him but the supreme tribunal was content with the sentence of imprisonment whilst pisani was suffering this unmerited disgrace chioza in the vicinity of the capital608 was by the assistance of the signor of padua delivered into the hands of pietro doria at the intelligence of that disaster the great bell of st marks tower tolled to arms and the people and the soldiery of the galleys were summoned to the repulse of the approaching enemy but they protested they would not move a step unless pisani were liberated and placed at their head the great council

reposed in his efforts and who implored him to forget the indignities he had endured in her service i have submitted replied the magnanimous republican i have submitted to your deliberations without

in conjunction with those of carlo zeno the venetians soon recovered the ascendancy over their maritime rivals  the italian communities were no less unjust to their citizens than the greek republics liberty both with the one and the other seems to have been a national not an individual object and notwithstanding the boasted equality before the laws which an ancient greek writer609 considered the great distinctive mark between his countrymen and the barbarians the mutual rights of fellow citizens seem never to have been the principal scope of the old democracies the world may have not yet seen an essay by the author of the italian republics in which the distinction between the liberty of former states and the signification attached to that word by the happier constitution of england is ingeniously developed the italians however when they had ceased to be free still looked back with a sigh upon those times of turbulence when every citizen might rise to a share of sovereign power and have never been taught fully to appreciate the repose of a monarchy sperone speroni when francis maria ii duke of rovere proposed the question which was preferable the republic or the principalitythe perfect and not durable or the less perfect and not so liable to change replied that our happiness is to be measured by its quality not by its duration and that he preferred to live for one day like a man than for a hundred years like a brute a stock or a stone this was thought and called a magnificent answer down to the last days of italian servitude610                                20                                and the crown     which petrarchs laureate brow supremely wore     upon a far and foreign soil had grown                                          stanza lvii lines 6 7 and 8  the florentines did not take the opportunity of petrarchs short visit to their city in 1350 to revoke the decree which confiscated the property of his father who had been banished shortly after the exile of dante his crown did not dazzle them but when in the next year they were in want of his assistance in the formation of their university they repented of their injustice and boccaccio was sent to padua to entreat the laureate to conclude his wanderings in the bosom of his native country where he might finish his immortal africa and enjoy with his recovered possessions the esteem of all classes of his fellow citizens they gave him the option of the book and the science he might condescend to expound they called him the glory of his country who was dear and who would be dearer to them and they added that if there was anything unpleasing in their letter he ought to return amongst them were it only to correct their style611 petrarch seemed at first to listen to the flattery and to the entreaties of his friend but he did not return to florence and preferred a pilgrimage to the tomb of laura and the shades of vaucluse                                21      boccaccio to his parent earth bequeathed       his dust                                             stanza lviii lines 1 and 2  boccaccio was buried in the church of st michael and st james at certaldo a small town in the valdelsa which was by some supposed the place of his birth there he passed the latter part of his life in a course of laborious study which shortened his existence and there might his ashes have been secure if not of honour at least of repose but the hyena bigots of certaldo tore up the tombstone of boccaccio and ejected it from the holy precincts of st michael and st james the occasion and it may be hoped the excuse of this ejectment was the making of a new floor for the church but the fact is that the tombstone was taken up and thrown aside at the bottom of the building ignorance may share the sin with bigotry it would be painful to relate such an exception to the devotion of the italians for their great names could it not be accompanied by a trait more honourably conformable to the general character of the nation the principal person of the district the last branch of the house of medicis afforded that protection to the memory of the insulted dead which her best ancestors had dispensed upon all contemporary merit the marchioness lenzoni rescued the tombstone of boccaccio from the neglect in which it had some time lain and found for it an honourable elevation in her own mansion she has done more the house in which the poet lived has been as little respected as his tomb and is falling to ruin over the head of one indifferent to the name of its former tenant it consists of two or three little chambers and a low tower on which cosmo ii affixed an inscription this house she has taken measures to purchase and proposes to devote to it that care and consideration which are attached to the cradle and to the roof of genius  this is not the place to undertake the defence of boccaccio but the man who exhausted his little patrimony in the acquirement of learning who was amongst the first if not the first to allure the science and the poetry of greece to the bosom of italywho not only invented a new style but founded or certainly fixed a new language who besides the esteem of every polite court of europe was thought worthy of employment by the predominant republic of his own country and what is more of the friendship of petrarch who lived the life of a philosopher and a freeman and who died in the pursuit of knowledgesuch a man might have found more consideration than he has met with from the priest of certaldo and from a late english traveller who strikes off his portrait as an odious contemptible licentious writer whose impure remains should be suffered to rot without a record612 that english traveller unfortunately for those who have to deplore the loss of a very amiable person is beyond all criticism but the mortality which did not protect boccaccio from mr eustace must not defend mr eustace from the impartial judgment of his successors death may canonise his virtues not his errors and it may be modestly pronounced that he transgressed not only as an author but as a man when he evoked the shade of boccaccio in company with that of aretine amidst the sepulchres of santa croce merely to dismiss it with indignity as far as respects        il flagello de principi     il divin pietro aretino  it is of little import what censure is passed upon a coxcomb who owes his present existence to the above burlesque character given to him by the poet whose amber has preserved many other grubs and worms but to classify boccaccio with such a person and to excommunicate his very ashes must of itself make us doubt of the qualification of the classical tourist for writing upon italian or indeed upon any other literature for ignorance on one point may incapacitate an author merely for that particular topic but subjection to a professional prejudice must render him an unsafe director on all occasions any perversion and injustice may be made what is vulgarly called a case of conscience and this poor excuse is all that can be offered for the priest of certaldo or the author of the classical tour it would have answered the purpose to confine the censure to the novels of boccaccio and gratitude to that source which supplied the muse of dryden with her last and most harmonious numbers might perhaps have restricted that censure to the objectionable qualities of the hundred tales at any rate the repentance of boccaccio might have arrested his exhumation and it should have been recollected and told that in his old age he wrote a letter entreating his friend to discourage the reading of the decameron for the sake of modesty and for the sake of the author who would not have an apologist always at hand to state in his excuse that he wrote it when young and at the command of his superiors613 it is neither the licentiousness of the writer nor the evil propensities of the reader which have given to the decameron alone of all the works of boccaccio a perpetual popularity the establishment of a new and delightful dialect conferred an immortality on the works in which it was first fixed the sonnets of petrarch were for the same reason fated to survive his selfadmired africa the favourite of kings the invariable traits of nature and feeling with which the novels as well as the verses abound have doubtless been the chief source of the foreign celebrity of both authors but boccaccio as a man is no more to be estimated by that work than petrarch is to be regarded in no other light than as the lover of laura even however had the father of the tuscan prose been known only as the author of the decameron a considerate writer would have been cautious to pronounce a sentence irreconcilable with the unerring voice of many ages and nations an irrevocable value has never been stamped upon any work solely recommended by impurity  the true source of the outcry against boccaccio which began at a very early period was the choice of his scandalous personages in the cloisters as well as the courts but the princes only laughed at the gallant adventures so unjustly charged upon queen theodelinda whilst the priesthood cried shame upon the debauches drawn from the convent and the hermitage and most probably for the opposite reason namely that the picture was faithful to the life two of the novels are allowed to be facts usefully turned into tales to deride the canonisation of rogues and laymen ser ciappelletto and marcellinus are cited with applause even by the decent muratori614 the great arnaud as he is quoted in bayle states that a new edition of the novels was proposed of which the expurgation consisted in omitting the words monk and nun and tacking the immoralities to other names the literary history of italy particularises no such edition but it was not long before the whole of europe had but one opinion of the decameron and the absolution of the author seems to have been a point settled at least a hundred years ago on se feroit siffler si l on prétendoit convaincre boccace de navoir pas été honnête homme puis quil a fait le décameron so said one of the best men and perhaps the best critic that ever livedthe very martyr to impartiality615 but as this information that in the beginning of the last century one would have been hooted at for pretending that boccaccio was not a good man may seem to come from one of those enemies who are to be suspected even when they make us a present of truth a more acceptable contrast with the proscription of the body soul and muse of boccaccio may be found in a few words from the virtuous the patriotic contemporary who thought one of the tales of this impure writer worthy a latin version from his own pen i have remarked elsewhere says petrarch writing to boccaccio that the book itself has been worried by certain dogs but stoutly defended by your staff and voice nor was i astonished for i have had proof of the vigour of your mind and i know you have fallen on that unaccommodating incapable race of mortals who whatever they either like not or know not or cannot do are sure to reprehend in others and on those occasions only put on a show of learning and eloquence but otherwise are entirely dumb616  it is satisfactory to find that all the priesthood do not resemble those of certaldo and that one of them who did not possess the bones of boccaccio would not lose the opportunity of raising a cenotaph to his memory bevius canon of padua at the beginning of the sixteenth century erected at arquà opposite to the tomb of the laureate a tablet in which he associated boccaccio to the equal honours of dante and of petrarch                                22      what is her pyramid of precious stones                                                       stanza lx line 1  our veneration for the medici begins with cosmo and expires with his grandson that stream is pure only at the source and it is in search of some memorial of the virtuous republicans of the family that we visit the church of st lorenzo at florence the tawdry glaring unfinished chapel in that church designed for the mausoleum of the dukes of tuscany set round with crowns and coffins gives birth to no emotions but those of contempt for the lavish vanity of a race of despots whilst the pavement slab simply inscribed to the father of his country reconciles us to the name of medici617 it was very natural for corinna618 to suppose that the statue raised to the duke of urbino in the capella de depositi was intended for his great namesake but the magnificent lorenzo is only the sharer of a coffin half hidden in a niche of the sacristy the decay of tuscany dates from the sovereignty of the medici of the sepulchral peace which succeeded to the establishment of the reigning families in italy our own sidney has given us a glowing but a faithful picture notwithstanding all the seditions of florence and other cities of tuscany the horrid factions of guelphs and ghibelins neri and bianchi nobles and commons they continued populous strong and exceeding rich but in the space of less than a hundred and fifty years the peaceable reign of the medices is thought to have destroyed nine parts in ten of the people of that province amongst other things it is remarkable that when philip ii of spain gave sienna to the duke of florence his ambassador then at rome sent him word that he had given away more than 650000 subjects and it is not believed there are now 20000 souls inhabiting that city and territory pisa pistoia arezzo cortona and other towns that were then good and populous are in the like proportion diminished and florence more than any when that city had been long troubled with seditions tumults and wars for the most part unprosperous they still retained such strength that when charles viii of france being admitted as a friend with his whole army which soon after conquered the kingdom of naples thought to master them the people taking arms struck such a terror into him that he was glad to depart upon such conditions as they thought fit to impose machiavel reports that in that time florence alone with the val darno a small territory belonging to that city could in a few hours by the sound of a bell bring together 135000 wellarmed men whereas now that city with all the others in that province are brought to such despicable weakness emptiness poverty and baseness that they can neither resist the oppressions of their own prince nor defend him or themselves if they were assaulted by a foreign enemy the people are dispersed or destroyed and the best families sent to seek habitations in venice genoa rome naples and lucca this is not the effect of war or pestilence they enjoy a perfect peace and suffer no other plague than the government they are under619 from the usurper cosmo down to the imbecile gaston we look in vain for any of those unmixed qualities which should raise a patriot to the command of his fellowcitizens the grand dukes and particularly the third cosmo had operated so entire a change in the tuscan character that the candid florentines in excuse for some imperfections in the philanthropic system of leopold are obliged to confess that the sovereign was the only liberal man in his dominions yet that excellent prince himself had no other notion of a national assembly than of a body to represent the wants and wishes not the will of the people                                23      an earthquake reeled unheededly away                                                    stanza lxiii line 5  and such was their mutual animosity so intent were they upon the battle that the earthquake which overthrew in great part many of the cities of italy which turned the course of rapid streams poured back the sea upon the rivers and tore down the very mountains was not felt by one of the combatants620 such is the description of livy it may be doubted whether modern tactics would admit of such an abstraction  the site of the battle of thrasimene is not to be mistaken the traveller from the village under cortona to casa di piano the next stage on the way to rome has for the first two or three miles around him but more particularly to the right that flat land which hannibal laid waste in order to induce the consul flaminius to move from arezzo on his left and in front of him is a ridge of hills bending down towards the lake of thrasimene called by livy montes cortonenses and now named the gualandra these hills he approaches at ossaja a village which the itineraries pretend to have been so denominated from the bones found there but there have been no bones found there and the battle was fought on the other side of the hill from ossaja the road begins to rise a little but does not pass into the roots of the mountains until the sixtyseventh milestone from florence the ascent thence is not steep but perpetual and continues for twenty minutes the lake is soon seen below on the right with borghetto a round tower close upon the water and the undulating hills partially covered with wood amongst which the road winds sink by degrees into the marshes near to this tower lower than the road down to the right amidst these woody hillocks hannibal placed his horse621 in the jaws of or rather above the pass which was between the lake and the present road and most probably close to borghetto just under the lowest of the tumuli622 on a summit to the left above the road is an old circular ruin which the peasants call the tower of hannibal the carthaginian arrived at the highest point of the road the traveller has a partial view of the fatal plain which opens fully upon him as he descends the gualandra he soon finds himself in a vale enclosed to the left and in front and behind him by the gualandra hills bending round in a segment larger than a semicircle and running down at each end to the lake which obliques to the right and forms the chord of this mountain arc the position cannot be guessed at from the plains of cortona nor appears to be so completely enclosed unless to one who is fairly within the hills it then indeed appears a place made as it were on purpose for a snare locus insidiis natus borghetto is then found to stand in a narrow marshy pass close to the hill and to the lake whilst there is no other outlet at the opposite turn of the mountains than through the little town of passignano which is pushed into the water by the foot of a high rocky acclivity there is a woody eminence branching down from the mountains into the upper end of the plain nearer to the side of passignano and on this stands a white village called torre polybius seems to allude to this eminence as the one on which hannibal encamped and drew out his heavyarmed africans and spaniards in a conspicuous position623 from this spot he despatched his balearic and lightarmed troops round through the gualandra heights to the right so as to arrive unseen and form an ambush amongst the broken acclivities which the road now passes and to be ready to act upon the left flank and above the enemy whilst the horse shut up the pass behind flaminius came to the lake near borghetto at sunset and without sending any spies before him marched through the pass the next morning before the day had quite broken so that he perceived nothing of the horse and light troops above and about him and saw only the heavyarmed carthaginians in front on the hill of torre the consul began to draw out his army in the flat and in the mean time the horse in ambush occupied the pass behind him at borghetto thus the romans were completely enclosed having the lake on the right the main army on the hill of torre in front the gualandra hills filled with the lightarmed on their left flank and being prevented from receding by the cavalry who the further they advanced stopped up all the outlets in the rear a fog rising from the lake now spread itself over the army of the consul but the high lands were in the sunshine and all the different corps in ambush looked towards the hill of torre for the order of attack hannibal gave the signal and moved down from his post on the height at the same moment all his troops on the eminences behind and in the flank of flaminius rushed forwards as it were with one accord into the plain the romans who were forming their array in the mist suddenly heard the shouts of the enemy amongst them on every side and before they could fall into their ranks or draw their swords or see by whom they were attacked felt at once that they were surrounded and lost there are two little rivulets which run from the gualandra into the lake the traveller crosses the first of these at about a mile after he comes into the plain and this divides the tuscan from the papal territories the second about a quarter of a mile further on is called the bloody rivulet and the peasants point out an open spot to the left between the sanguinetto and the hills which they say was the principal scene of slaughter the other part of the plain is covered with thickset olivetrees in corn grounds and is nowhere quite level except near the edge of the lake it is indeed most probable that the battle was fought near this end of the valley for the six thousand romans who at the beginning of the action broke through the enemy escaped to the summit of an eminence which must have been in this quarter otherwise they would have had to traverse the whole plain and to pierce through the main army of hannibal  the romans fought desperately for three hours but the death of flaminius was the signal for a general dispersion the carthaginian horse then burst in upon the fugitives and the lake the marsh about borghetto but chiefly the plain of the sanguinetto and the passes of the gualandra were strewed with dead near some old walls on a bleak ridge to the left above the rivulet many human bones have been repeatedly found and this has confirmed the pretensions and the name of the stream of blood  every district of italy has its hero in the north some painter is the usual genius of the place and the foreign julio romano more than divides mantua with her native virgil624 to the south we hear of roman names near thrasimene tradition is still faithful to the fame of an enemy and hannibal the carthaginian is the only ancient name remembered on the banks of the perugian lake flaminius is unknown but the postilions on that road have been taught to show the very spot where il console romano was slain of all who fought and fell in the battle of thrasimene the historian himself has besides the generals and maharbal preserved indeed only a single name you overtake the carthaginian again on the same road to rome the antiquary that is the hostler of the posthouse at spoleto tells you that his town repulsed the victorious enemy and shows you the gate still called porta di annibale it is hardly worth while to remark that a french travel writer well known by the name of the president dupaty saw thrasimene in the lake of bolsena which lay conveniently on his way from sienna to rome                                24      and thou dread statue still existent in       the austerest form of naked majesty                                           stanza lxxxvii lines 1 and 2  the projected division of the spada pompey has already been recorded by the historian of the decline and fall of the roman empire mr gibbon found it in the memorials of flaminius vacca and it may be added to his mention of it that pope julius iii gave the contending owners five hundred crowns for the statue and presented it to cardinal capo di ferro who had prevented the judgment of solomon from being executed upon the image in a more civilised age this statue was exposed to an actual operation for the french who acted the brutus of voltaire in the coliseum resolved that their cæsar should fall at the base of that pompey which was supposed to have been sprinkled with the blood of the original dictator the ninefoot hero was therefore removed to the arena of the amphitheatre and to facilitate its transport suffered the temporary amputation of its right arm the republican tragedians had to plead that the arm was a restoration but their accusers do not believe that the integrity of the statue would have protected it the love of finding every coincidence has discovered the true cæsarian ichor in a stain near the right knee but colder criticism has rejected not only the blood but the portrait and assigned the globe of power rather to the first of the emperors than to the last of the republican masters of rome winckelmann625 is loth to allow an heroic statue of a roman citizen but the grimani agrippa a contemporary almost is heroic and naked roman figures were only very rare not absolutely forbidden the face accords much better with the hominem integrum et castum et gravem626 than with any of the busts of augustus and is too stern for him who was beautiful says suetonius at all periods of his life the pretended likeness to alexander the great cannot be discerned but the traits resemble the medal of pompey627 the objectionable globe may not have been an illapplied flattery to him who found asia minor the boundary and left it the centre of the roman empire it seems that winckelmann has made a mistake in thinking that no proof of the identity of this statue with that which received the bloody sacrifice can be derived from the spot where it was discovered628 flaminius vacca says sotto una cantina and this cantina is known to have been in the vicolo de leutari near the cancellaria a position corresponding exactly to that of the janus before the basilica of pompeys theatre to which augustus transferred the statue after the curia was either burnt or taken down629 part of the pompeian shade630 the portico existed in the beginning of the xvth century and the atrium was still called satrum so says blondus631 at all events so imposing is the stern majesty of the statue and so memorable is the story that the play of the imagination leaves no room for the exercise of the judgment and the fiction if a fiction it is operates on the spectator with an effect not less powerful than truth                                25      and thou the thunderstricken nurse of rome                                                 stanza lxxxviii line 1  ancient rome like modern sienna abounded most probably with images of the fostermother of her founder but there were two shewolves of whom history makes particular mention one of these of brass in ancient work was seen by dionysius632 at the temple of romulus under the palatine and is universally believed to be that mentioned by the latin historian as having been made from the money collected by a fine on usurers and as standing under the ruminal figtree633 the other was that which cicero634 has celebrated both in prose and verse and which the historian dion also records as having suffered the same accident as is alluded to by the orator635 the question agitated by the antiquaries is whether the wolf now in the conservators palace is that of livy and dionysius or that of cicero or whether it is neither one nor the other the earlier writers differ as much as the moderns lucius faunus636 says that it is the one alluded to by both which is impossible and also by virgil which may be fulvius ursinus637 calls it the wolf of dionysius and marlianus638 talks of it as the one mentioned by cicero to him rycquius tremblingly assents639 nardini is inclined to suppose it may be one of the many wolves preserved in ancient rome but of the two rather bends to the ciceronian statue640 montfaucon641 mentions it as a point without doubt of the latter writers the decisive winckelmann642 proclaims it as having been found at the church of saint theodore where or near where was the temple of romulus and consequently makes it the wolf of dionysius his authority is lucius faunus who however only says that it was placed not found at the ficus ruminalis by the comitium by which he does not seem to allude to the church of saint theodore rycquius was the first to make the mistake and winckelmann followed rycquius  flaminius vacca tells quite a different story and says he had heard the wolf with the twins was found643 near the arch of septimius severus the commentator on winckelmann is of the same opinion with that learned person and is incensed at nardini for not having remarked that cicero in speaking of the wolf struck with lightning in the capitol makes use of the past tense but with the abates leave nardini does not positively assert the statue to be that mentioned by cicero and if he had the assumption would not perhaps have been so exceedingly indiscreet the abate himself is obliged to own that there are marks very like the scathing of lightning in the hinder legs of the present wolf and to get rid of this adds that the wolf seen by dionysius might have been also struck by lightning or otherwise injured  let us examine the subject by a reference to the words of cicero the orator in two places seems to particularise the romulus and the remus especially the first which his audience remembered to have been in the capitol as being struck with lightning in his verses he records that the twins and wolf both fell and that the latter left behind the marks of her feet cicero does not say that the wolf was consumed and dion only mentions that it fell down without alluding as the abate has made him to the force of the blow or the firmness with which it had been fixed the whole strength therefore of the abates argument hangs upon the past tense which however may be somewhat diminished by remarking that the phrase only shows that the statue was not then standing in its former position winckelmann has observed that the present twins are modern and it is equally clear that there are marks of gilding on the wolf which might therefore be supposed to make part of the ancient group it is known that the sacred images of the capitol were not destroyed when injured by time or accident but were put into certain underground depositories called favissæ644 it may be thought possible that the wolf had been so deposited and had been replaced in some conspicuous situation when the capitol was rebuilt by vespasian rycquius without mentioning his authority tells that it was transferred from the comitium to the lateran and thence brought to the capitol if it was found near the arch of severus it may have been one of the images which orosius645 says was thrown down in the forum by lightning when alaric took the city that it is of very high antiquity the workmanship is a decisive proof and that circumstance induced winckelmann to believe it the wolf of dionysius the capitoline wolf however may have been of the same early date as that at the temple of romulus lactantius646 asserts that in his time the romans worshipped a wolf and it is known that the lupercalia held out to a very late period647 after every other observance of the ancient superstition had totally expired this may account for the preservation of the ancient image longer than the other early symbols of paganism  it may be permitted however to remark that the wolf was a roman symbol but that the worship of that symbol is an inference drawn by the zeal of lactantius the early christian writers are not to be trusted in the charges which they make against the pagans eusebius accused the romans to their faces of worshipping simon magus and raising a statue to him in the island of the tyber the romans had probably never heard of such a person before who came however to play a considerable though scandalous part in the church history and has left several tokens of his aërial combat with st peter at rome notwithstanding that an inscription found in this very island of the tyber showed the simon magus of eusebius to be a certain indigenal god called semo sangus or fidius648  even when the worship of the founder of rome had been abandoned it was thought expedient to humour the habits of the good matrons of the city by sending them with their sick infants to the church of saint theodore as they had before carried them to the temple of romulus649 the practice is continued to this day and the site of the above church seems to be thereby identified with that of the temple so that if the wolf had been really found there as winckelmann says there would be no doubt of the present statue being that seen by dionysius650 but faunus in saying that it was at the ficus ruminalis by the comitium is only talking of its ancient position as recorded by pliny and even if he had been remarking where it was found would not have alluded to the church of saint theodore but to a very different place near which it was then thought the ficus ruminalis had been and also the comitium that is the three columns by the church of santa maria liberatrice at the corner of the palatine looking on the forum  it is in fact a mere conjecture where the image was actually dug up and perhaps on the whole the marks of the gilding and of the lightning are a better argument in favour of its being the ciceronian wolf than any that can be adduced for the contrary opinion at any rate it is reasonably selected in the text of the poem as one of the most interesting relics of the ancient city651 and is certainly the figure if not the very animal to which virgil alludes in his beautiful verses              geminos huic ubera circum     ludere pendentes pueros et lambere matrem     impavidos illam tereti cervice reflexam     mulcere alternos et corpora fingere linguâ652                                26                   for the romans mind     was modelled in a less terrestrial mould                                                stanza xc lines 3 and 4  it is possible to be a very great man and to be still very inferior to julius cæsar the most complete character so lord bacon thought of all antiquity nature seems incapable of such extraordinary combinations as composed his versatile capacity which was the wonder even of the romans themselves the first generalthe only triumphant politicianinferior to none in eloquencecomparable to any in the attainments of wisdom in an age made up of the greatest commanders statesmen orators and philosophers that ever appeared in the worldan author who composed a perfect specimen of military annals in his travelling carriageat one time in a controversy with cato at another writing a treatise on punning and collecting a set of good sayingsfighting and making love at the same moment and willing to abandon both his empire and his mistress for a sight of the fountains of the nile such did julius cæsar appear to his contemporaries and to those of the subsequent ages who were the most inclined to deplore and execrate his fatal genius  but we must not be so much dazzled with his surpassing glory or with his magnanimous his amiable qualities as to forget the decision of his impartial countrymen                          he was justly slain653                                27      egeria sweet creation of some heart       which found no mortal restingplace so fair       as thine ideal breast                                           stanza cxv lines 1 2 and 3  the respectable authority of flaminius vacca would incline us to believe in the claims of the egerian grotto654 he assures us that he saw an inscription in the pavement stating that the fountain was that of egeria dedicated to the nymphs the inscription is not there at this day but montfaucon quotes two lines655 of ovid fast iii 275 276 from a stone in the villa giustiniani which he seems to think had been brought from the same grotto  this grotto and valley were formerly frequented in summer and particularly the first sunday in may by the modern romans who attached a salubrious quality to the fountain which trickles from an orifice at the bottom of the vault and overflowing the little pools creeps down the matted grass into the brook below the brook is the ovidian almo whose name and qualities are lost in the modern aquataccio the valley itself is called valle di caffarelli from the dukes of that name who made over their fountain to the pallavicini with sixty rubbia of adjoining land  there can be little doubt that this long dell is the egerian valley of juvenal and the pausing place of umbritius notwithstanding the generality of his commentators have supposed the descent of the satirist and his friend to have been into the arician grove where the nymph met hippolitus and where she was more peculiarly worshipped  the step from the porta capena to the alban hill fifteen miles distant would be too considerable unless we were to believe in the wild conjecture of vossius who makes that gate travel from its present station where he pretends it was during the reign of the kings as far as the arician grove and then makes it recede to its old site with the shrinking city656 the tufo or pumice which the poet prefers to marble is the substance composing the bank in which the grotto is sunk  the modern topographers657 find in the grotto the statue of the nymph and nine niches for the muses and a late traveller658 has discovered that the cave is restored to that simplicity which the poet regretted had been exchanged for injudicious ornament but the headless statue is palpably rather a male than a nymph and has none of the attributes ascribed to it at present visible the nine muses could hardly have stood in six niches and juvenal certainly does not allude to any individual cave659 nothing can be collected from the satirist but that somewhere near the porta capena was a spot in which it was supposed numa held nightly consultations with his nymph and where there was a grove and a sacred fountain and fanes once consecrated to the muses and that from this spot there was a descent into the valley of egeria where were several artificial caves it is clear that the statues of the muses made no part of the decoration which the satirist thought misplaced in these caves for he expressly assigns other fanes delubra to these divinities above the valley and moreover tells us that they had been ejected to make room for the jews in fact the little temple now called that of bacchus was formerly thought to belong to the muses and nardini660 places them in a poplar grove which was in his time above the valley  it is probable from the inscription and position that the cave now shown may be one of the artificial caverns of which indeed there is another a little way higher up the valley under a tuft of alder bushes but a single grotto of egeria is a mere modern invention grafted upon the application of the epithet egerian to these nymphea in general and which might send us to look for the haunts of numa upon the banks of the thames  our english juvenal was not seduced into mistranslation by his acquaintance with pope he carefully preserves the correct plural      thence slowly winding down the vale we view     the egerian grots oh how unlike the true  the valley abounds with springs661 and over these springs which the muses might haunt from their neighbouring groves egeria presided hence she was said to supply them with water and she was the nymph of the grottos through which the fountains were taught to flow  the whole of the monuments in the vicinity of the egerian valley have received names at will which have been changed at will venuti662 owns he can see no traces of the temples of jove saturn juno venus and diana which nardini found or hoped to find the mutatorium of caracallas circus the temple of honour and virtue the temple of bacchus and above all the temple of the god rediculus are the antiquaries despair  the circus of caracalla depends on a medal of that emperor cited by fulvius ursinus of which the reverse shows a circus supposed however by some to represent the circus maximus it gives a very good idea of that place of exercise the soil has been but little raised if we may judge from the small cellular structure at the end of the spina which was probably the chapel of the god consus this cell is half beneath the soil as it must have been in the circus itself for dionysius663 could not be persuaded to believe that this divinity was the roman neptune because his altar was underground                                28                                    great nemesis     here where the ancient paid thee homage long                                            stanza cxxxii lines 2 and 3  we read in suetonius that augustus from a warning received in a dream664 counterfeited once a year the beggar sitting before the gate of his palace with his hand hollowed and stretched out for charity a statue formerly in the villa borghese and which should be now at paris represents the emperor in that posture of supplication the object of that selfdegradation was the appeasement of nemesis the perpetual attendant on good fortune of whose power the roman conquerors were also reminded by certain symbols attached to their cars of triumph the symbols were the whip and the crotalo which were discovered in the nemesis of the vatican the attitude of beggary made the above statue pass for that of belisarius and until the criticism of winckelmann665 had rectified the mistake one fiction was called in to support another it was the same fear of the sudden termination of prosperity that made amasis king of egypt warn his friend polycrates of samos that the gods loved those whose lives were chequered with good and evil fortunes nemesis was supposed to lie in wait particularly for the prudent that is for those whose caution rendered them accessible only to mere accidents and her first altar was raised on the banks of the phrygian Æsepus by adrastus probably the prince of that name who killed the son of croesus by mistake hence the goddess was called adrastea666  the roman nemesis was sacred and august there was a temple to her in the palatine under the name of rhamnusia667 so great indeed was the propensity of the ancients to trust to the revolution of events and to believe in the divinity of fortune that in the same palatine there was a temple to the fortune of the day668 this is the last superstition which retains its hold over the human heart and from concentrating in one object the credulity so natural to man has always appeared strongest in those unembarrassed by other articles of belief the antiquaries have supposed this goddess to be synonymous with fortune and with fate669 but it was in her vindictive quality that she was worshipped under the name of nemesis                                29                          he their sire     butchered to make a roman holiday                                              stanza cxli lines 6 and 7  gladiators were of two kinds compelled and voluntary and were supplied from several conditionsfrom slaves sold for that purpose from culprits from barbarian captives either taken in war and after being led in triumph set apart for the games or those seized and condemned as rebels also from free citizens some fighting for hire auctorati others from a depraved ambition at last even knights and senators were exhibiteda disgrace of which the first tyrant was naturally the first inventor670 in the end dwarfs and even women fought an enormity prohibited by severus of these the most to be pitied undoubtedly were the barbarian captives and to this species a christian writer671 justly applies the epithet innocent to distinguish them from the professional gladiators aurelian and claudius supplied great numbers of these unfortunate victims the one after his triumph and the other on the pretext of a rebellion672 no war says lipsius673 was ever so destructive to the human race as these sports in spite of the laws of constantine and constans gladiatorial shows survived the old established religion more than seventy years but they owed their final extinction to the courage of a christian in the year 404 on the kalends of january they were exhibiting the shows in the flavian amphitheatre before the usual immense concourse of people almachius or telemachus an eastern monk who had travelled to rome intent on his holy purpose rushed into the midst of the arena and endeavoured to separate the combatants the prætor alypius a person incredibly attached to these games674 gave instant orders to the gladiators to slay him and telemachus gained the crown of martyrdom and the title of saint which surely has never either before or since been awarded for a more noble exploit honorius immediately abolished the shows which were never afterwards revived the story is told by theodoret675 and cassiodorus676 and seems worthy of credit notwithstanding its place in the roman martyrology677 besides the torrents of blood which flowed at the funerals in the amphitheatres the circus the forums and other public places gladiators were introduced at feasts and tore each other to pieces amidst the supper tables to the great delight and applause of the guests yet lipsius permits himself to suppose the loss of courage and the evident degeneracy of mankind to be nearly connected with the abolition of these bloody spectacles                                30      here where the roman millions blame or praise     was death or lifethe playthings of a crowd                                             stanza cxlii lines 5 and 6  when one gladiator wounded another he shouted he has it hoc habet or habet the wounded combatant dropped his weapon and advancing to the edge of the arena supplicated the spectators if he had fought well the people saved him if otherwise or as they happened to be inclined they turned down their thumbs and he was slain they were occasionally so savage that they were impatient if a combat lasted longer than ordinary without wounds or death the emperors presence generally saved the vanquished and it is recorded as an instance of caracallas ferocity that he sent those who supplicated him for life in a spectacle at nicomedia to ask the people in other words handed them over to be slain a similar ceremony is observed at the spanish bullfights the magistrate presides and after the horseman and piccadores have fought the bull the matadore steps forward and bows to him for permission to kill the animal if the bull has done his duty by killing two or three horses or a man which last is rare the people interfere with shouts the ladies wave their handkerchiefs and the animal is saved the wounds and death of the horses are accompanied with the loudest acclamations and many gestures of delight especially from the female portion of the audience including those of the gentlest blood every thing depends on habit the author of childe harold the writer of this note and one or two other englishmen who have certainly in other days borne the sight of a pitched battle were during the summer of 1809 in the governors box at the great amphitheatre of santa maria opposite to cadiz the death of one or two horses completely satisfied their curiosity a gentleman present observing them shudder and look pale noticed that unusual reception of so delightful a sport to some young ladies who stared and smiled and continued their applause as another horse fell bleeding to the ground one bull killed three horses off his own horns he was saved by acclamations which were redoubled when it was known he belonged to a priest  an englishman who can be much pleased with seeing two men beat themselves to pieces cannot bear to look at a horse galloping round an arena with his bowels trailing on the ground and turns from the spectacle and the spectators with horror and disgust                                31                               and afar     the tiber winds and the broad ocean laves     the latian coast etc etc                                            stanza clxxiv lines 3 and 4  the whole declivity of the alban hill is of unrivalled beauty and from the convent on the highest point which has succeeded to the temple of the latian jupiter the prospect embraces all the objects alluded to in the cited stanza the mediterranean the whole scene of the latter half of the Æneid and the coast from beyond the mouth of the tiber to the headland of circæum and the cape of terracina  the site of ciceros villa may be supposed either at the grotta ferrata or at the tusculum of prince lucien buonaparte  the former was thought some years ago the actual site as may be seen from myddletons life of cicero at present it has lost something of its credit except for the domenichinos nine monks of the greek order live there and the adjoining villa is a cardinals summerhouse the other villa called rufinella is on the summit of the hill above frascati and many rich remains of tusculum have been found there besides seventytwo statues of different merit and preservation and seven busts  from the same eminence are seen the sabine hills embosomed in which lies the long valley of rustica there are several circumstances which tend to establish the identity of this valley with the ustica of horace and it seems possible that the mosaic pavement which the peasants uncover by throwing up the earth of a vineyard may belong to his villa rustica is pronounced short not according to our stress uponusticæ cubantis it is more rational to think that we are wrong than that the inhabitants of this secluded valley have changed their tone in this word the addition of the consonant prefixed is nothing yet it is necessary to be aware that rustica may be a modern name which the peasants may have caught from the antiquaries  the villa or the mosaic is in a vineyard on a knoll covered with chestnut trees a stream runs down the valley and although it is not true as said in the guide books that this stream is called licenza yet there is a village on a rock at the head of the valley which is so denominated and which may have taken its name from the digentia licenza contains seven hundred inhabitants on a peak a little way beyond is civitella containing three hundred on the banks of the anio a little before you turn up into valle rustica to the left about an hour from the villa is a town called vicovaro another favourable coincidence with the varia of the poet at the end of the valley towards the anio there is a bare hill crowned with a little town called bardela at the foot of this hill the rivulet of licenza flows and is almost absorbed in a wide sandy bed before it reaches the anio nothing can be more fortunate for the lines of the poet whether in a metaphorical or direct sense      me quotiens reficit gelidus digentia rivus     quem mandela bibit rugosus frigore pagus  the stream is clear high up the valley but before it reaches the hill of bardela looks green and yellow like a sulphur rivulet  rocca giovane a ruined village in the hills half an hours walk from the vineyard where the pavement is shown does seem to be the site of the fane of vacuna and an inscription found there tells that this temple of the sabine victory was repaired by vespasian with these helps and a position corresponding exactly to every thing which the poet has told us of his retreat we may feel tolerably secure of our site  the hill which should be lucretilis is called campanile and by following up the rivulet to the pretended bandusia you come to the roots of the higher mountain gennaro singularly enough the only spot of ploughed land in the whole valley is on the knoll where this bandusia rises        tu frigus amabile     fessis vomere tauris     præbes et pecori vago  the peasants show another spring near the mosaic pavement which they call oradina and which flows down the hills into a tank or milldam and thence trickles over into the digentia  but we must not hope      to trace the muses upwards to their spring  by exploring the windings of the romantic valley in search of the bandusian fountain it seems strange that any one should have thought bandusia a fountain of the digentiahorace has not let drop a word of it and this immortal spring has in fact been discovered in possession of the holders of many good things in italy the monks it was attached to the church of st gervais and protais near venusia where it was most likely to be found678 we shall not be so lucky as a late traveller in finding the occasional pine still pendent on the poetic villa there is not a pine in the whole valley but there are two cypresses which he evidently took or mistook for the tree in the ode679 the truth is that the pine is now as it was in the days of virgil a garden tree and it was not at all likely to be found in the craggy acclivities of the valley of rustica horace probably had one of them in the orchard close above his farm immediately overshadowing his villa not on the rocky heights at some distance from his abode the tourist may have easily supposed himself to have seen this pine figured in the above cypresses for the orange and lemon trees which throw such a bloom over his description of the royal gardens at naples unless they have been since displaced were assuredly only acacias and other common garden shrubs680                                32      upon the blue symplegades
