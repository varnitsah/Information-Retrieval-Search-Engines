93124716	the origin of species  1   by thomas h huxley     mr darwins longstanding and wellearned scientific eminence probably renders him indifferent to that social notoriety which passes by the name of success but if the calm spirit of the philosopher have not yet wholly superseded the ambition and the vanity of the carnal man within him he must be well satisfied with the results of his venture in publishing the origin of species overflowing the narrow bounds of purely scientific circles the species question divides with italy and the volunteers the attention of general society everybody has read mr darwins book or at least has given an opinion upon its merits or demerits pietists whether lay or ecclesiastic decry it with the mild railing which sounds so charitable bigots denounce it with ignorant invective old ladies of both sexes consider it a decidedly dangerous book and even savants who have no better mud to throw quote antiquated writers to show that its author is no better than an ape himself while every philosophical thinker hails it as a veritable whitworth gun in the armoury of liberalism and all competent naturalists and physiologists whatever their opinions as to the ultimate fate of the doctrines put forth acknowledge that the work in which they are embodied is a solid contribution to knowledge and inaugurates a new epoch in natural history  nor has the discussion of the subject been restrained within the limits of conversation when the public is eager and interested reviewers must minister to its wants and the genuine litterateur is too much in the habit of acquiring his knowledge from the book he judgesas the abyssinian is said to provide himself with steaks from the ox which carries himto be withheld from criticism of a profound scientific work by the mere want of the requisite preliminary scientific acquirement while on the other hand the men of science who wish well to the new views no less than those who dispute their validity have naturally sought opportunities of expressing their opinions hence it is not surprising that almost all the critical journals have noticed mr darwins work at greater or less length and so many disquisitions of every degree of excellence from the poor product of ignorance too often stimulated by prejudice to the fair and thoughtful essay of the candid student of nature have appeared that it seems an almost hopeless task to attempt to say anything new upon the question  but it may be doubted if the knowledge and acumen of prejudged scientific opponents or the subtlety of orthodox special pleaders have yet exerted their full force in mystifying the real issues of the great controversy which has been set afoot and whose end is hardly likely to be seen by this generation so that at this eleventh hour and even failing anything new it may be useful to state afresh that which is true and to put the fundamental positions advocated by mr darwin in such a form that they may be grasped by those whose special studies lie in other directions and the adoption of this course may be the more advisable because notwithstanding its great deserts and indeed partly on account of them the origin of species is by no means an easy book to readif by reading is implied the full comprehension of an authors meaning  we do not speak jestingly in saying that it is mr darwins misfortune to know more about the question he has taken up than any man living personally and practically exercised in zoology in minute anatomy in geology a student of geographical distribution not on maps and in museums only but by long voyages and laborious collection having largely advanced each of these branches of science and having spent many years in gathering and sifting materials for his present work the store of accurately registered facts upon which the author of the origin of species is able to draw at will is prodigious  but this very superabundance of matter must have been embarrassing to a writer who for the present can only put forward an abstract of his views and thence it arises perhaps that notwithstanding the clearness of the style those who attempt fairly to digest the book find much of it a sort of intellectual pemmicana mass of facts crushed and pounded into shape rather than held together by the ordinary medium of an obvious logical bond due attention will without doubt discover this bond but it is often hard to find  again from sheer want of room much has to be taken for granted which might readily enough be proved and hence while the adept who can supply the missing links in the evidence from his own knowledge discovers fresh proof of the singular thoroughness with which all difficulties have been considered and all unjustifiable suppositions avoided at every reperusal of mr darwins pregnant paragraphs the novice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fancies is gratuitous assumption  thus while it may be doubted if for some years any one is likely to be competent to pronounce judgment on all the issues raised by mr darwin there is assuredly abundant room for him who assuming the humbler though perhaps as useful office of an interpreter between the origin of species and the public contents himself with endeavouring to point out the nature of the problems which it discusses to distinguish between the ascertained facts and the theoretical views which it contains and finally to show the extent to which the explanation it offers satisfies the requirements of scientific logic at any rate it is this office which we purpose to undertake in the following pages  it may be safely assumed that our readers have a general conception of the nature of the objects to which the word species is applied but it has perhaps occurred to a few even to those who are naturalists ex professo to reflect that as commonly employed the term has a double sense and denotes two very different orders of relations when we call a group of animals or of plants a species we may imply thereby either that all these animals or plants have some common peculiarity of form or structure or we may mean that they possess some common functional character that part of biological science which deals with form and structure is called morphologythat which concerns itself with function physiologyso that we may conveniently speak of these two senses or aspects of speciesthe one as morphological the other as physiological regarded from the former point of view a species is nothing more than a kind of animal or plant which is distinctly definable from all others by certain constant and not merely sexual morphological peculiarities thus horses form a species because the group of animals to which that name is applied is distinguished from all others in the world by the following constantly associated characters they have1 a vertebral column 2 mammae 3 a placental embryo 4 four legs 5 a single welldeveloped toe in each foot provided with a hoof 6 a bushy tail and 7 callosities on the inner sides of both the fore and the hind legs the asses again form a distinct species because with the same characters as far as the fifth in the above list all asses have tufted tails and have callosities only on the inner side of the forelegs if animals were discovered having the general characters of the horse but sometimes with callosities only on the forelegs and more or less tufted tails or animals having the general characters of the ass but with more or less bushy tails and sometimes with callosities on both pairs of legs besides being intermediate in other respectsthe two species would have to be merged into one they could no longer be regarded as morphologically distinct species for they would not be distinctly definable one from the other  however bare and simple this definition of species may appear to be we confidently appeal to all practical naturalists whether zoologists botanists or palaeontologists to say if in the vast majority of cases they know or mean to affirm anything more of the group of animals or plants they so denominate than what has just been stated even the most decided advocates of the received doctrines respecting species admit this  i apprehend says professor owen 2 that few naturalists nowadays in describing and proposing a name for what they call a new species use that term to signify what was meant by it twenty or thirty years ago that is an originally distinct creation maintaining its primitive distinction by obstructive generative peculiarities the proposer of the new species now intends to state no more than he actually knows as for example that the differences on which he founds the specific character are constant in individuals of both sexes so far as observation has reached and that they are not due to domestication or to artificially superinduced external circumstances or to any outward influence within his cognizance that the species is wild or is such as it appears by nature  if we consider in fact that by far the largest proportion of recorded existing species are known only by the study of their skins or bones or other lifeless exuvia that we are acquainted with none or next to none of their physiological peculiarities beyond those which can be deduced from their structure or are open to cursory observation and that we cannot hope to learn more of any of those extinct forms of life which now constitute no inconsiderable proportion of the known flora and fauna of the world it is obvious that the definitions of these species can be only of a purely structural or morphological character it is probable that naturalists would have avoided much confusion of ideas if they had more frequently borne the necessary limitations of our knowledge in mind but while it may safely be admitted that we are acquainted with only the morphological characters of the vast majority of speciesthe functional or physiological peculiarities of a few have been carefully investigated and the result of that study forms a large and most interesting portion of the physiology of reproduction  the student of nature wonders the more and is astonished the less the more conversant he becomes with her operations but of all the perennial miracles she offers to his inspection perhaps the most worthy of admiration is the development of a plant or of an animal from its embryo examine the recently laid egg of some common animal such as a salamander or newt it is a minute spheroid in which the best microscope will reveal nothing but a structureless sac enclosing a glairy fluid holding granules in suspension but strange possibilities lie dormant in that semifluid globule let a moderate supply of warmth reach its watery cradle and the plastic matter undergoes changes so rapid yet so steady and purposelike in their succession that one can only compare them to those operated by a skilled modeller upon a formless lump of clay as with an invisible trowel the mass is divided and subdivided into smaller and smaller portions until it is reduced to an aggregation of granules not too large to build withal the finest fabrics of the nascent organism and then it is as if a delicate finger traced out the line to be occupied by the spinal column and moulded the contour of the body pinching up the head at one end the tail at the other and fashioning flank and limb into due salamandrine proportions in so artistic a way that after watching the process hour by hour one is almost involuntarily possessed by the notion that some more subtle aid to vision than an achromatic would show the hidden artist with his plan before him striving with skilful manipulation to perfect his work  as life advances and the young amphibian ranges the waters the terror of his insect contemporaries not only are the nutritious particles supplied by its prey by the addition of which to its frame growth takes place laid down each in its proper spot and in such due proportion to the rest as to reproduce the form the colour and the size characteristic of the parental stock but even the wonderful powers of reproducing lost parts possessed by these animals are controlled by the same governing tendency cut off the legs the tail the jaws separately or all together and as spallanzani showed long ago these parts not only grow again but the redintegrated limb is formed on the same type as those which were lost the new jaw or leg is a newts and never by any accident more like that of a frog what is true of the newt is true of every animal and of every plant the acorn tends to build itself up again into a woodland giant such as that from whose twig it fell the spore of the humblest lichen reproduces the green or brown incrustation which gave it birth and at the other end of the scale of life the child that resembled neither the paternal nor the maternal side of the house would be regarded as a kind of monster  so that the one end to which in all living beings the formative impulse is tendingthe one scheme which the archaeus of the old speculators strives to carry out seems to be to mould the offspring into the likeness of the parent it is the first great law of reproduction that the offspring tends to resemble its parent or parents more closely than anything else  science will some day show us how this law is a necessary consequence of the more general laws which govern matter but for the present more can hardly be said than that it appears to be in harmony with them we know that the phenomena of vitality are not something apart from other physical phenomena but one with them and matter and force are the two names of the one artist who fashions the living as well as the lifeless hence living bodies should obey the same great laws as other matternor throughout nature is there a law of wider application than this that a body impelled by two forces takes the direction of their resultant but living bodies may be regarded as nothing but extremely complex bundles of forces held in a mass of matter as the complex forces of a magnet are held in the steel by its coercive force and since the differences of sex are comparatively slight or in other words the sum of the forces in each has a very similar tendency their resultant the offspring may reasonably be expected to deviate but little from a course parallel to either or to both  represent the reason of the law to ourselves by what physical metaphor or analogy we will however the great matter is to apprehend its existence and the importance of the consequences deducible from it for things which are like to the same are like to one another and if in a great series of generations every offspring is like its parent it follows that all the offspring and all the parents must be like one another and that given an original parental stock with the opportunity of undisturbed multiplication the law in question necessitates the production in course of time of an indefinitely large group the whole of whose members are at once very similar and are blood relations having descended from the same parent or pair of parents the proof that all the members of any given group of animals or plants had thus descended would be ordinarily considered sufficient to entitle them to the rank of physiological species for most physiologists consider species to be definable as the offspring of a single primitive stock  but though it is quite true that all those groups we call species may according to the known laws of reproduction have descended from a single stock and though it is very likely they really have done so yet this conclusion rests on deduction and can hardly hope to establish itself upon a basis of observation and the primitiveness of the supposed single stock which after all is the essential part of the matter is not only a hypothesis but one which has not a shadow of foundation if by primitive he meant independent of any other living being a scientific definition of which an unwarrantable hypothesis forms an essential part carries its condemnation within itself but even supposing such a definition were in form tenable the physiologist who should attempt to apply it in nature would soon find himself involved in great if not inextricable difficulties as we have said it is indubitable that offspring tend to resemble the parental organism but it is equally true that the similarity attained never amounts to identity either in form or in structure there is always a certain amount of deviation not only from the precise characters of a single parent but when as in most animals and many plants the sexes are lodged in distinct individuals from an exact mean between the two parents and indeed on general principles this slight deviation seems as intelligible as the general similarity if we reflect how complex the cooperating bundles of forces are and how improbable it is that in any case their true resultant shall coincide with any mean between the more obvious characters of the two parents whatever be its cause however the coexistence of this tendency to minor variation with the tendency to general similarity is of vast importance in its bearing on the question of the origin of species  as a general rule the extent to which an offspring differs from its parent is slight enough but occasionally the amount of difference is much more strongly marked and then the divergent offspring receives the name of a variety multitudes of what there is every reason to believe are such varieties are known but the origin of very few has been accurately recorded and of these we will select two as more especially illustrative of the main features of variation the first of them is that of the ancon or otter sheep of which a careful account is given by colonel david humphreys frs in a letter to sir joseph banks published in the philosophical transactions for 1813 it appears that one seth wright the proprietor of a farm on the banks of the charles river in massachusetts possessed a flock of fifteen ewes and a ram of the ordinary kind in the year 1791 one of the ewes presented her owner with a male lamb differing for no assignable reason from its parents by a proportionally long body and short bandy legs whence it was unable to emulate its relatives in those sportive leaps over the neighbours fences in which they were in the habit of indulging much to the good farmers vexation  the second case is that detailed by a no less unexceptionable authority than reaumur in his art de faire eclore les poulets a maltese couple named kelleia whose hands and feet were constructed upon the ordinary human model had born to them a son gratio who possessed six perfectly movable fingers on each hand and six toes not quite so well formed on each foot no cause could be assigned for the appearance of this unusual variety of the human species  two circumstances are well worthy of remark in both these cases in each the variety appears to have arisen in full force and as it were per saltum a wide and definite difference appearing at once between the ancon ram and the ordinary sheep between the sixfingered and sixtoed gratio kelleia and ordinary men in neither case is it possible to point out any obvious reason for the appearance of the variety doubtless there were determining causes for these as for all other phenomena but they do not appear and we can be tolerably certain that what are ordinarily understood as changes in physical conditions as in climate in food or the like did not take place and had nothing to do with the matter it was no case of what is commonly called adaptation to circumstances but to use a conveniently erroneous phrase the variations arose spontaneously the fruitless search after final causes leads their pursuers a long way but even those hardy teleologists who are ready to break through all the laws of physics in chase of their favourite willothewisp may be puzzled to discover what purpose could be attained by the stunted legs of seth wrights ram or the hexadactyle members of gratio kelleia  varieties then arise we know not why and it is more than probable that the majority of varieties have arisen in this spontaneous manner though we are of course far from denying that they may be traced in some cases to distinct external influences which are assuredly competent to alter the character of the tegumentary covering to change colour to increase or diminish the size of muscles to modify constitution and among plants to give rise to the metamorphosis of stamens into petals and so forth but however they may have arisen what especially interests us at present is to remark that once in existence varieties obey the fundamental law of reproduction that like tends to produce like and their offspring exemplify it by tending to exhibit the same deviation from the parental stock as themselves indeed there seems to be in many instances a prepotent influence about a newlyarisen variety which gives it what one may call an unfair advantage over the normal descendants from the same stock this is strikingly exemplified by the case of gratio kelleia who married a woman with the ordinary pentadactyle extremities and had by her four children salvator george andre and marie of these children salvator the eldest boy had six fingers and six toes like his father the second and third also boys had five fingers and five toes like their mother though the hands and feet of george were slightly deformed the last a girl had five fingers and five toes but the thumbs were slightly deformed the variety thus reproduced itself purely in the eldest while the normal type reproduced itself purely in the third and almost purely in the second and last so that it would seem at first as if the normal type were more powerful than the variety but all these children grew up and intermarried with normal wives and husband and then note what took place salvator had four children three of whom exhibited the hexadactyle members of their grandfather and father while the youngest had the pentadactyle limbs of the mother and grandmother so that here notwithstanding a double pentadactyle dilution of the blood the hexadactyle variety had the best of it the same prepotency of the variety was still more markedly exemplified in the progeny of two of the other children marie and george marie whose thumbs only were deformed gave birth to a boy with six toes and three other normally formed children but george who was not quite so pure a pentadactyle begot first two girls each of whom had six fingers and toes then a girl with six fingers on each hand and six toes on the right foot but only five toes on the left and lastly a boy with only five fingers and toes in these instances therefore the variety as it were leaped over one generation to reproduce itself in full force in the next finally the purely pentadactyle andre was the father of many children not one of whom departed from the normal parental type  if a variation which approaches the nature of a monstrosity can strive thus forcibly to reproduce itself it is not wonderful that less aberrant modifications should tend to be preserved even more strongly and the history of the ancon sheep is in this respect particularly instructive with the cuteness characteristic of their nation the neighbours of the massachusetts farmer imagined it would be an excellent thing if all his sheep were imbued with the stayathome tendencies enforced by nature upon the newlyarrived ram and they advised wright to kill the old patriarch of his fold and install the ancon ram in his place the result justified their sagacious anticipations and coincided very nearly with what occurred to the progeny of gratio kelleia the young lambs were almost always either pure ancons or pure ordinary sheep 3 but when sufficient ancon sheep were obtained to interbreed with one another it was found that the offspring was always pure ancon colonel humphreys in fact states that he was acquainted with only one questionable case of a contrary nature here then is a remarkable and wellestablished instance not only of a very distinct race being established per saltum but of that race breeding true at once and showing no mixed forms even when crossed with another breed  by taking care to select ancons of both sexes for breeding from it thus became easy to establish an extremely wellmarked race so peculiar that even when herded with other sheep it was noted that the ancons kept together and there is every reason to believe that the existence of this breed might have been indefinitely protracted but the introduction of the merino sheep which were not only very superior to the ancons in wool and meat but quite as quiet and orderly led to the complete neglect of the new breed so that in 1813 colonel humphreys found it difficult to obtain the specimen whose skeleton was presented to sir joseph banks we believe that for many years no remnant of it has existed in the united states  gratio kelleia was not the progenitor of a race of sixfingered men as seth wrights ram became a nation of ancon sheep though the tendency of the variety to perpetuate itself appears to have been fully as strong in the one case as in the other and the reason of the difference is not far to seek seth wright took care not to weaken the ancon blood by matching his ancon ewes with any but males of the same variety while gratio kelleias sons were too far removed from the patriarchal times to intermarry with their sisters and his grandchildren seem not to have been attracted by their sixfingered cousins in other words in the one example a race was produced because for several generations care was taken to select both parents of the breeding stock from animals exhibiting a tendency to vary in the same condition while in the other no race was evolved because no such selection was exercised a race is a propagated variety and as by the laws of reproduction offspring tend to assume the parental forms they will be more likely to propagate a variation exhibited by both parents than that possessed by only one  there is no organ of the body of an animal which may not and does not occasionally vary more or less from the normal type and there is no variation which may not be transmitted and which if selectively transmitted may not become the foundation of a race this great truth sometimes forgotten by philosophers has long been familiar to practical agriculturists and breeders and upon it rest all the methods of improving the breeds of domestic animals which for the last century have been followed with so much success in england colour form size texture of hair or wool proportions of various parts strength or weakness of constitution tendency to fatten or to remain lean to give much or little milk speed strength temper intelligence special instincts there is not one of these characters whose transmission is not an everyday occurrence within the experience of cattlebreeders stockfarmers horsedealers and dog and poultry fanciers nay it is only the other day that an eminent physiologist dr brownsequard communicated to the royal society his discovery that epilepsy artificially produced in guineapigs by a means which he has discovered is transmitted to their offspring  but a race once produced is no more a fixed and immutable entity than the stock whence it sprang variations arise among its members and as these variations are transmitted like any others new races may be developed out of the preexisting one ad infinitum or at least within any limit at present determined given sufficient time and sufficiently careful selection and the multitude of races which may arise from a common stock is as astonishing as are the extreme structural differences which they may present a remarkable example of this is to be found in the rockpigeon which dr darwin has in our opinion satisfactorily demonstrated to be the progenitor of all our domestic pigeons of which there are certainly more than a hundred wellmarked races the most noteworthy of these races are the four great stocks known to the fancy as tumblers pouters carriers and fantails birds which not only differ most singularly in size colour and habits but in the form of the beak and of the skull in the proportions of the beak to the skull in the number of tailfeathers in the absolute and relative size of the feet in the presence or absence of the uropygial gland in the number of vertebrae in the back in short in precisely those characters in which the genera and species of birds differ from one another  and it is most remarkable and instructive to observe that none of these races can be shown to have been originated by the action of changes in what are commonly called external circumstances upon the wild rockpigeon on the contrary from time immemorial pigeonfanciers have had essentially similar methods of treating their pets which have been housed fed protected and cared for in much the same way in all pigeonries in fact there is no case better adapted than that of the pigeons to refute the doctrine which one sees put forth on high authority that no other characters than those founded on the development of bone for the attachment of muscles are capable of variation in precise contradiction of this hasty assertion mr darwins researches prove that the skeleton of the wings in domestic pigeons has hardly varied at all from that of the wild type while on the other hand it is in exactly those respects such as the relative length of the beak and skull the number of the vertebrae and the number of the tailfeathers in which muscular exertion can have no important influence that the utmost amount of variation has taken place  we have said that the following out of the properties exhibited by physiological species would lead us into difficulties and at this point they begin to be obvious for if as the result of spontaneous variation and of selective breeding the progeny of a common stock may become separated into groups distinguished from one another by constant not sexual morphological characters it is clear that the physiological definition of species is likely to clash with the morphological definition no one would hesitate to describe the pouter and the tumbler as distinct species if they were found fossil or if their skins and skeletons were imported as those of exotic wild birds commonly areand without doubt if considered alone they are good and distinct morphological species on the other hand they are not physiological species for they are descended from a common stock the rockpigeon  under these circumstances as it is admitted on all sides that races occur in nature how are we to know whether any apparently distinct animals are really of different physiological species or not seeing that the amount of morphological difference is no safe guide is there any test of a physiological species the usual answer of physiologists is in the affirmative it is said that such a test is to be found in the phenomena of hybridizationin the results of crossing races as compared with the results of crossing species  so far as the evidence goes at present individuals of what are certainly known to be mere races produced by selection however distinct they may appear to be not only breed freely together but the offspring of such crossed races are only perfectly fertile with one another thus the spaniel and the greyhound the drayhorse and the arab the pouter and the tumbler breed together with perfect freedom and their mongrels if matched with other mongrels of the same kind are equally fertile  on the other hand there can be no doubt that the individuals of many natural species are either absolutely infertile if crossed with individuals of other species or if they give rise to hybrid offspring the hybrids so produced are infertile when paired together the horse and the ass for instance if so crossed give rise to the mule and there is no certain evidence of offspring ever having been produced by a male and female mule the unions of the rockpigeon and the ringpigeon appear to be equally barren of result here then says the physiologist we have a means of distinguishing any two true species from any two varieties if a male and a female selected from each group produce offspring and that offspring is fertile with others produced in the same way the groups are races and not species if on the other hand no result ensues or if the offspring are infertile with others produced in the same way they are true physiological species the test would be an admirable one if in the first place it were always practicable to apply it and if in the second it always yielded results susceptible of a definite interpretation unfortunately in the great majority of cases this touchstone for species is wholly inapplicable  the constitution of many wild animals is so altered by confinement that they will not breed even with their own females so that the negative results obtained from crosses are of no value and the antipathy of wild animals of the same species for one another or even of wild and tame members of the same species is ordinarily so great that it is hopeless to look for such unions in nature the hermaphrodism of most plants the difficulty in the way of insuring the absence of their own or the proper working of other pollen are obstacles of no less magnitude in applying the test to them and in both animals and plants is superadded the further difficulty that experiments must be continued over a long time for the purpose of ascertaining the fertility of the mongrel or hybrid progeny as well as of the first crosses from which they spring  not only do these great practical difficulties lie in the way of applying the hybridization test but even when this oracle can be questioned its replies are sometimes as doubtful as those of delphi for example cases are cited by mr darwin of plants which are more fertile with the pollen of another species than with their own and there are others such as certain fuci whose male element will fertilize the ovule of a plant of distinct species while the males of the latter species are ineffective with the females of the first so that in the lastnamed instance a physiologist who should cross the two species in one way would decide that they were true species while another who should cross them in the reverse way would with equal justice according to the rule pronounce them to be mere races several plants which there is great reason to believe are mere varieties are almost sterile when crossed while both animals and plants which have always been regarded by naturalists as of distinct species turn out when the test is applied to be perfectly fertile again the sterility or fertility of crosses seems to bear no relation to the structural resemblances or differences of the members of any two groups  mr darwin has discussed this question with singular ability and circumspection and his conclusions are summed up as follows at page 276 of his work  first crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as species and their hybrids are very generally but not universally sterile the sterility is of all degrees and is often so slight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived have come to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test the sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species and is eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions the degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity but is governed by several curious and complex laws it is generally different and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same two species it is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrid produced from this cross  in the same manner as in grafting trees the capacity of one species or variety to take on another is incidental on generally unknown differences in their vegetative systems so in crossing the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems there is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and breeding in nature than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests  the sterility of first crosses between pure species which have their reproductive systems perfect seems to depend on several circumstances in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive systems imperfect and which have had this system and their whole organization disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species seems closely allied to that sterility which so frequently affects pure species when their natural conditions of life have been disturbed this view is supported by a parallelism of another kind namely that the crossing of forms only slightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of the offspring and that slight changes in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings it is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two species and the degree of sterility of their hybrid offspring should generally correspond though due to distinct causes for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between the species which are crossed nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross the fertility of hybrids produced from it and the capacity of being grafted togetherthough this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstancesshould all run to a certain extent parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to experiment for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of resemblance between all species  first crosses between forms known to be varieties or sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties and their mongrel offspring are very generally but not quite universally fertile nor is this nearly general and perfect fertility surprising when we remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences and not of differences in the reproductive system in all other respects excluding fertility there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrelspp 2768  we fully agree with the general tenor of this weighty passage but forcible as are these arguments and little as the value of fertility or infertility as a test of species may be it must not be forgotten that the really important fact so far as the inquiry into the origin of species goes is that there are such things in nature as groups of animals and of plants whose members are incapable of fertile union with those of other groups and that there are such things as hybrids which are absolutely sterile when crossed with other hybrids for if such phenomena as these were exhibited by only two of those assemblages of living objects to which the name of species whether it be used in its physiological or in its morphological sense is given it would have to be accounted for by any theory of the origin of species and every theory which could not account for it would be so far imperfect  up to this point we have been dealing with matters of fact and the statements which we have laid before the reader would to the best of our knowledge be admitted to contain a fair exposition of what is at present known respecting the essential properties of species by all who have studied the question and whatever may be his theoretical views no naturalist will probably be disposed to demur to the following summary of that exposition  living beings whether animals or plants are divisible into multitudes of distinctly definable kinds which are morphological species they are also divisible into groups of individuals which breed freely together tending to reproduce their like and are physiological species normally resembling their parents the offspring of members of these species are still liable to vary and the variation may be perpetuated by selection as a race which race in many cases presents all the characteristics of a morphological species but it is not as yet proved that a race ever exhibits when crossed with another race of the same species those phenomena of hybridization which are exhibited by many species when crossed with other species on the other hand not only is it not proved that all species give rise to hybrids infertile inter se but there is much reason to believe that in crossing species exhibit every gradation from perfect sterility to perfect fertility  such are the most essential characteristics of species even were man not one of thema member of the same system and subject to the same lawsthe question of their origin their causal connexion that is with the other phenomena of the universe must have attracted his attention as soon as his intelligence had raised itself above the level of his daily wants  indeed history relates that such was the case and has embalmed for us the speculations upon the origin of living beings which were among the earliest products of the dawning intellectual activity of man in those early days positive knowledge was not to be had but the craving after it needed at all hazards to be satisfied and according to the country or the turn of thought of the speculator the suggestion that all living things arose from the mud of the nile from a primeval egg or from some more anthropomorphic agency afforded a sufficient restingplace for his curiosity the myths of paganism are as dead as osiris or zeus and the man who should revive them in opposition to the knowledge of our time would be justly laughed to scorn but the coeval imaginations current among the rude inhabitants of palestine recorded by writers whose very name and age are admitted by every scholar to be unknown have unfortunately not yet shared their fate but even at this day are regarded by ninetenths of the civilized world as the authoritative standard of fact and the criterion of the justice of scientific conclusions in all that relates to the origin of things and among them of species in this nineteenth century as at the dawn of modern physical science the cosmogony of the semibarbarous hebrew is the incubus of the philosopher and the opprobrium of the orthodox who shall number the patient and earnest seekers after truth from the days of galileo until now whose lives have been embittered and their good name blasted by the mistaken zeal of bibliolaters who shall count the host of weaker men whose sense of truth has been destroyed in the effort to harmonize impossibilitieswhose life has been wasted in the attempt to force the generous new wine of science into the old bottles of judaism compelled by the outcry of the same strong party  it is true that if philosophers have suffered their cause has been amply avenged extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of every science as the strangled snakes beside that of hercules and history records that whenever science and orthodoxy have been fairly opposed the latter has been forced to retire from the lists bleeding and crushed if not annihilated scotched if not slain but orthodoxy is the bourbon of the world of thought it learns not neither can it forget and though at present bewildered and afraid to move it is as willing as ever to insist that the first chapter of genesis contains the beginning and the end of sound science and to visit with such petty thunderbolts as its halfparalysed hands can hurl those who refuse to degrade nature to the level of primitive judaism  philosophers on the other hand have no such aggressive tendencies with eyes fixed on the noble goal to which per aspera et ardua they tend they may now and then be stirred to momentary wrath by the unnecessary obstacles with which the ignorant or the malicious encumber if they cannot bar the difficult path but why should their souls be deeply vexed the majesty of fact is on their side and the elemental forces of nature are working for them not a star comes to the meridian at its calculated time but testifies to the justice of their methodstheir beliefs are one with falling rain and with the growing corn by doubt they are established and open inquiry is their bosom friend such men have no fear of traditions however venerable and no respect for them when they become mischievous and obstructive but they have better than mere antiquarian business in hand and if dogmas which ought to be fossil but are not are not forced upon their notice they are too happy to treat them as nonexistent  the hypotheses respecting the origin of species which profess to stand upon a scientific basis and as such alone demand serious attention are of two kinds the one the special creation hypothesis presumes every species to have originated from one or more stocks these not being the result of the modification of any other form of living matteror arising by natural agenciesbut being produced as such by a supernatural creative act  the other the socalled transmutation hypothesis considers that all existing species are the result of the modification of preexisting species and those of their predecessors by agencies similar to those which at the present day produce varieties and races and therefore in an altogether natural way and it is a probable though not a necessary consequence of this hypothesis that all living beings have arisen from a single stock with respect to the origin of this primitive stock or stocks the doctrine of the origin of species is obviously not necessarily concerned the transmutation hypothesis for example is perfectly consistent either with the conception of a special creation of the primitive germ or with the supposition of its having arisen as a modification of inorganic matter by natural causes  the doctrine of special creation owes its existence very largely to the supposed necessity of making science accord with the hebrew cosmogony but it is curious to observe that as the doctrine is at present maintained by men of science it is as hopelessly inconsistent with the hebrew view as any other hypothesis  if there be any result which has come more clearly out of geological investigation than another it is that the vast series of extinct animals and plants is not divisible as it was once supposed to be into distinct groups separated by sharplymarked boundaries there are no great gulfs between epochs and formationsno successive periods marked by the appearance of plants of water animals and of land animals en masse every year adds to the list of links between what the older geologists supposed to be widely separated epochs witness the crags linking the drift with older tertiaries the maestricht beds linking the tertiaries with the chalk the st cassian beds exhibiting an abundant fauna of mixed mesozoic and palaeozoic types in rocks of an epoch once supposed to be eminently poor in life witness lastly the incessant disputes as to whether a given stratum shall be reckoned devonian or carboniferous silurian or devonian cambrian or silurian  this truth is further illustrated in a most interesting manner by the impartial and highly competent testimony of m pictet from whose calculations of what percentage of the genera of animals existing in any formation lived during the preceding formation it results that in no case is the proportion less than onethird or 33 per cent it is the triassic formation or the commencement of the mesozoic epoch which has received the smallest inheritance from preceding ages the other formations not uncommonly exhibit 60 80 or even 94 per cent of genera in common with those whose remains are imbedded in their predecessor not only is this true but the subdivisions of each formation exhibit new species characteristic of and found only in them and in many cases as in the lias for example the separate beds of these subdivisions are distinguished by wellmarked and peculiar forms of life a section a hundred feet thick will exhibit at different heights a dozen species of ammonite none of which passes beyond its particular zone of limestone or clay into the zone below it or into that above it so that those who adopt the doctrine of special creation must be prepared to admit that at intervals of time corresponding with the thickness of these beds the creator thought fit to interfere with the natural course of events for the purpose of making a new ammonite it is not easy to transplant oneself into the frame of mind of those who can accept such a conclusion as this on any evidence short of absolute demonstration and it is difficult to see what is to be gained by so doing since as we have said it is obvious that such a view of the origin of living beings is utterly opposed to the hebrew cosmogony deserving no aid from the powerful arm of bibliolatry then does the received form of the hypothesis of special creation derive any support from science or sound logic assuredly not much the arguments brought forward in its favour all take one form if species were not supernaturally created we cannot understand the facts x or y or z we cannot understand the structure of animals or plants unless we suppose they were contrived for special ends we cannot understand the structure of the eye except by supposing it to have been made to see with we cannot understand instincts unless we suppose animals to have been miraculously endowed with them  as a question of dialectics it must be admitted that this sort of reasoning is not very formidable to those who are not to be frightened by consequences it is an argumentum ad ignorantiamtake this explanation or be ignorant  but suppose we prefer to admit our ignorance rather than adopt a hypothesis at variance with all the teachings of nature or suppose for a moment we admit the explanation and then seriously ask ourselves how much the wiser are we what does the explanation explain is it any more than a grandiloquent way of announcing the fact that we really know nothing about the matter a phenomenon is explained when it is shown to be a case of some general law of nature but the supernatural interposition of the creator can by the nature of the case exemplify no law and if species have really arisen in this way it is absurd to attempt to discuss their origin  or lastly let us ask ourselves whether any amount of evidence which the nature of our faculties permits us to attain can justify us in asserting that any phenomenon is out of the reach of natural causation to this end it is obviously necessary that we should know all the consequences to which all possible combinations continued through unlimited time can give rise if we knew these and found none competent to originate species we should have good ground for denying their origin by natural causation till we know them any hypothesis is better than one which involves us in such miserable presumption  but the hypothesis of special creation is not only a mere specious mask for our ignorance its existence in biology marks the youth and imperfection of the science for what is the history of every science but the history of the elimination of the notion of creative or other interferences with the natural order of the phenomena which are the subjectmatter of that science when astronomy was young the morning stars sang together for joy and the planets were guided in their courses by celestial hands now the harmony of the stars has resolved itself into gravitation according to the inverse squares of the distances and the orbits of the planets are deducible from the laws of the forces which allow a schoolboys stone to break a window the lightning was the angel of the lord but it has pleased providence in these modern times that science should make it the humble messenger of man and we know that every flash that shimmers about the horizon on a summers evening is determined by ascertainable conditions and that its direction and brightness might if our knowledge of these were great enough have been calculated  the solvency of great mercantile companies rests on the validity of the laws which have been ascertained to govern the seeming irregularity of that human life which the moralist bewails as the most uncertain of things plague pestilence and famine are admitted by all but fools to be the natural result of causes for the most part fully within human control and not the unavoidable tortures inflicted by wrathful omnipotence upon his helpless handiwork  harmonious order governing eternally continuous progressthe web and woof of matter and force interweaving by slow degrees without a broken thread that veil which lies between us and the infinitethat universe which alone we know or can know such is the picture which science draws of the world and in proportion as any part of that picture is in unison with the rest so may we feel sure that it is rightly painted shall biology alone remain out of harmony with her sister sciences  such arguments against the hypothesis of the direct creation of species as these are plainly enough deducible from general considerations but there are in addition phenomena exhibited by species themselves and yet not so much a part of their very essence as to have required earlier mention which are in the highest degree perplexing if we adopt the popularly accepted hypothesis such are the facts of distribution in space and in time the singular phenomena brought to light by the study of development the structural relations of species upon which our systems of classification are founded the great doctrines of philosophical anatomy such as that of homology or of the community of structural plan exhibited by large groups of species differing very widely in their habits and functions  the species of animals which inhabit the sea on opposite sides of the isthmus of panama are wholly distinct 4 the animals and plants which inhabit islands are commonly distinct from those of the neighbouring mainlands and yet have a similarity of aspect  the mammals of the latest tertiary epoch in the old and new worlds belong to the same genera or family groups as those which now inhabit the same great geographical area the crocodilian reptiles which existed in the earliest secondary epoch were similar in general structure to those now living but exhibit slight differences in their vertebrae nasal passages and one or two other points the guineapig has teeth which are shed before it is born and hence can never subserve the masticatory purpose for which they seem contrived and in like manner the female dugong has tusks which never cut the gum all the members of the same great group run through similar conditions in their development and all their parts in the adult state are arranged according to the same plan man is more like a gorilla than a gorilla is like a lemur such are a few taken at random among the multitudes of similar facts which modern research has established but when the student seeks for an explanation of them from the supporters of the received hypothesis of the origin of species the reply he receives is in substance of oriental simplicity and brevitymashallah it so pleases god there are different species on opposite sides of the isthmus of panama because they were created different on the two sides the pliocene mammals are like the existing ones because such was the plan of creation and we find rudimental organs and similarity of plan because it has pleased the creator to set before himself a divine exemplar or archetype and to copy it in his works and somewhat ill those who hold this view imply in some of them that such verbal hocuspocus should be received as science will one day be regarded as evidence of the low state of intelligence in the nineteenth century just as we amuse ourselves with the phraseology about natures abhorrence of a vacuum wherewith torricellis compatriots were satisfied to explain the rise of water in a pump and be it recollected that this sort of satisfaction works not only negative but positive ill by discouraging inquiry and so depriving man of the usufruct of one of the most fertile fields of his great patrimony nature  the objections to the doctrine of the origin of species by special creation which have been detailed must have occurred with more or less force to the mind of every one who has seriously and independently considered the subject it is therefore no wonder that from time to time this hypothesis should have been met by counter hypotheses all as well and some better founded than itself and it is curious to remark that the inventors of the opposing views seem to have been led into them as much by their knowledge of geology as by their acquaintance with biology in fact when the mind has once admitted the conception of the gradual production of the present physical state of our globe by natural causes operating through long ages of time it will be little disposed to allow that living beings have made their appearance in another way and the speculations of de maillet and his successors are the natural complement of scillas demonstration of the true nature of fossils  a contemporary of newton and of leibnitz sharing therefore in the intellectual activity of the remarkable age which witnessed the birth of modern physical science benoit de maillet spent a long life as a consular agent of the french government in various mediterranean ports for sixteen years in fact he held the office of consulgeneral in egypt and the wonderful phenomena offered by the valley of the nile appear to have strongly impressed his mind to have directed his attention to all facts of a similar order which came within his observation and to have led him to speculate on the origin of the present condition of our globe and of its inhabitants but with all his ardour for science de maillet seems to have hesitated to publish views which notwithstanding the ingenious attempts to reconcile them with the hebrew hypothesis contained in the preface to telliamed were hardly likely to be received with favour by his contemporaries  but a short time had elapsed since more than one of the great anatomists and physicists of the italian school had paid dearly for their endeavours to dissipate some of the prevalent errors and their illustrious pupil harvey the founder of modern physiology had not fared so well in a country less oppressed by the benumbing influences of theology as to tempt any man to follow his example probably not uninfluenced by these considerations his catholic majestys consulgeneral for egypt kept his theories to himself throughout a long life for telliamed the only scientific work which is known to have proceeded from his pen was not printed till 1735 when its author had reached the ripe age of seventynine and though de maillet lived three years longer his book was not given to the world before 1748 even then it was anonymous to those who were not in the secret of the anagrammatic character of its title and the preface and dedication are so worded as in case of necessity to give the printer a fair chance of falling back on the excuse that the work was intended for a mere jeu desprit  the speculations of the suppositious indian sage though quite as sound as those of many a mosaic geology which sells exceedingly well have no great value if we consider them by the light of modern science the waters are supposed to have originally covered the whole globe to have deposited the rocky masses which compose its mountains by processes comparable to those which are now forming mud sand and shingle and then to have gradually lowered their level leaving the spoils of their animal and vegetable inhabitants embedded in the strata as the dry land appeared certain of the aquatic animals are supposed to have taken to it and to have become gradually adapted to terrestrial and aerial modes of existence but if we regard the general tenor and style of the reasoning in relation to the state of knowledge of the day two circumstances appear very well worthy of remark the first that de maillet had a notion of the modifiability of living forms though without any precise information on the subject and how such modifiability might account for the origin of species the second that he very clearly apprehended the great modern geological doctrine so strongly insisted upon by hutton and so ably and comprehensively expounded by lyell that we must look to existing causes for the explanation of past geological events indeed the following passage of the preface in which de maillet is supposed to speak of the indian philosopher telliamed his alter ego might have been written by the most philosophical uniformitarian of the present day  ce quil y a detonnant est que pour arriver a ces connoissances il semble avoir perverti lordre naturel puisquau lieu de sattacher dabord a rechercher lorigine de notre globe il a commence par travailler a sinstruire de la nature mais a lentendre ce renversement de lordre a ete pour lui leffet dun genie favorable qui la conduit pas a pas et comme

origine de ce globe que nous habitons comment et par qui il a ete formepp xix xx  but de maillet was before his age and as could hardly fail to happen to one who speculated on a zoological and botanical question before linnaeus and on a physiological problem before haller he fell into great errors here and there and hence perhaps the general neglect of his work robinets speculations are rather behind than in advance of those of de maillet and though linnaeus may have played with the hypothesis of transmutation it obtained no serious support until lamarck adopted it and advocated it with great ability in his philosophie zoologique  impelled towards the hypothesis of the transmutation of species partly by his general cosmological and geological views partly by the conception of a graduated though irregularly branching scale of being which had arisen out of his profound study of plants and of the lower forms of animal life lamarck whose general line of thought often closely resembles that of de maillet made a great advance upon the crude and merely speculative manner in which that writer deals with the question of the origin of living beings by endeavouring to find physical causes competent to effect that change of one species into another which de maillet had only supposed to occur and lamarck conceived that he had found in nature such causes amply sufficient for the purpose in view it is a physiological fact he says that organs are increased in size by action atrophied by inaction it is another physiological fact that modifications produced are transmissible to offspring change the actions of an animal therefore and you will change its structure by increasing the development of the parts newly brought into use and by the diminution of those less used but by altering the circumstances which surround it you will alter its actions and hence in the long run change of circumstance must produce change of organization all the species of animals therefore are in lamarcks view the result of the indirect action of changes of circumstance upon those primitive germs which he considered to have originally arisen by spontaneous generation within the waters of the globe it is curious however that lamarck should insist so strongly 5 as he has done that circumstances never in any degree directly modify the form or the organization of animals but only operate by changing their wants and consequently their actions for he thereby brings upon himself the obvious question how then do plants which cannot be said to have wants or actions become modified to this he replies that they are modified by the changes in their nutritive processes which are effected by changing circumstances and it does not seem to have occurred to him that such changes might be as well supposed to take place among animals   when we have said that lamarck felt that mere speculation was not the way to arrive at the origin of species but that it was necessary in order to the establishment of any sound theory on the subject to discover by observation or otherwise some vera causa competent to give rise to them that he affirmed the true order of classification to coincide with the order of their development one from another that he insisted on the necessity of allowing sufficient time very strongly and that all the varieties of instinct and reason were traced back by him to the same cause as that which has given rise to species we have enumerated his chief contributions to the advance of the question on the other hand from his ignorance of any power in nature competent to modify the structure of animals except the development of parts or atrophy of them in consequence of a change of needs lamarck was led to attach infinitely greater weight than it deserves to this agency and the absurdities into which he was led have met with deserved condemnation of the struggle for existence on which as we shall see mr darwin lays such great stress he had no conception indeed he doubts whether there really are such things as extinct species unless they be such large animals as may have met their death at the hands of man and so little does he dream of there being any other destructive causes at work that in discussing the possible existence of fossil shells he asks pourquoi dailleurs seroientils perdues des que lhomme na pu operer leur destruction phil zool vol i p 77 of the influence of selection lamarck has as little notion and he makes no use of the wonderful phenomena which are exhibited by domesticated animals and illustrate its powers the vast influence of cuvier was employed against the lamarckian views and as the untenability of some of his conclusions was easily shown his doctrines sank under the opprobrium of scientific as well as of theological heterodoxy nor have the efforts made of late years to revive them tended to reestablish their credit in the minds of sound thinkers acquainted with the facts of the case indeed it may be doubted whether lamarck has not suffered more from his friends than from his foes  two years ago in fact though we venture to question if even the strongest supporters of the special creation hypothesis had not now and then an uneasy consciousness that all was not right their position seemed more impregnable than ever if not by its own inherent strength at any rate by the obvious failure of all the attempts which had been made to carry it on the other hand however much the few who thought deeply on the question of species might be repelled by the generally received dogmas they saw no way of escaping from them save by the adoption of suppositions so little justified by experiment or by observation as to be at least equally distasteful  the choice lay between two absurdities and a middle condition of uneasy scepticism which last however unpleasant and unsatisfactory was obviously the only justifiable state of mind under the circumstances  such being the general ferment in the minds of naturalists it is no wonder that they mustered strong in the rooms of the linnaean society on the 1st of july of the year 1858 to hear two papers by authors living on opposite sides of the globe working out their results independently and yet professing to have discovered one and the same solution of all the problems connected with species the one of these authors was an able naturalist mr wallace who had been employed for some years in studying the productions of the islands of the indian archipelago and who had forwarded a memoir embodying his views to mr darwin for communication to the linnaean society on perusing the essay mr darwin was not a little surprised to find that it embodied some of the leading ideas of a great work which he had been preparing for twenty years and parts of which containing a development of the very same views had been perused by his private friends fifteen or sixteen years before perplexed in what manner to do full justice both to his friend and to himself mr darwin placed the matter in the hands of dr hooker and sir charles lyell by whose advice he communicated a brief abstract of his own views to the linnaean society at the same time that mr wallaces paper was read of that abstract the work on the origin of species is an enlargement but a complete statement of mr darwins doctrine is looked for in the large and wellillustrated work which he is said to be preparing for publication  the darwinian hypothesis has the merit of being eminently simple and comprehensible in principle and its essential positions may be stated in a very few words all species have been produced by the development of varieties from common stocks by the conversion of these first into permanent races and then into new species by the process of natural selection which process is essentially identical with that artificial selection by which man has originated the races of domestic animalsthe struggle for existence taking the place of man and exerting in the case of natural selection that selective action which he performs in artificial selection  the evidence brought forward by mr darwin in support of his hypothesis is of three kinds first he endeavours to prove that species may be originated by selection secondly he attempts to show that natural causes are competent to exert selection and thirdly he tries to prove that the most remarkable and apparently anomalous phenomena exhibited by the distribution development and mutual relations of species can be shown to be deducible from the general doctrine of their origin which he propounds combined with the known facts of geological change and that even if all these phenomena are not at present explicable by it none are necessarily inconsistent with it  there cannot be a doubt that the method of inquiry which mr darwin has adopted is not only rigorously in accordance with the canons of scientific logic but that it is the only adequate method critics exclusively trained in classics or in mathematics who have never determined a scientific fact in their lives by induction from experiment or observation prate learnedly about mr darwins method which is not inductive enough not baconian enough forsooth for them but even if practical acquaintance with the process of scientific investigation is denied them they may learn by the perusal of mr mills admirable chapter on the deductive method that there are multitudes of scientific inquiries in which the method of pure induction helps the investigator but a very little way  the mode of investigation says mr mill which from the proved inapplicability of direct methods of observation and experiment remains to us as the main source of the knowledge we possess or can acquire respecting the conditions and laws of recurrence of the more complex phenomena is called in its most general expression the deductive method and consists of three operations the first one of direct induction the second of ratiocination and the third of verification  now the conditions which have determined the existence of species are not only exceedingly complex but so far as the great majority of them are concerned are necessarily beyond our cognizance but what mr darwin has attempted to do is in exact accordance with the rule laid down by mr mill he has endeavoured to determine certain great facts inductively by observation and experiment he has then reasoned from the data thus furnished and lastly he has tested the validity of his ratiocination by comparing his deductions with the observed facts of nature inductively mr darwin endeavours to prove that species arise in a given way deductively he desires to show that if they arise in that way the facts of distribution development classification etc may be accounted for ie may be deduced from their mode of origin combined with admitted changes in physical geography and climate during an indefinite period and this explanation or coincidence of observed with deduced facts is so far as it extends a verification of the darwinian view  there is no fault to be found with mr darwins method then but it is another question whether he has fulfilled all the conditions imposed by that method is it satisfactorily proved in fact that species may be originated by selection that there is such a thing as natural selection that none of the phenomena exhibited by species are inconsistent with the origin of species in this way if these questions can be answered in the affirmative mr darwins view steps out of the rank of hypotheses into those of proved theories but so long as the evidence at present adduced falls short of enforcing that affirmation so long to our minds must the new doctrine be content to remain among the formeran extremely valuable and in the highest degree probable doctrine indeed the only extant hypothesis which is worth anything in a scientific point of view but still a hypothesis and not yet the theory of species  after much consideration and with assuredly no bias against mr darwins views it is our clear conviction that as the evidence stands it is not absolutely proven that a group of animals having all the characters exhibited by species in nature has ever been originate by selection whether artificial or natural groups having the morphological character of species distinct and permanent races in fact have been so produced over and over again but there is no positive evidence at present that any group of animals has by variation and selective breeding given rise to another group which was even in the least degree infertile with the first mr darwin is perfectly aware of this weak point and brings forward a multitude of ingenious and important arguments to diminish the force of the objection we admit the value of these arguments to their fullest extent nay we will go so far as to express our belief that experiments conducted by a skilful physiologist would very probably obtain the desired production of mutually more or less infertile breeds from a common stock in a comparatively few years but still as the case stands at present this little rift within the lute is not to be disguised nor overlooked  in the remainder of mr darwins argument our own private ingenuity has not hitherto enabled us to pick holes of any great importance and judging by what we hear and read other adventurers in the same field do not seem to have been much more fortunate it has been urged for instance that in his chapters on the struggle for existence and on natural selection mr darwin does not so much prove that natural selection does occur as that it must occur but in fact no other sort of demonstration is attainable a race does not attract our attention in nature until it has in all probability existed for a considerable time and then it is too late to inquire into the conditions of its origin again it is said that there is no real analogy between the selection which takes place under domestication by human influence and any operation which can be effected by nature for man interferes intelligently reduced to its elements this argument implies that an effect produced with trouble by an intelligent agent must a fortiori be more troublesome if not impossible to an unintelligent agent even putting aside the question whether nature acting as she does according to definite and invariable laws can be rightly called an unintelligent agent such a position as this is wholly untenable mix salt and sand and it shall puzzle the wisest of men with his mere natural appliances to separate all the grains of sand from all the grains of salt but a shower of rain will effect the same object in ten minutes and so while man may find it tax all his intelligence to separate any variety which arises and to breed selectively from it the destructive agencies incessantly at work in nature if they find one variety to be more soluble in circumstances than the other will inevitably in the long run eliminate it  a frequent and a just objection to the lamarckian hypothesis of the transmutation of species is based upon the absence of transitional forms between many species but against the darwinian hypothesis this argument has no force indeed one of the most valuable and suggestive parts of mr darwins work is that in which he proves that the frequent absence of transitions is a necessary consequence of his doctrine and that the stock whence two or more species have sprung need in no respect be intermediate between these species if any two species have arisen from a common stock in the same way as the carrier and the pouter say have arisen from the rockpigeon then the common stock of these two species need be no more intermediate between the two than the rockpigeon is between the carrier and pouter clearly appreciate the force of this analogy and all the arguments against the origin of species by selection based on the absence of transitional forms fall to the ground and mr darwins position might we think have been even stronger than it is if he had not embarrassed himself with the aphorism natura non facit saltum which turns up so often in his pages we believe as we have said above that nature does make jumps now and then and a recognition of the fact is of no small importance in disposing of many minor objections to the doctrine of transmutation  but we must pause the discussion of mr darwins arguments in detail would lead us far beyond the limits within which we proposed at starting to confine this article our object has been attained if we have given an intelligible however brief account of the established facts connected with species and of the relation of the explanation of those facts offered by mr darwin to the theoretical views held by his predecessors and his contemporaries and above all to the requirements of scientific logic we have ventured to point out that it does not as yet satisfy all those requirements but we do not hesitate to assert that it is as superior to any preceding or contemporary hypothesis in the extent of observational and experimental basis on which it rests in its rigorously scientific method and in its power of explaining biological phenomena as was the hypothesis of copernicus to the speculations of ptolemy but the planetary orbits turned out to be not quite circular after all and grand as was the service copernicus rendered to science kepler and newton had to come after him what if the orbit of darwinism should be a little too circular what if species should offer residual phenomena here and there not explicable by natural selection twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is or is not the case but in either event they will owe the author of the origin of species an immense debt of gratitude we should leave a very wrong impression on the readers mind if we permitted him to suppose that the value of that work depends wholly on the ultimate justification of the theoretical views which it contains on the contrary if they were disproved tomorrow the book would still be the best of its kindthe most compendious statement of wellsifted facts bearing on the doctrine of species that has ever appeared the chapters on variation on the struggle for existence on instinct on hybridism on the imperfection of the geological record on geographical distribution have not only no equals but so far as our knowledge goes no competitors within the range of biological literature and viewed as a whole we do not believe that since the publication of von baers researches on development thirty years ago any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence not only on the future of biology but in extending the domination of science over regions of thought into which she has as yet hardly penetrated    footnote 1 the westminster review april 1860  footnote 2 on the osteology of the chimpanzees and orangs
