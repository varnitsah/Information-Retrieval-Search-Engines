readers   with the sea fairies my book for 1911 i ventured into a new field of fairy literature and to my delight the book was received with much approval by my former readers many of whom have written me that they like trot almost as well as dorothy as dorothy was an old old friend and trot a new one i think this is very high praise for capn bills little companion capn bill is also a new character who seems to have won approval and so both trot and the old sailor are again introduced in the present story which may be called the second of the series of adventures of trot and capn bill  but you will recognize some other acquaintances in sky island here for instance is buttonbright who once had an adventure with dorothy in oz and without buttonbright and his magic umbrella you will see that the story of sky island could never have been written as polychrome the rainbows daughter lives in the sky it is natural that trot and buttonbright meet her during their adventures there  this story of sky island has astonished me considerably and i think it will also astonish you the sky country is certainly a remarkable fair land but after reading about it i am sure you will agree with me that our old mother earth is a very good place to live upon and that trot and buttonbright and capn bill were fortunate to get back to it again  by the way one of my little correspondents has suggested that i print my address in this book so that the children may know where letters will reach me i am doing this as you see and hope that many will write to me and tell me how they like sky island my greatest treasures are these letters from my readers and i am always delighted to receive them  l frank baum  ozcot at hollywood in california     a mysterious arrival  chapter 1   hello said the boy  hello answered trot looking up surprised where did you come from  philadelphia said he  dear me said trot youre a long way from home then  bout as far as i can get in this country the boy replied gazing out over the water isnt this the pacific ocean  of course  why of course he asked  because its the biggest lot of water in all the world  how do you know  capn bill told me she said  whos capn bill  an old sailorman whos a friend of mine he lives at my house toothe white house you see over there on the bluff  oh is that your home  yes said trot proudly isnt it pretty  its pretty small seems to me answered the boy  but its big enough for mother and me an for capn bill said trot  havent you any father  yes ndeed capn griffith is my father but hes gone most of the time sailin on his ship you mus be a stranger in these parts little boy not to know bout capn griffith she added looking at her new acquaintance intently  trot wasnt very big herself but the boy was not quite as big as trot he was thin with a rather pale complexion and his blue eyes were round and earnest he wore a blouse waist a short jacket and knickerbockers under his arm he held an old umbrella that was as tall as he was its covering had once been of thick brown cloth but the color had faded to a dull drab except in the creases and trot thought it looked very oldfashioned and common the handle though was really curious it was of wood and carved to resemble an elephants head the long trunk of the elephant was curved to make a crook for the handle the eyes of the beast were small red stones and it had two tiny tusks of ivory  the boys dress was rich and expensive even to his fine silk stockings and tan shoes but the umbrella looked old and disreputable  it isnt the rainy season now remarked tot with a smile  the boy glanced at his umbrella and hugged it tighter no he said but umbrellas are good for other things sides rain  fraid of gettn sunstruck asked trot  he shook his head still gazing far out over the water i dont blieve this is bigger than any other ocean said he i cant see any more of it than i can of the atlantic  youd find out if you had to sail across it she declared  when i was in chicago i saw lake michigan he went on dreamily and it looked just as big as this water does  looks dont count with oceans she asserted your eyes can only see jus so far whether youre lookin at a pond or a great sea  then it doesnt make any difference how big an ocean is he replied what are those buildings over there pointing to the right along the shore of the bay  thats the town said trot most of the people earn their living by fishing the town is half a mile from here an my house is almost a halfmile the other way so its bout a mile from my house to the town  the boy sat down beside her on the flat rock  do you like girls asked trot making room for him  not very well the boy replied some of em are pretty good fellows but not many the girls with brothers are bossy an the girls without brothers havent any go to em but the worlds full o both kinds and so i try to take em as they come they cant help being girls of course do you like boys  when they dont put on airs or get roughhouse replied trot my sperience with boys is that they dont know much but think they do  thats true he answered i dont like boys much better than i do girls but some are all right andyou seem to be one of em  much obliged laughed trot you arent so bad either an if we dont both turn out worse than we seem we ought to be friends  he nodded rather absently and tossed a pebble into the water been to town he asked  yes mother wanted some yarn from the store shes knittin capn bill a stocking  doesnt he wear but one  thats all capn bill has one wooden leg she explained thats why he dont sailor any more im glad of it cause capn bill knows evrything i spose he knows more than anyone else in all the world  whew said the boy thats taking a good deal for granted a onelegged sailor cant know much  why not asked trot a little indignantly folks dont learn things with their legs do they  no but they cant get around without legs to find out things  capn bill got round lively nough once when he had two meat legs she said hes sailed to most evry country on the earth an found out all that the people in em knew and a lot besides he was shipwrecked on a desert island once and another time a cannibal king tried to boil him for dinner an one day a shark chased him seven leagues through the water an  whats a league asked the boy  its aa distance like a mile is but a league isnt a mile you know  what is it then  youll have to ask capn bill he knows everthing  not everthing objected the boy i know some things capn bill dont know  if you do youre pretty smart said trot  no im not smart some folks think im stupid i guess i am but i know a few things that were wonderful capn bill may know moren i doa good deal morebut im sure he cant know the same things say whats your name  im mayre griffith but everbody calls me trot is a nickname i got when i was a baby cause i trotted so fast when i walked an it seems to stick whats your name  buttonbright  how did it happen  how did what happen  such a funny name  the boy scowled a little just like your own nickname happened he answered gloomily my father once said i was bright as a button an it made everbody laugh so they always call me buttonbright  whats your real name she inquired  saladin paracelsus de lambertine evagne von smith  guess ill call you buttonbright said trot sighing the only other thing would be salad an i dont like salads dont you find it hard work to member all of your name  i dont try to he said theres a lot more of it but ive forgotten the rest  thank you said trot oh here comes capn bill as she glanced over her shoulder  buttonbright turned also and looked solemnly at the old sailor who came stumping along the path toward them capn bill wasnt a very handsome man he was old not very tall somewhat stout and chubby with a round face a bald head and a scraggly fringe of reddish whisker underneath his chin but his blue eyes were frank and merry and his smile like a ray of sunshine he wore a sailor shirt with a broad collar a short peajacket and widebottomed sailor trousers one leg of which covered his wooden limb but did not hide it as he came pegging along the pathas he himself described his hobbling walkhis hands were pushed into his coat pockets a pipe was in his mouth and his black neckscarf was fluttering behind him in the breeze like a sable banner  buttonbright liked the sailors looks there was something very winningsomething jolly and carefree and honest and sociableabout the ancient seaman that made him everybodys friend so the strange boy was glad to meet him  well well trot he said coming up is this the way you hurry to town  no for im on my way back said she i did hurry when i was going capn bill but on my way home i sat down here to rest an watch the gullsthe gulls seem awful busy today capn billan then i found this boy  capn bill looked at the boy curiously dont think as ever i sawr him at the village he remarked guess as youre a stranger my lad  buttonbright nodded  haint walked the nine mile from the railroad station have ye asked capn bill  no said buttonbright  the sailor glanced around him dont see no waggin er no autymobl he added  no said buttonbright  catch a ride wi some one  buttonbright shook his head  a boat cant land here the rocks is too thick an too sharp continued capn bill peering down toward the foot of the bluff on which they sat and against which the waves broke in foam  no said buttonbright i didnt come by water  trot laughed he must a dropped from the sky capn bill she exclaimed  buttonbright nodded very seriously thats it he said  oh a airship eh cried capn bill in surprise ive hearn tell o them sky keeridges somethn like flyin autymobls aint they  i dont know said buttonbright ive never seen one  both trot and capn bill now looked at the boy in astonishment now then lemme think a minute said the sailor reflectively heres a riddle for us to guess trot he dropped from the sky he says an yet he didnt come in a airship    riddlecum riddlecum ree   what can the answer be  trot looked the boy over carefully she didnt see any wings on him the only queer thing about him was his big umbrella oh she said suddenly clapping her hands together i know now  do you asked capn bill doubtfully then youre some smarter ner i am mate  he sailed down with the umbrel she cried he used his umbrel as a parapara  shoot said capn bill theyre called parashoots mate but why i cant say did you drop down in that way my lad he asked the boy  yes said buttonbright that was the way  but how did you get up there asked trot you had to get up in the air before you could drop down anoh capn bill he says hes from phillydelfy which is a big city way at the other end of america  are you asked the sailor surprised  buttonbright nodded again i ought to tell you my story he said and then youd understand but im afraid you wont believe me and he suddenly broke off and looked toward the white house in the distance didnt you say you lived over there he inquired  yes said trot wont you come home with us  id like to replied buttonbright  all right lets go then said the girl jumping up  the three walked silently along the path the old sailorman had refilled his pipe and lighted it again and he smoked thoughtfully as he pegged along beside the children know anyone around here he asked buttonbright  no one but you two said the boy following after trot with his umbrella tucked carefully underneath his arm  and you dont know us very well remarked capn bill seems to me youre pretty young to be travelin so far from home an among strangers but i wont say anything more till weve heard your story then if you need my advice or trots adviceshes a wise little girl fer her size trot iswell freely give it an be glad to help you  thank you replied buttonbright i need a lot of things im sure and praps advice is one of em     the magic umbrella  chapter 2   when they reached the neat frame cottage which stood on a high bluff a little back from the sea and was covered with pretty green vines a woman came to the door to meet them she seemed motherly and good and when she saw buttonbright she exclaimed goodness me whos this youve got trot  its a boy ive just found explained the girl he lives way off in phillydelphy  mercy sakes alive cried mrs griffith looking into his upturned face i dont believe hes had a bite to eat since he started aint you hungry child  yes said buttonbright  run trot an get two slices o breadanbutter commanded mrs griffith cut em thick dear an use plenty of butter  sugar on em asked trot turning to obey  no said buttonbright just breadanbutters good enough when youre hungry and it takes time to spread sugar on  well have supper in an hour observed trots mother briskly but a hungry child cant wait a whole hour im sure what are you grinning at capn bill how dare you laugh when im talking stop it this minute you old pirate or ill know the reason why  i didnt mum said capn bill meekly i ony  stop right there sir how dare you speak when im talking she turned to buttonbright and her tone changed to one of much gentleness as she said come in the house my poor boy an rest yourself you seem tired out here give me that clumsy umbrella  no please said buttonbright holding the umbrella tighter  then put it in the rack behind the door she urged  the boy seemed a little frightened iid rather keep it with me if you please he pleaded  never mind capn bill ventured to say it wont worry him so much to hold the umbrella mum as to let it go guess hes afraid hell lose it but it aint any great shakes to my notion why see here buttonbright weve got halfadozen umbrellas in the closet thats better ner yours  perhaps said the boy yours may look a heap better sir butill keep this one if you please  where did you get it asked trot appearing just then with a plate of breadandbutter  itit belongs in our family said buttonbright beginning to eat and speaking between bites this umbrella has been in our family years an years an years but it was tucked away up in our attic an no one ever used it cause it wasnt pretty  dont blame em much remarked capn bill gazing at it curiously its a pretty oldlookin bumbershoot they were all seated in the vineshaded porch of the cottageall but mrs griffith who had gone into the kitchen to look after the supperand trot was on one side of the boy holding the plate for him while capn bill sat on the other side  it is old said buttonbright one of my greatgreatgrandfathers was a knightan arabian knightand it was he who first found this umbrella  an arabian night exclaimed trot why that was a magic night wasnt it  theres diffrent sorts o nights mate said the sailor an the knight buttonbright means aint the same night you mean soldiers used to be called knights but that were in the dark ages i guess an likely nough buttnbrights greatgranther were that sort of a knight  but he said an arabian knight persisted trot  well if he went to araby or was born there hed be an arabian knight wouldnt he the lads granther were probly a furriner an yours an mine were too trot if you go back far enough for ameriky wasnt diskivered in them days  there said trot triumphantly didnt i tell you buttonbright that capn bill knows everthing  he knows a lot i expect soberly answered the boy finishing the last slice of breadandbutter and then looking at the empty plate with a sigh but if he really knows everthing he knows about the magic umbrella so i wont have to tell you anything about it  magic cried trot with big eager eyes did you say magic umbrel buttonbright  i said magic but none of our family knew it was a magic umbrella till i found it out for myself youre the first people ive told the secret to he added glancing into their faces rather uneasily  glory me exclaimed the girl clapping her hands in ecstacy it must be jus elegant to have a magic umbrel  capn bill coughed he had a way of coughing when he was suspicious magic he observed gravely was once lyin round loose in the world that was in the dark ages i guess when the magic arabian nights was but the light o civilization has skeered it away long ago an magics been a lost art since long afore you an i was born trot  i know that fairies still live said trot reflectively she didnt like to contradict capn bill who knew everthing  so do i added buttonbright and i know theres magic still in the worldor in my umbrella anyhow  tell us about it begged the girl excitedly  well said the boy i found it all out by accident it rained in philadelphia for three whole days and all the umbrellas in our house were carried out by the family and lost or mislaid or something so that when i wanted to go to uncle bobs house which is at germantown there wasnt an umbrella to be found my governess wouldnt let me go without one and  oh said trot do you have a governess  yes but i dont like her shes cross she said i couldnt go to uncle bobs because i had no umbrella instead she told me to go up in the attic and play i was sorry bout that but i went up in the attic and pretty soon i found in a corner this old umbrella i didnt care how it looked it was whole and strong and big and would keep me from getting wet on the way to uncle bobs so off i started for the car but i found the streets awful muddy and once i stepped in a mudhole way up to my ankle gee i said i wish i could fly through the air to uncle bobs  i was holding up the open umbrella when i said that and as soon as i spoke the umbrella began lifting me up into the air i was awful scared at first but i held on tight to the handle and it didnt pull very much either i was going pretty fast for when i looked down all the big buildings were sliding past me so swift that it made me dizzy and before i really knew what had happened the umbrella settled down and stood me on my feet at uncle bobs front gate  i didnt tell anybody about the wonderful thing that had happened cause i thought no one would believe me uncle bob looked sharp at the thing an said buttonbright how did your father happen to let you take that umbrella he didnt i said father was away at the office so i found it in the attic an i jus took it then uncle bob shook his head an said i ought to leave it alone he said it was a famly relic that had been handed down from father to son for many generations but i told him my father had never handed it to me though im his son uncle bob said our famly always believed that it brought em good luck to own this umbrella he couldnt say why not knowing its early history but he was afraid that if i lost the umbrella bad luck would happen to us so he made me go right home to put the umbrella back where i got it i was sorry uncle bob was so cross and i didnt want to go home yet where the governess was crosser n he was i wonder why folks get cross when it rains but by that time it had stopped rainingfor awhile anyhowand uncle bob told me to go straight home and put the umbrella in the attic an never touch it again  when i was around the corner i thought id see if i could fly as i had before id heard of buffalo but i didnt know just where it was so i said to the umbrella take me to buffalo up in the air i went just as soon as i said it and the umbrella sailed so fast that i felt as if i was in a gale of wind it was a long long trip and i got awful tired holding onto the handle but just as i thought id have to let go i began to drop down slowly and then i found myself in the streets of a big city i put down the umbrella and asked a man what the name of the city was and he said buffalo  how wonderful gasped trot capn bill kept on smoking and said nothing  it was magic im sure said buttonbright it surely couldnt have been anything else  praps suggested trot the umbrella can do other magic things  no said the boy ive tried it when i landed in buffalo i was hot and thirsty i had ten cents car fare but i was afraid to spend it so i held up the umbrella and wished i had an icecream soda but i didnt get it then i wished for a nickel to buy an icecream soda with but i didnt get that either i got frightened and was afraid the umbrella didnt have any magic left so to try it i said take me to chicago i didnt want to go to chicago but that was the first place i thought of and i soon saw this was going to be another long journey so i called out to the umbrella never mind stop i guess i wont go to chicago ive changed my mind so take me home again but the umbrella wouldnt it kept right on flying and i shut my eyes and held on at last i landed in chicago and then i was in a pretty fix it was nearly dark and i was too tired and hungry to make the trip home again i knew id get an awful scolding too for running away and taking the family luck with me so i thought that as long as i was in for it id better see a good deal of the country while i had the chance i wouldnt be allowed to come away again you know  no of course not said trot  i bought some buns and milk with my ten cents and then i walked around the streets of chicago for a time and afterward slept on a bench in one of the parks in the morning i tried to get the umbrella to give me a magic breakfast but it wont do anything but fly i went to a house and asked a woman for something to eat and she gave me all i wanted and advised me to go straight home before my mother worried about me she didnt know i lived in philadelphia that was this morning  this mornin exclaimed capn bill why lad it takes three or four days for the railroad trains to get to this coast from chicago  i know replied buttonbright but i didnt come on a railroad train this umbrella goes faster than any train ever did this morning i flew from chicago to denver but no one there would give me any lunch a policeman said hed put me in jail if he caught me begging so i got away and told the umbrella to take me to the pacific ocean when i stopped i landed over there by the big rock i shut up the umbrella and saw a girl sitting on the rock so i went up and spoke to her thats all  goodness me said trot if that isnt a fairy story i never heard one  it is a fairy story agreed buttonbright anyhow its a magic story and the funny part of it is its true i hope you believe me but i dont know as id believe it myself if it hadnt been me that it happened to  i believe evry word of it declared trot earnestly  as fer me said capn bill slowly im goin to believe it too bymby when ive seen the umbrel fly once  youll see me fly away with it asserted the boy but at present its pretty late in the day and philadelphia is a good way off do you spose trot your mother would let me stay here all night  course she would answered trot weve got an extra room with a nice bed in it and wed love to have you stay just as long as you want to wouldnt we capn bill  right you are mate replied the old man nodding his bald head whether the umbrel is magic or not buttnbright is welcome  mrs griffith came out soon after and seconded the invitation so the boy felt quite at home in the little cottage it was not long before supper was on the table and in spite of all the breadandbutter he had eaten buttonbright had a fine appetite for the good things trots mother had cooked mrs griffith was very kind to the children but not quite so agreeable toward poor capn bill when the old sailorman at one time spilled some tea on the tablecloth trots mother flew angry and gave the culprit such a tonguelashing that buttonbright was sorry for him but capn bill was meek and made no reply hes used to it you know whispered trot to her new friend and indeed capn bill took it all cheerfully and never minded a bit  then it came trots turn to get a scolding when she opened the parcel she had bought at the village it was found she had selected the wrong color of yarn and mrs griffith was so provoked that trots scolding was almost as severe as that of capn bill tears came to the little girls eyes and to comfort her the boy promised to take her to the village next morning with his magic umbrella so she could exchange the yarn for the right color  trot quickly brightened at this promise although capn bill looked grave and shook his head solemnly when supper was over and trot had helped with the dishes she joined buttonbright and the sailorman on the little porch again dusk had fallen and the moon was just rising they all sat in silence for a time and watched the silver trail that topped the crests of the waves far out to sea  oh buttonbright cried the little girl presently im so glad youre going to let me fly with you way to town and back tomorrow wont it be fine capn bill  dunno trot said he i cant figger how both of you can hold on to the handle o that umbrel  trots face fell ill hold on to the handle said buttonbright and she can hold on to me it doesnt pull hard at all youve no idea how easy it is to fly that way after you get used to it  but trot aint used to it objected the sailor if she happened to lose her hold and let go its goodbye trot i dont like to risk it for trots my chum an i cant afford to lose her  cant you tie us together then asked the boy  well see well see replied capn bill and began to think very deeply he forgot that he didnt believe the umbrella could fly and after buttonbright and trot had both gone to bed the old sailor went out into the shed and worked a while before he too turned into his bunk the sandman wasnt around and capn bill lay awake for hours thinking of the strange tale of the magic umbrella before he finally sank into slumber then he dreamed about it and waking or dreaming he found the tale hard to believe     a wonderful experience  chapter 3   they had early breakfasts at trots house because they all went to bed early and it is possible to sleep only a certain number of hours if one is healthy in body and mind and right after breakfast trot claimed buttonbrights promise to take her to town with the magic umbrella  any time suits me said the boy he had taken his precious umbrella to bed with him and even carried it to the breakfast table where he stood it between his knees as he ate so now he held it close to him and said he was ready to fly at a moments notice this confidence impressed capn bill who said with a sigh  well if you must go trot ive pervided a machine thatll carry you both comftable im summat of an inventor myself though there aint any magic about me  then he brought from the shed the contrivance he had made the night before it was merely a swing seat he had taken a wide board that was just long enough for both the boy and girl to sit upon and had bored six holes in it two holes at each end and two in the middle through these holes he had run stout ropes in such a way that the seat could not turn and the occupants could hold on to the ropes on either side of them the ropes were all knotted together at the top where there was a loop that could be hooked upon the crooked handle of the umbrella  buttonbright and trot both thought capn bills invention very clever the sailor placed the board upon the ground while they sat in their places buttonbright at the right of trot and then the boy hooked the rope loop to the handle of the umbrella which he spread wide open i want to go to the town over yonder he said pointing with his finger to the roofs of the houses that showed around the bend in the cliff  at once the umbrella rose into the air slowly at first but quickly gathering speed trot and buttonbright held fast to the ropes and were carried along very easily and comfortably it seemed scarcely a minute before they were in the town and when the umbrella set them down just in front of the storefor it seemed to know just where they wanted to goa wondering crowd gathered around them trot ran in and changed the yarn while buttonbright stayed outside and stared at the people who stared at him they asked questions too wanting to know what sort of an aeroplane this was and where his power was stored and lots of other things but the boy answered not a sound when the little girl came back and took her seat buttonbright said i want to go to trots house  the simple villagers could not understand how the umbrella suddenly lifted the two children into the air and carried them away they had read of airships but here was something wholly beyond their comprehension  capn bill had stood in front of the house watching with a feeling akin to bewilderment the flight of the magic umbrella he could follow its course until it descended in the village and he was so amazed and absorbed that his pipe went out he had not moved from his position when the umbrella started back the sailors big blue eyes watched it draw near and settle down with its passengers upon just the spot it had started from  trot was joyous and greatly excited oh capn its gallorious she cried in ecstasy it beats ridin in a boat ororin anything else you feel so light an free ananglad im sorry the trip didnt last longer though only trouble is you go too fast  buttonbright was smiling contentedly he had proved to both trot and capn bill that he had told the truth about the magic umbrella however marvelous his tale had seemed to them ill take you on another trip if you like said he im in no hurry to go home and if you will let me stay with you another day we can make two or three little trips with the family luck  you mus stay a whole week said trot decidedly an you mus take capn bill for an airride too  oh trot i dunno as id like it protested capn bill nervously  yes you would youre sure to like it  i guess im too heavy  im sure the umbrella could carry twenty people if they could be fastened to the handle said buttonbright  solid lands pretty good to hold on to decided capn bill a rope might break you know  oh capn bill youre scared stiff said trot  i aint mate it aint that at all but i dont see that human critters has any call to fly in the air anyhow the air were made for the birds anan muskeeters an  an flyinfishes added trot i know all that capn but why wasnt it made for humans too if they can manage to fly in it we breathe the air an we can breathe it high up just as well as down on the earth  seein as you like it so much trot it would be cruel for me to go with buttnbright an leave you at home said the sailor when i were youngerwhich is ancient historyan afore i had a wooden leg i could climb a ships ropes with the best of em an walk out on a boom or stand atop a mast so you know very well i aint skeered about the highupness  why cant we all go together asked the boy make another seat capn and swing it right under ours then we can all three ride anywhere we want to go  yes do exclaimed trot and see here capn lets take a day off and have a picnic mother is a little cross today and she wants to finish knitting your new stockin so i guess shell be glad to get rid of us  wherell we go he asked shifting on his wooden leg uneasily  anywhere i dont care therell be the airride there an the airride back an thats the main thing with me if you say well go capn ill run in an pack a basket of lunch  howll we carry it  swing it to the bottom of your seat  the old sailor stood silent a moment he really longed to take the airride but was fearful of danger however trot had gone safely to town and back and had greatly enjoyed the experience all right he said ill risk it mate although i guess im an old fool for temptin fate by tryin to make a bird o myself get the lunch trot if your motherll let you have it and ill rig up the seat  he went into the shed and trot went to her mother mrs griffith busy with her work knew nothing of what was going on in regard to the flight of the magic umbrella she never objected when trot wanted to go away with capn bill for a days picnicking she knew the child was perfectly safe with the old sailor who cared for trot even better than her mother would have done if she had asked any questions today and had found out they intended to fly in the air she might have seriously objected but mrs griffith had her mind on other things and merely told the girl to take what she wanted from the cupboard and not bother her so trot remembering that buttonbright would be with them and had proved himself to be a hearty eater loaded the basket with all the good things she could find  by the time she came out lugging the basket with both hands capn bill appeared with the new seat he had made for his own use which he attached by means of ropes to the double seat of the boy and girl now then wherell we go asked trot  anywhere suits me replied capn bill they had walked to the high bluff overlooking the sea where a gigantic acacia tree stood on the very edge a seat had been built around the trunk of the tree for this was a favorite spot for trot and capn bill to sit and talk and watch the fleet of fishing boats sail to and from the village when they came to this tree trot was still trying to think of the most pleasant place to picnic she and capn bill had been every place that was desirable and nearby but today they didnt want a nearby spot they must decide upon one far enough away to afford them a fine trip through the air looking far out over the pacific the girls eyes fell upon a dim island lying on the horizon line just where the sky and water seemed to meet and the sight gave her an idea  oh capn bill she exclaimed lets go to that island for our picnic weve never been there yet you know  the sailor shook his head its a good many miles away trot he said further than it looks to be from here  that wont matter remarked buttonbright the umbrella will carry us there in no time  lets go repeated trot well never have another such chance capn its too far to sail or row and ive always wanted to visit that island  whats the name of it inquired buttonbright while the sailor hesitated to decide  oh its got an awful hard name to pernounce replied the girl so capn bill and i jus call it sky island cause it looks as if it was half in the sky weve been told its a very pretty island and a few people live there and keep cows and goats and fish for a living there are woods and pastures and springs of clear water and im sure we would find it a fine place for a picnic  if anything happened on the way observed capn bill wed drop in the water  of course said trot and if anything happened while we were flyin over the land wed drop there but nothings goin to happen capn didnt buttonbright come safe all the way from philydelfy  i think id like to go to sky island said the boy ive always flown above the land so far and it will be something new to fly over the ocean  all right im agreeble decided capn bill but afore we starts on such a long journey spose we make a little trial trip along the coast i want to see if the new seat fits me an make certain the umbrel will carry all three of us  very well said buttonbright where shall we go  lets go as far as smugglers cove an then turn round an come back if alls right an shipshape then we can start for the island  they put the broad double seat on the ground and then the boy and girl sat in their places and buttonbright spread open the magic umbrella capn bill sat in his seat just in front of them all being upon the ground  dont we look funny said trot with a chuckle of glee but hold fast the ropes capn an take care of your wooden leg  buttonbright addressed the umbrella speaking to it very respectfully for it was a thing to inspire awe i want to go as far as smugglers cove and then turn around in the air and come back here he said at once the umbrella rose into the air lifting after it first the seat in which the children sat and then capn bills seat  dont kick your heels trot cried the sailor in a voice that proved he was excited by his novel experience you might bump me in the nose  all right she called back ill be careful  it was really a wonderful exhilarating ride and capn bill wasnt long making up his mind he liked the sensation when about fifty feet above the ground the umbrella began moving along the coast toward smugglers cove which it soon reached looking downward capn bill suddenly exclaimed why there a boat cast loose an its goin to smash on the rocks hold on a minute buttnbright till we can land an drag it ashore  hold on a minute umbrella cried the boy but the magic umbrella kept steadily upon its way it made a circle over the cove and then started straight back the way it had come its no use sir said buttonbright to the sailor if i once tell it to go to a certain place the umbrella will go there and nowhere else ive found that out before this you simply cant stop it  wont let you change your mind eh replied capn bill well that has its advantidges an its disadvantiges if your ol umbrel hadnt been so obstinate we could have saved that boat  never mind said trot briskly here we are safe back again wasnt it jus thethe fascinatingest ride you ever took capn  its pretty good fun admitted capn bill beats them aeroplanes an things all holler cause it dont need any regulatin  if were going to that island we may as well start right away said buttonbright when they had safely landed  all right ill tie on the lunchbasket answered the sailor he fastened it so it would swing underneath his own seat and they all took their places again  ready asked the boy  let er go my lad  i want to go to sky island said buttonbright to the umbrella using the name trot had given him the umbrella started promptly it rose higher than before carrying the three voyagers with it and then started straight away over the ocean     the island in the sky  chapter 4   they clung tightly to the ropes but the breeze was with them so after a few moments when they became accustomed to the motion they began to enjoy the ride immensely  larger and larger grew the island and although they were headed directly toward it the umbrella seemed to rise higher and higher into the air the farther it traveled they had not journeyed ten minutes before they came directly over the island and looking down they could see the forests and meadows far below them but the umbrella kept up its rapid flight  hold on there cried capn bill if it aint keerful the ol thing will pass by the island  iim sure it has passed it already exclaimed trot whats wrong buttonbright why dont we stop  buttonbright seemed astonished too  perhaps i didnt say it right he replied after a moments thought then looking up at the umbrella he repeated distinctly i said i wanted to go to sky island sky island dont you understand  the umbrella swept steadily along getting farther and farther out to sea and rising higher and higher toward the clouds  mackrel an herrings roared capn bill now really frightened aint there any blamed way at all to stop her  none that i know of said buttonbright anxiously  praps said trot after a pause during which she tried hard to think praps sky island isnt the name of that island at all  why we know very well it aint the name of it yelled capn bill from below we jus called it that cause its right name is too hard to say  thats the whole trouble then returned buttonbright somewhere in the world theres a real sky island and having told the magic umbrella to take us there its going to do so  well i declare gasped the sailorman cant we land anywhere else  not unless you care to tumble off said the boy ive told the umbrella to take us to sky island so thats the exact place were bound for im sorry it was your fault for giving me the wrong name  they glided along in silence for a while the island was now far behind them growing small in the distance where do you spose the real sky island can be asked trot presently  we cant tell anything about it until we get there buttonbright answered seems to me ive heard of the isle of skye but thats over in great britain somewhere the other side of the world and it isnt sky island anyhow  this miserble ol umbrel is too perticler growled capn bill it wont let you change your mind an it goes ezzacly where you say  if it didnt said trot wed never know where we were going  we dont know now said the sailor one things certain folks were gettn a long way from home  and see how the clouds are rolling just above us remarked the boy who was almost as uneasy as capn bill  were in the sky all right said the girl if there could be an island up here among the clouds id think it was there were going  couldnt there be one asked buttonbright why couldnt there be an island in the sky that would be named sky island  of course not declared capn bill there wouldnt be anything to hold it up you know  whats holding us up asked trot  magic i guess  then magic might hold an island in the sky wheeee what a black cloud  it grew suddenly dark for they were rushing through a thick cloud that rolled around them in billows trot felt little drops of moisture striking her face and knew her clothing was getting damp and soggy its a rain cloud she said to buttonbright and it seems like an awful big one cause it takes so long for us to pass through it  the umbrella never hesitated a moment it made a path through the length of the heavy black cloud at last and carried its passengers into a misty billowy bank of white which seemed as soft and fleecy as a ladys veil when this broke away they caught sight of a majestic rainbow spanning the heavens its gorgeous colors glinting brightly in the sun its arch perfect and unbroken from end to end but it was only a glimpse they had for quickly they dove into another bank of clouds and the rainbow disappeared  here the clouds were not black nor heavy but they assumed queer shapes some were like huge ships some like forest trees and others piled themselves into semblances of turreted castles and wonderful palaces the shapes shifted here and there continually and the voyagers began to be bewildered by the phantoms  seems to me were goin down called trot  down where asked capn bill  who knows said buttonbright but were dropping all right  it was a gradual descent the magic umbrella maintained a uniform speed swift and unfaltering but its path through the heavens was now in the shape of an arch as a flying arrow falls the queer shapes of the clouds continued for some time and once or twice trot was a little frightened when a monstrous airy dragon passed beside them or a huge giant stood upon a peak of cloud and stared savagely at the intruders into his domain but none of these fanciful vapory creatures seemed inclined to molest them or to interfere with their flight and after a while the umbrella dipped below this queer cloudland and entered a clear space where the sky was of an exquisite blue color  oh look called capn bill theres land below us the boy and girl leaned over and tried to see this land but capn bill was also leaning over and his big body hid all that was just underneath them  is it an island asked trot solemnly  seems so the old sailor replied the blue is around all one side of it an a pink sunshine around the other side theres a big cloud just over the middle but i guess its surely an island trot an bein as its in the sky its likely to be sky island  then we shall land there said the boy confidently i knew the umbrella wouldnt make a mistake  presently capn bill spoke again were goin down on the blue part o the island he said i can see trees an ponds an houses hold tight trot hold tight buttnbright im afeared were agoin to bump somethin  they were certainly dropping very quickly now and the rush of air made their eyes fill with water so that they could not see much below them suddenly the basket that was dangling below capn bill struck something with a loud thud and this was followed by a yell of anger capn bill sat flat upon the ground landing with such a force that jarred the sailorman and made his teeth click together while down upon him came the seat that trot and buttonbright occupied so that for a moment they were all tangled up  get off from me get off from my feet i say cried an excited voice what in the sky do you mean by sitting on my feet get off get off at once     the boolooroo of the blues  chapter 5   capn bill suspected that these remarks were addressed to him but he couldnt move just then because the seat was across him and a boy and girl were sprawling on the seat as the magic umbrella was now as motionless as any ordinary umbrella might be buttonbright first released the catch and closed it up after which he unhooked the crooked handle from the rope and rose to his feet trot had managed by this time to stand up and she pulled the board off from capn bill all this time the shrill excited voice was loudly complaining because the sailor was on his feet and trot looked to see who was making the protest while capn bill rolled over and got on his hands and knees so he could pull his meat leg and his wooden leg into an upright position which wasnt a very easy thing to do  buttonbright and trot were staring with all their might at the queerest person they had ever seen they decided it must be a man because he had two long legs a body as round as a ball a neck like an ostrich and a comical little head set on the top of it but the most curious thing about him was his skin which was of a lovely skyblue tint his eyes were also skyblue and his hair which was trained straight up and ended in a curl at the top of his head was likewise blue in color and matched his skin and his eyes he wore tightfitting clothes made of skyblue silk with a broad blue ruffle around his long neck and on his breast glittered a magnificent jewel in the form of a star set with splendid blue stones  if the blue man astonished the travelers they were no less surprised by his surroundings for look where they might everything they beheld was of the same blue color as the sky above they seemed to have landed in a large garden surrounded by a high wall of blue stone the trees were all blue the grass was blue the flowers were blue and even the pebbles in the paths were blue there were many handsomely carved benches and seats of blue wood scattered about the garden and near them stood a fountain made of blue marble which shot lovely sprays of blue water into the blue air  but the angry inhabitants of this blue place would not permit them to look around them in peace for as soon as capn bill rolled off his toes he began dancing around in an excited way and saying very disrespectful things of his visitors you brutes you apes you miserable whiteskinned creatures how dare you come into my garden and knock me on the head with that awful basket and then fall on my toes and cause me pain and suffering how dare you i say dont you know you will be punished for your impudence dont you know the boolooroo of the blues will have revenge i can have you patched for this insult and i willjust as sure as im the royal boolooroo of sky island  oh is this sky island then asked trot  of course its sky island what else could it be and im its ruler its king its sole royal potentate and dictator behold in the personage you have injured the mighty quitey righty boolooroo of the blues here he strutted around in a very pompous manner and wagged his little head contemptuously at them  glad to meet you sir said capn bill i allus had a likin for kings bein as theyre summat unusual please scuse me for asittin on your royal toes not knowin as your toes were there  i wont excuse you roared the boolooroo but ill punish you you may depend upon that  seems to me said trot youre actin rather imperlite to strangers if anyone comes to our country to visit us we always treat em decent  your country exclaimed the boolooroo looking at them more carefully and seeming interested in their appearance where in the sky did you come from then and where is your country located  we live on the earth when were at home replied the girl  the earth nonsense ive heard of the earth my child but it isnt inhabited no one can live there because its just a round cold barren ball of mud and water declared the blueskin  oh youre wrong about that said buttonbright  you surely are added capn bill  why we live there ourselves cried trot  i dont believe it i believe you are living in sky island where you have no right to be with your horrid white skins and youve intruded into the private garden of the palace of the greatly stately irately boolooroo which is a criminal offense and youve bumped my head with your basket and smashed my toes with your boards and bodies which is a crime unparalleled in all the history of sky island arent you sorry for yourselves  im sorry for you replied trot cause you dont seem to know the proper way to treat visitors but we wont stay long well go home pretty soon  not until you have been punished exclaimed the boolooroo sternly you are my prisoners  beg parding your majesty said capn bill but youre takin a good deal for granted weve tried to be friendly and peaceable an weve poligized for hurtin you but if that dont satisfy you youll have to make the most of it you may be the boolooroo of the blues but you aint even a tin whistle to us an you cant skeer us for half a minute im an ol man myself but if you dont behave ill spank you like i would a baby an it wont be any trouble at all to do it thanke as a matter o fact weve captured your whole bloomin blue island but we dont like the place very much and i guess well give it back it gives us the blues dont it trot so as soon as we eat a bite of lunch from our basket well sail away again  sail away how asked the boolooroo  with the magic umbrel said capn bill pointing to the umbrella that buttonbright was holding underneath his arm  oh ho i see i see said the boolooroo nodding his funny head go ahead then and eat your lunch  he retreated a little way to a marble seat beside the fountain but watched the strangers carefully capn bill feeling sure he had won the argument whispered to the boy and girl that they must eat and get away as soon as possible as this might prove a dangerous country for them to remain in trot longed to see more of the strange blue island and especially wanted to explore the magnificent blue palace that adjoined the garden and which had six hundred tall towers and turrets but she felt that her old friend was wise in advising them to get away quickly so she opened the basket and they all three sat in a row on a stone bench and began to eat sandwiches and cake and pickles and cheese and all the good things that were packed in the lunch basket  they were hungry from the long ride and while they ate they kept their eyes busily employed in examining all the queer things around them the boolooroo seemed quite the queerest of anything and trot noticed that when he pulled the long curl that stuck up from the top of his head a bell tinkled somewhere in the palace he next pulled at the bottom of his right ear and another faraway bell tinkled then he touched the end of his nose and still another bell was faintly heard the boolooroo said not a word while he was ringing the bells and trot wondered if that was the way he amused himself but now the frown died away from his face and was replaced with a look of satisfaction  have you nearly finished he inquired  no said trot weve got to eat our apples yet  apples apples what are apples he asked  trot took some from the basket have one she said theyre awful good  the boolooroo advanced a step and took the apple which he regarded with much curiosity  guess they dont grow anywhere but on the earth remarked capn bill  are they good to eat asked the boolooroo  try it and see answered trot biting into an apple herself  the blueskin sat down on the end of their bench next to buttonbright and began to eat his apple he seemed to like it for he finished it in a hurry and when it was gone he picked up the magic umbrella  let that alone said buttonbright making a grab for it but the boolooroo jerked it away in an instant and standing up he held the umbrella behind him and laughed aloud  now then said he you cant get away until im willing to let you go you are my prisoners  i guess not returned capn bill and reaching out one of his long arms the sailorman suddenly grasped the boolooroo around his long thin neck and shook him until his whole body fluttered like a flag drop that umbrel drop it yelled capn bill and the boolooroo quickly obeyed the magic umbrella fell to the ground and buttonbright promptly seized it then the sailor let go his hold and the king staggered to a seat choking and coughing to get his breath back  i told you to let things alone growled capn bill if you dont behave your majesty this blue islandll have to get another boolooroo  why asked the blueskin  because ill probly spoil you for a king an mebbe for anything else anyhow youll get badly damaged if you try to interfere with us an thats a fact  dont kill him capn bill said trot cheerfully  kill me why he couldnt do that observed the king who was trying to rearrange the ruffle around his neck nothing can kill me  why not asked capn bill  because i havent lived my six hundred years yet perhaps you dont know that every blueskin in sky island lives exactly six hundred years from the time he is born  no i didnt know that admitted the sailor  its a fact said the king nothing can kill us until weve lived to the last day of our appointed lives when the final minute is up we die but were obliged to live all of the six hundred years whether we want to or not so you neednt think of trying to kill anybody on sky island it cant be done  never mind said capn bill im no murderer thank goodness and i wouldnt kill you if i could much as you deserve it  but isnt six hundred years an awful long time to live questioned trot  it seems like it at first replied the king but i notice that whenever any of my subjects get near the end of their six hundred they grow nervous and say the life is altogether too short  how long have you lived asked buttonbright  the king coughed again and turned a bit bluer that is considered an impertinent question in sky island he answered but i will say that every boolooroo is elected to reign three hundred years and ive reigned not quiteahemtwo hundred  are your kings elected then asked capn bill  yes of course this is a republic you know the people elect all their officers from the king down every man and every woman is a voter the boolooroo tells them whom to vote for and if they dont obey they are severely punished its a fine system of government and the only thing i object to is electing the boolooroo for only three hundred years it ought to be for life my successor has already been elected but he cant reign for a hundred years to come  i think three hundred years is plenty long enough said trot it gives someone else a chance to rule an i wouldnt be sprised if the next king is a better one seems to me youre not much of a boolooroo  that replied the king indignantly is a matter of opinion i like myself very much but i cant expect you to like me because youre deformed and ignorant  im not cried trot  yes you are your legs are too short and your neck is nothing at all your color is most peculiar but there isnt a shade of blue about any of you except the deepblue color of the clothes the old ape that choked me wears also you are ignorant because you know nothing of sky island which is the center of the universe and the only place anyone would care to live  dont listen to him trot said buttonbright hes an ignorant himself  capn bill packed up the lunch basket one end of the rope was still tied to the handle of the basket and the other end to his swing seat which lay on the ground before them  well said he lets go home weve seen enough of this blue country and its blue boolooroo i guess an its a long journey back again  all right agreed trot jumping up  buttonbright stood on the bench and held up the magic umbrella so he could open it and the sailor had just attached the ropes when a thin blue line shot out from behind them and in a twinkling wound itself around the umbrella at the same instant another blue cord wound itself around the boys body and others caught trot and capn bill in their coils so that all had their arms pinned fast to their sides and found themselves absolutely helpless     the six snubnosed princesses  chapter 6   the boolooroo was laughing and dancing around in front of them as if well pleased for a moment the prisoners could not imagine what had happened to them but presently half a dozen blueskins resembling in shape and costume their ruler but less magnificently dressed stepped in front of them and bowed low to the boolooroo  your orders most mighty flighty tight and righty monarch have been obeyed said the leader  very well captain take that umbrella and carry it to my royal treasury see that it is safely locked up heres the key and if you dont return it to me within five minutes ill have you patched  the captain took the key and the magic umbrella and hastened away to the palace buttonbright had already hooked the ropes to the elephanttrunk handle so that when the captain carried away the umbrella he dragged after him first the double seat then capn bills seat which was fastened to it and finally the lunchbasket which was attached to the lower seat at every few steps some of these would trip up the captain and cause him to take a tumble but as he had only five minutes time in which to perform his errand he would scramble to his feet again and dash along the path until a board or the basket tripped him up again  they all watched him with interest until he had disappeared within the palace when the king turned to his men and said  release the prisoners they are now quite safe and cannot escape me  so the men unwound the long cords that were twined around the bodies of our three friends and set them free these men seemed to be soldiers although they bore no arms except the cords each cord had a weight at the end and when the weight was skillfully thrown by a soldier it wound the cord around anything in the twinkling of an eye and held fast until it was unwound again  trot decided these blueskins must have stolen into the garden when summoned by the bells the boolooroo had rung but they had kept out of sight and crept up behind the bench on which our friends were seated until a signal from the king aroused them to action  the little girl was greatly surprised by the suddenness of her capture and so was buttonbright capn bill shook his head and said he was afeared theyd get into trouble our mistake he added was in stoppin to eat our lunch but its too late now to cry over spilt milk  i dont mind not much anyhow asserted trot bravely were in no hurry to get back are we buttonbright  im not said the boy if they hadnt taken the umbrella i wouldnt care how long we stopped in this funny island do you think its a fairy country trot  cant say im sure she answered i havent seen anything here yet that reminds me of fairies but capn bill said a floating island in the sky was sure to be a fairyland  i think so yet mate returned the sailor but theres all sorts o fairies ive heard some is good an some is bad an if all the blueskins are like their boolooroo they cant be called fustclass  dont let me hear any more impudence prisoners called the boolooroo sternly you are already condemned to severe punishment and if i have any further trouble with you you are liable to be patched  whats being patched inquired the girl  the soldiers all laughed at this question but the king did not reply just then a door in the palace opened and out trooped a group of girls there were six of them all gorgeously dressed in silken gowns with many puffs and tucks and ruffles and flounces and laces and ribbons everything being in some shade of blue grading from light blue to deep blue their blue hair was elaborately dressed and came to a point at the top of their heads the girls approached in a line along the garden path all walking with mincing steps and holding their chins high their skirts prevented their long legs from appearing as grotesque as did those of the men but their necks were so thin and long that the ruffles around them only made them seem the more absurd  ah said the king with a frown here come the six snubnosed princesses the most beautiful and aristocratic ladies in sky island  theyre snubnosed all right observed trot looking at the girls with much interest but i should think it would make em mad to call em that  why asked the boolooroo in surprise is not a snub nose the highest mark of female beauty  is it asked the girl  most certainly in this favored island which is the center of the universe a snub nose is an evidence of high breeding which any lady would be proud to possess  the six snubnosed princesses now approached the fountain and stood in a row staring with haughty looks at the strangers  goodness me your majesty exclaimed the first what queer dreadfullooking creatures are these where in all the sky did they come from  they say they came from the earth cerulia answered the boolooroo  but that is impossible said another princess our scientists have proved that the earth is not inhabited  your scientistsll have to guess again then said trot  but how did they get to sky island inquired the third snubnosed one  by means of a magic umbrella which i have captured and put away in my treasure chamber replied the boolooroo  what will you do with the monsters papa asked the fourth princess  i havent decided yet said the boolooroo theyre curiosities you see and may serve to amuse us but as theyre only half civilized i shall make them my slaves  what are they good for can they do anything useful asked the fifth  well see returned the king impatiently i cant decide in a hurry give me time azure give me time if theres anything i hate its a hurry  ive an idea your majesty announced the sixth snubnosed princess whose complexion was rather darker than that of her sisters and it has come to me quite deliberately without any hurry at all let us take the little girl to be our maidto wait upon us and amuse us when were dull all the other ladies of the court will be wild with envy and if the child doesnt prove of use to us we can keep her for a living pincushion  oh ah that will be fine cried all the other five and the boolooroo said  very well indigo it shall be as you desire then he turned to trot and added i present you to the six lovely snubnosed princesses to be their slave if you are good and obedient you wont get your ears boxed oftener than once an hour  i wont be anybodys slave protested trot i dont like these snubnosed fussy females an i wont have anything to do with em  how impudent cried cerulia  how vulgar cried turquoise  how unladylike cried sapphire  how silly cried azure  how absurd cried cobalt  how wicked cried indigo and then all six held up their hands as if horrified  the boolooroo laughed youll know how to bring her to time i imagine he remarked and if the girl isnt reasonable and obedient send her to me and ill have her patched now then take her away  but trot was obstinate and wouldnt budge a step keep us together your majesty begged capn bill if were to be slaves dont separate us but make us all the same kind o slaves  i shall do what pleases me declared the boolooroo angrily dont try to dictate old moonface for theres only one royal will in sky island and thats my own  he then gave a command to a soldier who hastened away to the palace and soon returned with a number of long blue ribbons one he tied around trots waist and then attached to it six other ribbons each of the six snubnosed princesses held the end of a ribbon and then they turned and marched haughtily away to the palace dragging the little girl after them  dont worry trot cried buttonbright well get you out of this trouble pretty soon  trust to us mate added capn bill well manage to take care o you  oh im all right answered trot with fine courage im not afraid of these gawkies  but the princesses pulled her after them and soon they had all disappeared into one of the entrances to the blue palace  now then said the boolooroo i will instruct you two in your future duties i shall make old moonface  my names capn bill weedles interrupted the sailor  i dont care what your name is i shall call you old moonface replied the king for that suits you quite well i shall appoint you the royal nectar mixer to the court of sky island and if you dont mix our nectar properly ill have you patched  how do you mix it asked capn bill  i dont mix it its not the boolooroos place to mix nectar was the stern reply but you may inquire of the palace servants and perhaps the royal chef or the majordomo will condescend to tell you take him to the servants quarters captain ultramarine and give him a suit of the royal livery  so capn bill was lad away by the chief of the soldiers and when he had gone the king said to buttonbright you slave shall be the royal bootblue your duty will be to keep the boots and shoes of the royal family nicely polished with blue  i dont know how answered buttonbright surlily  youll soon learn the royal steward will supply you with blue paste and when youve brushed this on our shoes you must shine them with qrays of moonshine do you understand  no said buttonbright  then the boolooroo told one of the soldiers to take the boy to the shoeblue den and have him instructed in his duties and the soldiers promptly obeyed and dragged buttonbright away to the end of the palace where the servants lived     ghipghisizzle proves friendly  chapter 7   the royal palace was certainly a magnificent building with large and lofty rooms and superb furnishings all being in shades of blue the soldier and the boy passed through several broad corridors and then came to a big hall where many servants were congregated these were staring in bewilderment at capn bill who had been introduced to them by captain ultramarine now they turned in no less surprise to examine the boy and their looks expressed not only astonishment but dislike  the servants were all richly attired in blue silk liveries and they seemed disposed to resent the fact that these strangers had been added to their ranks they scowled and muttered and behaved in a very unfriendly way even after captain ultramarine had explained that the newcomers were merely base slaves and not to be classed with the free royal servants of the palace  one of those present however showed no especial enmity to buttonbright and capn bill and this blueskin attracted the boys notice because his appearance was so strange he looked as if he were made of two separate men each cut through the middle and then joined together half of one to half of the other one side of his blue hair was curly and the other half straight one ear was big and stuck out from the side of his head while the other ear was small and flat one eye was half shut and twinkling while the other was big and staring his nose was thin on one side and flat on the other while one side of his mouth curled up and the other down buttonbright also noticed that he limped as he walked because one leg was a trifle longer than the other and that one hand was delicate and slender and the other thick and hardened by use  dont stare at him a voice whispered in the boys ear the poor fellow has been patched thats all  buttonbright turned to see who had spoken and found by his side a tall young blueskin with a bluegold chain around his neck he was quite the best looking person the boy had seen in sky island and he spoke in a pleasant way and seemed quite friendly but the twosided man had overheard the remark and he now stepped forward and said in a careless tone  never mind its no disgrace to be patched in a country ruled by such a cruel boolooroo as we have let the boy look at me if he wants to im not pretty but thats not my fault blame the boolooroo  iim glad to meet you sir stammered buttonbright what is your name please  im now named jimfred jonesjinks and my partner is called fredjim jinksjones hes busy at present guarding the treasure chamber but ill introduce you to him when he comes back weve had the misfortune to be patched you know  what is being patched asked the boy  they cut two of us in halves and mismatch the halveshalf of one to half of the other you knowand then the other two halves are patched together it destroys our individuality and makes us complex creatures so its the worst punishment than can be inflicted in sky island  oh said buttonbright alarmed at such dreadful butchery doesnt it hurt  no it doesnt hurt replied jimfred but it makes one frightfully nervous they stand you under a big knife which drops and slices you neatly in two exactly in the middle then they match half of you to another person who has likewise been sliced and there you are patched to someone you dont care about and havent much interest in if your half wants to do something the other half is likely to want to do something different and the funny part of it is you dont quite know which is your half and which is the other half its a terrible punishment and in a country where one cant die or be killed until he has lived his six hundred years to be patched is a great misfortune  im sure it is said buttonbright earnestly but cant you ever getgetunpatched again  if the boolooroo would consent i think it could be done jimfred replied but he never will consent this is about the meanest boolooroo who ever ruled this land and he was the first to invent patching people as a punishment i think we will all be glad when his three hundred years of rule are ended  when will that be inquired the boy  hushshsh cried everyone in a chorus and they all looked over their shoulders as if frightened by the question the officer with the bluegold chain pulled buttonbrights sleeve and whispered follow me please and then he beckoned to capn bill and led the two slaves to another room where they were alone  i must instruct you in your duties said he when they were all comfortably seated in cozy chairs with blue cushions you must learn how to obey the boolooroos commands so he wont become angry and have you patched  how could he patch us asked the sailorman curiously  oh hed just slice you all in halves and then patch half of the boy to half of the girl and the other half to half of you and the other half of you to the other half of the girl see  cant say i do said capn bill much bewildered its a reglar mixup  thats what its meant to be explained the young officer  an seein as were earth folks an not natives of sky island ive an idea the slicing machine would about end us without bein patched continued the sailor  oh said buttonbright so it would  while you are in this country you cant die till youve lived six hundred years declared the officer  oh said buttonbright thats different of course but who are you please  my name is ghipghisizzle can you remember it  i can member the sizzle said the boy but im fraid the gwipgripglip  ghipghisizzle repeated the officer slowly i want you to remember my name because if you are going to live here you are sure to hear of me a great many times can you keep a secret  i can try said buttonbright  ive kep secretsonce in a while asserted capn bill  well try to keep this one im to be the next boolooroo of sky island  good for you cried the sailor i wish you was the boolooroo now sir but it seems youve got to wait a hundred years or more afore you can take his place  ghipghisizzle rose to his feet and paced up and down the room for a time a frown upon his face then he halted and faced capn bill sir said he there lies all my trouble im quite sure the present boolooroo has reigned three hundred years next thursday but he claims it is only two hundred years and as he holds the royal book of records under lock and key in the royal treasury there is no way for us to prove he is wrong  oh said buttonbright how old is the boolooroo  he was two hundred years old when he was elected replied ghipghisizzle if he has already reigned three hundred years as i suspect then he is now five hundred years old you see he is trying to steal another hundred years of rule so as to remain a tyrant all his life  he dont seem as old as that observed capn bill thoughtfully why im only sixty myself an i guess i look twice as old as your king does  we do not show our age in looks the officer answered i am just about your age sirsixtytwo my next birthdaybut im sure i dont look as old as that  thats a fact agreed capn bill then he turned to buttonbright and added dont that prove sky island is a fairy country as i said  oh ive known that all along said the boy the slicing and patching proves it and so do lots of other things  now then said ghipghisizzle let us talk over your duties it seems you must mix the royal nectar capn bill do you know how to do that  im free to say as i dont friend sizzle  the boolooroo is very particular about his nectar i think he has given you this job so he can find fault with you and have you punished but we will fool him you are strangers here and i dont want you imposed upon ill send tiggle to the royal pantry and keep him there to mix the nectar then when the boolooroo or the queen or any of the snubnosed princesses call for a drink you can carry it to them and it will be sure to suit them  thanke sir said capn bill thats real kind of you  your job buttonbright is easier continued ghipghisizzle  im no bootblack declared the boy the boolooroo has no right to make me do his dirty work  youre a slave the officer reminded him and a slave must obey  why asked buttonbright  because he cant help himself no slave ever wants to obey but he just has to and it isnt dirty work at all you dont black the royal boots and shoes you merely blue them with a finely perfumed blue paste then you shine them neatly and your task is done you will not be humiliated by becoming a bootblack youll be a bootblue  oh said buttonbright i dont see much difference but perhaps its a little more respectable  yes the royal bootblue is considered a high official in sky island you do your work at evening or early morning and the rest of the day you are at liberty to do as you please  it wont last long buttonbright said capn bill consolingly somethins bound to happen pretty soon you know  i think so myself answered the boy  and now remarked ghipghisizzle since you understand your new duties perhaps youd like to walk out with me and see the blue city and the glorious blue country of sky island  we would that cried capn bill promptly  so they accompanied their new friend through a maze of passagesfor the palace was very bigand then through a high arched portal into the streets of the city so rapid had been their descent when the umbrella landed them in the royal garden that they had not even caught a glimpse of the blue city so now they gazed with wonder and interest at the splendid sights that met their eyes     the blue city  chapter 8   the blue city was quite extensive and consisted of many broad streets paved with blue marble and lined with splendid buildings of the same beautiful material there were houses and castles and shops for the merchants and all were prettily designed and had many slender spires and imposing turrets that rose far into the blue air everything was blue here just as was everything in the royal palace and gardens and a blue haze overhung all the city  doesnt the sun ever shine asked capn bill  not in the blue part of sky island replied ghipghisizzle the moon shines here every night but we never see the sun i am told however that on the other half of the islandwhich i have never seenthe sun shines brightly but there is no moon at all  oh said buttonbright is there another half to sky island  yes a dreadful place called the pink country im told everything there is pink instead of blue a fearful place it must be indeed said the blueskin with a shudder  i dunno bout that remarked capn bill that pink country sounds kind o cheerful to me is your blue country very big  it is immense was the proud reply this enormous city extends a half mile in all directions from the center and the country outside the city is fully a halfmile further in extent thats very big isnt it  not very replied capn bill with a smile weve cities on the earth ten times bigger an then some big besides wed call this a small town in our country  our country is thousands of miles wide and thousands of miles longits the great united states of america added the boy earnestly  ghipghisizzle seemed astonished he was silent a moment and then he said here in sky island we prize truthfulness very highly our boolooroo is not very truthful i admit for he is trying to misrepresent the length of his reign but our people as a rule speak only the truth  so do we asserted capn bill what buttonbright said is the honest truth every word of it  but we have been led to believe that sky island is the greatest country in the universemeaning of course our half of it the blue country  it may be for you perhaps the sailor stated politely an i dont imagine any island floatin in the sky is any bigger but the universe is a big place an you cant be sure of whats in it till youve traveled like we have  perhaps you are right mused the blueskin but he still seemed to doubt them  is the pink side of sky island bigger than the blue side asked buttonbright  no it is supposed to be the same size was the reply  then why havent you ever been there seems to me you could walk across the whole island in an hour said the boy  the two parts are separated by an impassable barrier answered ghipghisizzle between them lies the great fog bank  a fog bank why thats no barrier exclaimed capn bill  it is indeed returned the blueskin the fog bank is so thick and heavy that it blinds one and if once you got into the bank you might wander forever and not find your way out again also it is full of dampness that wets your clothes and your hair until you become miserable it is furthermore said that those who enter the fog bank forfeit the six hundred years allowed them to live and are liable to die at any time here we do not die you know we merely pass away  hows that asked the sailor isnt passn away jus the same as dyin  no indeed when our six hundred years are ended we march into the great blue grotto through the arch of phinis and are never seen again  thats queer said buttonbright what would happen if you didnt march through the arch  i do not know for no one has ever refused to do so it is the law and we all obey it  it saves funeral expenses anyhow remarked capn bill where is this arch  just outside the gates of the city there is a mountain in the center of the blue land and the entrance to the great blue grotto is at the foot of the mountain according to our figures the boolooroo ought to march into this grotto a hundred years from next thursday but he is trying to steal a hundred years and so perhaps he wont enter the arch of phinis therefore if you will please be patient for about a hundred years you will discover what happens to one who breaks the law  thanke remarked capn bill i dont expect to be very curious a hundred years from now  nor i added buttonbright laughing at the whimsical speech but i dont see how the boolooroo is able to fool you all cant any of you remember two or three hundred years back when he first began to rule  no said ghipghisizzle thats a long time to remember and we blueskins try to forget all we can especially whatever is unpleasant those who remember are usually the unhappy ones only those able to forget find the most joy in life  during this conversation they had been walking along the streets of the blue city where many of the blueskin inhabitants stopped to gaze wonderingly at the sailor and the boy whose strange appearance surprised them they were a nervous restless people and their eggshaped heads set on the ends of long thin necks seemed so grotesque to the strangers that they could scarcely forbear laughing at them the bodies of these people were short and round and their legs exceptionally long so when a blueskin walked he covered twice as much ground at one step as capn bill or buttonbright did the women seemed just as repellent as the men and buttonbright began to understand that the six snubnosed princesses were after all rather better looking than most of the females of the blue country and so had a certain right to be proud and haughty  there were no horses nor cows in this land but there were plenty of blue goats from which the people got their milk children tended the goatswee blueskin boys and girls whose appearance was so comical that buttonbright laughed whenever he saw one of them  although the natives had never seen before this any human beings made as buttonbright and capn bill were they took a strong dislike to the strangers and several times threatened to attack them perhaps if ghipghisizzle who was their favorite had not been present they would have mobbed our friends with vicious illwill and might have seriously injured them but ghipghisizzles friendly protection made them hold aloof  by and by they passed through a city gate and their guide showed them the outer walls which protected the city from the country beyond there were several of these gates and from their recesses stone steps led to the top of the wall they mounted a flight of these steps and from their elevation plainly saw the low mountain where the arch of phinis was located and beyond that the thick bluegray fog bank which constantly rolled like billows of the ocean and really seemed from a distance quite forbidding  but it wouldnt take long to get there decided buttonbright and if you were close up it might not be worse than any other fog is the pink country on the other side of it  so we are told in the book of records replied ghipghisizzle none of us now living know anything about it but the book of records calls it the sunset country and says that at evening the pink shades are drowned by terrible colors of orange and crimson and goldenyellow and red wouldnt it be horrible to be obliged to look upon such a sight it must give the poor people who live there dreadful headaches  id like to see that book of records mused capn bill who didnt think the description of the sunset country at all dreadful  id like to see it myself returned ghipghisizzle with a sigh but no one can lay hands on it because the boolooroo keeps it safely locked up in his treasure chamber  wheres the key to the treasure chamber asked buttonbright  the boolooroo keeps it in his pocket night and day was the reply he is afraid to let anyone see the book because it would prove he has already reigned three hundred years next thursday and then he would have to resign the throne to me and leave the palace and live in a common house  my magic umbrella is in that treasure chamber said buttonbright and im going to try to get it  are you inquired ghipghisizzle eagerly well if you manage to enter the treasure chamber be sure to bring me the book of records if you can do that i will be the best and most grateful friend you ever had  ill see said the boy it ought not to be hard work to break into the treasure chamber is it guarded  yes the outside guard is jimfred jinksjones the double patch of the fredjim whom you have met and the inside guard is a ravenous creature known as the blue wolf which has teeth a foot long and as sharp as needles  oh said buttonbright but never mind the blue wolf i must manage to get my umbrella somehow or other  they now walked back to the palace still objects of much curiosity to the natives who sneered at them and mocked them but dared not interfere with their progress at the palace they found that dinner was about to be served in the big dining hall of the servants and dependents and household officers of the royal boolooroo ghipghisizzle was the majordomo and master of ceremonies so he took his seat at the end of the long table and placed capn bill on one side of him and buttonbright on the other to the great annoyance of the other blueskins present who favored the strangers with nothing pleasanter than envious scowls  the boolooroo and his queen and daughtersthe six snubnosed princessesdined in formal state in the banquet hall where they were waited upon by favorite soldiers of the royal bodyguard here in the servants hall there was one vacant seat next to buttonbright which was reserved for trot but the little girl had not yet appeared and the sailorman and the boy were beginning to be uneasy about her     the tribulation of trot  chapter 9   the apartments occupied by the six snubnosed princesses were so magnificent that when trot first entered them led by her haughty captors she thought they must be the most beautiful rooms in the world there was a long and broad reception room with fortyseven windows in it and opening out of it were six lovely bedchambers each furnished in the greatest luxury adjoining each sleeping room was a marble bath and each princess had a separate boudoir and a dressing room the furnishings were of the utmost splendor bluegold and blue gems being profusely used in the decorations while the divans and chairs were of richly carved bluewood upholstered in blue satins and silks the draperies were superbly embroidered and the rugs upon the marble floors were woven with beautiful scenes in every conceivable shade of blue  when they first reached the reception room princess azure cast herself upon a divan while her five sisters sat or reclined in easy chairs with their heads thrown back and their blue chins scornfully elevated trot who was much annoyed at the treatment she had received did not hesitate to seat herself also in a big easy chair  slave cried princess cerulia fetch me a mirror  slave cried princess turquoise a lock of my hair is loosened bind it up  slave cried princess cobalt unfasten my shoes theyre too tight  slave cried princess sapphire bring hither my box of blue chocolates  slave cried princess azure stand by my side and fan me  slave cried princess indigo get out of that chair how dare you sit in our presence  if youre saying all those things to me replied trot you may as well save your breath im no slave and she cuddled down closer in the chair  you are a slave shouted the six all together  im not  our father the revered and resplendent royal ruler of the blues has made you our slave asserted indigo with a yawn  but he cant objected the little girl im some royal an rapturous an ridiclous myself an i wont allow any cheap boolooroo to order me round  are you of royal birth asked azure seeming surprised  royal why im an american snubnoses and if theres anything royaler than an american id like to know what it is  the princesses seemed uncertain what reply to make to this speech and began whispering together finally indigo said to trot we do not think it matters what you were in your own country for having left there you have forfeited your rank by recklessly intruding into our domain you have become a slave and being a slave you must obey us or suffer the consequences  what consquences asked the girl  dare to disobey us and you will quickly find out snapped indigo swaying her head from side to side on its long swanlike neck like the pendulum of a clock  i dont want any trouble said trot gravely we came to sky island by mistake and wanted to go right away again but your father wouldnt let us it isnt our fault were still here an im free to say youre a very disgreeble an horrid lot of people with no manners to speak of or youd treat us nicely  no impertinence cried indigo savagely  why its the truth replied trot  indigo made a rush and caught trot by both shoulders the princess was twice the little girls size and she shook her victim so violently that trots teeth rattled together then princess cobalt came up and slapped one side of the slaves face and princess turquoise ran forward and slapped the other side cerulia gave trot a push one way and sapphire pushed her the other way so the little girl was quite out of breath and very angry when finally her punishment ceased she had not been much hurt though and she was wise enough to understand that these princesses were all cruel and vindictive so that her safest plan was to pretend to obey them  now then commanded princess indigo go and feed my little blue dog that crows like a rooster  and feed my pretty blue cat that sings like a bird said princess azure  and feed my soft blue lamb that chatters like a monkey said princess cobalt  and feed my poetic blue parrot that barks like a dog said princess sapphire  and feed my fuzzy blue rabbit that roars like a lion said princess turquoise  and feed my lovely blue peacock that mews like a cat said princess cerulia  anything else asked trot drawing a long breath  not until you have properly fed our pets replied azure with a scowl  what do they eat then  meat  milk  clover  seeds  bread  carrots  all right said trot where do you keep the menagerie  our pets are in our boudoirs said indigo harshly what a little fool you are  perhaps said trot pausing as she was about to leave the room when i grow up ill be as big a fool as any of you  then she ran away to escape another shaking and in the first boudoir she found the little blue dog curled up on a blue cushion in a corner trot patted his head gently and this surprised the dog who was accustomed to cuffs and kicks so he licked trots hand and wagged his funny little tail and then straightened up and crowed like a rooster the girl was delighted with the queer doggie and she found some meat in a cupboard and fed him out of her hand patting the tiny creature and stroking his soft blue hair the doggie had never in his life known anyone so kind and gentle so when trot went into the next boudoir the animal followed close at her heels wagging his tail every minute  the blue cat was asleep on a window seat but it woke up when trot tenderly took it in her lap and fed it milk from a bluegold dish it was a pretty cat and instantly knew the little girl was a friend vastly different from its own badtempered mistress so it sang beautifully as a bird sings and both the cat and the dog followed trot into the third boudoir  here was a tiny baby lamb with fleece as blue as a larkspur and as soft as milk  oh you darling cried trot hugging the little lamb tight in her arms at once the lamb began chattering just as a monkey chatters only in the most friendly and grateful way and trot fed it a handful of fresh blue clover and smoothed and petted it until the lamb was eager to follow her wherever she might go  when she came to the fourth boudoir a handsome blue parrot sat on a blue perch and began barking as if it were nearly starved then it cried out    rubadub dub   gimme some grub  trot laughed and gave it some seeds and while the parrot ate them she stroked gently his soft feathers the bird seemed much astonished at the unusual caress and turned upon the girl first one little eye and then the other as if trying to discover why she was so kind he had never experienced kind treatment in all his life so it was no wonder that when the little girl entered the fifth boudoir she was followed by the parrot the lamb the cat and the dog who all stood beside her and watched her feed the peacock which she found strutting around and mewing like a cat for his dinner said the parrot    i spy a peacocks eye   on every feather i wonder why  the peacock soon came to love trot as much as the other bird and all the beasts did and it spread its tail and strutted after her into the next boudoir the sixth one as she entered this room trot gave a start of fear for a terrible roar like the roar of a lion greeted her but there was no lion there a fuzzy blue rabbit was making all the noise for goodness sake keep quiet said trot heres a nice blue carrot for you the color seems all wrong but it may taste jus as good as if it was red  evidently it did taste good for the rabbit ate it greedily when it was not roaring the creature was so soft and fluffy that trot played with it and fondled it a long time after it had finished eating and the rabbit played with the cat and the dog and the lamb and did not seem a bit afraid of the parrot or the peacock but all of a sudden in pounced princess indigo with a yell of anger  so this is how you waste your time is it exclaimed the princess and grabbing trots arm she jerked the girl to her feet and began pushing her from the room all the pets began to follow her and seeing this indigo yelled at them to keep back as they paid no attention to this command the princess seized a basin of water and dashed the fluid over the beasts and birds after which she renewed her attempt to push trot from the room the pets rebelled at such treatment and believing they ought to protect trot whom they knew to be their friend they proceeded to defend her the little blue dog dashed at indigo and bit her right ankle while the blue cat scratched her left leg with its claws and the parrot flew upon her shoulder and pecked her ear the lamb ran up and butted indigo so that she stumbled forward on her face when the peacock proceeded to pound her head with his wings indigo screaming with fright sprang to her feet again but the rabbit ran between her legs and tripped her up all the time roaring loudly like a lion and the dog crowed triumphantly as a rooster crows while the cat warbled noisily and the lamb chattered and the parrot barked and the peacock screeched meow  altogether indigo was as trot said scared stiff and she howled for help until her sisters ran in and rescued her pulling her through the bedchamber into the reception room when she was alone trot sat down on the floor and laughed until the tears came to her eyes and she hugged all the pets and kissed them every one and thanked them for protecting her    thats all right   we like a fight  declared the parrot in reply  the princesses were horrified to find indigo so scratched and bitten and they were likewise amazed at the rebellion of their six pets which they had never petted indeed but kept in their boudoirs so they could abuse them whenever they felt especially wicked or illnatured none of the snubnosed ones dared enter the room where the girl was but they called through a crack in the door for trot to come out instantly trot pretending not to hear paid no attention to these demands  finding themselves helpless and balked of their revenge the six snubnosed princesses finally recovered from their excitement and settled down to a pleasant sisterly quarrel as was their customary amusement indigo wanted to have trot patched and cerulia wanted her beaten with knotted cords and cobalt wanted her locked up in a dark room and sapphire wanted her fed on sand and turquoise wanted her bound to a windmill and so between these various desires they quarreled and argued until dinner time arrived  trot was occupying indigos room so that princess was obliged to dress with azure not daring to enter her own chamber and the two sisters quarreled so enthusiastically that they almost came to blows before they were ready for dinner  before the six snubnosed princesses went to the royal banquet hall cobalt stuck her head through a crack of the door and said to trot if you want any dinner youll find it in the servants hall i advise you to eat for after our dinner we will decide upon a fitting punishment for you and then im sure you wont have much appetite  thank you replied the girl im right hungry jus now she waited until the snubnosed sextette had pranced haughtily away and then she came out followed by all the pets and found her way to the servants quarters     the kings treasure chamber  chapter 10   all the blueskins assembled in the servants hall were amazed to see the pets of the princesses trailing after the strange little girl but trot took her place next to buttonbright at the table and the parrot perched upon her shoulder while the peacock stood upon one side of her chair and the lamb upon the other and the cat and dog lay at her feet and the blue rabbit climbed into her lap and cuddled down there some of the blueskins insisted that the animals and birds must be put out of the room but ghipghisizzle said they could remain as they were the favored pets of the lovely snubnosed princesses  capn bill was delighted to see his dear little friend again and so was buttonbright and now that they were reunitedfor a time at leastthey paid little heed to the sour looks and taunting remarks of the ugly blueskins and ate heartily of the dinner which was really very good  the meal was no sooner over than ghipghisizzle was summoned to the chamber of his majesty the boolooroo but before he went away he took trot and capn bill and buttonbright into a small room and advised them to stay there until he returned so that the servants and soldiers would not molest them my people seem to dislike strangers said the majordomo thoughtfully and that surprises me because you are the first strangers they have ever seen i think they imagine you will become favorites of the boolooroo and of the princesses and that is why they are jealous and hate you  they neednt worry bout that replied trot the snubnoses hate me worse than the people do  i cant imagine a bootblue becoming a royal favorite grumbled buttonbright  or a necktie mixer added capn bill  you dont mix neckties youre a nectar mixer said ghipghisizzle correcting the sailor ill not be gone long for im no favorite of the boolooroo either so please stay quietly in this room until my return  the majordomo found the boolooroo in a bad temper he had finished his dinner where his six daughters had bitterly denounced trot all through the meal and implored their father to invent some new and terrible punishment for her also his wife the queen had made him angry by begging for gold to buy ribbons with then when he had retired to his own private room he decided to send for the umbrella he had stolen from buttonbright and test its magic powers but the umbrella in his hands proved just as common as any other umbrella might be he opened it and closed it and turned it this way and that commanding it to do all sorts of things but of course the magic umbrella would obey no one but a member of the family that rightfully owned it at last the boolooroo threw it down and stamped upon it and then kicked it into a corner where it rolled underneath a cabinet then he sent for ghipghisizzle  do you know how to work that magic umbrella he asked the majordomo  no your majesty i do not was the reply  well find out make the whiteskins tell you so that i can use it for my own amusement  ill do my best your majesty said ghipghisizzle  youll do more than that or ill have you patched roared the angry boolooroo and dont waste any time either for as soon as we find out the secret of the umbrella im going to have the three strangers marched through the arch of phinis and that will be the end of them  you cant do that your majesty said the majordomo  why cant i  they havent lived six hundred years yet and only those who have lived that length of time are allowed to march through the arch of phinis into the great blue grotto  the king looked at him with a sneer has anyone ever come out of that arch alive he asked  no said ghipghisizzle but no one has ever gone into the blue grotto until his allotted time was up  well im going to try the experiment declared the boolooroo i shall march these three strangers through the arch and if by chance they come out alive ill do a new sort of patchingill chop off their heads and mix em up putting the wrong head on each of em ha ha wont it be funny to see the old moonfaces head on the little girl ho ho i really hope theyll come out of the great blue grotto alive  i also hope they will replied ghipghisizzle  then ill bet you four buttonholes they dont ive a suspicion that once they enter the great blue grotto thats the last of them  ghipghisizzle went away quite sad and unhappy he did not approve the way the strangers were being treated and thought it was wicked and cruel to try to destroy them  during his absence the prisoners had been talking together very earnestly we must get away from here somehow r other said capn bill but o course we cant stir a step without the magic umbrel  no i must surely manage to get my umbrella first said buttonbright  do it quick then urged trot for i cant stand those snubnoses much longer  ill do it tonight said the boy  the sooner the better my lad remarked the sailor but seein as the blue boolooroo has locked it up in his treasure chamber it maynt be easy to get hold of  no it wont be easy buttonbright admitted but it has to be done capn bill and theres no use waiting any longer no one here likes us and in a few days they may make an end of us  oh buttonbright theres a blue wolf in the treasure chamber exclaimed trot  yes i know  an a patched man on guard outside capn bill reminded him  i know repeated buttonbright  and the keys in the kings own pocket added trot despairingly  the boy nodded he didnt say how he would overcome all these difficulties so the little girl feared they would never see the magic umbrella again but their present position was a very serious one and even capn bill dared not advise buttonbright to give up the desperate attempt  when ghipghisizzle returned he said you must be very careful not to anger the boolooroo or he may do you a mischief i think the little girl had better keep away from the princesses for tonight unless they demand her presence the boy must go for the kings shoes and blue them and polish them and then take them back to the royal bedchamber capn bill wont have anything to do for ive ordered tiggle to mix the nectar  thank e friend sizzle said capn bill  now follow me and i will take you to your rooms  he led them to the rear of the palace where he gave them three small rooms on the ground floor each having a bed in it capn bills room had a small door leading out into the street of the city but ghip ghisizzle advised him to keep this door locked as the city people would be sure to hurt the strangers if they had the chance to attack them  youre safer in the palace than anywhere else said the majordomo for there is no way you can escape from the island and here the servants and soldiers dare not injure you for fear of the boolooroo  he placed trot and her six petswhich followed her wherever she wentin one room and capn bill in another and took buttonbright away with him to show the boy the way to the kings bedchamber as they proceeded they passed many rooms with closed doors and before one of these a patched blueskin was pacing up and down in a tired and sleepy way it was jimfred jinksjones the double of the fredjim jonesjinks they had talked with in the servants hall and he bowed low before the majordomo  this is the kings new bootblue a stranger who has lately arrived here said ghipghisizzle introducing the boy to the patched man  im sorry for him muttered jimfred hes a queerlooking chap with his pale yellow skin and i imagine our cruel boolooroo is likely to patch him before long as he did mei mean us  no he wont said buttonbright positively the boolooroos afraid of me  oh thats different said jimfred youre the first person i ever knew that could scare our boolooroo  they passed on and ghipghisizzle whispered that is the royal treasure chamber buttonbright nodded he had marked the place well so he couldnt miss it when he wanted to find it again when they came to the kings apartments there was another guard before the door this time a longnecked soldier with a terrible scowl  this slave is the royal bootblue said ghipghisizzle to the guard you will allow him to pass into his majestys chamber to get the royal shoes and to return them when they are blued  all right answered the guard our boolooroo is in an ugly mood tonight it will go hard with this little shortnecked creature if he doesnt polish the shoes properly  then ghipghisizzle left buttonbright and went away and the boy passed through several rooms to the royal bedchamber where his majesty sat undressing  hi there what are you doing here he roared as he saw buttonbright  ive come for the shoes said the boy  the king threw them at his head aiming carefully but buttonbright dodged the missiles and one smashed a mirror while the other shattered a vase on a small table his majesty looked around for something else to throw but the boy seized the shoes and ran away returning to his own room  while he polished the shoes he told his plans to capn bill and trot and asked them to be ready to fly with him as soon as he returned with the magic umbrella all they need to do was to step out into the street through the door of capn bills room and open the umbrella fortunately the seats and the lunchbasket were still attached to the handleor so they thoughtand there would be nothing to prevent their quickly starting on the journey home  they waited a long time however to give the boolooroo time to get to sleep so it was after midnight when buttonbright finally took the shoes in his hand and started for the royal bedchamber he passed the guard of the royal treasury and fredjim nodded goodnaturedly to the boy but the sleepy guard before the kings apartments was cross and surly  what are you doing here at this hour he demanded  im returning his majestys shoes said buttonbright  go back and wait till morning commanded the guard  if you prevent me from obeying the boolooroos orders returned the boy quietly he will probably have you patched  this threat frightened the longnecked guard who did not know what orders the boolooroo had given his royal bootblue go in then said he but if you make a noise and waken his majesty the chances are youll get yourself patched  ill be quiet promised the boy  indeed buttonbright had no desire to waken the boolooroo whom he found snoring lustily with the curtains of his highposted bed drawn tightly around him the boy had taken off his own shoes after he passed the guard and now he tiptoed carefully into the room set down the royal shoes very gently and then crept to the chair where his majestys clothes were piled scarcely daring to breathe for fear of awakening the terrible monarch the boy searched in the royal pockets until he found a bluegold key attached to a bluegold chain at once he decided this must be the key to the treasure chamber but in order to make sure he searched in every other pocketwithout finding another key  then buttonbright crept softly out of the room again and in one of the outer rooms he sat down near a big cabinet and put on his shoes poor buttonbright did not know that lying disregarded beneath that very cabinet at his side was the precious umbrella he was seeking or that he was undertaking a desperate adventure all for nothing he passed the longnecked guard again finding the man half asleep and then made his way to the treasure chamber facing jimfred he said to the patched man in a serious tone his majesty commands you to go at once to the corridor leading to the apartments of the six snubnosed princesses and to guard the entrance until morning you are to permit no one to enter or leave the apartments  butgood gracious exclaimed the surprised jimfred who will guard the treasure chamber  i am to take your place said buttonbright  oh very well replied jimfred this is a queer freak for our boolooroo to indulge in but he is always doing something absurd youre not much of a guard seems to me but if anyone tries to rob the treasure chamber you must ring this big gong which will alarm the whole palace and bring the soldiers to your assistance do you understand  yes said buttonbright  then fredjim stalked away to the other side of the palace to guard the princesses and buttonbright was left alone with the key to the treasure chamber in his hand but he had not forgotten that the ferocious blue wolf was guarding the interior of the chamber so he searched in some of the rooms until he found a sofapillow which he put under his arm and then returned to the corridor  he placed the key in the lock and the bolt turned with a sharp click buttonbright did not hesitate he was afraid to be sure and his heart was beating fast with the excitement of the moment but he knew he must regain the magic umbrella if he would save his comrades and himself from destruction for without it they could never return to the earth so he summoned up his best courage opened the door stepped quickly inside and closed the door after him     buttonbright encounters the blue wolf  chapter 11   a low fierce growl greeted him the treasure chamber was pretty dark although the moonlight came in through some of the windows but the boy had brought with him the low brass lamp that lighted the corridor and this he set upon a table beside the door before he took time to look around him  the treasure chamber was heaped and crowded with all the riches the boolooroo had accumulated during his reign of two or three hundred years piles of gold and jewels were on all sides and precious ornaments and splendid cloths rare pieces of carved furniture vases bricabrac and the like were strewn about the room in astonishing profusion  just at the boys feet crouched a monstrous animal of most fearful aspect he knew at a glance it was the terrible blue wolf and the sight of the beast sent a shiver through him the blue wolfs head was fully as big as that of a lion and its wide jaws were armed with rows of long pointed teeth his shoulders and front legs were huge and powerful but the rest of the wolfs body dwindled away until at the tail it was no bigger than a dog the jaws were therefore the dangerous part of the creature and its small blue eyes flashed wickedly at the intruder  just as the boy made his first step forward the blue wolf sprang upon him with its enormous jaws stretched wide open buttonbright jammed the sofapillow into the brutes mouth and crowded it in as hard as he could the terrible teeth came together and buried themselves in the pillow and then mr wolf found he could not pull them out againbecause his mouth was stuffed full he could not even growl or yelp but rolled upon the floor trying in vain to release himself from the conquering pillow  buttonbright paid no further attention to the helpless animal but caught up the bluebrass lamp and began a search for his umbrella of course he could not find it as it was not there he came across a small book bound in lightblue leather which lay upon an exquisitely carved centertable it was named in darkblue letters stamped on the leather the royal record book and remembering ghipghisizzle longed to possess this book buttonbright hastily concealed it inside his blouse then he renewed his search for the umbrella but it was quite in vain he hunted in every crack and corner bumbling the treasures here and there in the quest but at last he became positive that the magic umbrella was not there  the boy was bitterly disappointed and did not know what to do next but he noticed that the blue wolf had finally seized an edge of the sofapillow in its sharp claws and was struggling to pull the thing out of his mouth so there being no object in his remaining longer in the room where he might have to fight the wolf again buttonbright went out and locked the door behind him  while he stood in the corridor wondering what to do next a sudden shouting reached his ears it was the voice of the boolooroo saying my key my key who has stolen my golden key and then there followed shouts of soldiers and guards and servants and the rapid pattering of feet was heard throughout the palace  buttonbright took to his heels and ran along the passages until he came to capn bills room where the sailorman and trot were anxiously awaiting him  quick cried the boy we must escape from here at once or we will be caught and patched  wheres the umbrel asked capn bill  i dont know i cant find it but all the palace is aroused and the boolooroo is furious come lets get away at once  wherell we go inquired trot  we must make for the open country and hide in the fog bank or in the arch of phinis replied the boy  they did not stop to argue any longer but all three stepped out of the little door into the street where they first clasped hands so they would not get separated in the dark and then ran as swiftly as they could down the street which was deserted at this hour by the citizens they could not go very fast because the sailormans wooden leg was awkward to run with and held them back but capn bill hobbled quicker than he had ever hobbled before in all his life and they really made pretty good progress  they met no one on the streets and continued their flight until at last they came to the city wall which had a blueiron gate in it here was a blueskin guard who had been peacefully slumbering when aroused by the footsteps of the fugitives halt cried the guard fiercely  capn bill halted long enough to grab the man around his long neck with one hand and around his long leg with the other hand then he raised the blueskin in the air and threw him far over the wall a moment later they had unfastened the gate and fled into the open country where they headed toward the low mountain whose outlines were plainly visible in the moonlight  the guard was now howling and crying for help in the city were answering shouts a hue and cry came from every direction reaching as far as the palace lights began to twinkle everywhere in the streets and the blue city hummed like a beehive filled with angry bees it wont do for us to get caught now panted capn bill as they ran along im more afeared o them blue citizens ner i am o the blue boolooroo theyd tear us to pieces if they could  sky island was not a very big place especially the blue part of it and our friends were now very close to the low mountain presently they paused before a grim archway of blue marble above which was carved the one word phinis the interior seemed dark and terrible as they stopped to regard it as a possible place of refuge  dont like that place capn whispered trot  no more do i mate he answered  i think id rather take a chance on the fog bank said buttonbright  just then they were all startled by a swift flapping of wings and a voice cried in shrill tones  where are you trot as like as not ive been forgot  capn bill jumped this way and buttonbright that and then there alighted on trots shoulder the blue parrot that had been the pet of the princess cerulia said the bird    gee ive flown   here all alone   its pretty far   but here we are  and then he barked like a dog and chuckled with glee at having found his little friend  in escaping the palace trot had been obliged to leave all the pets behind her but it seemed that the parrot had found some way to get free and follow her they were all astonished to hear the bird talkand in poetry toobut capn bill told trot that some parrots he had known had possessed a pretty fair gift of language and he added that this blue one seemed an unusually bright bird as fer potry said he thats as how you look at potry rhymes come from your head but real potry from your heart an whether the blue parrot has a heart or not hes sure got a head  having decided not to venture into the arch of phinis they again started on this time across the country straight toward the fog bank which hung like a bluegrey cloud directly across the center of the island they knew they were being followed by bands of the blueskins for they could hear the shouts of their pursuers growing louder and louder every minute since their long legs covered the ground more quickly than our friends could possibly go had the journey been much farther the fugitives would have been overtaken but when the leaders of the pursuing blueskins were only a few yards behind them they reached the edge of the fog bank and without hesitation plunged into its thick mist which instantly hid them from view  the blueskins fell back horrified at the mad act of the strangers to them the fog bank was the most dreadful thing in existence and no blueskin had ever ventured within it even for a moment  thats the end of those shortnecked yellowskins said one shaking his head we may as well go back and report the matter to the boolooroo     through the fog bank  chapter 12   it was rather moist in the fog bank seems like a reglar drizzle said trot ill be soaked through in a minute she had been given a costume of blue silk in exchange for her own dress and the silk was so thin that the moisture easily wetted it  never mind said capn bill when its a case of life n death clos dont count for much im sort o drippy myself  cried the parrot fluttering his feathers to try to keep them from sticking together    floods and gushes fill our path   this is not my day for a bath   shut if off or fear my wrath  we cant laughed trot well jus have to stick it out till we get to the other side  had we better go to the other side asked buttonbright anxiously  why not returned capn bill the other sides the only safe side for us  we dont know that sir said the boy ghipghisizzle said it was a terrible country  i dont believe it retorted the sailor stoutly sizzles never been there an he knows nothing about it the sunset country sounds sort o good to me  but howll we ever manage to get there inquired trot arent we already lost in this fog  not yet said capn bill ive kep my face turned straight ahead ever since we climbed inter this bank o wetness if we dont get twisted any well go straight through to the other side  it was no darker in the fog bank than it had been in the blue country they could see dimly the mass of fog which seemed to cling to them and when they looked down they discovered that they were walking upon white pebbles that were slightly tinged with the blue color of the sky gradually this blue became fainter until as they progressed everything became a dull gray  i wonder how far it is to the other side remarked trot wearily  we cant say till we get there mate answered the sailor in a cheerful voice capn bill had a way of growing more and more cheerful when danger threatened  never mind said the girl im as wet as a dishrag now and ill never get any wetter    wet wet wet   its awful wet you bet  moaned the parrot on her shoulder    im a fishpond im a well   im a clam without a shell  cant you dry up asked capn bill    not this evening thank you sir   to talk and grumble i prefer  replied the parrot dolefully  they walked along more slowly now still keeping hold of hands for although they were anxious to get through the fog bank they were tired with the long run across the country and with their days adventures they had no sleep and it was a long time past midnight  look out cried the parrot sharply and they all halted to find a monstrous frog obstructing their path capn bill thought it was as big as a whale and as it squatted on the gray pebbles its eyes were on a level with those of the old sailor  kerchug herkchoo grunted the frog what in the sky is this crowd  wwere strangers stammered trot an were tryin to scape from the blueskins an get into the pink country  i dont blame you said the frog in a friendly tone i hate those blueskins the pinkies however are very decent neighbors  oh im glad to hear that cried buttonbright can you tell us mistermistressgood mr frogeh eh your royal highness if were on the right road to the pink country  the frog seemed to laugh for he gurgled in his throat in a very funny way im no royal highness he said im just a common frog and a little wee tiny frog too but i hope to grow in time this fog bank is the paradise of frogs and our king is about ten times as big as i am  then hes a big un an no mistake admitted capn bill im glad you like your country but its a mite too damp for us an wed be glad to get out of it  follow me said the frog ill lead you to the border its only about six jumps he turned around made a mighty leap and disappeared in the gray mist our friends looked at one another in bewilderment  dont see how we can foller that lead remarked capn bill but we may as well start in the same direction    brooks and creeks   how it leaks  muttered the parrot    how can we jog   to a frog in the fog  the big frog seemed to understand their difficulty for he kept making noises in his throat to guide them to where he had leaped when at last they came up to him he made a second jumpout of sight as beforeand when they attempted to follow they found a huge lizard lying across the path capn bill thought it must be a giant alligator at first it was so big but he looked at them sleepily and did not seem at all dangerous  o lizyou puffy lizget out of our way and mind your biz cried the parrot    creepamousie crawlamousie please move on   we cant move a step till you are gone  dont disturb me said the lizard im dreaming about parsnips did you ever taste a parsnip  were in a hurry if its the same to you sir said capn bill politely  then climb over me or go around i dont care which murmured the lizard when theyre little theyre juicy when theyre big theres more of em but either way theres nothing so delicious as a parsnip there are none here in the fog bank so the best i can do is dream of them oh parsnips parsnips parsnips he closed his eyes sleepily and resumed his dreams  walking around the lizard they resumed their journey and soon came to the frog being guided by its grunts and croaks then off it went again its tremendous leap carrying it far into the fog suddenly capn bill tripped and would have fallen flat had not trot and buttonbright held him up then he saw that he had stumbled over the claw of a gigantic landcrab which lay sprawled out upon the pebbly bottom  oh beg parding im sure exclaimed capn bill backing away  dont mention it replied the crab in a tired tone you did not disturb me so there is no harm done  we didnt know you were here explained trot  probably not said the crab its no place for me anyhow for i belong in the constellations you know with taurus and gemini and the other fellows but i had the misfortune to tumble out of the zodiac some time ago my name is cancer but im not a disease those who examine the heavens in these days alas can find no cancer there  yes we can sir mister cancer said the parrot with a chuckle  once remarked capn bill i sawr a picter of you in an almanac  ah the almanacs always did us full justice the crab replied but im told theyre not fashionable now  if you dont mind wed like to pass on said buttonbright  no i dont mind but be careful not to step on my legs theyre rheumatic its so moist here  they climbed over some of the huge legs and walked around others soon they had left the creature far behind arent you rather slow asked the frog when once more they came up to him  it isnt that said trot you are rather swift i guess the frog chuckled and leaped again they noticed that the fog had caught a soft rose tint and was lighter and less dense than before for which reason the sailor remarked that they must be getting near to the pink country  on this jump they saw nothing but a monstrous turtle which lay asleep with its head and legs drawn into its shell it was not in their way so they hurried on and rejoined the frog which said to them im sorry but im due at the kings court in a few minutes and i cant wait for your short weak legs to make the journey to the pink country but if you will climb upon my back i think i can carry you to the border in one more leap  im tired said trot an this awful fogs beginnin to choke me lets ride on the frog capn  right you are mate he replied and although he shook a bit with fear the old man at once began to climb to the frogs back trot seated herself on one side of him and buttonbright on the other and the sailor put his arms around them both to hold them tight together  are you ready asked the frog  dingdong cried the parrot    all aboard let er go   jump the best jump that you know  dontdont jump sort o easy please begged capn bill  but the frog was unable to obey his request its powerful hind legs straightened like steel springs and shot the big body with its passengers through the fog like an arrow launched from a bow they gasped for breath and tried to hang on and then suddenly the frog landed just at the edge of the fog bank stopping so abruptly that his three riders left his back and shot far ahead of him they felt the fog melt away and found themselves bathed in glorious rays of sunshine but they had no time to consider this change because they were still shooting through the air and presentlybefore they could think of anything at allall three were rolling heels over head on the soft grass of a meadow     the pink country  chapter 13   when the travelers could collect their senses and sit up they stared about them in bewilderment for the transition from the sticky damp fog to this brilliant scene was so abrupt as to daze them at first  it was a pink country indeed the grass was a soft pink the trees were pink all the fences and buildings which they saw in the near distance were pinkeven the gravel in the pretty paths was pink many shades of color were there of course grading from a faint blush rose to deep pink verging on red but no other color was visible in the sky hung a pink glow with rosy clouds floating here and there and the sun was not silvery white as we see it from the earth but a distinct pink  the sun was high in the sky just now which proved the adventurers had been a long time in passing through the fog bank but all of them were wonderfully relieved to reach this beautiful country in safety for aside from the danger that threatened them in the blue country the other side of the island was very depressing here the scene that confronted them was pretty and homelike except for the prevailing color and the fact that all the buildings were round without a single corner or angle  half a mile distant was a large city its pink tintings glistening bravely in the pink sunshine while hundreds of pink banners floated from its numerous domes the country between the fog bank and the city was like a vast garden very carefully kept and as neat as wax  the parrot was fluttering its wings and pruning its feathers to remove the wet of the fog trot and buttonbright and capn bill were all soaked to the skin and chilled through but as they sat upon the pink grass they felt the rays of the sun sending them warmth and rapidly drying their clothes so being tired out they laid themselves comfortably down and first one and then another fell cozily asleep  it was the parrot that aroused them    look outlook out   theres folks about  it screamed  the appledumplings fat and pink will be here quicker than a wink  trot stared up in alarm and rubbed her eyes capn bill rolled over and blinked hardly remembering where he was buttonbright was on his feet in an instant advancing toward them were four of the natives of the pink country  two were men and two were women and their appearance was in sharp contrast to that of the blueskins for the pinkies were round and chubbyalmost like appledumplings as the parrot called themand they were not very tall the highest of the men being no taller than trot or buttonbright they all had short necks and legs pink hair and eyes rosy cheeks and pink complexions and their faces were goodnatured and jolly in expression  the men wore picturesque pink clothing and round hats with pink feathers in them but the apparel of the women was still more gorgeous and striking their dresses consisted of layer after layer of gauzy tuck and ruffles and laces caught here and there with bows of dainty ribbon the skirtswhich of course were of many shades of pinkwere so fluffy and light that they stuck out from the fat bodies of the pinkie women like the skirts of balletdancers displaying their chubby pink ankles and pink kid shoes they wore rings and necklaces and bracelets and brooches of rosegold set with pink gems and all four of the new arrivals both men and women carried sharppointed sticks made of rosewood for weapons  they halted a little way from our adventurers and one of the women muttered in a horrified voice blueskins    guess again the more you guess   i rather think youll know the less  retorted the parrot and then he added grumblingly in trots ear blue feathers dont make bluebirds  really said the girl standing up and bowing respectfully to the pinkies we are not blueskins although we are wearing the blue uniforms of the boolooroo and have just escaped from the blue country if you will look closely you will see that our skins are white  there is some truth in what she says remarked one of the men thoughtfully their skins are not blue but neither are they white to be exact i should call the skin of the girl and that of the boy a muddy pink rather faded while the skin of the gigantic monster with them is an unpleasant brown  capn bill looked cross for a minute for he did not like to be called a gigantic monster although he realized he was much larger than the pink people  what country did you come from asked the woman who had first spoken  from the earth replied buttonbright  the earth the earth they repeated that is a country we have never heard of where is it located  why down below somewhere said the boy who did now know in which direction the earth lay it isnt just one country but a good many countries  we have three countries in sky island returned the woman they are the blue country the fog country and the pink country but of course this end of the island is the most important  how came you in the blue country from whence you say you escaped asked the man  we flew there by means of a magic umbrella explained buttonbright but the wicked boolooroo stole it from us  stole it how dreadful they all cried in a chorus  and they made us slaves said trot  an wanted fer to patch us added capn bill indignantly  so we ran away and passed through the fog bank and came here said buttonbright  the pinkies turned away and conversed together in low tones then one of the women came forward and addressed the strangers your story is the strangest we have ever heard said she and your presence here is still more strange and astonishing so we have decided to take you to tourmaline and let her decide what shall be your fate  who is tourmaline inquired trot doubtfully for she didnt like the idea of being taken to anyone  the queen of the pinkies she is the sole ruler of our country so the word of tourmaline is the law of the land  seems to me weve had bout enough of kings an queens remarked capn bill cant we shy your tuttormarlineor whatever you call herin some way an deal with you direct  no until we prove your truth and honor we must regard you as enemies of our race if you had a magic umbrella you may be magicians and sorcerers come here to deceive us and perhaps betray us to our natural enemies the blueskins    mud and bricks fiddlesticks   we dont play such nasty tricks  yelled the parrot angrily and this caused the pinkies to shrink back in alarm for they had never seen a parrot before  surely this is magic declared one of the men no bird can talk unless inspired by witchcraft  oh yes parrots can said trot but this incident had determined the pinkies to consider our friends prisoners and to take them immediately before their queen  must we fight you asked the woman or will you come with us peaceably  well go peaceable answered capn bill youre amakin a sad mistake for were as harmless as doves but seein as youre suspicious wed better have it out with your queen first as last  their clothing was quite dry by this time although much wrinkled and discolored by the penetrating fog so at once they prepared to follow the pinkies the two men walked on either side of them holding the pointed sticks ready to jab them if they attempted to escape and the two women followed in the rear also armed with sharp sticks  so the procession moved along the pretty roadways to the city which they soon reached there was a strong high wall of pink marble around it and they passed through a gate made of pink metal bars and found themselves in a most delightful and picturesque town the houses were big and substantial all round in shape with domed roofs and circular windows and doorways in all the place there was but one streeta circular one that started at the gate and wound like a corkscrew toward the center of the city it was paved with pink marble and between the street and the houses that lined both sides of it were gardens filled with pink flowers and pink grass lawns which were shaded by pink trees and shrubbery  as the queen lived in the very center of the city the captives were obliged to parade the entire length of this street and that gave all the pink citizens a chance to have a good look at the strangers the pinkies were every one short and fat and gorgeously dressed in pink attire and their faces indicated that they were contented and happy they were much surprised at capn bills great size and wooden legtwo very unusual things in their experienceand the old sailor frightened more than one pink boy and girl and sent them scampering into the houses where they viewed the passing procession from behind the window shutters in comparative safety as for the grown people many of them got out their sharppointed sticks to use as weapons in case the strangers attacked them or broke away from their guards a few more bold than the others followed on at the tail of the procession and so presently they all reached an open circular place in the exact center of the pink city     tourmaline the poverty queen  chapter 14   the open space which they entered was paved with pink marble and around it were two rows of large pink statues at least lifesize and beautifully sculptured all were set upon nicely carved pink pedestals they were of course statues of pinky men and women and all had bands of pink metal around their foreheads in the center of each band being a glistening pink jewel  about the middle of the open space inside the statues which appeared to be the public meeting place of the pinkies was a small low house domed like all the other houses but built of a coarse pink stone instead of the fine marble to be seen everywhere else it had no ornamentation being exceedingly plain in appearance no banners floated from it no flowers grew near it  here said one of their guides as the procession halted before the little stone building is the palace of tourmaline who is our queen  what that little cabin exclaimed trot  of course did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome residences asked the woman evidently surprised  i thought it would be better said the girl all the palaces ive seen were splendid  a splendid palace exclaimed one of the pinkies and then they looked at one another in amazement and seemed to doubt that their ears had heard aright  these intruders are very peculiar people remarked a man in the crowd  they seem very ignorant poor things said another in reply  come commanded the woman who led the party you three must follow me to the presence of tourmaline the people must wait outside for there is no room for them in the palace  so they followed her through the low archway and in a room beyond very simply furnished sat a young girl engaged in darning a pair of pink stockings she was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age not fat like all the rest of the pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty her complexion was not a decided pink but a soft rosy tint not much deeper than that of trots skin instead of a silken gown furbelowed like all the others they had seen women wear in this land tourmaline was dressed in a severely plain robe of coarse pink cloth much resembling bedticking across her brow however was a band of rose gold in the center of which was set a luminous pink jewel which gleamed more brilliantly than a diamond it was her badge of office and seemed very incongruous when compared with her poor rainment and simple surroundings  as they entered the girl sighed and laid down her work her expression was patient and resigned as she faced her audience what is it coralie she asked the woman  here are three strange people tourmaline was the reply who say they have entered our country through the fog bank they tell a queer story of an escape from the blueskins so i decided to bring them to you that you may determine their fate  the queen gazed upon our friends with evident interest she smileda little sadlyat trot seemed to approve buttonbrights open frank face and was quite surprised because capn bill was so much bigger than her own people are you a giant she asked the sailor in a soft sweet voice  no your majesty he replied im only  majesty she exclaimed flushing a deeper pink are you addressing that word to me  o course maam answered capn bill im told thats the proper way to speak to a queen  perhaps you are trying to ridicule me she continued regarding the sailors face closely there is nothing majestic about me as you know very well coralie do you consider majesty a proper word to use when addressing a queen she added appealing to the pinky woman  by no means was the prompt reply  what shall i call her then inquired capn bill  just tourmaline that is her name and it is sufficient said the woman  the ruler of a country ought to be treated with great respec declared trot a little indignantly for she thought the pretty little queen was not being properly deferred to  why asked tourmaline curiously  because the ruler is the mos risticratic person in any land explained the little girl even in america everbody bows low to our president an the blueskins are so fraid o their boolooroo that they tremble whenever they go near him  but surely that is all wrong said tourmaline gravely the ruler is appointed to protect and serve the people and here in the pink country i have the full power to carry out the laws i even decree death when such a punishment is merited therefore i am a mere agent to direct the laws which are the will of the people and am only a public servant obliged constantly to guard the welfare of my subjects  in that case said buttonbright youre entitled to the best there is to pay for your trouble a powerful ruler ought to be rich and to live in a splendid palace your folks ought to treat you with great respect as trot says  oh no responded tourmaline quickly that would indeed be very wrong too much should never be given to anyone if with my great power conferred upon me by the people i also possessed great wealth i might be tempted to be cruel and overbearing in that case my subjects would justly grow envious of my superior station if i lived as luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns the good pinkies would say that their queen had more than they themselves and it would be true no our way is best the ruler be it king or queen has absolute power to rule but no riches no high station no false adulation the people have the wealth and honor for it is their due the queen has nothing but the power to execute the laws to adjust grievances and to compel order  what pays you then for all your bother asked trot  i have one great privilege after my death a pink marble statue of me will be set up in the grand court with the statues of the other kings and queens who have ruled this land and all the pinkies in ages to come will then honor me as having been a just and upright queen that is my reward  im sorry for you maam said capn bill your pay for bein a queen is sort o like a lifeinsurance if dont come due till after youre dead an then you cant get much fun out o it  i did not choose to be the queen answered tourmaline simply a misfortune of birth placed me here and i cannot escape my fate it is much more desirable to be a private citizen happy and carefree but we have talked long enough of myself tell me who you are and why you have come here  between them they told the story of how the magic umbrella had taken them to sky island which they did not know when they started was anywhere in existence buttonbright told this and then trot related their adventures among the blueskins and how the boolooroo had stolen the umbrella and prevented them from going home again the parrot on her shoulder kept interrupting her continually for the mention of the boolooroo seemed to make the bird frantic with rage    naughty naughty boolooroo   hes the worst i ever knew  the parrot repeated over and over again  capn bill finished the story by telling of their escape through the fog bank we didnt know what your pink country was like o course he said but we knew it couldnt be worse than the blue country an we didnt take any stock in their stories that the fog bank would be the death o us    pretty wet pretty wet   was the journey you can bet  declared the parrot in conclusion  yes it was wet an sticky all right agreed the sailor but the big frog helped us an we got through all right  but what can you do here asked tourmaline you are not like my people the pinkies and there is no place for you in our country  thats true enough said capn bill but we had to go somewhere an this was the likeliest place we could think of your sky island aint very big so when we couldnt stay in the blue country where everbody hated us or in the fog bank which aint healthy an is too wet for humans to live in for long we natrally were forced to enter the pink country where we expected to find nice people  we are nice said tourmaline but it is our country not yours and we have no place here for strangers in all our history you are the first people from outside our borders who have ever stepped a foot in our land we do not hate you as you say the blueskins do nor are we savage or cruel but we do not want you here and i am really puzzled what to do with you  isnt there a law to cover this case asked coralie  i do not remember any such law replied the queen but i will search in the great book and see if i can find anything that refers to strange people entering our land  if not said the woman you must make a law it is your duty  i know answered tourmaline but i hope such a responsibility will not fall upon my shoulders these poor strangers are in a very uncomfortable position and i wish i could help them to get back to their own country  thank you said trot we wish so too havent you any fairies here  oh there are fairies of course as there are everywhere answered tourmaline but none that we can call to our assistance or command to do our bidding  how about witches asked buttonbright  i know of one witch said tourmaline thoughtfully but she is not very obliging she says it makes her head ache to perform witchcraft and so she seldom indulges in it but if there is no other way i may be obliged to call upon rosalie for help ill look in the great book first meantime you will go home with coralie who will feed you and give you entertainment tomorrow morning come to me again and then i will decree your fate the little queen then picked up her stocking and began to darn the holes in it and coralie without any formal parting led the strangers from the miserable palace     the sunrise tribe and the sunset tribe  chapter 15   although trot and her comrades were still prisoners they were far more comfortable than they had been in the blue country coralie took them to her own home where she lived in great luxury being one of the prominent women of the pinkies in this country the women seemed fully as important as the men and instead of being coddled and petted they performed their share of the work both in public and private affairs and were expected to fight in the wars exactly as the men did  our friends learned considerable about the pinkies during that afternoon and evening for their hostess proved kind and agreeable and frankly answered all their questions although this half of sky island was no larger than the blue country being no more than two miles square it had several hundred inhabitants these were divided into two tribes which were called the sunrise tribe and the sunset tribe the sunrise tribe lived in the eastern half of the pink country and the sunset tribe in the west half and there was great rivalry between them and sometimes war  it was all a question of social importance the sunrise tribe claimed that every day the sun greeted them first of all which proved they were the most important but on the other hand the sunset tribe claimed that the sun always deserted the other tribe and came to them which was evidence that they were the most attractive people on sky islandat least on the pink sidethe sun arose in wonderful splendor but also it set in a blaze of glory and so there were arguments on both sides and for want of something better to argue about the pinkies took this queer subject as a cause of dispute  both tribes acknowledged tourmaline their queen and obeyed the laws of the country and just at this time there was peace in the land and all the inhabitants of the east and west were friendly but they had been known coralie said to fight one another fiercely with their sharp sticks at which times a good many were sure to get hurt  why do they call this an island asked buttonbright there isnt any water around it is there  no but there is sky all around it answered coralie and if one should step off the edge he would go tumbling into the great sky and never be heard of again  is there a fence around the edge asked trot  only a few places are fenced was the reply usually there are rows of thick bushes set close to the edge to prevent people from falling off once there was a king of the pinkies who was cruel and overbearing and imagined he was superior to the people he ruled so one day his subjects carried him to the edge of the island and threw him over the bushes  goodness me said trot he might have hit someone on the earth  guess he skipped it though added capn bill for i never heard of a pinky till i came here  and i have never heard of the earth retorted coralie of course there must be such a place because you came from there but the earth is never visible in our sky  no said buttonbright cause its under your island but its there all right and its a pretty good place to live i wish i could get back to it  so do i buttonbright exclaimed trot  lets fly cried the parrot turning his head so that one bright little eye looked directly into the girls eye say goodbye and lets fly through the sky far and high  if we only had my umbrella wed fly in a minute sighed buttonbright but the boolooroo stole it    naughty naughty boolooroo   what a wicked thing to do  wailed the parrot and they all agreed with him  coralie belonged to the sunset tribe as she lived west of the queens palace which was the center of the pink country a servant came to the room where they were conversing to state that the sun was about to set and at once coralie arose and took the strangers to an upper balcony where all the household had assembled  the neighboring houses also had their balconies and roofs filled with people for it seemed all the sunset tribe came out every night to witness the setting of the sun it was really a magnificent sight and trot scarcely breathed as the great golden ball sank low in the sky and colored all the clouds with gorgeous tints of orange red and yellow never on the earth was there visible such splendor and as the little girl watched the everchanging scene she decided the sunset tribe was amply justified in claiming that the west was the favored country of the sun  you see said capn bill the sky is all around us an were high up so the sun really loses itself in the clouds an leaves a trail of beauty behind him  he does that agreed trot this is almost worth comin for capn  but not quite said buttonbright sadly id get along without the sunset if only we could go home  they went in to dinner after this and sat at coralies own table with her husband and children and found the meal very good after a pleasant evening during which no reference was made to their being prisoners they were shown to prettily furnished roomsall in pinkand slept soundly in the soft beds provided for them trot wakened early the next morning and went out on the balcony to see the sunrise the little girl was well repaid for the splendor of the rising sun was almost equal to that of the setting sun surely this was a wonderful country and much more delightful than the blue side of the island where the sun was hidden by the great fog and only the moon was visible  when she went in she found that both buttonbright and capn bill were up and dressed so they decided to take a walk before breakfast no one restrained them or interfered with them in any way they know we cant get away observed the sailor so they dont need to watch us  we could go into the fog bank again suggested trot  we could mate but we wont answered capn bill if theres no way for us to get clean offn sky island id rather stay with the pinkies than with the blues  i wonder what theyll do with us said buttonbright the queen seems like a nice girl and i dont think shell hurt us whatever happens  they walked freely along the circular street seeing such sights as the pink city afforded and then returned to coralies house for breakfast coralie herself was not there as she had been summoned to the queens palace but her husband looked after the guests and when breakfast was finished he said to them i am to take you to tourmaline who has promised to decide your fate this morning i am curious to know what she will do with you for in all our history we have never before had strangers intrude upon us  were curious too said trot but well soon find out as they walked down the street they observed that the sky was now covered with dark clouds which entirely hid the sun  does it ever rain here inquired buttonbright  certainly answered coralies husband that is the one drawback of our country it rains quite often and although it makes the flowers and the grass grow i think rain is very disagreeable i am always glad to see the rainbow which is a sign that the sun will shine again  looks like rain now remarked capn bill  it does said the man glancing at the sky we must hurry or we may get wet  havent you any umbrellas asked buttonbright  no we dont know what umbrellas are replied the pinky man  it did not rain at once and they reached tourmalines wretched hut in safety there they found quite a number of pinkies assembled and a spirited discussion was taking place when they arrived  come in please said tourmaline opening the door for them and when they had entered she placed a pinkwood bench for them to sit upon and went back to her throne which was a common rocking chair at her right were seated six men and women of the sunrise tribe and on her left six men and women of the sunset tribe among the latter being coralie the contrast between the plain simple dress of the queen and the gorgeous apparel of her counselors was quite remarkable yet her beauty far surpassed that of any of her people and her demeanor was so modest and unassuming that it was difficult for the prisoners to believe that her word would decree life or death and that all the others were subservient to her tourmalines eyes were so deep a shade of pink that they were almost hazel and her hair was darker than that of the others being a goldenred in color these points taken with her lightpink skin and slender form rendered her distinctive among the pinkies whatever gown she might wear  when the strangers were seated she turned to them and said i have searched through the great book of laws and found nothing about foreign people entering our land there is a law that if any of the blueskins break through the fog bank they shall be driven back with sharp sticks but you are not blueskins so this law does not apply to you therefore in order to decide your fate i have summoned a council of twelve of my people who will vote as to whether you shall be permitted to remain here or not they wanted to see you before they cast their final vote that they may examine you carefully and discover if you are worthy to become inhabitants of the pink country    the rose is red the violets blue   but trot is sweeter than the two  declared the parrot in a loud voice it was a little verse capn bill had taught the bird that very morning while trot was seeing the sun rise  the pinkies were startled and seemed a little frightened at hearing a bird speak so clearly trot laughed and patted the birds head in return for the compliment is the monster man whose legs are part wood a dangerous creature asked one of the sunrise tribe  not to my friends replied capn bill much amused i spose i could fight your whole crowd of pinkies if i had to an make you run for your lives but bein as youre friendly to us you aint in any danger the sailor thought this speech was diplomatic and might head off any trouble but the pinkies seemed uneasy and several of them picked up their slender pointed sticks and held them in their hands they were not cowardly but it was evident they mistrusted the big man who on earth was not considered big at all but rather undersized  what wed like said trot is to stay here cozy an peaceable till we can find a way to get home to the earth again your country is much nicer than the blue country and we like you pretty well from what weve seen of you so if youll let us stay we wont be any more trouble to you than we can help  they all gazed upon the little girl curiously and one of them said how strangely light her color is and it is pink too which is in her favor but her eyes are of that dreadful blue tint which prevails in the other half of sky island while her hair is a queer color unknown to us she is not like our people and would not harmonize with the universal color here  thats true said another the three strangers are all inharmonious if allowed to remain here they would ruin the color scheme of the country where all is now pink  in spite of that said coralie they are harmless creatures and have done us no wrong  yes they have replied a nervous little sunrise man they wronged us by coming here  they could not help doing that argued coralie and it is their misfortune that they are here on sky island at all perhaps if we keep them with us for a while they may find a way to return safely to their own country  well fly through the sky byandbykiyi yelled the parrot with startling suddenness  is that true asked a pinky seriously  why we would if we could answered trot we flew to this island anyhow  perhaps said another if we pushed them off the edge they could fly down again who knows  we know answered capn bill hastily wed tumble but we wouldnt fly    theyd take a fall   and that is all  observed the parrot fluttering its wings there was silence for a moment while all the pinkies seemed to think deeply then the queen asked the strangers to step outside while they counseled together our friends obeyed and leaving the room they all entered the courtyard and examined the rows of pink marble statues for nearly an hour before they were summoned to return to the little room in tourmalines palace  we are now ready to vote as to your fate said the pretty queen to them we have decided there are but two things for us do to either permit you to remain here as honored guests or take you to an edge of the island and throw you over the bushes into the sky  they were silent at hearing this dreadful alternative but the parrot screamed shrilly    oh what a dump oh what a jump   wont we all thump when we land with a bump  if we do said capn bill thoughtfully well none of us know it     rosalie the witch  chapter 16   trot and buttonbright had now become worried and anxious for they knew if they were tossed over the edge of the island they would be killed capn bill frowned and set his jaws tight together the old sailor had made up his mind to make a good fight for his boy and girl as well as for his own life if he was obliged to do so  the twelve counselors then voted and when the vote was counted tourmaline announced that six had voted to allow the strangers to remain and six to toss them over the bushes we seem evenly divided on this matter remarked the queen with a puzzled look at her council  trot thought the pretty queen was their friend so she said of course youll have the deciding vote then you being the ruler  oh no replied tourmaline since i have asked these good people to advise me it would be impolite to side against some of them and with the others that would imply that the judgment of some of my counselors is wrong and the judgment of others right i must ask someone else to cast the deciding vote  who will it be then inquired trot cant i do it or capn bill or buttonbright  tourmaline smiled and shook her head while all the counselors murmured their protests    let trot do it   or youll rue it  advised the parrot and then he barked like a dog and made them all jump  let me think a moment said the queen resting her chin on her hand    a pink can think   as quicks a wink  the parrot declared but tourmalines thoughts required time and all her counselors remained silent and watched her anxiously  at last she raised her head and said i shall call upon rosalie the witch she is wise and honest and will decide the matter justly  the pinkies seemed to approve this choice so tourmaline rose and took a small pink paper parcel from a drawer in it was a pink powder which she scattered upon the seat of a big armchair then she lighted this powder which at first flashed vivid pink and then filled all the space around the chair with a thick pink cloud of smoke presently the smoke cleared away when they all saw seated within the chair rosalie the witch  this famous woman was much like the other pinkies in appearance except that she was somewhat taller and not quite so fat as most of the people her skin and hair and eyes were all of a rosy pink color and her gown was of spiderweb gauze that nicely matched her complexion she did not seem very old for her features were smiling and attractive and pleasant to view she held in her hand a slender staff tipped with a lustrous pink jewel  all the pinkies present bowed very respectfully to rosalie who returned the salutation with a dignified nod then tourmaline began to explain the presence of the three strangers and the difficulty of deciding what to do with them  i have summoned you here that you may cast the deciding vote added the queen what shall we do rosalie allow them to remain here as honored guests or toss them over the bushes into the sky  rosalie during tourmalines speech had been attentively examining the faces of the three earth people now she said  before i decide i must see who these strangers are i will follow their adventures in a vision to discover if they have told you the truth and in order that you may all share my knowledge you shall see the vision as i see it she then bowed her head and closed her eyes    rockabye baby on a treetop   dont wake her up or the vision will stop  muttered the parrot but no one paid any attention to the noisy bird  gradually a pink mist formed in the air about the witch and in this mist the vision began to appear  first there was buttonbright in the attic of his house finding the magic umbrella then his first flight was shown and afterward his trip across the united states until he landed on the bluff where trot sat in rapid succession the scenes shifted and disclosed the trial flights with trot and capn bill as passengers then the trip to sky island and the meeting with the boolooroo no sound was heard but it was easy from the gestures of the actors for the pinkies to follow all the adventures of the strangers in the blue country buttonbright was greatly astonished to see in this vision how the boolooroo had tested the magic umbrella and in a fit of rage cast it into a corner underneath the cabinet with the seats and lunch basket still attached to the handle by means of the rope the boy now knew why he could not find the umbrella in the treasure chamber and he was provoked to think he had several times been quite close to it without knowing it was there the last scene ended with the trip through the fog bank and the assistance rendered them by the friendly frog after the three tumbled upon the grass of the pink country the vision faded away and rosalie lifted her head with a smile of triumph at the success of her witchcraft  did you see clearly she asked  we did o wonderful witch they declared  then said rosalie there can be no doubt in your minds that these strangers have told you the truth  none at all they admitted  what arguments are advanced by the six counselors who voted to allow them to remain here as guests inquired the witch  they have done us no harm answered coralie speaking for her side therefore we should in honor and justice do them no harm  rosalie nodded what arguments have the others advanced she asked  they interfere with our color scheme and do not harmonize with our people a man of the sunrise tribe answered  again rosalie nodded and trot thought her eyes twinkled a little  i think i now fully comprehend the matter said she and so i will cast my vote i favor taking the earth people to the edge of the island and casting them into the sky  for a moment there was perfect silence in the room all present realized that this was a decree of death to the strangers trot was greatly surprised at the decision and for a moment she thought her heart had stopped beating for a wave of fear swept over her buttonbright flushed red as a pinky and then grew very pale he crept closer to trot and took her hand in his own pressing it to give the little girl courage as for capn bill he was watching the smiling face of the witch in a puzzled but not hopeless way for he thought she did not seem wholly in earnest in what she had said  the case is decided announced tourmaline in a clear cold voice the three strangers shall be taken at once to the edge of the island and thrown over the bushes into the sky  its raining hard outside announced coralie who sat near the door why not wait until this shower is over  i have said at once replied the little queen with dignity and so it must be at once we are accustomed to rain so it need not delay us and when a disagreeable duty is to be performed the sooner it is accomplished the better  may i ask maam said capn bill addressing the witch why you have decided to murder of us in this coldblooded way  i did not decide to murder you answered rosalie  to throw us off the island will be murder declared the sailor  then they cannot throw you off the witch replied  the queen says they will  i know said rosalie but im quite positive her people cant do it  this statement astonished all the pinkies who looked at the witch inquiringly why not asked tourmaline  it is evident to me said the witch speaking slowly and distinctly that these earth people are protected in some way by fairies they may not be aware of this themselves nor did i see any fairies in my vision but if you will think upon it carefully you will realize that the magic umbrella has no power in itself but is enchanted by fairy power so that it is made to fly and carry passengers through the air by fairies this being the case i do not think you will be allowed to injure these favored people in any way but i am curious to see in what manner the fairies will defend them and therefore i have voted to have them thrown off the island i bear these strangers no ill will nor do i believe they are in any danger but since you tourmaline have determined to attempt this terrible thing at once i shall go with you and see what will happen  some of the pinkies looked pleased and some troubled at this speech but they all prepared to escort the prisoners to the nearest edge of the island the rain was pouring down in torrents and umbrellas were unknown but all of them both men and women slipped gossamer raincoats over their clothing which kept the rain from wetting them then they caught up their sharp sticks and surrounding the doomed captives commanded them to march to meet their fate     the arrival of polychrome  chapter 17   capn bill had determined to fight desperately for their lives but he was a shrewd old sailorman and he found much that was reasonable in the witchs assertion that fairies would protect them he had often wondered how the magic umbrella could fly and obey spoken commands but now he plainly saw that the thing must be directed by some invisible power and that power was quite likely to save them from the cruel death that had been decreed to be sure the magic umbrella was now in the blue country and the fairies that directed its flight might be with the umbrella instead of with them yet the old sailor had already experienced some strange adventures in trots company and knew she had managed to escape every danger that had threatened so he decided not to fight until the last moment and meekly hobbled along the street as he was commanded to do trot was also encouraged by the witchs suggestion for she believed in fairies and trusted them but buttonbright could find no comfort in their situation and his face was very sad as he marched along by trots side  if they had followed the corkscrew windings of the street it would have been a long journey to the outer edge of the pink country but tourmaline took a shortcut leading them through private gardens and even through houses so that they followed almost a bee line to their destination it rained all the way and the walking was very disagreeable but our friends were confronting an important crisis in their strange adventures and with possible death at their journeys end they were in no hurry to arrive there  once free of the city they traversed the open country and here they often stepped into sticky pink mud up to their ankles capn bills wooden leg would often go down deep and stick fast in this mud and at such times he would be helpless until two of the pinkieswho were a strong peoplepulled him out again the parrot was getting its feathers sadly draggled in the rain and the poor bird soon presented a wet and woebegone appearance    soak us again   drown us with rain  it muttered in a resigned tone and then it would turn to trot and moan the rose is red the violets blue the pinkies are a beastly crew  the country was not so trim and neatly kept near the edge for it was evident the people did not care to go too near to the dangerous place there was a row of thick bushes which concealed the gulf below and as they approached these bushes the rain abruptly ceased and the clouds began to break and drift away in the sky two of you seize the girl and throw her over said tourmaline in a calm matteroffact way and two others must throw the boy over it may take four perhaps to lift the huge and ancient man  moren that said capn bill grimly im pretty sure itll take all o you young lady an the chances are you wont do it then  they had halted a short distance from the bushes and now there suddenly appeared through a rift in the clouds an immense rainbow it was perfectly formed and glistened with a dozen or more superb tintings that were so vivid and brilliant and blended into one another so exquisitely that everyone paused to gaze enraptured upon the sight steadily yet with wonderful swiftness the end of the great bow descended until it rested upon the pink fieldalmost at the feet of the little party of observers then they saw dancing gaily upon the arch a score of beautiful maidens dressed in fleecy robes of rainbow tints which fluttered around them like clouds  the daughters of the rainbow whispered tourmaline in an awed voice and the witch beside her nodded and said fairies of the sky what did i tell you tourmaline  just then one of the maidens tripped lightly down the span of the arch until near the very end leaning over to observe the group below she was exquisitely fair dainty as a lily and graceful as a bough swaying in the breeze why its polychrome exclaimed buttonbright in a voice of mingled wonder and delight hello polly dont you remember me  of course i remember buttonbright replied the maiden in a sweet tinkling voice the last time i saw you was in the land of oz  oh cried trot turning to stare at the boy with big wideopen eyes were you ever in the land of oz  yes he answered still looking at the rainbows daughter and then he said appealingly these people want to kill us polly cant you help us    polly wants a cracker   polly wants a cracker  screeched the parrot  polychrome straightened up and glanced at her sisters tell father to call for me in an hour or two said she there is work for me to do here for one of my old friends is in trouble  with this she sprang lightly from the rainbow and stood beside buttonbright and trot and scarcely had she left the splendid arch when it lifted and rose into the sky the other end had been hidden in the clouds and now the rainbow began to fade gradually like mist and the sun broke through the clouds and shot its cheering rays over the pink country until presently the rainbow had vanished altogether and the only reminder of it was the lovely polychrome standing among the wondering band of pinkies tell me she said gently to the boy why are you here and why do these people of the sky wish to destroy you  in a few hurried words buttonbright related their adventures with the magic umbrella and how the boolooroo had stolen it and they had been obliged to escape into the pink country polychrome listened and then turned to the queen why have you decreed death to these innocent strangers she asked  they do not harmonize with our color scheme replied tourmaline  that is utter nonsense declared polychrome impatiently youre so dreadfully pink here that your color which in itself is beautiful had become tame and insipid what you really need is some sharp contrast to enhance the charm of your country and to keep these three people here would be a benefit rather than an injury to you  at this the pinkies looked downcast and ashamed while only rosalie the witch laughed and seemed to enjoy the rebuke but protested tourmaline the great book of laws says our country shall harbor none but the pinkies  does it indeed asked the rainbows daughter come let us return at once to your city and examine your book of laws i am quite sure i can find in them absolute protection for these poor wanderers  they dared not disobey polychromes request so at once they all turned and walked back to the city as it was still muddy underfoot the rainbows daughter took a cloak from one of the women partly rolled it and threw it upon the ground then she stepped upon it and began walking forward the cloak unrolled as she advanced affording a constant carpet for her feet and for those of the others who followed her so being protected from the mud and wet they speedily gained the city and in a short time were all gathered in the low room of tourmalines palace where the great book of laws lay upon a table  polychrome began turning over the leaves while the others all watched her anxiously and in silence here she said presently is a law which reads as follows everyone in the pink country is entitled to the protection of the ruler and to a house and a good living except only the blueskins if any of the natives of the blue country should ever break through the fog bank they must be driven back with sharp sticks have you read this law tourmaline  yes said the queen but how does that apply to these strangers  why being in the pink country as they surely are and not being blueskins they are by this law entitled to protection to a home and good living the law does not say pinkies it says any who are in the pink country  true agreed coralie greatly pleased and all the other pinkies nodded their heads and repeated true true    the rose is red the violets blue   the laws the thing because its true  cried the parrot  i am indeed relieved to have you interpret the law in this way declared tourmaline i knew it was cruel to throw these poor people over the edge but that seemed to us the only thing to be done  it was cruel and unjust answered polychrome as sternly as her sweet voice could speak but here she added for she had still continued to turn the leaves of the great book is another law which you have also overlooked it says the person whether man or woman boy or girl living in the pink country who has the lightest skin shall be the rulerking or queenas long as he or she lives unless someone of a lighter skin is found and this rulers commands all the people must obey do you know this law  oh yes replied tourmaline that is why i am the queen you will notice my complexion is of a lighter pink than that of any other of my people  yes remarked polychrome looking at her critically when you were made queen without doubt you had the lightestcolored skin in all the pink country but now you are no longer queen of the pinkies tourmaline  those assembled were so startled by this statement that they gazed at the rainbows daughter in astonishment for a time then tourmaline asked why not your highness  because here is one lighter in color than yourself pointed to trot this girl is by the law of the great book the rightful queen of the pinkies and as loyal citizens you are all obliged to obey her commands give me that circlet from your brow tourmaline without hesitation tourmaline removed the rosegold circlet with its glittering jewel and handed it to polychrome who turned and placed it upon trots brow then she called in a loud imperative voice greet your new queen pinkies  one by one they all advanced knelt before trot and pressed her hand to their lips long live queen mayre called out capn bill dancing around on his wooden leg in great delight vive lavive laah ah trot  thank you polly said buttonbright gratefully this will fix us all right im sure  why i have done nothing returned polychrome smiling upon him it is the law of the country isnt it surprising how little people know of their laws are you all contented pinkies she asked turning to the people  we are they cried then several of the men ran out to spread the news throughout the city and country so that a vast crowd soon began to gather in the court of the statues     mayre queen of the pink country  chapter 18   polychrome now dismissed all but buttonbright capn bill rosalie the witch and the new queen of the pinkies tourmaline hastened away to her fathers house to put on a beautiful gown all covered with flounces and ribbons for she was glad to be relieved of the duties of the queen and was eager to be gaily dressed and one of the people again  i spose said trot ill have to put on one of tourmalines common pink dresses  yes replied polychrome you must follow the customs of the country absurd though they may be in the little sleeping chamber adjoining this room you will find plenty of gowns poor enough for the queen to wear shall i assist you to put one on  no answered trot i guess i can manage it alone  when she withdrew to the little chamber the rainbows daughter began conversing with the witch whom she urged to stay with the new queen and protect her as long as she ruled the pink country rosalie who longed to please the powerful polychrome whose fairy powers as daughters of the rainbow were far superior to her own witchcraft promised faithfully to devote herself to queen mayre as long as she might need her services  by the time trot was dressed in pink and had returned to the room there was an excited and clamorous crowd assembled in the court and polychrome took the little girls hand and led her out to greet her new subjects the pinkies were much impressed by the fact that the rainbows daughter was their new queens friend and that rosalie the witch stood on trots left hand and treated her with humble deference so they shouted their approval very enthusiastically and pressed forward one by one to kneel before their new ruler and kiss her hand  the parrot was now on capn bills shoulder for trot thought a queen ought not to carry a bird around but the parrot did not mind the change and was as much excited as anyone in the crowd oh what bliss to kiss a miss he shouted as trot held out her hand to be kissed by her subjects and then he would scream    were in the sky and flyin high   were goin to live instead of die   its time to laugh instead of cry   oh my kiyi aint this a pie  capn bill let the bird jabber as he pleased for the occasion was a joyful one and it was no wonder the parrot was excited and while the throng shouted greetings to the queen suddenly the great rainbow appeared in the sky and dropped its end right on the court of the statues polychrome stooped to kiss trot and buttonbright gave capn bill a charming smile and rosalie the witch a friendly nod of farewell then she sprang lightly upon the arch of the rainbow and was greeted by the bevy of dancing laughing maidens who were her sisters i shall keep watch over you buttonbright she called to the boy dont despair whatever happens for behind the clouds is always the rainbow  thank you polly he answered and trot also thanked the lovely polychrome and so did capn bill the parrot made quite a long speech flying high above the arch where polychrome stood and then back to capn bills shoulder said he    we pollys know our business and were all right   well take good care of capn bill and trot and buttonbright   you watch em from the rainbow and ill watch day and night   and well call a sky policeman if trouble comes in sight  suddenly the bow lifted and carried the dancing maidens into the sky the colors faded the arch slowly dissolved and the heavens were clear trot turned to the pinkies lets have a holiday today she said have a good time and enjoy yourselves i dont jus know how im goin to rule this country yet but ill think it over an let you know then she went into the palace hut with capn bill and buttonbright and rosalie the witch and the people went away to enjoy themselves and talk over the surprising events of the day  dear me said trot throwing herself into a chair wasnt that a sudden change of fortune though that rainbows daughter is a pretty good fairy im glad you know her buttonbright  i was sure something would happen to save you remarked rosalie and that was why i voted to have you thrown off the edge i wanted to discover who would come to your assistance and i found out now i have made a friend of polychrome and that will render me more powerful as a witch for i can call upon her for assistance whenever i need her  but see here said capn bill you cant afford to spend your time arulin this tuckedup country trot  why not asked trot who was pleased with her new and important position  itd get pretty tiresome mate after youd had a few quarrels with the pinkies for they expec their queen to be as poor as poverty an never have any fun in life  you wouldnt like it for long im sure added buttonbright seriously  trot seemed thoughtful no i dont knows i would she admitted but as long as we stay here it seems a pretty good thing to be queen i guess im a little proud of it i wish mother could see me rulin the pinkies an papa griffith too wouldnt they open their eyes  they would mate but they cant see you said capn bill so the question is whats to be done  we ought to get home observed the boy our folks will worry about us and earths the best place to live after all if we could only get hold of my magic umbrella wed be all right    the rose is red the violets blue   but the umbrels stolen by the boolooroo  screamed the parrot  thats it said capn bill the boolooroos got the umbrel an that settles the question  tell me said rosalie if you had your magic umbrella could you fly home again in safety  of course we could replied buttonbright  and would you prefer to go home to remaining here  we would indeed  then why do you not get the umbrella  how asked trot eagerly  you must go into the blue country and force the boolooroo to give up your property  through the fog bank asked capn bill doubtfully  and let the boolooroo capture us again demanded buttonbright with a shiver  an have to wait on the snubnoses instead of bein a queen said trot  you must remember that conditions have changed and you are now a powerful ruler replied rosalie the pinkies are really a great nation and they are pledged to obey your commands why not assemble an army march through the fog bank fight and conquer the boolooroo and recapture the magic umbrella  hooray shouted capn bill pounding his wooden leg on the floor thats the proper talk lets do it queen trot  it doesnt seem like a bad idea added buttonbright  do you think the pinkies would fight the blueskins asked trot  why not replied the sailorman they have sharp sticks an know how to use em whereas the blueskins have only them windinup cords with weights on the ends  the blueskins are the biggest people said the girl  but theyre cowards im sure declared the boy  anyhow the sailor remarked thats our only hope of ever gettn home again id like to try it trot  if you decide on this adventure said rosalie i believe i can be of much assistance to you  thatll help asserted capn bill  and weve one good friend among the blueskins said buttonbright im sure ghipghisizzle will side with us and ive got the royal record book which proves that the boolooroo has already reigned his lawful three hundred years  does the book say that inquired trot with interest  yes ive been reading it  then sizzlell be the new boolooroo said the girl an praps we wont have to fight after all  wed better go prepared though advised capn bill fer that awful ol boolooroo wont give up without a struggle when shall we start  trot hesitated so they all looked to rosalie for advice just as soon as we can get the army together and ready decided the witch that will not take long perhaps two or three days  good cried capn bill and the parrot screamed    heres a lovely howdydo   were going to fight the boolooroo   well get the six snubnoses too   and make em all feel mighty blue  either that or the other thing said trot anyhow were in for it     the war of the pinks and blues  chapter 19   much to the surprise of the earth people the pinkies made no objection whatever to undertaking the adventure their lives were so monotonous and uninteresting that they welcomed anything in the way of excitement this march through the unknown fog bank to fight the unknown blueskins aroused them to enthusiasm and although the result of the expedition could not be foretold and some of them were almost certain to get hurt they did not hesitate to undertake the war  it appeared that coralie was captain of the sunset tribe and a man named tintint the captain of the sunrise tribe tintint had a very pink skin and eyes so faded in their pink color that he squinted badly in order to see anything around him he was a fat and pompous little fellow and loved to strut up and down his line of warriors twirling his long pointed stick so that all might admire him  by rosalies advice the army of conquest consisted of one hundred sunsets and one hundred sunrises many more were eager to go but the witch thought that would be enough the warriors consisted of both men and women equally divided and there was no need to provide uniforms for them because their regular pink clothing was a distinctive uniform in itself each one bore a long pointed stick as the main weapon and had two short pointed sticks stuck in his belt  while the army was getting ready rosalie the witch went to the central edge of the fog bank and fearlessly entered it there she called for the king of the giant frogs who came at her bidding and the two held an earnest and long talk together meantime capn bill had the army assembled in the court of the statues where queen mayre appeared and told the pinkies that the sailorman was to be commander in chief of the expedition and all must obey his commands then capn bill addressed the army and told them what the fog bank was like he advised them all to wear their raincoats over their pretty pink clothes so they would not get wet and he assured them that all the creatures to be met with in the fog were perfectly harmless  when we come to the blue country though he added youre liable to be pretty busy the blueskins are tall an lanky an ugly an fierce an if they happen to capture you youll all be patched which is a deep disgrace an a uncomfortable mixup  will they throw us over the edge asked captain tintint  i dont think so replied capn bill while i was there i never heard the edge mentioned theyre cruel enough to do thatspecially the boolooroobut i guess theyve never thought o throwin folks over the edge they fight with long cords that have weights on the ends which coil round you an make you helpless in a jiffy so whenever they throw them cords you mus ward em off with your long sticks dont let em wind around your bodies or youre done for  he told them other things about the blueskins so they would not be frightened when they faced the enemy and found them so different in appearance from themselves and also he assured them that the pinkies were so much the braver and better armed that he had no doubt they would easily conquer  on the third day just at sunrise the army moved forward to the fog bank headed by capn bill clad in an embroidered pink coat with wide flowing pink trousers and accompanied by trot and buttonbright and rosalie the witch all bundled up in their pink raincoats the parrot was there too as the bird refused to be left behind  they had not advanced far into the deep fog when they were halted by a queer barrier consisting of a long line of gigantic frogs crouching so close together that no pinkie could squeeze between them as the heads of the frogs were turned the other way toward the blue country the army could not at first imagine what the barrier was but rosalie said to them our friends the frogs have agreed to help us through the fog bank climb upon their backs as many on each frog as are able to hold on and then we shall make the journey more quickly obeying this injunction the pinkies began climbing upon the frogs and by crowding close together all were able to find places on the back of the king frog rode trot and her parrot besides rosalie buttonbright capn bill and the captains of the two companies of the army  when all were seated clinging to one another so they would not slide off capn bill gave the word of command and away leaped the frogs all together they bounded a long distance at this jumpsome farther than othersand as soon as they landed they jumped again without giving their passengers a chance to get their breaths it was a bewildering and exciting ride but a dozen of the huge jumps accomplished the journey and at the edge of the fog bank each frog stopped so suddenly that the pinkies went flying over their heads to tumble into the blue fields of the blue country where they rolled in a confused mass until they could recover and scramble to their feet no one was hurt however and the king frog had been wise enough to treat his passengers more gently by slowing down at the edge and allowing his riders to slip to the ground very comfortably  capn bill at once formed his army into line of battle and had them all remove the cumbersome raincoats which they piled in a heap at the edge of the fog bank it was a splendid array of warriors and from where they stood they could discover several blueskins rushing in a panic toward the blue city as fast as their long blue legs could carry them  well they know were here anyhow said capn bill and instead of waitin to see whatll they do i guess well jus march on the city an ask em to please surrender     ghipghisizzle has a bad time  chapter 20   the boolooroo was quite busy at the time the pinkies invaded his country he had discovered the loss of the book of records and after being frightened most to death at the prospect of his fraud on the peoples being made public he decided to act boldly and hold his position as boolooroo at any cost  since ghipghisizzle was to be the next boolooroo the king suspected him first of all so he had the majordomo bound with cords and brought before him when he accused him of stealing the book of records of course ghipghisizzle denied taking the book but he became almost as nervous at its loss as had the boolooroo he secretly believed that buttonbright had taken the book from the treasure chamber and if this were true it might prove as great a misfortune as if the king had kept it locked up for buttonbright had escaped into the fog bank and ghipghisizzle was afraid the boy would never again be seen in the blue country  he did not tell the boolooroo of this suspicion because in that case the king would realize he was secure and that his deception could never be proved against him the majordomo simply denied taking the record book and the boolooroo did not believe he spoke truly to prevent his rival from ever becoming the ruler of the blue country the boolooroo determined to have him patched but for some time he could find no other blueskin to patch him with no one had disobeyed a command or done anything wrong so the king was in a quandary until he discovered that a servant named tiggle had mixed the royal nectar for capn bill who had been ordered to do it at the time of his capture this was sufficient excuse for the boolooroo who at once had tiggle made a prisoner and brought before him  this servant was not so longlegged as ghipghisizzle and his head was thicker and his nose flatter but that pleased the boolooroo all the more he realized that when the great knife had sliced the prisoners in two and their halves were patched together they would present a ridiculous sight and all the blueskins would laugh at them and avoid them so on the very morning that the pinkies arrived the boolooroo had ordered his two prisoners brought into the room of the palace where the great knife stood and his soldiers were getting ready to perform the operation of patching ghipghisizzle with tingle when a messenger came running to say that a great army of the pinkies had broken through the fog bank  never mind said the boolooroo ill attend to them in a minute im busy now  they are marching on the city said the frightened messenger if you delay most high and mighty one we shall all be captured youd better save your city first and do your patching afterward  what roared the boolooroo dare you dictate to me but he was impressed by the mans logic after locking the prisoners who were still bound in the room of the great knife the ruler hurried away to assemble his soldiers by this time the pinkies had advanced halfway to the walls of the city so the first thing the boolooroo did was to order all the gates closed and locked and then he placed a line of soldiers on the wall to prevent any of the pinkies from climbing over therefore when capn bills army reached the wall he was obliged to halt his ranks until he could find a way to enter the city  now when the boolooroo looked through the bluesteel bars of the main gate and saw the enemy armed with sharppointed sticks he began to tremble and when he thought how painful it would be to have his body and arms and legs prodded and pricked by such weapons he groaned aloud and was very miserable but the thought occurred to him that if he could avoid being caught by the pinkies they would be unable to harm him so he went among his people and reminded them how horrible it would feel to be punched full of holes by the invaders and urged them to fight desperately and drive the pinkies back into the fog bank  only a few of the blueskins were soldiers and these all belonged to the kings bodyguard but the citizens realized that they must indeed fight bravely to save themselves from getting hurt so they promised the boolooroo to do all they could they armed themselves with long cords having weights fastened to the ends and practiced throwing these weights in such a manner that the cords would wind around their enemies also they assembled in the streets in small groups and told each other in frightened whispers that all their trouble was due to the boolooroos cruel treatment of the earth people if he had received them as friends instead of making them slaves they would never have escaped to the pinkies and brought an army into the blue country that they might be revenged the blueskins had not liked their boolooroo before this and now they began to hate him forgetting they had also treated the strangers in a very disagreeable manner  meantime the six snubnosed princesses had seen from their rooms in a tower of the palace the army of the pinkies marching upon them and the sight had served to excite them greatly they had been quarreling bitterly among themselves all morning and strangely enough this quarrel was all about which of them should marry ghipghisizzle they knew that some day the majordomo would become boolooroo and each one of the six had determined to marry him so as to be queen and thus force her sisters to obey her commands they paid no attention to the fact that ghipghisizzle did not want to marry any of them for they had determined that when it was agreed who should have him they would ask their father to force the man to marry  while they quarreled in one room of the palace ghipghisizzle was in danger of being patched in another room but the six snubnosed princesses did not know that the arrival of the pinkies gave them something new to talk about so they hurried downstairs and along the corridors so as to gain the courtyard and take part in the exciting scenes but as they passed the closed doors of the room of the great knife they heard a low moan and stopped to listen the moan was repeated and being curious they unlocked the doorthe key having been left on the outsideand entered the room  at once the pinkies were forgotten for there upon the floor tightly bound lay ghipghisizzle and beside him poor tiggle who had uttered the moans  the six princesses sat down in a circle facing the captives and cerulia said ghip my dear we will release you on one condition that you choose a wife from among us and promise to marry the one selected as soon as the pinkies are driven back into the fog bank  ghipghisizzle managed to shake his head then he said really ladies you must excuse me id rather be patched than mismatched as i would be with a lovely snubnosed wife you are too beautiful for me go seek your husbands elsewhere  monster cried indigo if you choose me ill scratch your eyes out  if you choose me said cobalt in a rage ill tear out your hair by the roots  if i am to be your wife screamed azure ill mark your obstinate face with my fingernails  and i said turquoise passionately will pound your head with a broomstick  ill shake him till his teeth rattle shrieked sapphire  the best way to manage a husband observed cerulia angrily is to pull his nose  ladies said ghipghisizzle when he had a chance to speak do not anticipate these pleasures i beg of you for i shall choose none among you for a wife  well see about that said indigo  i think you will soon change your mind added azure  im going to be patched to tingle here as soon as the boolooroo returns said ghipghisizzle and its against the law for a patched man to marry anyone its regarded as halfbigamy  dear me cried cerulia if hes patched he never can be boolooroo  then he musnt be patched declared sapphire we must save him from that fate girls and force him to decide among us otherwise none of us can ever be the queen  this being evident they proceeded to unbind the long legs of ghipghisizzle leaving his body and arms however tied fast together then between them they got him upon his feet and led him away paying no attention to poor tiggle who whined to be released so he could fight in the war after a hurried consultation the six snubnosed princesses decided to hide the majordomo in one of their boudoirs so they dragged him up the stairs to their reception room and fell to quarreling as to whose boudoir should be occupied by their captive not being able to settle the question they finally locked him up in a vacant room across the hall and told him he must stay there until he had decided to marry one of the princesses and could make a choice among them     the capture of capn bill  chapter 21   while this was transpiring in the palace capn bill and the pinkies had encamped before the principal gate of the city and a tent had been pitched for trot and buttonbright and rosalie the army had been very fearful and weakkneed when it first entered the blue country but perceiving that the boolooroo and his people were afraid of them and had locked themselves up in the city the pinkies grew bolder and longed to make an attack  one of them in his curiosity to examine the blue city got a little too near the wall and a blue soldier threw his cordandweight at him the cord didnt wind around the pinkie as he was too far off but the weight hit him in the eye and made him howl lustily as he trotted back to this comrades at full speed after this experience the invaders were careful to keep a safe distance from the wall  the boolooroo having made all preparations to receive the enemy was annoyed because they held back he was himself so nervous and excited that he became desperate and after an hour of tedious waiting during which time he pranced around impatiently he decided to attack the hated pinkies and rid the country of them  their dreadful color makes me hysterical he said to his soldiers so if i am to have any peace of mind we must charge the foe and drive them back into the fog bank but take all the prisoners you can my brave men and tomorrow we will have a jolly time patching them dont be afraid those pink creatures have no blue blood in their veins and theyll run like rabbits when they see us coming  then he ordered the gate thrown open and immediately the blueskins poured out into the open plain and began to run toward the pinkies the boolooroo went out too but he kept well behind his people remembering the sharp sticks with which the enemy were armed  capn bill was alert and had told his army what to do in case of an attack the pinkies did not run like rabbits but formed a solid line and knelt down with their long sharp sticks pointed directly toward the blueskins the other ends being set firmly upon the ground of course the blueskins couldnt run against these sharp points so they halted a few feet away and began swinging their cordandweights but the pinkies were too close together to be caught in this manner and now by command of capn bill they suddenly rose to their feet and began jabbing their sticks at the foe the blueskins hesitated until a few got pricked and began to yell with terror when the whole of the boolooroos attacking party turned around and ran back to the gate their ruler reaching it first of all the pinkies tried to chase them but their round fat legs were no match for the long thin legs of the blueskins who quickly gained the gate and shut themselves up in the city again  it is evident panted the boolooroo facing his defeated soldiers wrathfully that you are a pack of cowards  but we followed your own royal example in running replied the captain  i merely ran back to the city to get a drink of water for i was thirsty declared the boolooroo  so did we so did we cried the soldiers eagerly we were all thirsty  your high and mighty spry and flighty majesty remarked the captain respectfully it occurs to me that the weapons of the pinkies are superior to our own what we need in order to oppose them successfully is a number of sharp sticks which are longer than their own  true true exclaimed the boolooroo enthusiastically get to work at once and make yourselves long sharp sticks and then we will attack the enemy again  so the soldiers and citizens all set to work preparing long sharp sticks and while they were doing this rosalie the witch had a vision in which she saw exactly what was going on inside the city wall queen trot and capn bill and buttonbright saw the vision too for they were all in the tent together and the sight made them anxious  what can be done asked the girl the blueskins are bigger and stronger than the pinkies and if they have sharp sticks which are longer than ours they will surely defeat us  i have one magic charm said rosalie thoughtfully that will save our army but i am allowed to work only one magic charm every three daysnot oftenerand perhaps ill need the magic for other things  strikes me maam returned the sailor that what we need most on this expedition is to capture the blueskins if we dont well need plenty of magic to help us back to the pink country but if we do we can take care of ourselves without magic  very well replied rosalie i will take your advice capn and enchant the weapons of the pinkies she then went out and had all the pinkies come before her one by one and she enchanted their sharp sticks by muttering some cabalistic words and making queer passes with her hands over the weapons now she said to them you will be powerful enough to defeat the blueskins whatever they may do the pinkies were overjoyed at this promise and it made them very brave indeed since they now believed they would surely be victorious  when the boolooroos people were armed with long thin lances of bluewood all sharpened to fine points at one end they prepared to march once more against the invaders their sticks were twice as long as those of the pinkies and the boolooroo chuckled with glee to think what fun they would have in punching holes in the round fat bodies of his enemies  out from the gate they marched very boldly and pressed on to attack the pinkies who were drawn up in line of battle to receive them with capn bill at their head when the opposing forces came together however and the blueskins pushed their points against the pinkies the weapons which had been enchanted by rosalie began to whirl in swift circlesso swift that the eye could scarcely follow the motion the result was that the lances of the boolooroos people could not touch the pinkies but were thrust aside with violence and either broken in two or sent hurling through the air in all directions finding themselves so suddenly disarmed the amazed blueskins turned about and ran again while capn bill greatly excited by his victory shouted to his followers to pursue the enemy and hobbled after them as fast as he could make his wooden leg go swinging his sharp stick as he advanced  the blues were in such a frightened confused mass that they got in one anothers way and could not make very good progress on the retreat so the old sailor soon caught up with them and began jabbing at the crowd with his stick unfortunately the pinkies had not followed their commander being for the moment dazed by their success so that capn bill was all alone among the blueskins when he stepped his wooden leg into a hole in the ground and tumbled full length his sharp stick flying from his hand and pricking the boolooroo in the leg as it fell  at this the ruler of the blues stopped short in his flight to yell with terror but seeing that only the sailorman was pursuing them and that this solitary foe had tumbled flat upon the ground he issued a command and several of his people fell upon poor capn bill seized him in their long arms and carried him struggling into the city where he was fast bound  then a panic fell upon the pinkies at the loss of their leader and trot and buttonbright called out in vain for them to rescue capn bill by the time the army recovered their wits and prepared to obey it was too late and although trot ran with them in her eagerness to save her friend the gate was found to be fast barred and she knew it was impossible for them to force an entrance into the city  so she went sorrowfully back to the camp followed by the pinkies and asked rosalie what could be done  im sure i do not know replied the witch i cannot use another magic charm until three days have expired but if they do not harm capn bill during that time i believe i can then find a way to save him  three days is a long time remarked trot dismally  the boolooroo may decide to patch him at once added buttonbright with equal sadness for he too mourned the sailors loss  it cant be helped replied rosalie i am not a fairy my dears but merely a witch and so my magic powers are limited we can only hope that the boolooroo wont patch capn bill for three days  when night settled down upon the camp of the pinkies where many tents had now been pitched all the invaders were filled with gloom the band tried to enliven them by playing the dead march but it was not a success the pinkies were despondent in spite of the fact that they had repulsed the attack of the blues for as yet they had not succeeded in gaining the city or finding the magic umbrella and the blue dusk of this dread countrywhich was so different from their own land of sunsetsmade them all very nervous they saw the moon rise for the first time in their lives and its cold silvery radiance made them shudder and prevented them from going to sleep trot tried to interest them by telling them that on the earth the people had both the sun and the moon and loved them both but nevertheless it is certain that had not the terrible fog bank stood between them and the pink land most of the invading army would have promptly deserted and gone back home  trot couldnt sleep either she was so worried over capn bill she went back to the tent where rosalie and buttonbright were sitting in the moonlight and asked the witch if there was no way in which she could secretly get into the city of the blues and search for her friend rosalie thought it over for some time and then replied  we can make a rope ladder that will enable you to climb to the top of the wall and descend into the city but if anyone should see you you would be captured  ill risk that said the child excited at the prospect of gaining the side of capn bill in this adventurous way please make the rope ladder at once rosalie  so the witch took some ropes and knotted together a ladder long enough to reach the top of the wall when it was finished the threerosalie trot and buttonbrightstole out into the moonlight and crept unobserved into the shadow of the wall the blueskins were not keeping a very close watch as they were confident the pinkies could not get into the city  the hardest part of rosalies task was to toss up one end of the rope ladder until it would catch on some projection on top of the wall there were few such projections but after creeping along the wall for a distance they saw the end of a broken flagstaff near the top edge the witch tossed up the ladder trying to catch it upon this point and on the seventh attempt she succeeded  good cried trot now i can climb up  dont you want me to go with you asked buttonbright a little wistfully  no said the girl you must stay to lead the army and if you can think of a way you must try to rescue us perhaps ill be able to save capn bill by myself but if i dont its all up to you buttonbright  ill do my best he promised  and here keep my polly till i come back added trot giving him the bird i cant take it with me for it would be a bother an if it tried to spout potry id be discovered in a jiffy  as the beautiful witch kissed the little girl goodbye she slipped upon her finger a curious ring at once buttonbright exclaimed why where has she gone  im right here said trots voice by his side cant you see me  no replied the boy mystified  rosalie laughed its a magic ring ive loaned you my dear said she and as long as you wear it you will be invisible to all eyes those of blueskins and pinkies alike im going to let you wear this wonderful ring for it will save you from being discovered by your enemies if at any time you wish to be seen take the ring from your finger but as long as you wear it no one can see you not even earth people  oh thank you cried trot that will be fine  i see you have another ring on your hand said rosalie and i perceive it is enchanted in some way where did you get it  the queen of the mermaids gave it to me answered trot but sky island is so far away from the sea that the ring wont do me any good while im here its only to call the mermaids to me if i need them and they cant swim in the sky you see  rosalie smiled and kissed her again be brave my dear she said and i am sure you will be able to find capn bill without getting in danger yourself but be careful not to let any blueskin touch you for while you are in contact with any person you will become visible keep out of their way and you will be perfectly safe dont lose the ring for you must give it back to me when you return it is one of my witchcraft treasures and i need it in my business  the trot climbed the ladder although neither buttonbright nor rosalie could see her do so and when she was on top the broad wall she pulled up the knotted ropes and began to search for a place to let it down on the other side a little way off she found a bluestone seat near to the inner edge and attaching the ladder to this she easily descended it and found herself in the blue city a guard was pacing up and down near her but as he could not see the girl he of course paid no attention to her so after marking the place where the ladder hung that she might know how to reach it again trot hurried away through the streets of the city     trots invisible adventure  chapter 22   all the blueskins except a few soldiers had gone to bed and were sound asleep a blue gloom hung over the city which was scarcely relieved by a few bluish wavering lights here and there but trot knew the general direction in which the palace lay and she decided to go there first she believed the boolooroo would surely keep so important a prisoner as capn bill locked up in his own palace  once or twice the little girl lost her way for the streets were very puzzling to one not accustomed to them but finally she sighted the great palace and went up to the entrance there she found a double guard posted they were sitting on a bench outside the doorway and both stood up as she approached  we thought we heard footsteps said one  so did we replied the other yet there is no one in sight  trot then saw that the guards were the two patched men jimfred jonesjinks and fredjim jinksjones who had been talking together quite cheerfully it was the first time the girl had seen them together and she marveled at the queer patching that had been so strongly united here yet so thoroughly separated them  you see remarked jimfred as they seated themselves again upon the bench the boolooroo has ordered the patching to take place tomorrow morning after breakfast the old earth man is to be patched to poor tiggle instead of ghipghisizzle who has in some way managed to escape from the room of the great knifeno one knows how but tiggle and tiggle wont tell  were sorry for anyone who has to be patched replied fredjim in a reflective tone for although it didnt hurt us as much as we expected its a terrible mixup to be in until we become used to our strange combination you and we are about alike now jimfred although we were so different before  not so said jimfred we are really more intelligent than you are for the left side of our brain was always the keenest before we were patched  that may be admitted fredjim but we are much the strongest because our right arm was by far the best before we were patched  we are not sure of that responded jimfred for we have a right arm too and it is pretty strong  we will test it suggested the other by all pulling upon one end of this bench with our right arms whichever can pull the bench from the others must be the strongest  while they were tussling at the bench dragging it first here and then there in the trial of strength trot opened the door of the palace and walked in it was pretty dark in the hall and only a few dim blue lights showed at intervals down the long corridors as the girl walked through these passages she could hear snores of various degrees coming from behind some of the closed doors and knew that all the regular inmates of the place were sound asleep so she mounted to the upper floor and thinking she would be likely to find capn bill in the room of the great knife she went there and tried the door it was locked but the key had been left on the outside she waited until the sentry who was pacing the corridor had his back toward her and then she turned the key and slipped within softly closing the door behind her  it was pitch dark in the room and trot didnt know how to make a light after a moments thought she began feeling her way to the window stumbling over objects as she went every time she made a noise someone groaned and that made the child uneasy at last she found a window and managed to open the shutters and let the moonlight in it wasnt a very strong moonlight but it enabled her to examine the interior of the room in the center stood the great knife which the boolooroo used to split people in two when he patched them and at one side was a dark form huddled upon the floor and securely bound  trot hastened to this form and knelt beside it but was disappointed to find it was only tiggle the man stirred a little and rolled against trots knee when she at once became visible to him oh its the earth child said he are you condemned to be patched too little one  no answered trot tell me where capn bill is  i cant said tiggle the boolooroo has hidden him until tomorrow morning when hes to be patched to me ghipghisizzle was to have been my mate but ghip escaped being carried away by the six snubnosed princesses  why she asked  one of them means to marry him explained tiggle  oh thats worse than being patched cried trot  much worse said tiggle with a groan  but now an idea occurred to the girl would you like to escape she asked the captive if i get you out of the palace can you hide yourself so that you wont be found  certainly he declared i know a house where i can hide so snugly that all the boolooroos soldiers cannot find me  all right said trot ill do it for when youre gone the boolooroo will have no one to patch capn bill to  he may find someone else suggested the prisoner  but it will take him time to do that and time is all i want answered the child even while she spoke trot was busy with the knots in the cords and presently she had unbound tiggle who soon got upon his feet now ill go to one end of the passage and make a noise said she and when the guard runs to see what it is you must run the other way outside the palace jimfred and fredjim are on guard but if you tip over the bench they are seated on you can easily escape them  ill do that all right promised the delighted tiggle youve made a friend of me little girl and if ever i can help you ill do it with pleasure  then trot started for the door and tiggle could no longer see her because she was not now touching him the man was much surprised at her disappearance but listened carefully and when he heard the girl make a noise at one end of the corridor he opened the door and ran in the opposite direction as he had been told to do  of course the guard could not discover what made the noise and trot ran little risk as she was careful not to let him touch her when tiggle had escaped the little girl wandered through the palace in search of capn bill but soon decided such a quest in the dark was likely to fail and she must wait until morning she was tired too and thought she would find a vacant roomof which there were many in the big palaceand go to sleep until daylight she remembered there was a comfortable vacant room just opposite the suite of the six snubnosed princesses so she stole softly up to it and tried the door it was locked but the key was outside as the blueskins seldom took a door key from its place so she turned the key opened the door and walked in  now this was the chamber in which ghipghisizzle had been confined by the princesses his arms being bound tight to his body but his legs left free the boolooroo in his search had failed to discover what had become of ghip ghisizzle but the poor man had been worried every minute for fear his retreat would be discovered or that the terrible princesses would come for him and nag him until he went crazy there was one window in his room and the prisoner had managed to push open the sash with his knees looking out he found that a few feet below the window was the broad wall that ran all around the palace gardens a little way to the right the wall joined the wall of the city being on the same level with it  ghipghisizzle had been thinking deeply upon this discovery and he decided that if anyone entered his room he would get through the window leap down upon the wall and try in this way to escape it would be a dangerous leap for as his arms were bound he might topple off the wall into the garden but he resolved to take this chance therefore when trot rattled at the door of his room ghipghisizzle ran and seated himself upon the window sill dangling his long legs over the edge when she finally opened the door he slipped off and let himself fall to the wall where he doubled up in a heap the next minute however he had scrambled to his knees and was running swiftly along the garden wall  trot finding the window open came and looked out and she saw the majordomos tall form hastening along the top of the wall the guards saw him too outlined against the sky in the moonlight and they began yelling at him to stop but ghipghisizzle kept right on until he reached the city wall when he began to follow that more guards were yelling now running along the foot of the wall to keep the fugitive in sight and people began to pour out of the houses and join in the chase  poor ghip realized that if he kept on the wall he would merely circle the city and finally be caught if he leaped down into the city he would be seized at once just then he came opposite the camp of the pinkies and decided to trust himself to the mercies of his earth friends rather than be made a prisoner by his own people who would obey the commands of their detested but greatly feared boolooroo so suddenly he gave a mighty leap and came down into the field outside the city again he fell in a heap and rolled over and over for it was a high wall and the jump a dangerous one but finally he recovered and got upon his feet delighted to find he had broken none of his bones  some of the blueskins had by now opened a gate and out rushed a crowd to capture the fugitive but ghipghisizzle made straight for the camp of the pinkies and his pursuers did not dare follow him far in that direction they soon gave up the chase and returned to the city while the runaway majordomo was captured by captain coralie and marched away to the tent of rosalie the witch a prisoner of the pinkies     the girl and the boolooroo  chapter 23   trot watched from the window the escape of ghipghisizzle but did not know of course who it was then after the city had quieted down again she lay upon the bed without undressing and was sound asleep in a minute  the blue dawn was just breaking when she opened her eyes with a start of fear that she might have overslept but soon she found that no one else in the palace was yet astir even the guards had gone to sleep by this time and were adding their snores to the snores of the other inhabitants of the royal palace so the little girl got up and finding a ewer of water and a basin upon the dresser washed herself carefully and then looked in a big mirror to see how her hair was to her astonishment there was no reflection at all the mirror was blank so far as trot was concerned she laughed a little at that remembering she wore the ring of rosalie the witch which rendered her invisible then she slipped quietly out of the room and found it was already light enough in the corridors for her to see all objects distinctly  after hesitating a moment which way to turn she decided to visit the snubnosed princesses and passed through the big reception room to the sleeping room of indigo there this princess the crossest and most disagreeable of all the disagreeable six was curled up in bed and slumbering cozily the little blue dog came trotting out of indigos boudoir and crowed like a rooster for although he could not see trot his keen little nose scented her presence thinking it time the princess awoke trot leaned over and gave her snub nose a good tweak and at once indigo sprang out of her bed and rushed into the chamber of cobalt which adjoined her own thinking it was this sister who had slyly attacked her indigo rushed at the sleeping cobalt and slapped her face  at once there was war the other four princesses hearing the screams and cries of rage came running into cobalts room and as fast as they appeared trot threw pillows at them so that presently all six were indulging in a freeforall battle and snarling like tigers the blue lamb came trotting into the room and trot leaned over and patted the pretty little animal but as she did so she became visible for an instant each pat destroying the charm of the ring while the girl was in contact with a living creature these flashes permitted some of the princesses to see her and at once they rushed toward her with furious cries but the girl realized what had happened and leaving the lamb she stepped back into a corner and her frenzied enemies failed to find her it was a little dangerous though remaining in a room where six girls were feeling all around for her so she went away and left them to their vain search while she renewed her hunt for capn bill  the sailorman did not seem to be in any of the rooms she entered so she decided to visit the boolooroos own apartments in the room where rosalies vision had shown them the magic umbrella lying under a cabinet trot attempted to find it for she considered that next to rescuing capn bill this was the most important task to accomplish but the umbrella had been taken away and was no longer beneath the cabinet this was a severe disappointment to the child but she reflected that the umbrella was surely someplace in the blue city so there was no need to despair  finally she entered the kings own sleeping chamber and found the boolooroo in bed and asleep with a funny nightcap tied over his eggshaped head as trot looked at him she was surprised to see that he had one foot out of bed and that to his big toe was tied a cord that led out of the bedchamber into a small dressing room beyond trot slowly followed this cord and in the dressing room came upon capn bill who was lying asleep upon a lounge and snoring with great vigor his arms were tied to his body and his body was tied fast to the lounge the wooden leg stuck out into the room at an angle and the shoe on his one foot had been removed so that the end of the cord could be fastened to the sailors big toe  this arrangement had been a clever thought of the boolooroo fearing his important prisoner might escape before he was patched as ghipghisizzle had done the cruel king of the blues had kept capn bill in his private apartments and had tied his own big toe to the prisoners big toe so that if the sailor made any attempt to get away he would pull on the cord and that would arouse the boolooroo  trot saw through this cunning scheme at once so the first thing she did was to untie the cord from capn bills big toe and retie it to the leg of the lounge then she unfastened her friends hands and leaned over to give his leathery face a smacking kiss capn bill sat up and rubbed his eyes he looked around the room and rubbed his eyes again seeing no one who could have kissed him then he discovered that his bonds had been removed and he rubbed his eyes once more to make sure he was not dreaming the little girl laughed softly  trot exclaimed the sailor recognizing her voice  then trot came up and took his hand the touch at once rendering her visible to him dear me said the bewildered sailor however did you get here mate in the boolooroos own den is the blue city captured  not yet she replied but you are capn and ive come to save you  all alone trot  all alone capn bill but its got to be done jus the same and then she explained about the magic ring rosalie had lent her which rendered her invisible while she wore itunless she touched some living creature capn bill was much interested  im willing to be saved mate he said for the boolooroo is set on patchin me right after breakfas which i hope the cookll be late with  who are you to be patched to she asked  a feller named tiggle whos in disgrace cause he mixed the royal necktie for me  that was nectar not necktie corrected trot but you neednt be fraid of bein patched with tiggle cause ive set him loose by this time hes in hiding where he cant be found  thats good said capn bill nodding approval but the blamed ol boolooroos sure to find someone else whats to be done mate  trot thought about it for a moment then she remembered how some unknown man had escaped from the palace the night before by means of the wall which he had reached from the window of the very chamber in which she had slept capn bill might easily do the same and the rope ladder she had used would help the sailor down from the top of the wall could you climb down a rope ladder capn she asked  like enough said he ive done it many a time on shipboard  but you hadnt a wooden leg then she reminded him  the wooden leg wont bother much he assured her  so trot tied a small sofa cushion around the end of his wooden leg so it wouldnt make any noise pounding upon the floor and then she quietly led the sailor through the room of the sleeping boolooroo and through several other rooms until they came to the passage here a soldier was on guard but he had fallen asleep for a moment in order to rest himself they passed the blueskin without disturbing him and soon reached the chamber opposite the suite of the six snubnosed princesses whom they could hear still quarreling loudly among themselves  trot locked the door from the inside so no one could disturb them and then led the sailor to the window the garden was just below  but good gracious me its a drop o ten feet trot he exclaimed  and youve only one foot to drop capn she said laughing couldnt you let yourself down with one of the sheets from the bed  ill try he rejoined but can you do that circus act trot  oh im goin to stay here an find the magic umbrella she replied bein invisble capn im safe enough what i want to do is to see you safe back with the pinkies an then ill manage to hold my own all right never fear  so they brought a blue sheet and tied one end to a post of the blue bed and let the other end dangle out the blue window goodbye mate said capn bill preparing to descend dont get reckless  i wont capn dont worry  then he grasped the sheet with both hands and easily let himself down to the wall trot had told him where to find the rope ladder she had left and how to fasten it to the broken flagstaff so he could climb down into the field outside the city as soon as he was safe on the wall capn bill began to hobble along the broad top toward the connecting wall that surrounded the entire cityjust as ghipghisizzle had doneand trot anxiously watched him from the window  but the blue city was now beginning to waken to life one of the soldiers came from a house sleepily yawning and stretching himself and presently his eyes lit upon the huge form of capn bill hastening along the top of the wall the soldier gave a yell that aroused a score of his comrades and brought them tumbling into the street when they saw how the boolooroos precious prisoner was escaping they instantly became alert and wideawake and every one started in pursuit along the foot of the wall  of course the longlegged blueskins could run faster than poor capn bill some of them soon got ahead of the old sailorman and came to the rope ladder which trot had left dangling from the stone bench where it hung down inside the city the blue soldiers promptly mounted this ladder and so gained the wall heading off the fugitive when capn bill came up panting and all out of breath the blueskins seized him and held him fast  capn bill was terribly disappointed at being recaptured and so was trot who had eagerly followed his every movement from her window in the palace the little girl would have cried with vexation and i think she did weep a few tears before she recovered her courage but capn bill was a philosopher in his way and had learned to accept ill fortune cheerfully knowing he was helpless he made no protest when they again bound him and carried him down the ladder like a bale of goods  others were also disappointed by his capture buttonbright had heard the parrot squawking oh theres capn bill theres capn bill i see him still up on that hill its capn bill so the boy ran out of his tent to find the sailor scurrying along the top of the wall as fast as he could go at once buttonbright aroused coralie who got her pinkies together and quickly marched them toward the wall to assist in the escape of her commander in chief but they were too late before they could reach the wall the blueskins had captured trots old friend and lugged him down in to the city so coralie and buttonbright were forced to return to their camp discomfited there ghipghisizzle and rosalie were awaiting them and they all went into the witchs tent and held a council of war  tell me said ghipghisizzle did you not take the royal record book from the treasure chamber of the boolooroo  i did replied the boy i remember that you wanted it and so i have kept it with me ever since that night here it is and he presented the little blue book to the majordomo the only friend the adventurers had found among all the blueskins  ghipghisizzle took the book eagerly and at once began turning over its leaves ah he exclaimed presently it is just as i suspected the wicked boolooroo had already reigned over the blue country three hundred years last thursday so that now he has no right to rule at all i myself have been the rightful ruler of the blues since thursday and yet this cruel and deceitful man has not only deprived me of my right to succeed him but he has tried to have me patched so that i could never become the boolooroo  does the book tell how old he is asked buttonbright  yes he is not five hundred years old and has yet another hundred years to live he planned to rule the blue country until the last but i now know the deception he has practiced and have the royal record book to prove it with this i shall be able to force him to resign that i may take his place for all the people will support me and abide by the law the tyrant will perhaps fight me and my cause desperately but i am sure to win in the end  if we can help you said buttonbright the whole pink army will fight for you only if you win you must promise to give me back my magic umbrella and let us fly away to our own homes again  i will do that most willingly agreed ghipghisizzle and now let us consult together how best to take the blue city and capture the boolooroo as i know my own country much better than you or the pinkies do i think i can find a way to accomplish our purpose     the amazing conquest of the blues  chapter 24   the shouting and excitement in the city following upon the recapture of capn bill aroused the sleeping boolooroo he found the cord still tied to his big toe and at first imagined his prisoner safe in the dressing room while he put on his clothes the king occasionally gave the cord a sudden pull hoping to hurt capn bills big toe and make him yell but as no response came to this mean action the boolooroo finally looked into the room only to find he had been pulling on a leg of the couch and that his prisoner had escaped  then he flew into a mighty rage and running out into the hall he aimed a blow at the unfaithful guard knocking the fellow off his feet then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the sailorman was not recaptured  while the boolooroo stormed and raged a band of soldiers and citizens came marching in surrounding capn bill who was again firmly bound  soho roared the monarch you thought you could defy me earth clod did you but you were mistaken no one can resist the mighty boolooroo of the blues so it is folly for you to rebel against my commands hold him fast my men and as soon as ive had my coffee and oatmeal ill take him to the room of the great knife and patch him  i wouldnt mind a cup o coffee myself said capn bill ive had considble exercise this mornin and im all ready for breakfas  very well replied the boolooroo you shall eat with me for then i can keep an eye on you my guards are not to be trusted and i dont mean to let you out of my sight again until you are patched  so capn bill and the boolooroo had breakfast together six blueskins standing in a row back of the sailorman to grab him if he attempted to escape but capn bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless  trot was in the room too standing in a corner and listening to all that was said while she racked her little brain for an idea that would enable her to save capn bill from being patched no one could see her so no onenot even capn billknew she was there  after breakfast was over a procession was formed headed by the boolooroo and they marched the prisoner through the palace until they came to the room of the great knife invisible trot followed soberly after them still wondering what she could do to save her friend  as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment  whats become of tiggle he shouted wheres tiggle who has released tiggle go at once you dummies and find him or it will go hard with you  the frightened soldiers hurried away to find tiggle and trot was well pleased because she knew tiggle was by this time safely hidden  the boolooroo stamped up and down the room muttering threats and declaring capn bill should be punished whether tiggle was found or not and while they waited trot took time to make an inspection of the place which she now saw for the first time in broad daylight  the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant thronechairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the snubnosed princesses the poor queen by the way was seldom seen as she passed all her time playing solitaire with a deck that was one card short hoping that before she had lived her entire six hundred years she would win the game therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her  in the center of the room stood the terrible knife that gave the place its name a name dreaded by every inhabitant of the blue city the knife was built into a huge framework like a derrick that reached to the ceiling and it was so arranged that when the boolooroo pulled a cord the great blade would drop down in its frame and neatly cut in two the person who stood under it and in order that the slicing would be accurate there was another frame to which the prisoner was tied so that he couldnt wiggle either way this frame was on rollers so that it could be placed directly underneath the knife  while trot was observing this dreadful machine the door opened and in walked the six snubnosed princesses all in a row and with their chins up as if they disdained everyone but themselves they were magnificently dressed and their blue hair was carefully arranged in huge towers upon their heads with blue plumes stuck into the tops these plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the princesses took rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing they marched to their chairs and seated themselves to enjoy the cruel scene their father was about to enact and capn bill bowed to them politely and said  mornin girls hope ye feel as well as ye look  papa exclaimed turquoise angrily can you not prevent this vile earth being from addressing us it is an insult to be spoken to by one about to be patched  control yourselves my dears replied the boolooroo the worst punishment i know how to inflict on anyone this prisoner is about to suffer youll see a very pretty patching my royal daughters  when inquired cobalt  when as soon as the soldiers return with tiggle said he  but just then in came the soldiers to say that tiggle could not be found anywhere in the city he had disappeared as mysteriously as had ghipghisizzle immediately the boolooroo flew into another towering rage  villains he shouted go out and arrest the first living thing you meet and whoever it proves to be will be instantly patched to capn bill  the captain of the guards hesitated to obey this order suppose its a friend he suggested  friend roared the boolooroo i havent a friend in the country tell me sir do you know of anyone who is my friend  the captain shook his head i cant think of anyone just now your spry and flighty high and mighty majesty he answered  of course not said the boolooroo everyone hates me and i dont object to that because i hate everybody but im the ruler here and ill do as i please go and capture the first living creature you see and bring him here to be patched to capn bill  so the captain took a file of soldiers and went away very sorrowful for he did not know who would be the victim and if the boolooroo had no friends the captain had plenty and did not wish to see them patched  meanwhile trot being invisible to all was roaming around the room and behind a bench she found a small end of rope which she picked up then she seated herself in an outoftheway place and quietly waited  suddenly there was a noise in the corridor and evidence of scuffling and struggling then the door flew open and in came the soldiers dragging a great blue billygoat which was desperately striving to get free  villains howled the boolooroo what does this mean  why you said to fetch the first living creature we met and that was this billygoat replied the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goats horns  the boolooroo stared a moment and then he fell back to his throne laughing boisterously the idea of patching capn bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter some of the soldiers laughed too being tickled with the absurd notion and the six snubnosed princesses all sat up straight and permitted themselves to smile contemptuously this would indeed be a severe punishment therefore the princesses were pleased at the thought of capn bills becoming half a billygoat and the billygoats being half capn bill  they look something alike you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and theyre nearly the same size if you stand the goat on his hind legs theyve both got the same style of whiskers and theyre both of em obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch  splendid fine glorious cried the boolooroo wiping the tears of merriment from his eyes we will proceed with the ceremony of patching at once  capn bill regarded the billygoat with distinct disfavor and the billygoat glared evilly upon capn bill trot was horrified and wrung her little hands in sore perplexity for this was a most horrible fate that awaited her dear friend  first bind the earth man in the frame commanded the boolooroo well slice him in two before we do the same to the billygoat  so they seized capn bill and tied him into the frame so that he couldnt move a jot in any direction then they rolled the frame underneath the great knife and handed the boolooroo the cord that released the blade but while this was going on trot had crept up and fastened one end of her rope to the frame in which capn bill was confined then she stood back and watched the boolooroo and just as he pulled the cord she pulled on her rope and dragged the frame on its rollers away so that the great knife fell with a crash and sliced nothing but the air  huh exclaimed the boolooroo thats queer roll him up again soldiers  the soldiers again rolled the frame in position having first pulled the great knife once more to the top of the derrick the immense blade was so heavy that it took the strength of seven blueskins to raise it when all was in readiness the king pulled the cord a second time and trot at the same instant pulled upon her rope the same thing happened as before capn bill rolled away in his frame and the knife fell harmlessly  now indeed the boolooroo was as angry as he was amazed he jumped down from the platform and commanded the soldiers to raise the great knife into position when this was accomplished the boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled awayseemingly of its own accordand he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before  as he stood bent nearly double his back was toward the billygoat which in their interest and excitement the soldiers were holding in a careless manner before any could stop him he butted his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning  the goats warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack finding himself free he turned and assaulted the soldiers butting them so fiercely that they tumbled down in bunches and as soon as they could rise again ran frantically from the room and along the corridors as if a fiend was after them by this time the goat was so animated by the spirit of conquest that he rushed at the six snubnosed princesses who had all climbed upon their chairs and were screaming in a panic of fear six times the goat butted and each time he tipped over a chair and sent a haughty princess groveling upon the floor where the ladies got mixed up in their long blue trains and flounces and laces and struggled wildly until they recovered their footing then they sped in great haste for the door and the goat gave a final butt that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within sound of their voices  as the room of the great knife was now cleared of all but capn bill who was tied in his frame and of trot and the moaning boolooroo who lay hidden behind the benches the goat gave a victorious bleat and stood in the doorway to face any enemy that might appear trot had been as surprised as anyone at this sudden change of conditions but she was quick to take advantage of the opportunities it afforded first she ran with her rope to the goat and as the animal could not see her she easily succeeded in tying the rope around its horns and fastening the loose end to a pillar of the doorway next she hurried to capn bill and began to unbind him and as she touched the sailor she became visible he nodded cheerfully then and said i had a notion it was you mate as saved me from the knife but it were a pretty close call an i hope it wont happen again i couldnt shiver much bein bound so tight but when im loose i mean to have jus one good shiver to relieve my feelins  shiver all you want to capn she said as she removed the last bonds but first youve got to help me save us both  as how he asked stepping from the frame  come and get the boolooroo she said going toward the benches the sailor followed and pulled out the boolooroo who when he saw the terrible goat was captured and tied fast quickly recovered his courage hi there he cried where are my soldiers what do you mean prisoner by daring to lay hands upon me let me go this minute or illill have you patched twice  dont mind him capn said trot but fetch him along to the frame the boolooroo looked around to see where the voice came from and capn bill grinned joyfully and caught up the king in both his strong arms dragging the struggling monarch of the blues to the frame  stop it how dare you roared the frightened boolooroo ill have revenge illill  youll take it easy cause you cant help yourself said capn bill what next queen trot  hold him steady in the frame and ill tie him up she replied so capn bill held the boolooroo and the girl tied him fast in position as capn bill had been tied so that his majesty couldnt wiggle at all then they rolled the frame in position underneath the great knife and trot held in her hand the cord which would release it  all right capn she said in a satisfied tone i guess we can run this blue country ourselves after this the boolooroo was terrified to find himself in danger of being sliced by the same knife he had so often wickedly employed to slice others like capn bill he had no room to shiver but he groaned very dismally and was so full of fear that his blue hair nearly stood on end     the ruler of sky island  chapter 25   the girl now took off rosalies ring and put it carefully away in her pocket it wont matter who sees me now she remarked an i want em to know that you an me capn are running this kingdom im queen o the pinkies an booloorooess o the blues an  whats that asked the sailor youreyoure what trot  booloorooess isnt that right capn  i dunno mate it sounds bigger ner you are an i dont like the word anyhow spose you jus call yourself the boss that fills the bill an dont need pernouncin  all right she said queen o the pinkies an boss o the blues seems funny dont it capn bill  just then they heard a sound of footsteps in the corridor the soldiers had recovered their courage and fearful of the anger of their dreaded boolooroo whom the princesses declared would punish them severely had ventured to return to the room they came rather haltingly though and the captain of the guards first put his head cautiously through the doorway to see if the coast was clear the goat discovered him and tried to make a rush but the rope held the animal back and when the captain saw this he came forward more boldly  halt cried trot the captain halted his soldiers peering curiously over his shoulders and the six snubnosed princesses looking on from behind where they considered themselves safe if anyone dares enter this room without my permission said trot ill pull this cord and slice your master that once was the boolooroo  dont come in dont come in yelled the boolooroo in a terrified voice  then they saw that the sailor was free and the boolooroo bound in his place the soldiers were secretly glad to observe this but the princesses were highly indignant release his majesty at once cried indigo from the corridor you shall be severely punished for this rebellion  dont worry replied trot his majesty isnt his majesty any longer hes jus a common blueskin capn bill and i perpose runnin this island ourselves after this youve all got to obey me for im the booloorooessno i mean the bosso the blues and ive a notion to run things my own way  you cant said turquoise scornfully the law says  bother the law exclaimed trot ill make the laws myself from now on and ill unmake every law you ever had before i conquered you  oh have you conquered us then asked the captain of the guards in a surprised tone  of course said trot cant you see  it looks like it admitted the captain  capn bill is goin to be my general o the army an the royal manager o the blue country continued trot so youll mind what he says  nonsense shouted indigo march in and capture them captain never mind if they do slice the boolooroo im his daughter and ill rule the kingdom  you wont screamed cobalt ill rule it  ill rule it myself cried cerulia  no no yelled turquoise ill be the ruler  that shall be my privilege shouted sapphire cobalt began to say im the  be quiet said trot sternly would you have your own father sliced so that you could rule in his place  yes yes of course rejoined the six princesses without a seconds hesitation  well well what d ye think o that mr boolooroo asked capn bill  theyre undutiful daughters dont pay any attention to them replied the frightened boolooroo  were not goin to said trot now you blue capn who are you and your soldiers going to obey me or the snubnosed ones  you declared the captain of the guards positively for he hated the princesses as did all the blueskins  then escort those girls to their rooms lock em in an put a guard before the door  at once the soldiers seized the princesses and notwithstanding their snarls and struggles marched them to their rooms and locked them in while they were gone on this errand the boolooroo begged to be released whining and wailing for fear the knife would fall upon him but trot did not think it safe to unbind him just then when the soldiers returned she told their leader to put a strong guard before the palace and to admit no one unless either she or capn bill gave the order to do so the soldiers obeyed readily and when trot and capn bill were left alone they turned the goat loose in the room of the great knife and then locked the animal in with the boolooroo  the billygoat is the very best guard we could have for everbodys fraid o him remarked capn bill as he put the key of the room in his pocket so now queen trot whats next on the program  next said trot were goin to hunt for that umbrel capn i dont mean to stay in this dismal blue country long even if i am the queen lets find the umbrel and go home as soon as we can  that suits me the sailor joyfully exclaimed and then the two began a careful search through the palace they went into every room and looked behind the furniture and underneath the beds and in every crack and corner but no place could they spy the magic umbrella capn bill even ventured to enter the rooms of the six snubnosed princesses who were by this time so thoroughly alarmed that they had become meek and mild as could be but the umbrella wasnt there either  finally they returned to the great throne room of the palace where they seated themselves on the throne and tried to think what could possibly have become of the precious umbrella while they were sitting and talking together the captain of the guards entered and bowed respectfully beg pardon your smallsized majesty said he to trot but it is my duty to report that the pinkies are preparing to attack the city  oh id forgotten the pinkies exclaimed the girl tell me captain have you such a thing as a brass band in this city  we have two fine bands but they are not brass replied the captain their instruments are made of blue metal  well order em out commanded trot and say get all the soldiers together and tell all the people theres going to be a high time in the blue city tonight well have music and dancing and eating and  an neckties to drink trot dont forget the royal neckties urged capn bill  well have all the fun there is going continued the girl for we are to entertain the army of the pinkies  the pinkies exclaimed the captain of the guards why theyre our enemies your short highness  not any more replied trot im queen of the pinkies an im also queen of the blues so i wont have my people quarreling tell the blue people we are to throw open the gates and welcome the pinkies to the city where everybody will join in a grand celebration and jus as soon as youve spread the news an got the bands tuned up and the soldiers ready to march you let us know and well head the procession  your microscopic majesty shall be obeyed said the captain and went away to carry out these commands     trot celebrates the victory  chapter 26   the blue people were by this time dazed with wonder at all the events that had transpired that eventful day but they still had wit enough to be glad the war was over for in war someone is likely to get hurt and it is foolish to take such chances when one can remain quietly at home the blues did not especially admire the pinkies but it was easier to entertain them than to fight them and above all the blueskins were greatly rejoiced that their wicked boolooroo had been conquered and could no longer abuse them so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told trot and capn bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace  so they went down and found that a great crowd of people had gathered and these cheered trot with much enthusiasmwhich was very different from the scowls and surly looks with which they had formerly greeted their strange visitors from the earth  the soldiers wore their best blue uniforms and were formed before the palace in marching order so trot and capn bill headed the procession and then came the soldiersall keeping stepand then the bands playing very loud noises on their instruments and finally the crowd of blue citizens waving flags and banners and shouting joyfully in this order they proceeded to the main gate which trot ordered the guards to throw wide open then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them  at the head of the pinkies were ghipghisizzle and buttonbright who had the parrot on his shoulder and they were supported by captain coralie and captain tintint and rosalie the witch they had decided to capture the blue city at all hazards that they might rescue trot and capn bill and conquer the boolooroo so when from a distance they saw the blueskins march from the gate with banners flying and bands playing they supposed a most terrible fight was about to take place  however as the two forces came nearer together buttonbright spied trot and capn bill standing before the enemy and the sight astonished him considerably  welcome friends shouted capn bill in a loud voice and welcome cried trot and welcome roared the blue soldiers and the people of the blue city  hooray yelled the parrot    welcome to our happy home   from which no longer will we roam  and then he flapped his wings and barked like a dog with pure delight and added as fast as his birds tongue could speak    one armys pink and one is blue   but neither one is in a stew   because the naughty boolooroo   is out of sight so what well do   is try to be a jolly crew   and dance and sing our tooralloo   and to our friends be ever true   and to our foes  stop it said buttonbright i cant hear myself think  the pinkies were amazed at the strange reception of the blues and hesitated to advance but trot now ran up in front of them and made a little speech pinkies said she your queen has conquered the boolooroo and is now the queen of the blues all of sky island except the fog bank is now my kingdom so i welcome my faithful pinkies to my blue city where you are to be royally entertained and have a good time the war is over an everbody must be sociable an happy or ill know the reason why  now indeed the pinkies raised a great shout of joy and the blues responded with another joyful shout and rosalie kissed the little girl and said she had performed wonders and everybody shook hands with capn bill and congratulated him upon his escape and the parrot flew to trots shoulder and screeched    the pinkies are pink the blues are blue   but trots the queen so tooralloo  when the blueskins saw ghipghisizzle they raised another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people but ghipghisizzle did not heed the shouting he was looking downcast and sad and it was easy to see he was disappointed because he had not conquered the boolooroo himself but the people called upon him for a speech so he faced the blueskins and said i escaped from the city because the boolooroo tried to patch me as you all know and the six snubnosed princesses tried to marry me which would have been a far greater misfortune but i have recovered the book of royal records which has long been hidden in the treasure chamber and by reading it i find that the boolooroo is not your lawful boolooroo at all having reigned more than his three hundred years since last thursday i ghipghisizzle have been the lawful boolooroo of the blue country but now that you are conquered by queen trot i suppose i am conquered too and you have no boolooroo at all  hooray cried the parrot    heres a pretty howdydo   you havent any boolooroo  trot had listened carefully to the majordomos speech when he finished she said cheerfully dont worry sizzle dear itll all come right pretty soon now then lets enter the city an enjoy the grand feast thats being cooked im nearly starved myself for this conquerin kingdoms is hard work  so the pinkies and the blues marched side by side into the city and there was great rejoicing and music and dancing and feasting and games and merrymaking that lasted for three full days trot carried rosalie and captain coralie and ghipghisizzle to the palace and of course buttonbright and capn bill were with her they had the royal chef serve dinner at once and they ate in great state seated in the royal banquet hall where they were waited on by a hundred servants the parrot perched upon the back of queen trots chair and the girl fed it herself being glad to have the jolly bird with her again  after they had eaten all they could and the servants had been sent away trot related her adventures telling how with the assistance of the billygoat she had turned the tables on the wicked boolooroo then she gave rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind witch for all she had done for them and now said she i want to say to ghipsizzle that jus as soon as we can find buttonbrights umbrel were going to fly home again ill always be queen of sky island but the pink and blue countries must each have a ruler i think ill make sizzle the boolooroo of the blues but i want you to promise me ghip that youll destroy the great knife and its frame and clean up the room and turn it into a skating rink an never patch anyone as long as you rule the blueskins  ghipghisizzle was overjoyed at the prospect of being boolooroo of the blues but he looked solemn at the promise trot exacted im not cruel he said and i dont approve of patching in general so ill willingly destroy the great knife but before i do that i want the privilege of patching the snubnosed princesses to each othermixing the six as much as possibleand then i want to patch the former boolooroo to the billygoat which is the same punishment he was going to inflict upon capn bill  no said trot positively theres been enough patching in this country and i wont have any more of it the old boolooroo and the six stuckup princesses will be punished enough by being put out of the palace the people dont like em a bit so theyll be outcasts and wanderers and that will make em sorry they were so wicked an cruel when they were powerful am i right capn bill  you are mate replied the sailor  please queen trot begged ghipghisizzle let me patch just the boolooroo it will be such a satisfaction  i have said no an i mean it answered the girl you let the poor old boolooroo alone theres nothing that hurts so much as a comedown in life an i spect the old rascals goin to be pretty miserble bymby  what does he say to his reversal of fortune asked rosalie  why i dont blieve he knows about it said trot guess id better send for him an tell him whats happened  so the captain of the guards was given the key and told to fetch the boolooroo from the room of the great knife the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the boolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace when the courtiers and the people assembled saw the goat they gave a great cheer for the beast had helped to dethrone their wicked ruler  whats goin to happen to this tough ol warrior trot asked capn bill its my idee as hes braver than the whole blue army put together  youre right capn she returned ill have sizzle make a fine yard for the goat where hell have plenty of blue grass to eat an ill have a pretty fence put around it an make all the people honor an respec him jus as long as he lives  ill gladly do that promised the new boolooroo and ill feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat besides the grass hell be the happiest goat in sky island i assure you  as they led the nowfamous animal from the room the boolooroo shuddered and said how dare you people give orders in my palace im the boolooroo  scuse me said trot i neglected to tell you that youre not the boolooroo any more weve got the royal record book an it proves youve already ruled this country longer than you had any right to sides all that im the queen o sky islandwhich means queen o the pinkies an queen o the blues both of em so things are run as i say an ive made ghipghisizzle boolooroo in your place hell look after this end of the island hereafter an unless im much mistaken hell do it a heap better than you did  the former boolooroo groaned whats going to become of me then he asked am i to be patched or what  you wont be hurt answered the girl but youll have to find some other place to stay besides this palace an perhaps youll enjoy workin for a livin by way of variety  cant i take any of the treasure with me he pleaded  not even a bird cage said she everthing in the palace now belongs to ghipghisizzle  except the six snubnosed princesses exclaimed the new boolooroo earnestly wont you please get rid of them too your majesty cant they be discharged  of course said trot they must go with their dear father an mother isnt there some house in the city they can all live in ghip  why i own a little cabin at the end of the town said ghipghisizzle and ill let them use that as i wont need it any longer it isnt a very pretty cabin and the furniture is cheap and common but im sure it is good enough for this wicked man and his family  ill not be wicked any more sighed the old boolooroo ill reform its always best to reform when it is no longer safe to remain wicked as a private citizen i shall be a model of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise  trot now sent for the princesses who had been weeping and wailing and fighting among themselves ever since they learned that their father had been conquered when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princesses the least little bit  trot told the girls that they must go with their father to live in ghipghisizzles little old cabin and when they heard this dreadful decree the six snubnosed ones began to scream and have hysterics and between them they managed to make so much noise that no one could hear anything else so ghipghisizzle ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home  this was done the onceroyal family departing from the palace with shamed and downcast looks then the room of the great knife was cleared of its awful furniture the frames were split into small pieces of bluewood and the benches chopped into kindling and the immense sharp knife broken into bits all the rubbish was piled into the square before the palace and a bonfire made of it while the blue people clustered around and danced and sang with joy as the blue flames devoured the dreadful instrument that had once caused them so much unhappiness  that evening trot gave a grand ball in her palace to which the most important of the pinkies and the blueskins were invited the combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served the pinkies would not dance with the blues however nor would the blues dance with the pinkies the two nations were so different in all ways that they were unable to agree at all and several times during the evening quarrels arose and there was fighting between them which trot promptly checked  i think it would be best for us to go back to our own country as soon as possible suggested rosalie the witch for if we stay here very long the blueskins may rise against us and cause the pinkies much trouble  jus as soon as we find that umbrel promised trot well dive into the fog bank an make tracks for the land of sunrise an sunset     the fate of the magic umbrella  chapter 27   next morning the search for the magic umbrella began in earnest with many to hunt for it and the liberty of the whole palace to aid them every inch of the great building was carefully examined but no trace of the umbrella could be found capn bill and buttonbright went down to the cabin of the former boolooroo and tried to find out what he had done with the umbrella but the old boolooroo said  i had it brought from the treasure chamber and tried to make it work but there was no magic about the thing so i threw it away i havent any idea what became of it  the six former princesses were sitting upon a rude bench looking quite bedraggled and untidy said indigo  if you will make ghipghisizzle marry me ill find your old umbrella  where is it asked buttonbright eagerly  make ghipghisizzle marry me and ill tell you repeated indigo but i wont say another word about it until after i am married  so they went back to the palace and proposed to the new boolooroo to marry indigo so they could get their magic umbrella but ghipghisizzle positively refused  id like to help you said he but nothing will ever induce me to marry one of those snubnoses  theyre very prettyfor blueskins said trot  but when you marry a girl you marry the inside as well as the outside declared ghipghisizzle and inside these princesses there are wicked hearts and evil thoughts id rather be patched than marry the best of them  which is the best asked buttonbright  i dont know im sure was the reply judging from their actions in the past there is no best  rosalie the witch now went to the cabin and put indigo into a deep sleep by means of a powerful charm then while the princess slept the witch made her tell all she knew which wasnt a great deal to be sure but it was soon discovered that indigo had been deceiving them and knew nothing at all about the umbrella she had hoped to marry ghipghisizzle and become queen after which she could afford to laugh at their reproaches so the witch woke her up and went back to the palace to tell trot of her failure  the girl and buttonbright and capn bill were all rather discouraged by this time for they had searched high and low and had not found a trace of the allimportant umbrella that night none of them slept much for they all lay awake wondering how they could ever return to the earth and to their homes  in the morning of the third day after trots conquest of the blues the little girl conceived another idea she called all the servants of the palace to her and questioned them closely but not one could remember having seen anything that looked like an umbrella  are all the servants of the old boolooroo here inquired capn bill who was sorry to see trot looking so sad and downcast  all but one was the reply tiggle used to be a servant but he escaped and ran away  oh yes exclaimed trot tiggle is in hiding somewhere perhaps he doesnt know theres been a revolution and a new boolooroo rules the country if he did theres no need for him to hide any longer for he is now in no danger  she now dispatched messengers all through the city and the surrounding country who cried aloud for tiggle saying that the new boolooroo wanted him tiggle hiding in the cellar of a deserted house in a back street at last heard these cries and joyfully came forth to confront the messengers having heard of the old boolooroos downfall and disgrace the old man consented to go to the palace again and as soon as trot saw him she asked about the umbrella  tiggle thought hard for a minute and then said he remembered sweeping the kings rooms and finding a queer thingthat might have been an umbrellalying beneath a cabinet it had ropes and two wooden seats and a wicker basket all attached to the handle  thats it cried buttonbright excitedly and thats it thats it cried both trot and capn bill  but what did you do with it asked ghipghisizzle  i dragged it out and threw it on the rubbish heap in an alley back of the palace said tiggle at once they all rushed out to the alley and began digging in the rubbish heap by and by capn bill uncovered the lunch basket and pulling on this he soon drew up the two seats and finally the magic umbrella  hurrah shouted buttonbright grabbing the umbrella and hugging it tight in his arms  hooray shrieked the parrot    capn bills a lucky fellah   cause he found the old umbrella  trots face was wreathed in smiles this is jus the best luck that could have happened to us she exclaimed cause now we can go home whenever we please  lets go nowthis minutebefore we lose the umbrella again said buttonbright  but trot shook her head not yet she replied weve got to straighten out things in sky island first of all a queen has some duties you know and as long as im queen here ive got to live up to the part  what has to be did mate inquired capn bill  well weve fixed the blue country pretty well by makin sizzle the boolooroo of it but the pinkies mus be looked after too cause theyve stood by us an helped us to win we must take em home again safe an sound and get a new queen to rule over em when thats done we can go home any time we want to  quite right trot said the sailor approvingly when do we march  right away she replied ive had enough of the blue country havent you  we have mate  weve had plenty of it observed buttonbright  and the pinkies are anxious to get home added rosalie who was present  so capn bill unhooked the seats from the handle of the umbrella and wound the ropes around the two boards and made a package of them which he carried under his arm trot took the empty lunch basket and buttonbright held fast to the precious umbrella then they returned to the palace to bid goodbye to ghipghisizzle and the blues  the new boolooroo seemed rather sorry to lose his friends but the people were secretly glad to get rid of the strangers especially of the pinkies they maintained a sullen silence while coralie and captain tintint formed their ranks in marching order and they did not even cheer when trot said to them in a final speech  im the queen of sky island you know and the new boolooroo has to carry out my orders and treat you all nicely while im away i dont know when ill come back but youd better watch out an not make any trouble or ill find a way to make you sorry for it so now goodbye  and good riddance screamed the six snubnosed girls who had once been princesses and who were now in the crowd that watched the departure  but trot paid no attention to them she made a signal to the pinkie band which struck up a fine pink march and then the army stepped out with the left foot first and away went the conquerors down the streets of the blue city out of the bluebarred gateway and across the country toward the fog bank     the elephants head comes to life  chapter 28   when they reached the edge of the fog bank the pinkies all halted to put on their raincoats and buttonbright put up his umbrella and held it over himself and trot then when everybody was ready they entered the fog and rosalie the witch made a signal to call the frog king and his subjects to aid them as they had done before  pretty soon the great frogs appeared a long line of them facing trot and her pink army and sitting upon their haunches close together  turn around so we can get upon your backs said rosalie  not yet answered the frog king in a gruff deep voice you must first take that insulting umbrella out of my dominions  why what is there about my umbrella that seems insulting asked buttonbright in surprise  it is an intimation that you dont like our glorious climate and object to our delightful fog and are trying to ward off its soulful clinging kisses replied the frog king in an agitated voice there has never been an umbrella in my kingdom before and ill not allow one in it now take it away at once  but we cant explained trot weve got to take the umbrella with us to the pink country well put it down if you like an cross the bank in this drizzlewhich may be clingin an soulful but is too wet to be comfortble but the umbrellas got to go with us  it cant go another inch cried the obstinate frog with an angry croak nor shall any of your people advance another step while that insulting umbrella is with you  trot turned to rosalie what shall we do she asked  i really do not know replied the witch greatly perplexed  cant you make the frogs let us through inquired the boy  no i have no power over the frogs rosalie answered they carried us before as a favor but if the king now insists that we cannot pass with the umbrella we must go back to the blue country or leave your umbrella behind us  we wont do that said buttonbright indignantly cant we fight the frogs  fight cried trot why see how big they are they could eat up our whole army if they wanted to  but just then while they stood dismayed at this unfortunate position a queer thing happened the umbrella in buttonbrights hand began to tremble and shake he looked down at the handle and saw that the red eyes of the carved elephants head were rolling fiercely and sending out red sparks of anger in all directions the trunk swayed from side to side and the entire head began to swell and grow larger  in his fright the boy sprang backward a step and dropped the umbrella to the ground and as he did so it took the form of a complete elephant growing rapidly to a monstrous size then flapping its ears and wagging its tailwhich was merely the covered frame of the umbrellathe huge elephant lifted its trunk and charged the line of astonished frogs  in a twinkling the frogs all turned and made the longest leaps their powerful legs enabled them to the king jumped first of all and in a panic of fear the others followed his example they were out of sight in an instant and then the elephant turned its head and looked at buttonbright and at once trotted into the depths of the fog  he wants us to follow said the boy gasping in amazement at this wonderful transformation so immediately they began marching through the fog behind the elephant and as the great beast advanced the frogs scrambled out of his way and hid themselves in the moist banks until he had passed them by  capn bill had to mind his wooden leg carefully and the old sailor was so excited that he mumbled queer sentences about araby ann knights and dingdonged magic and the fool foolishness of fussin with witches an sich until trot wondered whether her old friend had gone crazy or was only badly scared  it was a long journey and all the pinkies were dripping water from their raincoats and their fat little legs were tired and aching when the pink glow showing through the fog at last announced that they were nearing the pink country  at the very edge of the fog bank the elephant halted winked at buttonbright lowered its head and began to shrink in size and dwindle away by the time the boy came up to it closely followed by trot and capn bill the thing was only the wellknown magic umbrella with the carved elephants head for a handle and it lay motionless upon the ground buttonbright picked it up and as he examined it he thought the tiny eyes still twinkled a little as if with triumph and pride  trot drew a long breath  that was some magic i guess she exclaimed dont you think so rosalie  it was the most wonderful thing i ever saw admitted the witch the fairies who control buttonbrights umbrella must be very powerful indeed     trot regulates the pinkies  chapter 29   the pinkies were rejoiced to find themselves again in their beloved land of sunrises and sunsets they sang and shouted with glee and the band uncovered its pink instruments and played the national pink anthem while the parrot flew from trots shoulder to capn bills shoulder and back again screaming ecstatically    hooray were through the wetful fogs   where the elephant scared the fretful frogs  there was a magnificent sunset in the sky just then and it cheered the pinkies and gave them renewed strength away they hastened across the pink fields to the pink city where all the pink people who had been left behind ran out to welcome them home again  trot and buttonbright with capn bill and rosalie the witch went to the humble palace where they had a simple supper of coarse food and slept upon hard beds in the houses of the city however there was much feasting and merrymaking and it seemed to trot that the laws of the country which forbade the queen from enjoying all the good things the people did were decidedly wrong and needed changing  the next morning rosalie said to the little girl will you make tourmaline the queen again when you go away  ill send for her and see about it replied trot  but when tourmaline arrived at the palace dressed all in lovely fluffy robes and with a dainty pink plume in her pink hair she begged most earnestly not to be made the queen again  im having a good time just now after years of worry and uncomfortable living in this uncomfortable old hut of a palace said the poor girl so it would be cruel for you to make me the servant of the people again and condemn me to want and misery  that seems reasonble replied trot thoughtfully  rosalies skin is just as light a pink as my own continued tourmaline why dont you make her the queen  i hadnt thought of that said trot then she turned to rosalie and asked how would you like to rule the pinkies  i wouldnt like it replied the witch with a smile the queen is the poorest and most miserable creature in all the kingdom and im sure i dont deserve such a fate ive always tried to be a good witch and to do my duty  trot thought this over quite seriously for a time then one of her quaint ideas came to herso quaint that it was entirely sensible im the queen of the pinkies just now am i not she asked  of course answered rosalie none can dispute that  then ive the right to make new laws havent i  i believe so  in that case said the girl im goin to make a law that the queen shall have the same food an the same dresses an the same good times that her people have and she shall live in a house jus as good as the houses of any of her people an have as much money to spend as anybody but no more the queen can have her share of everthing cordin to the new law but if she tries to get more than her share ill have the law say she shall be taken to the edge an pushed off what do you think of that law rosalie  its a good law and a just one replied the witch approvingly  so trot sent for the royal scribbler who was a very fat pinky with large pink eyes and curly pink hair and had him carefully write the new law into the great book of laws the royal scribbler wrote it very nicely in pink ink with a big capital letter at the beginning and a fine flourish at the end after trot had signed her name to it as queen she called all of the important people of the land to assemble in the court of the statues and ordered the royal declaimer to read to them the new law the pinkies seemed to think it was a just law and much better than the old one and rosalie said  now no one can object to becoming queen since the ruler of the pinkies will no longer be obliged to endure suffering and hardships  all right said trot in that case ill make you the queen rosalie for youve got more sense than tourmaline has and your powers as a witch will help you protect the people  at once she made the announcement telling the assembled pinkies that by virtue of her high office as queen of sky island she would leave rosalie the witch to rule over the pink country while she returned to the earth with her friends as rosalie was greatly loved and respected the people joyfully accepted her as their queen and trot ordered them to tear down the old hut and build a new palace for rosalieone which would be just as good as any other house in the city but no better she further ordered a pink statue of tourmaline to be set up in the court and also a pink statue of herself so that the record of all the rulers of the pinkies should be complete  the people agreed to do all this as soon as possible and some of the leaders whispered together and then asked coralie to be their spokesman in replying to queen trots speech  coralie stood on a chair and made a bow after which she thanked trot in the name of the pinkies for leading them safely into the blue country and out again and for giving them so good a queen as rosalie the pinkies would be sorry to have their new friends the earth people leave them but asked the queen of sky island to carry with her the royal band of pink gold which she now wore upon her brow together with the glistening pink jewel set in its center it would remind her coralie declared of the beautiful land of sunset and sunrise and of the fact that the pinkies would always be glad to welcome her back  trot knew she would never return to sky island but she did not tell them that she merely thanked coralie and the pinkies and said they might all come to the court after dinner and see her and her comrades fly away through the sky     the journey home  chapter 30   after the pinkies had been dismissed their new queen rosalie by means of a clever charm conjured up a dinner table set with very nice things to eat they all enjoyed a hearty meal and afterward sat and talked over their adventures  will you take the parrot home with you trot asked capn bill  guess not capn she answered mother wouldnt like to have him hangin round an screechin bad potry evry minute ill give him to rosalie for im sure shell take good care of him  rosalie accepted the gift with pleasure but the parrot looked sober for a while and then said    this looks to me like a giveaway   but here i am and here ill stay   the countrys pink but well all be blue   when trot goes home as she says shell do  they now packed the lunchbasket with the remains of the feast for they knew a long journey was before them and feared they might be hungry before they landed again capn bill straightened out the ropes and adjusted the seats while buttonbright examined the umbrella to see if it had been injured in any way when the elephant tramped through the fog bank  the boy looked into the small red eyes of the carved elephantshead handle with some misgivings but as seen in the strong sunshine the eyes were merely red stones while the handle plainly showed the marks of the tool that had carved it  when all was ready they went into the court of the statues where all the pinkies were assembledtogether with their pink bandand capn bill hooked the swinging seats onto the handle of the magic umbrella  trot kissed rosalie and coralie and tourmaline goodbye and said to them  if you ever happen to come to earth you must be sure to visit me and ill try to give you a good time but praps youll stay here all your lives  i think we shall replied rosalie laughing for in all sky island there will be no magic umbrella for us to fly with  and when you see polychrome added trot jus give her my love  then she and buttonbright seated themselves in the double seat which was flat upon the pink ground and capn bill sat before them on his own seat to which the lunch basket had been fastened by means of a stout cord  hold fast said the sailor man and they all held fast to the ropes while the boy glancing up toward the open umbrella he held said solemnly and distinctly  take us to trots house on the earth the umbrella obeyed at once mounting into the air it moved slowly at first but gradually increased its speed first it lifted the seat of the boy and the girl then capn bills seat and finally the lunch basket    fly highmind your eye   dont crybyebye  shouted the parrot from the pink witchs shoulder  trot leaned over and waved her hand the pink band played as loud as it couldin order that the travelers might hear it as long as possibleand rosalie and coralie and tourmaline threw kisses to their vanishing friends as long as they remained in sight                                  seems good to be on the way home again remarked trot as the umbrella bumped into a big black cloud  it reely does mate answered the sailorman joyously  fast through the cloud the umbrella swept and then suddenly it sailed into a clear blue sky across which a great and gorgeous rainbow spread its radiant arch upon the bow danced the dainty daughters of the rainbow and the umbrella passed near enough to it for the passengers to observe polychrome merrily leading her sisters her fleecy robes waving prettily in the gentle breeze  goodbye polly cried buttonbright and trot and capn bill both called out goodbye  polychrome heard and nodded to them smilingly never halting in her graceful dance then the umbrella dropped far below the arch which presently faded from view  it was an exciting ride scenes presented themselves entirely different from those they had seen on their former voyage for the sky changes continually and the clouds of a moment ago are not the clouds of an hour ago once they passed between two small stars as brilliant as diamonds and once an enormous bird whose wings spread so wide that they shadowed the sun soared directly over them and lost itself in the vague distance of the limitless sky  they rode quite comfortably however and were full of eager interest in what they saw the rush of air past them made them hungry so capn bill drew up the lunchbasket and held it so that buttonbright and trot could help themselves to the pink food which tasted very good and finally a dark rim appeared below them which the sailor declared must be the earth he proved to be correct and when they came nearer they found themselves flying over the waves of the ocean pretty soon a small island appeared and trot exclaimed  thats the sky island we thought we were goin toonly we didnt  yes an theres the mainland mate cried capn bill excitedly pointing toward a distant coast  on swept the magic umbrella then its speed gradually slackened the houses and trees on the coast could be seen and presentlyalmost before they realized itthey were set down gently upon the high bluff near the giant acacia a little way off stood the white cottage where trot lived  it was growing dusk as capn bill unhooked the seats and buttonbright folded up the umbrella and tucked it under his arm trot seized the lunchbasket and ran to the house where she found her mother busy in the kitchen  well im back again said the little girl is supper ready mama  buttonbright stayed all night with them but next morning bright and early he hooked one of the seats to his magic umbrella said goodbye to trot and capn bill and flew into the air to begin his journey to philadelphia just before he started trot said  let me know if you get home safe buttonbright an come an see me again as quick as you can  ill try to come again said the boy weve had a good time havent we trot  the bes time i ever had she replied enthusiastically then she asked didnt you like it too capn bill  parts o it mate the sailor answered as he thoughtfully made marks in the sand with the end of his wooden leg but seems to me the bes part of all was gettn home again  after several days trot received a postal card from buttonbright it was awkwardly scrawled for the boy was not much of a writer but trot managed to make out the words it read as follows   got home safe trot and the folks were so worried they forgot to scold me father has taken the magic umbrella and locked it up in the big strong chest in the attic he put the key in his own pocket so i dont know as ill ever be able to see you again but ill never forget the queen of sky island and i send my love to you and capn bill  your friend  buttonbright     the end
