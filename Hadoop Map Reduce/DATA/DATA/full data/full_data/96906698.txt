96906698	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     a tigers skin   the travelling signpainter who was repainting the sign of the cauliflower was enjoying a wellearned respite from his labours  on the old table under the shade of the elms mammoth sandwiches and a large slice of cheese waited in an untied handkerchief until such time as his thirst should be satisfied  at the other side of the table the oldest man in claybury drawing gently at a long clay pipe turned a dim and regretful eye up at the old signboard  ive drunk my beer under it for pretty near seventy years he said with a sigh  its a pity it couldnt ha lasted my time  the painter slowly pushing a wedge of sandwich into his mouth regarded him indulgently  its all through two young gentlemen as was passing through ere a month or two ago continued the old man they told smith the landlord theyd been looking all over the place for the cauliflower and when smith showed em the sign they said they thought it was the george the fourth and a very good likeness too  the painter laughed and took another look at the old sign then with the nervousness of the true artist he took a look at his own  one or two shadows  he flung his legs over the bench and took up his brushes  in ten minutes the most fervent loyalist would have looked in vain for any resemblance and with a sigh at the pitfalls which beset the artist he returned to his interrupted meal and hailed the house for more beer  theres nobody could mistake your sign for anything but a cauliflower said the old man it looks good enough to eat  the painter smiled and pushed his mug across the table  he was a tender hearted man and oncewhen painting the sign of the sir wilfrid lawsonknew himself what it was to lack beer  he began to discourse on art and spoke somewhat disparagingly of the cauliflower as a subject with a shake of his head he spoke of the possibilities of a spotted cow or a blue lion  talking of lions said the ancient musingly i spose as you never eard tell of the claybury tiger  it was afore your time in these parts i expect  the painter admitted his ignorance and finding that the allusion had no reference to an inn pulled out his pipe and prepared to listen  its a while ago now said the old man slowly and the circus the tiger belonged to was going through claybury to get to wickham when just as they was passing gills farm a steamingine they ad to draw some o the vans broke down and they ad to stop while the blacksmith mended it  that being so they put up a big tent and ad the circus ere  i was one o them as went and i must say it was worth the money though henry walker was disappointed at the man who put is ead in the lions mouth  he said that the man frightened the lion first before e did it  it was a great night for claybury and for about a week nothing else was talked of  all the children was playing at being lions and tigers and suchlike and young roberts pretty near broke is back trying to see if he could ride horseback standing up  it was about two weeks after the circus ad gone when a strange thing appened the big tiger broke loose  bill chambers brought the news first aving read it in the newspaper while e was aving his tea  he brought out the paper and showed us and soon after we eard all sorts o tales of its doings  at first we thought the tiger was a long way off and we was rather amused at it  frederick scott laughed imself silly amost up ere one night thinking ow surprised a man would be if e come ome one night and found the tiger sitting in his armchair eating the baby  it didnt seem much of a laughing matter to me and i said so none of us liked it and even sam jones as ad got twins for the second time said shame but frederick scott was a man as would laugh at anything  when we eard that the tiger ad been seen within three miles of claybury things began to look serious and peter gubbins said that something ought to be done but before we could think of anything to do something appened  we was sitting up ere one evening aving a mug o beer and a pipesame as i might be now if id got any baccy leftand talking about it when we eard a shout and saw a raggedlooking tramp running toward us as ard as he could run  every now and then hed look over is shoulder and give a shout and then run arder than afore  its the tiger ses bill chambers and afore you could wink amost he was inside the house aving first upset smith and a pot o beer in the doorway  before he could get up smith ad to wait till we was all in  his langwidge was awful for a man as ad a license to lose and everybody shouting tiger as they trod on im didnt ease is mind  he was inside amost as soon as the last man though and in a flash he ad the door bolted just as the tramp flung imself agin it all out of breath and sobbing is hardest to be let in  open the door he ses banging on it  go away ses smith  its the tiger screams the tramp open the door  you go away ses smith youre attracting it to my place run up the road and draw it off  just at that moment john biggs the blacksmith come in from the taproom and as soon as he eard wot was the matter e took down smiths gun from behind the bar and said he was going out to look after the wimmen and children  open the door he ses  he was trying to get out and the tramp outside was trying to get in but smith held on to that door like a briton  then john biggs lost is temper and he ups with the gunsmiths own gun mind youand fetches im a bang over the ead with it  smith fell down at once and afore we could elp ourselves the door was open the tramp was inside and john biggs was running up the road shouting is hardest  we ad the door closed afore you could wink amost and then while the tramp lay in a corner aving brandy mrs smith got a bowl of water and a sponge and knelt down bathing er husbands ead with it  did you see the tiger ses bill chambers  see it ses the tramp with a shiver  oh lord  he made signs for more brandy and henery walker wot was acting as landlord without being asked gave it to im  it chased me for over a mile ses the tramp my earts breaking  he gave a groan and fainted right off  a terrible faint it was too and for some time we thought ed never come round agin  first they poured brandy down is throat then gin and then beer and still e didnt come round but lay quiet with is eyes closed and a horrible smile on is face  he come round at last and with nothing stronger than water which mrs smith kept pouring into is mouth  first thing we noticed was that the smile went then is eyes opened and suddenly e sat up with a shiver and gave such a dreadful scream that we thought at first the tiger was on top of us  then e told us ow he was sitting washing is shirt in a ditch when he eard a snuffling noise and saw the ead of a big tiger sticking through the hedge the other side  he left is shirt and ran and e said that fortunately the tiger stopped to tear the shirt to pieces else is last hour would ave arrived  when e ad finished smith went upstairs and looked out of the bedroom winders but e couldnt see any signs of the tiger and e said no doubt it ad gone down to the village to see wot it could pick up or praps it ad eaten john biggs  however that might be nobody cared to go outside to see and after it got dark we liked going ome less than ever  up to ten oclock we did very well and then smith began to talk about is license  he said it was all rubbish being afraid to go ome and that at any rate the tiger couldnt eat more than one of us and while e was doing that there was the chance for the others to get ome safe two or three of em took a dislike to smith that night and told im so  the end of it was we all slept in the taproom that night  it seemed strange at first but anything was better than going ome in the dark and we all slept till about four next morning when we woke up and found the tramp ad gone and left the front door standing wide open  we took a careful lookout and byandby first one started off and then another to see whether their wives and children ad been eaten or not not a soul ad been touched but the wimmen and children was that scared there was no doing anything with em  none o the children would go to school and they sat at ome all day with the front winder blocked up with a mattress to keep the tiger out  nobody liked going to work but it ad to be done and as farmer gill said that tigers went to sleep all day and only came out toward evening we was a bit comforted  not a soul went up to the cauliflower that evening for fear of coming ome in the dark but as nothing appened that night we began to ope as the tiger ad travelled further on  bob pretty laughed at the whole thing and said e didnt believe there was a tiger but nobody minded wot e said bob pretty being as ive often told people the black sheep o claybury wot with poaching and wot was worse is artfulness  but the very next morning something appened that made bob pretty look silly and wish e adnt talked quite so fast for at five oclock frederick scott going down to feed is hins found as the tiger ad been there afore im and ad eaten no less than seven of em  the side of the hinouse was all broke in there was a few feathers lying on the ground and two little chicks smashed and dead beside em  the way frederick scott went on about it youd ardly believe  he said that govinment ud ave to make it up to im and instead o going to work e put the two little chicks and the feathers into a pudding basin and walked to cudford four miles off where they ad a policeman  he saw the policeman william white by name standing at the back door of the fox and hounds public house throwing a andful o corn to the landlords fowls and the first thing mr white ses was its off my beat he ses  but you might do it in your spare time mr white ses frederick scott  its very likely that the tigerll come back to my hin ouse for the rest of em and hed be very surprised if e popped is ead in and see you there waiting for im  hed ave reason to be ses policeman white staring at im  think of the praise youd get said frederick scott coaxing like  look ere ses policeman white if you dont take yourself and that pudding basin off pretty quick youll come along o me dye see youve been drinking and youre in a excited state  he gave frederick scott a push and follered im along the road and every time frederick stopped to ask im wot e was doing of e gave im another push to show im  frederick scott told us all about it that evening and some of the bravest of us went up to the cauliflower to talk over wot was to be done though we took care to get ome while it was quite light  that night peter gubbinss two pigs went  they were two o the likeliest pigs i ever seed and all peter gubbins could do was to sit up in bed shivering and listening to their squeals as the tiger dragged em off pretty near all claybury was round that sty next morning looking at the broken fence  some of them looked for the tigers footmarks but it was dry weather and they couldnt see any  nobody knew whose turn it would be next and the most sensible man there sam jones went straight off ome and killed his pig afore e went to work  nobody knew what to do farmer hall said as it was a soldiers job and e drove over to wickham to tell the police so but nothing came of it and that night at ten minutes to twelve bill chamberss pig went  it was one o the biggest pigs ever raised in claybury but the tiger got it off as easy as possible  bill ad the bravery to look out of the winder when e eard the pig squeal but there was such a awful snarling noise that e daresnt move and or foot  dicky weeds idea was for people with pigs and suchlike to keep em in the house of a night but peter gubbins and bill chambers both pointed out that the tiger could break a back door with one blow of is paw and that if e got inside he might take something else instead o pig  and they said that it was no worse for other people to lose pigs than wot it was for them  the odd thing about it was that all this time nobody ad ever seen the tiger except the tramp and people sent their children back to school agin and felt safe going about in the daytime till little charlie gubbins came running ome crying and saying that ed seen it  next morning a lot more children see it and was afraid to go to school and people began to wonder wot ud happen when all the pigs and poultry was eaten  then henery walker see it  we was sitting inside ere with scythes and pitchforks and suchlike things handy when we see im come in without is hat  his eyes were staring and is hair was all rumpled  he called for a pot o ale and drank it nearly off and then e sat gasping and olding the mug between is legs and shaking is ead at the floor till everybody ad left off talking to look at im  wots the matter henery ses one of em  dont ask me ses henery walker with a shiver  you dont mean to say as ow youve seen the tiger  ses bill chambers  henery walker didnt answer im  he got up and walked backards and forards still with that frightened look in is eyes and once or twice e give such a terrible start that e frightened us arf out of our wits then bill chambers took and forced im into a chair and give im two o gin and patted im on the back and at last henery walker got is senses back agin and told us ow the tiger ad chased im all round and round the trees in plashetts wood until e managed to climb up a tree and escape it  he said the tiger ad kept im there for over an hour and then suddenly turned round and bolted off up the road to wickham  it was a merciful escape and everybody said so except sam jones and e asked so many questions that at last henery walker asked im outright if e disbelieved is word  its all right sam ses bob pretty as ad come in just after henery walker  i see im with the tiger after im  wot ses henery staring at him  i see it all henery ses bob pretty and i see your pluck  it was all you could do to make up your mind to run from it  i believe if youd ad a fork in your and youd ave made a fight for it  everybody said bravo but henery walker didnt seem to like it at all  he sat still looking at bob pretty and at last e ses where was you e ses  up another tree henery where you couldnt see me ses bob pretty smiling at im  henery walker wot was drinking some beer choked a bit and then e put the mug down and went straight off ome without saying a word to anybody i knew e didnt like bob pretty but i couldnt see why e should be cross about is speaking up for im as e had done but bob said as it was is modesty and e thought more of im for it  after that things got worse than ever the wimmen and children stayed indoors and kept the doors shut and the men never knew when they went out to work whether theyd come ome agin  they used to kiss their children afore they went out of a morning and their wives too some of em even men whod been married for years did  and several more of em see the tiger while they was at work and came running ome to tell about it  the tiger ad been making free with claybury pigs and suchlike for pretty near a week and nothing ad been done to try and catch it and wot made claybury men madder than anything else was folks at wickham saying it was all a mistake and the tiger adnt escaped at all  even parson whod been away for a holiday said so and henery walker told is wife that if she ever set foot inside the church agin ed ask is old mother to come and live with em  it was all very well for parson to talk but the very night he come back henery walkers pig went and at the same time george kettle lost five or six ducks  he was a quiet man was george but when is temper was up e didnt care for anything  afore he came to claybury e ad been in the militia and that evening at the cauliflower e turned up with a gun over is shoulder and made a speech and asked who was game to go with im and hunt the tiger  bill chambers who was still grieving after is pig said e would then another man offered until at last there was seventeen of em  some of em ad scythes and some pitchforks and one or two of em guns and it was one o the finest sights i ever seed when george kettle stood em in rows of four and marched em off  they went straight up the road then across farmer gills fields to get to plashetts wood where they thought the tiger ud most likely be and the nearer they got to the wood the slower they walked  the sun ad just gone down and the wood looked very quiet and dark but john biggs the blacksmith and george kettle walked in first and the others follered keeping so close together that sam jones ad a few words over his shoulder with bill chambers about the way e was carrying is pitchfork  every now and then somebody ud say wots that and theyd all stop and crowd together and think the time ad come but it adnt and then theyd go on agin trembling until theyd walked all round the wood without seeing anything but one or two rabbits  john biggs and george kettle wanted for to stay there till it was dark but the others wouldnt ear of it for fear of frightening their wives and just as it was getting dark they all come tramp tramp back to the cauliflower agin  smith stood em arf a pint apiece and they was all outside ere fancying theirselves a bit for wot theyd done when we see old man parsley coming along on two sticks as fast as e could come  are you brave lads alooking for the tiger he asks  yes ses john biggs  then urry up for the sake of mercy ses old mr parsley putting is and on the table and going off into a fit of coughing its just gone into bob prettys cottage  i was passing and saw it  george kettle snatches up is gun and shouts out to is men to come along  some of em was for anging back at first some because they didnt like the tiger and some because they didnt like bob pretty but john biggs drove em in front of im like a flock o sheep and then they gave a cheer and ran after george kettle full pelt up the road  a few wimmen and children was at their doors as they passed but they took fright and went indoors screaming  there was a lamp in bob prettys front room but the door was closed and the ouse was silent as the grave  george kettle and the men with the guns went first then came the pitchforks and last of all the scythes  just as george kettle put is and on the door he eard something moving inside and the next moment the door opened and there stood bob pretty  what the dickens e ses starting back as e see the guns and pitchforks pointing at im  ave you killed it bob ses george kettle  killed wot ses bob pretty  be careful o them guns  take your fingers off the triggers  the tigers in your ouse bob ses george kettle in a whisper ave you ony just come in  look ere ses bob pretty  i dont want any o your games  you go and play em somewhere else  it aint a game ses john biggs the tigers in your ouse and were going to kill it  now then lads  they all went in in a eap pushing bob pretty in front of em till the room was full  only one man with a scythe got in and they wouldnt ave let im in if theyd known  it amost made em forget the tiger for the time  george kettle opened the door wot led into the kitchen and then e sprang back with such a shout that the man with the scythe tried to escape taking henery walker along with im  george kettle tried to speak but couldnt  all e could do was to point with is finger at bob prettys kitchenand bob prettys kitchen was for all the world like a porkbutchers shop  there was joints o pork anging from the ceiling two brine tubs as full as they could be and quite a string of fowls and ducks all ready for market  wot dye mean by coming into my ouse ses bob pretty blustering if you dont clear out pretty quick ill make you  nobody answered im they was all examining ands o pork and fowls and suchlike  theres the tiger ses henery walker pointing at bob pretty thats wot old man parsley meant

night  george kettle whose ducks ad gone the night afore went into the front room and walked up and down fighting for is breath but it was all no good nobody ever got the better o bob pretty  none of em could swear to their property and even when it became known a month later that bob pretty and the tramp knew each other nothing was done  but nobody ever eard any more of the tiger from that day to this
