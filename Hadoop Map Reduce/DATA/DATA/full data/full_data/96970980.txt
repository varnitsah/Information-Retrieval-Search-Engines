once 1    let us think for a while upon what the stage was once in a republic of the pastwhat it may be again i sometimes dream in some republic of the future  in order to do this let me take you back in fancy some 2314 years440 years before the christian era and try to sketch for youalas how clumsilya great though tiny people in one of their greatest momentsin one of the greatest moments it may be of the human race  for surely it is a great and a rare moment for humanity when all that is loftiest in itwhen reverence for the unseen powers reverence for the heroic dead reverence for the fatherland and that reverence too for self which is expressed in stateliness and selfrestraint in grace and courtesy when all these i say can lend themselves even for a day to the richest enjoyment of lifeto the enjoyment of beauty in form and sound and of relaxation not brutalising but ennobling  rare alas have such seasons been in the history of poor humanity but when they have come they have lifted it up one stage higher thenceforth  men having been such once may become such again and the work which such times have left behind them becomes immortal   a thing of beauty is a joy for ever   let me take you to the then still unfurnished theatre of athens hewn out of the limestone rock on the southeast slope of the acropolis  above are the new marble buildings of the parthenon rich with the statues and basreliefs of phidias and his scholars gleaming white against the blue sky with the huge bronze statue of athene promachos fifty feet in height towering up among the temples and colonnades  in front and far below gleams the blue sea and salamis beyond  and there are gathered the people of athensfifty thousand of them possibly when the theatre was complete and full  if it be fine they all wear garlands on their heads  if the sun be too hot they wear widebrimmed straw hats  and if a storm comes on they will take refuge in the porticoes beneath not without wine and cakes for what they have come to see will last for many an hour and they intend to feast their eyes and ears from sunrise to sunset  on the highest seats are slaves and freedmen below them the free citizens and on the lowest seats of all are the dignitaries of the republic the priests the magistrates and the other greekthe fair and good menas the citizens of the highest rank were called and with them foreign ambassadors and distinguished strangers  what an audience the rapidest subtlest wittiest down to the very cobblers and tinkers the world has ever seen  and what noble figures on those front seats pericles with aspasia beside him and all his friendsanaxagoras the sage phidias the sculptor and many another immortal artist and somewhere among the free citizens perhaps beside his father sophroniscus the sculptor a short square pug nosed boy of ten years old looking at it all with strange eyeswho will be one day so said the pythoness at delphi the wisest man in greecesage metaphysician humorist warrior patriot martyrfor his name is socrates  all are in their dresses of office for this is not merely a day of amusement but of religions ceremony sacred to dionysosbacchus the inspiring god who raises men above themselves for goodor for evil  the evil or at least the mere animal aspect of that inspiration was to be seen in forms grotesque and sensuous enough in those very festivals when the gayer and coarser part of the population in town and country broke out into frantic masqueradeof which the silly carnival of rome is perhaps the last paltry and unmeaning relic when as the learned o muller says the desire of escaping from self into something new and strange of living in an imaginary world broke forth in a thousand ways not merely in revelry and solemn though fantastic songs but in a hundred disguises imitating the subordinate beingssatyrs pans and nymphs by whom the god was surrounded and through whom life seemed to pass from him into vegetation and branch off into a variety of beautiful or grotesque formsbeings who were ever present to the fancy of the greeks as a convenient step by which they could approach more nearly to the presence of the divinity  but even out of that seemingly bare chaos athenian genius was learning how to construct under eupolis cratinus and aristophanes that elder school of comedy which remains not only unsurpassed but unapproachable save by rabelais alone as the ideal cloudland of masquerading wisdom in which the whole universe goes madbut with a subtle method in its madness  yes so it has been under some form or other in every race and climeever since eve ate of the magic fruit that she might be as a god knowing good and evil and found poor thing as most have since that it was far easier and more pleasant to know the evil than to know the good  but that theatre was built that men might know therein the good as well as the evil  to learn the evil indeed according to their light and the sure vengeance of ate and the furies which tracks up the evildoer  but to learn also the good lessons of piety patriotism heroism justice mercy self sacrifice and all that comes out of the hearts of men and women not dragged below but raised above themselves and behind allat least in the nobler and earlier tragedies of aeschylus and sophocles before euripides had introduced the tragedy of mere human passion that sensation tragedy which is the only one the world knows now and of which the world is growing rapidly tiredbehind all i say lessons of the awful and unfathomable mystery of human existenceof unseen destiny of that seemingly capricious distribution of weal and woe to which we can find no solution on this side the grave for which the old greek could find no solution whatsoever  therefore there was a central object in the old greek theatre most important to it but which did not exist in the old roman and does not exist in our theatres because our tragedies like the roman are mere plays concerning love murder and so forth while the greek were concerning the deepest relations of man to the unseen  the almost circular orchestra or pit between the benches and the stage was empty of what we call spectatorsbecause it was destined for the true and ideal spectatorsthe representatives of humanity in its centre was a round platform the greekoriginally the altar of bacchusfrom which the leader of these representatives the leader of the chorus could converse with the actors on the stage and take his part in the drama and round this thymele the chorus ranged with measured dance and song chanting to the sound of a simple flute odes such as the world had never heard before or since save perhaps in the templeworship at jerusalem  a chorus now as you know merely any number of persons singing in full harmony on any subject  the chorus was then in tragedy and indeed in the higher comedy what schlegel well calls the ideal spectatora personified reflection on the action going on the incorporation into the representation itself of the sentiments of the poet as the spokesman of the whole human race  he goes on to say and i think truly that the chorus always retained among the greeks a peculiar national signification publicity being according to their republican notions essential to the completeness of every important transaction  thus the chorus represented idealised public opinion not of course the shifting hasty public opinion of the momentto that it was a conservative check and it calmed it to soberness and charityfor it was the matured public opinion of centuries the experience and usually the sad experience of many generations the very spirit of the greek race  the chorus might be composed of what the poet would  of ancient citizens waiting for their sons to come back from the war as in the agamemnon of aeschylus of seanymphs as in his prometheus bound even of the very furies who hunt the matricide as in his eumenides of senators as in the antigone of sophocles or of village farmers as in his oedipus at colonosand now i have named five of the greatest poems as i hold written by mortal man till dante rose  or it may be the chorus was composedas in the comedies of aristophanes the greatest humorist the world has ever seenof birds or of frogs or even of clouds  it may rise to the level of don quixote or sink to that of sancho panza for it is always the incarnation of such wisdom heavenly or earthly as the poet wishes the people to bring to bear on the subjectmatter  but let the poets themselves rather than me speak awhile  allow me to give you a few specimens of these chorusesthe first as an example of that practical and yet surely not undivine wisdom by which they supplied the place of our modern preacher or essayist or didactic poet  listen to this of the old mens chorus in the agamemnon in the spirited translation of my friend professor blackie      twas said of old and tis said today    that wealth to prosperous stature grown       begets a birth of its own    that a surfeit of evil by good is prepared    and sons must bear what allotment of woe       their sires were spared    but this i refuse to believe  i know       that impious deeds conspire    to beget an offspring of impious deeds       too like their ugly sire but whoso is just though his wealth like a river flow down shall be scathless  his house shall rejoice    in an offspring of beauty for ever     the heart of the haughty delights to beget    a haughty heart  from time to time    in childrens children recurrent appears       the ancestral crime when the dark hour comes that the gods have decreed and the fury burns with wrathful fires    a demon unholy with ire unabated    lies like black night on the halls of the fated    and the recreant son plunges guiltily on       to perfect the guilt of his sires  but justice shines in a lowly cell in the homes of poverty smokebegrimed with the soberminded she loves to dwell    but she turns aside from the rich mans house with averted eye the goldenfretted halls of pride where hands with lucre are foul and the praise of counterfeit goodness smoothly sways and wisely she guides in the strong mans despite    all things to an issue of right   let me now give you another passage from the eumenidesor furiesof aeschylus  orestes prince of argos you must remember has avenged on his mother clytemnestra the murder of his father king agamemnon on his return from troy  pursued by the furies he takes refuge in the temple of apollo at delphi and then still furyhaunted goes to athens where pallas athene the warriormaiden the tutelary goddess of athens bids him refer his cause to the areopagus the highest court of athens apollo acting as his advocate and she sitting as umpire in the midst  the white and black balls are thrown into the urn and are equal and orestes is only delivered by the decision of atheneas the representative of the nearer race of gods the olympians the friends of man in whose likeness man is made  the furies are the representatives of the older and darker creedwhich yet has a depth of truth in itof the irreversible dooms which underlie all nature and which represent the law and not the gospel the consequence of the mere act independent of the spirit which has prompted it  they break out in fury against the overbearing arrogance of these younger gods  athene bears their rage with equanimity addresses them in the language of kindness even of veneration till these so indomitable beings are unable to withstand the charm of her mild eloquence  they are to have a sanctuary in the athenian land and to be called no more furies erinnys but eumenidesthe well conditionedthe kindly goddesses  and all ends with a solemn precession round the orchestra with hymns of blessing while the terrible chorus of the furies clothed in black with bloodstained girdles and serpents in their hair in masks having perhaps somewhat of the terrific beauty of medusamasks are convoyed to their new sanctuary by a procession of children women and old men in purple robes with torches in their hands after athene and the furies have sung in response to each other a chorus from which i must beg leave to give you an extract or two   eldest fury leader of the chorus  far from thy dwelling and far from thy border by the grace of my godhead benignant i order the blight which may blacken the bloom of the trees far from thy border and far from thy dwelling be the hot blast which shrivels the bud in its swelling the seedrotting taint and the creeping disease thy flocks be still doubled thy seasons be steady and when hermes is near thee thy hand be still ready    the heavendropt bounty to seize  athene  hear her words my citys warders fraught with blessings she prevaileth with olympians and infernals dread erinnys much revered mortal faith she guideth plainly to what goal she pleaseth sending songs to some to others days with tearful sorrows dulled  furies     far from thy border    the lawless disorder that sateless of evil shall reign    far from thy dwelling    the dear blood welling that taints thine own hearth with the slain    when slaughter from slaughter    shall flow like the water and rancour from rancour shall grow    but joy with joy blending    live each to all lending and hating onehearted the foe    when bliss hath

shines sunshine the clearest blest people near jove the olympian seated and dear to the maiden his daughter the dearest timely wise neath the wings of the daughter ye gather and mildly looks down on her children the father   those of you here who love your country as well as the old athenians loved theirs will feel at once the grand political significance of such a scene in which patriotism and religion become oneand feel too the exquisite dramatic effect of the innocent the weak the unwarlike welcoming among them without fear because without guilt those ancient snakyhaired sisters emblems of all that is most terrible and most inscrutable in the destiny of nations of families and of men   to their hallowed habitations neath ogygian earths foundations in that darksome hall sacrifice and supplication shall not fail  in adoration silent worship all   listen again to the gentler patriotism of a gentler poet sophocles himself  the village of colonos a mile from athens was his birthplace and in his oedipus coloneus he makes his chorus of village officials sing thus of their consecrated olive grove      in good hap stranger to these rural seats    thou comest to this regions blest retreats    where white colonos lifts his head    and glories in the bounding steed where sadly sweet the frequent nightingale    impassioned pours his evening song and charms with varied notes each verdant vale    the ivys darkgreen boughs among    or sheltered neath the clustering vine    which high above him forms a bower    safe from the sun or stormy shower    where frolic bacchus often roves and visits with his fostering nymphs the groves    bathed in the dew of heaven each morn    fresh is the fair narcissus born    of those great gods the crown of old    the crocus glitters robed in gold here restless fountains ever murmuring glide    and as their crisped streamlets play to feed cephisus thine unfailing tide    fresh verdure marks their winding way    here oft to raise the tuneful song    the virgin band of muses deigns and carborne aphrodite guides her golden reins   then they go on this band of village elders to praise the gods for their special gifts to that small athenian land  they praise pallas athene who gave their forefathers the olive then poseidonneptune as the romans call himwho gave their forefathers the horse and something morethe shipthe horse of the sea as they like the old norse vikings after them delighted to call it   our highest vaunt is thisthy grace    poseidon we behold the ruling curb embossed with gold controls the coursers managed pace though loud oh king thy billows roar our strong hands grasp the labouring oar and while the nereids round it play light cuts our bounding bark its way   what a combination of fine humanities  dance and song patriotism and religion so often parted among us have flowed together into one in these stately villagers each a small farmer each a trained soldier and probably a trained seaman also each a selfgoverned citizen and each a cultured gentleman if ever there were gentlemen on earth  but what drama doing or actionfor such is the meaning of the wordis going on upon the stage to be commented on by the sympathising chorus  one drama at least was acted in athens in that year440 bc which you i doubt not know wellantigone that of sophocles which mendelssohn has resuscitated in our own generation by setting it to music divine indeed though very different from the music to which it was set probably by sophocles himself at its first and for aught we know its only representation for pieces had not then as now a run of a hundred nights and more  the athenian genius was so fertile and the athenian audience so eager for novelty that new pieces were demanded and were forthcoming for each of the great festivals and if a piece was represented a second time it was usually after an interval of some years  they did not moreover like the moderns run every night to some theatre or other as a part of the days amusement  tragedy and even comedy were serious subjects calling out not a passing sigh or passing laugh but all the higher faculties and emotions  and as serious subjects were to be expressed in verse and music which gave stateliness doubtless even to the richest burlesques of aristophanes and lifted them out of mere streetbuffoonery into an ideal fairyland of the grotesque how much more stateliness must verse and music have added to their tragedy  and how much have we lost toward a true appreciation of their dramatic art by losing almost utterly not only the laws of their melody and harmony but even the true metric time of their odesmusic and metre which must have surely been as noble as their poetry their sculpture their architecture possessed by the same exquisite sense of form and of proportion  one thing we can understandhow this musical form of the drama which still remains to us in lower shapes in the oratorio in the opera must have helped to raise their tragedies into that ideal sphere in which they all like the antigone live and move  so ideal and yet so human nay rather truly ideal because truly human  the gods the heroes the kings the princesses of greek tragedy were dear to the hearts of greek republicans not merely as the founders of their states not merely as the tutelary deities many of them of their country  but as men and women like themselves only more vast with mightier wills mightier virtues mightier sorrows and often mightier crimes their inward freewill battling as schlegel has well seen against outward circumstance and overruling fate as every man should battle unless he sink to be a brute  in tragedy says schlegeluttering thus a deep and momentous truththe gods themselves either come forward as the servants of destiny and mediate executors of its decrees or approve themselves godlike only by asserting their liberty of action and entering upon the same struggles with fate which man himself has to encounter  and i believe this that this greek tragedy with its godlike men and manlike gods and heroes who had become gods by the very vastness of their humanity was a preparation and it may be a necessary preparation for the true christian faith in a son of man who is at once utterly human and utterly divine  that man is made in the likeness of godis the root idea only halfconscious only halfexpressed but instinctive without which neither the greek tragedies nor the homeric poems six hundred years before them could have been composed  doubtless the idea that man was like a god degenerated too often into the idea that the gods were like men and as wicked  but that travestie of a great truth is not confined to those old greeks  some socalled christian theoriesas i holdhave sinned in that direction as deeply as the athenians of old  meanwhile i say that this long acquiescence in the conception of godlike struggle godlike daring godlike suffering godlike martyrdom the very conception which was so foreign to the mythologies of any other racesave that of the jews and perhaps of our own teutonic forefathersdid prepare must have prepared men to receive as most rational and probable as the satisfaction of their highest instincts the idea of a being in whom all those partial rays culminated in clear pure light of a being at once utterly human and utterly divine who by struggle suffering selfsacrifice without a parallel achieved a victory over circumstance and all the dark powers which beleaguer main without a parallel likewise  take as an example the figure which you know bestthe figure of antigone herselfdevoting herself to be entombed alive for the sake of love and duty  love of a brother which she can only prove alas by burying his corpse  duty to the dead an instinct depending on no written law but springing out of the very depth of those blind and yet sacred monitions which prove that the true man is not an animal but a spirit fulfilling her holy purpose unchecked by fear unswayed by her sisters entreaties  hardening her heart magnificently till her fate is sealed and then after proving her godlike courage proving the tenderness of her womanhood by that melodious wail over her own untimely death and the loss of marriage joys which some of you must know from the music of mendelssohn and which the late dean milman has put into english thus   come fellowcitizens and see the desolate antigone on the last path her steps shall treed set forth the journey of the dead watching with vainly lingering gaze her last last suns expiring rays  never to see it never more for down to acherons dread shore a living victim am i led to hades universal bed to my dark lot no bridal joys belong nor oer the jocund noise of hymeneal chant shall sound for me but death cold death my only spouse shall be  oh tomb  oh bridal chamber  oh deepdelved and stronglyguarded mansion  i descend to meet in your dread chambers all my kindred who in dark multitudes have crowded down where proserpine received the dead  but i the lastand oh how few more miserable go down or ere my sands of life are run   and let me ask you whether the contemplation of such a selfsacrifice should draw you should have drawn those who heard the tale nearer to or farther from a certain cross which stood on calvary some 1800 years ago  may not the tale of antigone heard from mother or from nurse have nerved ere now some martyrmaiden to dare and suffer in an even holier cause  but to return  this set purpose of the athenian dramatists of the best school to set before men a magnified humanity explains much in their dramas which seems to us at first not only strange but faulty the masks which gave one grand but unvarying type of countenance to each wellknown historic personage and thus excluded the play of feature animated gesture and almost all which we now consider as acting proper the thicksoled cothurni which gave the actor a more than human stature the poverty according to our notions of the scenery which usually represented merely the front of a palace or other public place and was often though not always unchanged during the whole performance the total absence in fact of anything like that scenic illusion which most managers of theatres seem now to consider as their highest achievement the small number of the actors two or at most three only being present on the stage at oncethe simplicity of the action in which intrigue in the playhouse sense and any complication of plot are utterly absent all this must have concentrated not the eye of the spectator on the scene but his ear upon the voice and his emotions on the personages who stood out before him without a background sharpcut and clear as a group of statuary which is the same place it where you will complete in itselfa world of beauty independent of all other things and beings save on the ground on which it needs must stand it was the personage rather than his surroundings which was to be impressed by every word on the spectators heart and intellect and the very essence of greek tragedy is expressed in the still famous words of medea   che resta  io   contrast this with the european dramaespecially with the highest form of itour own elizabethan  it resembles as has been often said in better words than mine not statuary but painting  these dramas affect colour light and shadow background whether of town or country description of scenery where scenic machinery is inadequate all in fact which can blend the action and the actors with the surrounding circumstances without letting them altogether melt into the circumstances which can show them a part of the great whole by harmony or discord with the whole universe down to the flowers beneath their feet  this too had to be done  how it became possible for even the genius of a shakespeare to get it done i may with your leave hint to you hereafter  why it was not given to the greeks to do it i know not  let us at least thank them for what they did  one work was given them and that one they fulfilled as it had never been fulfilled before as it will never need to be fulfilled again for the greeks work was done not for themselves alone but for all races in all times and greek art is the heirloom of the whole human race and that work was to assert in drama lyric sculpture music gymnastic the dignity of manthe dignity of man which they perceived for the most part with their intense aesthetic sense through the beautiful in man  man with them was divine inasmuch as he could perceive beauty and be beautiful himself  beauty might be physical aesthetic intellectual moral  but in proportion as a thing was perfect it revealed its own perfection by its beauty  goodness itself was a formthough the highest formof beauty  greek meant both the physically beautiful and the morally good greek both the ugly and the bad  out of this rootidea sprang the whole of that greek sculpture which is still and perhaps ever will be one of the unrivalled wonders of the world  their first statues remember were statues of the gods  this is an historic fact  before bc 580 there were probably no statues in greece save those of deities  but of what form  we all know that the usual tendency of man has been to represent his gods as more or less monstrous  their monstrosity may have been meant as it was certainly with the mexican idols and probably those of the semitic races of syria and palestine to symbolise the ferocious passions which they attributed to those objects of their dread appeasable alone by human sacrifice  or the monstrosity as with the hawk headed or catheaded egyptian idols the winged bulls of nineveh and babylon the manyhanded deities of hindostanmerely symbolised powers which could not so the priest and the sculptor held belong to mere humanity  now of such monstrous forms of idols the records in greece are very few and very ancientrelics of an older worship and most probably of an older race  from the earliest historic period the greek was discerning more and more that the divine could be best represented by the human the tendency of his statuary was more and more to honour that divine by embodying it in the highest human beauty  in lonely mountain shrines there still might linger feared and honoured dolls like those black virgins of unknown antiquity which still work wonders on the european continent  in the mysterious cavern of phigalia for instance on the eleatic shore of peloponnese there may have been in remote timesso the legend ran an old black wooden image a woman with a horses head and mane and serpents growing round her head who held a dolphin in one hand and a dove in the other  and this image may have been connected with old naturemyths about the marriage of demeter and poseidonthat is of encroachments of the sea upon the land and the other myths of demeter the earthmother may have clustered round the place till the phigalians were gladfor it was profitable as well as honourableto believe that in their cavern demeter sat mourning for the loss of proserpine whom pluto had carried down to hades and all the earth was barren till zeus sent the fates or iris to call her forth and restore fertility to the world  and it may be truethe legend as pausanias tells it 600 years afterthat the old wooden idol having been burnt and the worship of demeter neglected till a famine ensued the phigalians warned by the oracle of delphi hired onatas a contemporary of polygnotus and phidias to make them a bronze replica of the old idol from some old copy and from a drama of his own  the story may be true  when pausanias went thither in the second century after christ the cave and the fountain and the sacred grove of oaks and the altar outside which was to be polluted with the blood of no victimthe only offerings being fruits and honey and undressed woolwere still there  the statue was gone some said it had been destroyed by the fall of the cliff some were not sure that it had ever been there at all  and meanwhile praxiteles had already brought to perfection paus 1 2 sec 4 the ideal of demeter motherlike as herewhom we still call juno now but softerfeatured and her eyes more closed  and so for mother earth as for the rest the best representation of the divine was the human  now conceive such an idea taking hold however slowly of a people of rare physical beauty of acutest eye for proportion and grace with opportunities of studying the human figure such as exist nowhere now save among tropic savages and gifted moreover in that as in all other matters with that inmate diligence of which mr carlyle has said that genius is only an infinite capacity of taking pains and we can understand somewhat of the causes which produced those statues human and divine which awe and shame the artificiality and degeneracy of our modern socalled civilisationwe can understand somewhat of the reverence for the human form of the careful study of every line the storing up for use each scattered fragment of beauty of which the artist caught sight even in his daily walks and consecrating it in his memory to the service of him or her whom he was trying to embody in marble or in bronze  and when the fashion came in of making statues of victors in the games and other distinguished persons a new element was introduced which had large social as well as artistic results  the sculptor carried his usual reverence into his careful delineation of the victors form while he obtained in him a model usually of the very highest type for perfecting his idea of some divinity  the possibility of gaining the right to a statue gave a fresh impulse to all competitors in the public games and through them to the gymnastic training throughout all the states of greece which made the greeks the most physically able and graceful as well as the most beautiful people known to the history of the human racea people who reverencing beauty reverenced likewise grace or acted beauty so utterly and honestly that nothing was too humble for a free man to do if it were not done awkwardly and ill  as an instance sophocles himselfover and above his poetic genius one of the most cultivated gentlemen as well as one of the most exquisite musicians dancers and gymnasts and one of the most just pious and gentle of all greececould not by reason of the weakness of his voice act in his own plays as poets were wont to do and had to perform only the office of stagemanager  twice he took part in the action once as the blind old thamyris playing on the harp and once in his own lost tragedy the nausicaa  there in the scene in which the princess as she does in homers odyssey comes down to the seashore with her maidens to wash the household clothes and then to play at ball sophocles himself a man then of middle age did the one thing he could do better than any thereand dressed in womens clothes among the lads who represented the maidens played at ball before the athenian people  just sixty years after the representation of the antigone 10000 greeks far on the plains of babylon cut through the whole persian army as the railway train cuts through a herd of buffalo and then losing all their generals by treacherous warfare fought their way north from babylon to trebizond on the black sea under the guidance of a young athenian a pupil of socrates who had never served in the army before  the retreat of xenophon and his 10000 will remain for ever as one of the grandest triumphs of civilisation over brute force  but what made it possible  that these men and their ancestors before them had been for at least 100 years in training physical intellectual and moral which made their bodies and their minds able to dare and suffer like those old heroes of whom their tragedy had taught them and whose spirits they still believed would help the valiant greek  and yet that feat which looks to us so splendid attracted as far as i am aware no special admiration at the time  so was the cultivated greek expected to behave whenever he came in contact with the uncultivated barbarian  but from what had sprung in that little state this exuberance of splendid life physical aesthetic intellectual which made and will make the name of athens and of the whole cluster of greek republics for ever admirable to civilised man  had it sprung from long years of peaceful prosperity  from infinite making of money and comfort according to the laws of socalled political economy and the dictates of enlightened selfishness  not so  but rather out of terror and agony and all but utter ruinand out of a magnificent want of economy and the divine daring and folly of selfsacrifice  in salamis across the strait a trophy stood and round that trophy forty years before sophocles the author of antigone then sixteen years of age the loveliest and most cultivated lad in athens undraped like a faun with lyre in hand was leading the chorus of athenian youths and singing to athene the tutelary goddess a hymn of triumph for a glorious victorythe very symbol of greece and athens springing up into a joyous second youth after invasion and desolation as the grass springs up after the prairie fire has passed  but the fire had been terrible  it had burnt athens at least down to the very roots  true while sophocles was dancing xerxes the great king of the east foiled at salamis as his father darius had been foiled at marathon ten years before was fleeing back to persia leaving his innumerable hosts of slaves and mercenaries to be destroyed piecemeal by land at platea by sea at mycale  the bold hope was over in which the persian ever since the days of cyrus had indulgedthat he the despot of the east should be the despot of the west likewise  it seemed to them as possible though not as easy to subdue the aryan greek as it had been to subdue the semite and the turanian the babylonian and the syrian to riffle his temples to destroy his idols carry off his women and children as colonists into distant lands as they had been doing with all the nations of the east  and they had succeeded with isolated colonies isolated islands of greeks and the shores of asia minor  but when they dared at last to attack the greek in his own sacred land of hellas they found they had bearded a lion in his den  nay rather as those old greeks would have saidthey had dared to attack pallas athene the eldest daughter of zeusemblem of that serene and pure divine wisdom of whom solomon sang of old  the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old  when he prepared the heavens i was there when he appointed the foundation of the earth then was i by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him  rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delight was with the sons of mento attack athene and her brother apollo lord of light and beauty and culture and grace and inspirationto attack them not in the name of ormuzd nor of any other deity but in the name of mere brute force and lust of conquest  the old persian spirit was gone out of them  they were the symbols now of nothing save despotism and selfwill wealth and selfindulgence  they once the children of ormuzd or light had become the children of ahriman or darkness and therefore it was as i believe that xerxes 1000 ships and the two million or as some have it five million human beings availed naught against the little fleets and little battalions of men who believed with a living belief in athene and apollo and thereforeponder it well for it is truewith a living belief under whatsoever confusions and divisions of personality in a god who loved taught inspired men a just god who befriended the righteous cause the cause of freedom and patriotism a deity the echo of whose mind and will to man was the song of athene on olympus when she   chanted of order and right and of foresight and order of peoples chanted of labour and craft wealth in the port and the garner chanted of valour and fame and the man who can fall with the foremost fighting for children and wife and the field which his father bequeathed him sweetly and cunningly sang she and planned new lessons for mortals happy who hearing obey her the wise unsullied athene   ah that they had always obeyed her those old greeks  but meanwhile as i said the agony had been extreme  if athens had sinned she had been purged as by fire and the firesurely of god had been terrible  northern greece had either been laid waste with fire and sword or had gone over to the persian traitors in their despair  attica almost the only loyal state had been overrun the old men women and children had fled to the neighbouring islands or to the peloponnese  athens itself had been destroyed and while young sophocles was dancing round the trophy at salamis the acropolis was still a heap of blackened ruins  but over and above their valour over and above their loyalty over and above their exquisite aesthetic faculty these athenians had a resilience of selfreliant energy like that of the frenchlike that of the american people after the fire of chicago and athens rose from her ashes to be awhile not only as she had nobly earned by suffering and endurance the leading state in greece but a mighty fortress a rich commercial port a living centre of art poetry philosophy such as this earth has never seen before or since  on the plateau of that little crag of the acropolis some eight hundred feet in length by four hundred in breadthabout the size and shape of the castle rock at edinburghwas gathered within forty years of the battle of salamis more and more noble beauty than ever stood together on any

depended on if it suited him he would lie betray overreach change sides and think it no sin  he was the sharpest of men  sharp practice in our modern sense of the word was the very element in which he floated any scholar knows it  in the grand times of marathon and salamis down to the disastrous times of the peloponnesian war and the thirty tyrants no public mans hands were clean with the exception perhaps of aristides who was banished because men were tired of hearing him called the just  the exciting cause of the peloponnesian war and the consequent downfall of athens was not merely the tyranny she exercised over the states allied to her it was the sharp practice of the athenians in misappropriating the tribute paid by the allies to the decoration of athens  and in laying the foundations of the parthenon was sown by a just judgment the seed of ruin for the state which gloried in it  and if the rulers were such what were the people  if the free were such what were the slaves  hence weakness at home and abroad mistrust of generals and admirals paralysing all bold and clear action peculations and corruptions at home internecine wars between factions inside states and between states or groups of states revolutions followed by despotism and final exhaustion and slaveryslavery to a people who were coming across the western sea hardheaded hardhearted caring nothing for art or science whose pleasures were coarse and cruel but with a certain rough honesty reverence for country for law and for the ties of a familymen of a somewhat old english type who had over and above like the english the inspiring belief that they could conquer the whole world and who very nearly succeeded in that as we have to our great blessing not succeededi mean of course the romans    thoughts on shelley and byron 35    the poets who forty years ago proclaimed their intention of working a revolution in english literature and who have succeeded in their purpose recommended especially a more simple and truthful view of nature  the established canons of poetry were to be discarded as artificial as to the matter the poet was to represent mere nature as he saw her as to form he was to be his own law  freedom and nature were to be his watchwords  no theory could be more in harmony with the spirit of the age and the impulse which had been given to it by the burning words of jean jacques rousseau  the school which arose expressed fairly the unrest and unruliness of the time its weariness of artificial restraint and unmeaning laws its craving after a nobler and a more earnest life its sense of a glory and mystery in the physical universe hidden from the poets of the two preceding centuries and now revealed by science  so far all was hopeful  but it soon became apparent that each poets practical success in carrying out the theory was paradoxically enough in inverse proportion to his belief in it that those who like wordsworth southey and keats talked most about naturalness and freedom and most openly reprobated the school of pope were after all least natural and least free that the balance of those excellences inclined much more to those who like campbell rogers crabbe and moore troubled their heads with no theories but followed the best old models which they knew and that the rightful sovereign of the new parnassus lord byron protested against the new movement while he followed it upheld to the last the models which it was the fashion to decry confessed to the last in poetry as in morals video meliora proboque deteriora sequor and uttered again and again prophecies of the downfall of english poetry and english taste which seem to be on the eve of realisation  now no one will we presume be silly enough to say that humanity has gained nothing by all the very beautiful poetry which has been poured out on it during the last thirty years in england  nevertheless when we see poetry dying down among us year by year although the age is becoming year by year more marvellous and inspiring we have a right to look for some false principle in a school which has had so little enduring vitality which seems now to be able to perpetuate nothing of itself but its vices  the answer so easy twenty years ago that the new poetry was spoiled by an influx of german bad taste will hardly hold good now except with a very few very ignorant people  it is now known of course that whatsoever quarrel lessing schiller and goethe may have had with pope it was not on account of his being too severe an artist but too loose a one not for being too classical but not classical enough that english poets borrowed from them nothing but their most boyish and immature types of thought and that these were reproduced and laughed at here while the men themselves were writing works of a purity and loftiness and completeness unknown to the worldexcept in the writings of miltonfor nearly two centuries  this feature however of the new german poetry was exactly the one which no english poet deigned to imitate save byron alone on whom accordingly goethe always looked with admiration and affection  but the rest went their way unheeding and if they have defects those defects are their own for when they did copy the german taste they for the most part deliberately chose the evil and refused the good and have their reward in a fame which we believe will prove itself a very shortlived one  we cannot deny however that in spite of all faults these men had a strength  they have exercised an influence  and they have done so by virtue of seeing a fact which more complete and in some cases more manly poets did not see  strangely enough shelley the man who was the greatest sinner of them all against the canons of good taste was the man who saw that new fact if not most clearly still most intensely and who proclaimed it most boldly  his influence therefore is outliving that of his compeers and growing and spreading for good and for evil and will grow and spread for years to come as long as the present great unrest goes on smouldering in mens hearts till the hollow settlement of 1815 is burst asunder anew and men feel that they are no longer in the beginning of the end but in the end itself and that this long thirty years prologue to the reconstruction of rotten europe is played out at last and the drama itself begun  such is the way of providence the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong nor the prophecy to the wise  the spirit bloweth where he listeth and sends on his errandsthose who deny him rebel against himprofligates madmen and hysterical rousseaus hysterical shelleys uttering words like the east wind he uses strange tools in his cosmogony  but he does not use them in vain  by bad men if not by good by fools if not by wise gods work is done and done right well  there was then a strength and a truth in all these men and it was thisthat more or less clearly they all felt that they were standing between two worlds and the ruins of an older age upon the threshold of a new one  to byrons mind the decay and rottenness of the old was perhaps the most palpable to shelleys the possible glory of the new  wordsworth declareda little too noisily we think as if he had been the first to discover the truththe dignity and divineness of the most simple human facts and relationships coleridge declares that the new can only assume living form by growing organically out of the old institutions  keats gives a sad and yet a wholesome answer to them both as young and passionate he goes down with faust to the mothers      to the rich warm youth of the nations childlike in virtue and faith though childlike in passion and pleasure childlike still still near to the gods while the sunset of eden lingered in rosered rays on the peaks of ionian mountains   and there amid the old classic forms he cries  these things too are eternal   a thing of beauty is a joy for ever   these or things even fairer than they must have their place in the new world if it is to be really a home for the human race  so he sings as best he can the halfeducated and consumptive stable keepers son from his prisonhouse of london brick and in one mighty yearn after that beauty from which he is debarred breaks his young heart and dies leaving a name not writ in water as he dreamed but on all fair things all lovers hearts for evermore  here then to return is the reason why the hearts of the present generation have been influenced so mightily by these men rather than by those of whom byron wrote with perfect sincerity   scott rogers campbell moore and crabbe will try gainst you the question with posterity   these lines written in 1818 were meant to apply only to coleridge wordsworth and southey  whether they be altogether just or unjust is not now the question  it must seem somewhat strange to our young poets that shelleys name is not among those who are to try the question of immortality against the lake school and yet many of his most beautiful poems had been already written  were then the revolt of islam and alastor not destined it seems in byrons opinion to live as long as the lady of the lake and the mariners of england  perhaps not  at least the omission of shelleys name is noteworthy  but still more noteworthy are these words of his to mr murray dated january 23 1819  read popemost of you dontbut do    and the inevitable consequence would be that you would burn all that i have ever written and all your other wretched claudians of the day except scott and crabbe into the bargain  and here arises a new questionis shelley then among the claudians  it is a hard saying  the present generation will receive it with shouts of laughter  some future one which studies and imitates shakespeare instead of anatomising him and which gradually awakens to the now forgotten fact that a certain man named edmund spenser once wrote a poem the like of which the earth never saw before and perhaps may never see again may be inclined to acquiesce in the verdict and believe that byron had a discrimination in this matter as in a hundred more far more acute than any of his compeers and had not eaten in vain poor fellow of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  in the meanwhile we may perceive in the poetry of the two men deep and radical differences indicating a spiritual difference between them even more deep which may explain the little notice which byron takes of shelleys poetry and the fact that the two men had no deep sympathy for each other and could not in any wise pull together during the sojourn in italy  doubtless there were plain outward faults of temper and character on both sides neither was in a state of mind which could trust itself or be trusted by those who loved them best  friendship can only consist with the calm and selfrestraint and selfrespect of moral and intellectual health and both were diseased fevered ready to take offence ready unwittingly to give it  but the diseases of the two were different as their natures were and shelleys fever was not byrons  now it is worth remarking that it is shelleys form of fever rather than byrons which has been of late years the prevailing epidemic since shelleys poems have become known in england and a timid public after approaching in fear and trembling the fountain which was understood to be poisoned has begun first to sip and then finding the magic water at all events sweet enough to quench its thirst with unlimited draughts byrons fiercer wine has lost favour wellat least the taste of the age is more refined if that be matter of congratulation  and there is an excuse for preferring champagne to waterside porter heady with grains of paradise and quassia salt and cocculus indicus  nevertheless worse ingredients than oenanthic acid may lurk in the delicate draught and the devils elixir may be made fragrant and sweet and transparent enough as french moralists well know for the most fastidious palate  the private sipping of euadecologne say the london physicians has increased mightily of late and so has the reading of shelley  it is not surprising  byrons corsairs and laras have been on the whole impossible during the thirty years peace and piracy and profligacy are at all times and especially nowadays expensive amusements and often require a good private fortunerare among poets  they have therefore been wisely abandoned as ideals except among a few young persons who used to wear turndown collars and are now attempting moustaches and mazzini hats  but even among them and among their bettersrather their morerespectablesninetenths of the bad influence which is laid at byrons door really is owing to shelley among the many goodgoing gentlemen and ladies byron is generally spoken of with horrorhe is so wicked forsooth while poor shelley poor dear shelley is very wrong of course but so refined so beautiful so tendera fallen angel while byron is a satyr and a devil  we boldly deny the verdict  neither of the two are devils as for angels when we have seen one we shall be better able to give an opinion at present shelley is in our eyes far less like one of those old hebrew and miltonic angels fallen or unfallen than byron is  and as for the satyr the less that is said for shelley on that point the better  if byron sinned more desperately and flagrantly than he it was done under the temptations of rank wealth disappointed love and under the impulses of an animal nature to which shelleys passions were   as moonlight unto sunlight and as water unto wine   at all events byron never set to work to consecrate his own sin into a religion and proclaim the worship of uncleanness as the last and highest ethical development of pure humanity  nobyron may be brutal but he never cants  if at moments he finds himself in hell he never turns round to the world and melodiously informs them that it is heaven if they could but see it in its true light  the truth is that what has put byron out of favour with the public of late has been not his faults but his excellences  his artistic good taste his classical polish his sound shrewd sense his hatred of cant his insight into humbug above all his shallow pitiable habit of being always intelligiblethese are the sins which condemn him in the eyes of a mesmerising tableturning spiritrapping spiritualising romanising generation who read shelley in secret and delight in his bad taste mysticism extravagance and vague and pompous sentimentalism  the age is an effeminate one and it can well afford to pardon the lewdness of the gentle and sensitive vegetarian while it has no mercy for that of the sturdy peer proud of his bull neck and his boxing who kept bears and bulldogs drilled greek ruffians at missoloughi and had no objection to a pot of beer and who might if he had reformed have made a gallant english gentleman while shelley if once his intense selfopinion had deserted him would have probably ended in rome as an oratorian or a passionist  we would that it were only for this count that byron has had to make way for shelley  there is as we said before a deeper moral difference between the men which makes the weaker rather than the stronger find favour in young mens eyes  for byron has the most intense and awful sense of moral lawof law external to himself shelley has little or none less perhaps than any known writer who has ever meddled with moral questions  byrons cry is i am miserable because law exists and i have broken it broken it so habitually that now i cannot help breaking it  i have tried to eradicate the sense of it by speculation by action but i cannot   the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life   there is a moral law independent of us and yet the very marrow of our life which punishes and rewards us by no arbitrary external penalties but by our own consciousness of being what we are   the mind which is immortal makes itself requital for its good or evil thoughts is its own origin of ill and end and its own place and timeits innate sense when stript of this mortality derives no colour from the fleeting things about but is absorbed in sufferance or in joy born from the knowledge of its own desert   this idea confused intermitted obscured by all forms of evilfor it was not discovered but only in the process of discoveryis the one which comes out with greater and greater strength through all corsairs laras and parasinas till it reaches its completion in cain and in manfred of both of which we do boldly say that if any sceptical poetry at all be right which we often question they are right and not wrong that in cain as in manfred the awful problem which perhaps had better not have been put at all is nevertheless fairly put and the solution as far as it is seen fairly confessed namely that there is an absolute and eternal law in the heart of man which sophistries of his own or of other beings may make him forget deny blaspheme but which exists eternally and will assert itself  if this be not the meaning of manfred especially of that great scene in the chamois hunters cottage what isif this be not the meaning of cain and his awful awakening after the murder not to any mere dread of external punishment but to an overwhelming instinctive inarticulate sense of having done wrong what is  yes that law exists let it never be forgotten is the real meaning of byron down to that last terrible don juan in which he sits himself down in artificial calm to trace the gradual rotting and degradation of a man without law the slave of his own pleasures a picture happily never finished because he who painted it was taken away before he had learnt perhaps when he was beginning to turn back fromthe lower depth within the lowest deep  now to this whole form of consciousness poor shelleys mind is altogether antipodal  his whole life through was a denial of external law and a substitution in its place of internal sentiment byrons cry is  there is a law and therefore i am miserable  why cannot i keep the law  shelleys is  there is a law and therefore i am miserable  why should not the law be abolishedaway with it for it interferes with my sentimentsaway with marriage custom and faith the foulest birth of timewe do not wish to follow him down into the fearful sins which he defended with the small powers of reasoningand they were peculiarly smallwhich he possessed  let any one who wishes to satisfy himself of the real difference between byrons mind and shelleys compare the writings in which each of them treats the same subjectnamely that frightful question about the relation of the sexes which forms evidently manfreds crime and see if the result is not simply this that shelley glorifies what byron damns  lawless love is shelleys expressed ideal of the relation of the sexes and his justice his benevolence his pity are all equally lawless  follow your instincts is his one moral rule confounding the very lowest animal instincts with those lofty ideas of might which it was the will of heaven that he should retain ay and love to the very last and so reducing them all to the level of sentiments  follow your instinctsbut what if our instincts lead us to eat animal food  then you must follow the instincts of me percy bysshe shelley  i think it horrible cruel it offends my taste  what if our instincts lead us to tyrannise over our fellowmen  then you must repress those instincts  i shelley think that too horrible and cruel  whether it be vegetarianism or liberty the rule is practically the samesentiment which in his case as in the case of all sentimentalists turns out to mean at last not the sentiments of mankind in general but the private sentiments of the writer  this is shelley a sentimentalist pure and simple incapable of anything like inductive reasoning unable to take cognisance of any facts but those which please his taste or to draw any conclusion from them but such as also pleases his taste as for example in that eighth stanza of the ode to liberty which had it been written by any other man but shelley possessing the same knowledge as he one would have called a wicked and deliberate liebut in his case is to be simply passed over with a sigh like a young ladys proofs of tableturning and rapping spirits  she wished to see it soand therefore so she saw it  for shelleys nature is utterly womanish  not merely his weak points but his strong ones are those of a woman  tender and pitiful as a woman and yet when angry shrieking railing hysterical as a woman  the physical distaste for meat and fermented liquors coupled with the hankering after physical horrors are especially feminine  the nature of a woman looks out of that wild beautiful girlish facethe nature  but not the spirit not   the reason firm the temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill   the lawlessness of the man with the sensibility of the woman    alas for him  he too might have discovered what byron did for were not his errors avenged upon him within more terribly even than without  his cries are like the wails of a child inarticulate peevish irrational and yet his pain fills his whole being blackens the very face of nature to him  but he will not confess himself in the wrong  once only if we recollect rightly the truth flashes across him for a moment and the clouds of selfish sorrow   alas i have nor hope nor health    nor peace within nor calm around nor that content surpassing wealth    the sage in meditation found and walked with inward glory crowned   noralas for the spiritual bathos which follows that short gleam of healthy feeling and coming to himself      fame nor power nor love nor leisure    others i see whom these surround    smiling they live and call life pleasure to me that cup has been dealt in another measure   poor shelley  as if the peace within and the calm around and the content surpassing wealth were things which were to be put in the same category with fame and power and love and leisure  as if they were things which could be dealt to any man instead of depending as byron who amid all his fearful sins was a man knew well enough upon a mans self a mans own will and that will exerted to do a will exterior to itself to know and to obey a law but no the cloud of sentiment must close over again and   yet now despair itself is mild    even as the winds and waters are i could lie down like a tired child    and weep away this life of care which i have borne and still must bear    till death like sleep might seize on me and i might feel in the warm air    my cheek grow cold and hear the sea breathe oer my dying brain its last monotony   too beautiful to laugh at however empty and sentimental  true  but why beautiful  because there is a certain sincerity in it which breeds coherence and melody which in short makes it poetry  but what if such a tone of mind be consciously encouraged even insincerely affected as the ideal state for a poets mind as his followers have done  the mischief which such a man would do is conceivable enough  he stands out both by his excellences and his defects as the spokesman and ideal of all the unrest and unhealth of sensitive young men for many a year after  his unfulfilled prophecies only help to increase that unrest  who shall blame either him for uttering those prophecies or them for longing for their fulfilment  must we not thank the man who gives us fresh hope that this earth will not be always as it is now  his notion of what it will be may be as shelleys was vague even in some things wrong and undesirable still we must accept his hope and faith in the spirit not in the letter  so have thousands of young men felt who would have shrunk with disgust from some of poor shelleys details of the good time coming  and shame on him who should wish to rob them of such a hope even if it interfered with his favourite scheme of unfulfilled prophecy  so men have felt shelleys spell a wondrous oneperhaps they think a lifegiving regenerative one  and yet what dream at once more shallow and more impossible  get rid of kings and priests marriage may stay pending discussions on the rights of women  let the poet speakwhat he is to say being of course a matter of utterly secondary import provided only that he be a poet and then the millennium will appear of itself and the devil be exorcised with a kiss from all heartsexcept of course these of pale priests and tyrants with their sneer of cold command who it seems have not been got rid of after all and the cossacks and croats whom they may choose to call to their rescue  and on the appearance of the said cossacks and croats the poets vision stops short and all is blank beyond  a recipe for the production of millenniums which has this one advantage that it is small enough to be comprehended by the very smallest minds and reproduced thereby with a difference in such spasmodic melodies as seem to those small minds to be imitations of shelleys nightingale notes  for nightingale notes they truly are  in spite of all his faults and there are few poetic faults in which he does not indulge to their very highest powerin spite of his interfluous and innumerous and the rest of his bad englishin spite of bombast horrors maundering sheer stuff and nonsense of all kinds there is a plaintive natural melody about this man such as no other english poet has ever uttered except shakespeare in some few immortal songs who that has read shelley does not recollect scraps worthy to stand by ariels songchaste simple unutterably musical  yes when he will be himselfshelley the scholar and the gentleman and the singerand leave philosophy and politics which he does not understand and shriekings and cursings which are unfit for any civilised and selfrespecting man he is perfect  like the american mockingbird he is harsh only when aping other mens tuneshis true power lies in his own native woodnotes wild  but it is not this faculty of his which has been imitated by his scholars for it is not this faculty which made him their ideal however it may have attracted them  all which sensible men deplore in him is that which poetasters have exalted in him  his morbidity and his doubt have become in their eyes his differential energy because too often it was all in him with which they had wit to sympathise  they found it easy to curse and complain instead of helping to mend  so had he  they found it pleasant to confound institutions with the abuses which defaced them  so had he  they found it pleasant to give way to their spleen  so had he  they found it pleasant to believe that the poet was to regenerate the world without having settled with what he was to regenerate it  so had he  they found it more pleasant to obey sentiment than inductive laws  so had he  they found it more pleasant to hurl about enormous words and startling figures than to examine reverently the awful depths of beauty which lie in the simplest words and the severest figures  so had he  and thus arose a spasmodic vague extravagant effeminate school of poetry which has been too often hastily and unfairly fathered upon byron  doubtless byron has helped to its formation but only in as far as his poems possess or rather seem to possess elements in common with shelleys  for that conscious struggle against law by which law is discovered may easily enough be confounded with the utter repudiation of it  both forms of mind will discuss the same questions both will discuss them freely with a certain plainness and daring which may range through all grades from the bluntness of socrates down to reckless immodesty and profaneness  the world will hardly distinguish between the two it did not in socrates case mistaking his reverent irreverence for atheism and martyred him accordingly as it has since martyred luthers memory  probably too if a living struggle is going on in the writers mind he will not have distinguished the two elements in himself he will be profane when he fancies himself only arguing for truth he will be only arguing for truth where he seems to the respectable undoubting to be profane  and in the meanwhile whether the respectable understand him or not the young and the inquiring much more the distempered who would be glad to throw off moral law will sympathise with him often more than he sympathises with himself words thrown off in the heat of passion shameful selfrevealings which he has written with his very hearts blood  ay even fallacies which he has put into the mouths of dramatic characters for the very purpose of refuting them or at least of calling on all who read to help him to refute them and to deliver him from the ugly dreamall these will by the lazy the frivolous the feverish the discontented be taken for integral parts and noble traits of the man to whom they are attracted by finding that he too has the same doubts and struggles as themselves that he has a voice and art to be their spokesman  and hence arises confusion on confusion misconception on misconception  the man is honoured for his dishonour  chronic disease is taken for a new type of health and byron is admired and imitated for that which byron is trying to tear out of his own heart and trample under foot as his curse and bane something which is not byrons self but byrons housefiend and tyrant and shame  and in the meanwhile that which calls itself respectability and orthodoxy and isunless augustine liedneither of them stands by and instead of echoing the voice of him who said come to me ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest mumbles proudly to itself with the pharisees of old  this people which knoweth not the law is accursed  we do not seek to excuse byron any more than we do shelley  they both sinned  they both paid bitter penalty for their sin  how far they were guilty or which of them was the more guilty we know not we can judge no man  it is as poets and teachers not as men and responsible spirits not in their inward beings known only to him who made them not even to themselves but in their outward utterance that we have a right to compare them  both have done harm  neither have we firmly believe harmed any human being who had not already the harm within himself  it is not by introducing evil but by calling into consciousness and more active life evil which was already lurking in the heart that any writer makes men worse  thousands doubtless have read byron and shelley and worse books and have risen from them as pure as when they sat down  in evil as well as in good the eye only sees that which it brings with it the power of seeingsay rather the wish to see  but it is because in spite of all our selfglorifying paeans our taste has become worse and not better that shelley the man who conceitedly despises and denies law is taking the place of byron the man who only struggles against it and who shows his honesty and his greatness most by confessing that his struggles are ineffectual that titan as he may look to the world his strength is misdirected a mere furious weakness which proclaims him a slave in fetters while prurient young gentlemen are fancying him heaping hills on hills and scaling olympus itself  they are tired of that notion however now  they have begun to suspect that byron did not scale olympus after all  how much more pleasant a leader then must shelley be who unquestionably did scale his little olympushaving made it himself first to fit his own stature  the man who has built the hayrick will doubtless climb it again if need be as often as desired and whistle on the top after the fashion of the rick building guild triumphantly enough  for after all shelleys range of vision is very narrow his subjects few his reflections still fewer when compared not only with such a poet as spenser but with his own contemporaries above all with byron  he has a deep heart but not a wide one an intense eye but not a catholic one  and therefore he never wrote a real drama for in spite of all that has been said to the contrary beatrice cenci is really none other than percy bysshe shelley himself in petticoats  but we will let them both be  perhaps they know better now  one very ugly superstition nevertheless we must mention of which these two men have been in england at least the great hierophants namely the right of genius to be eccentric  doubtless there are excuses for such a notion but it is one against which every wise man must set his face like a flint and at the risk of being called a philister and a flunky take part boldly with respectability and this wicked world and declare them to be for once utterly in the right  still there are excuses for it  a poet especially one who wishes to be not merely a describer of pretty things but a vates and seer of new truth must often say things which other people do not like to say and do things which others do not like to do  and moreover he will be generally gifted for the very purpose of enabling him to say and do these strange things with a sensibility more delicate than common often painful enough to himself  how easy for such a man to think that he has a right not to be as other men are to despise little conventionalities courtesies even decencies to offend boldly and carelessly conscious that he has something right and valuable within himself which not only atones for such defects but allows him to indulge in them as badges of his own superiority  this has been the notion of artistic genius which has spread among us of late years just in proportion as the real amount of artistic genius has diminished till we see men on the mere ground of being literary men too refined to keep accounts or pay their butchers bills affecting the pettiest absurdities in dress in manner in food giving themselves credit for being unable to bear a noise keep their temper educate their own children associate with their fellowmen and a thousand other paltry weaknesses morosenesses selfindulgences fastidiousnesses vulgaritiesfor all this is essentially vulgar and demands not honour and sympathy but a chapter in mr thackerays book of snobs  non sic itur ad astra  selfindulgence and exclusiveness can only be a proof of weakness  it may accompany talent but it proves that talent to be partial and defective  the brain may be large but the manhood the virtus is small where such things are allowed much more where they are gloried in  a poet such a man may be but a world poet never  he is sectarian a poetical quaker a puritan who forgetting that the truth which he possesses is equally the right and inheritance of every man he meets takes up a peculiar dress or phraseology as symbols of his fancied difference from his human brothers  all great poets till shelley and byron as far as we can discern have been men especially free from eccentricities careful not merely of the chivalries and the respectabilities but also of the courtesies and the petty conventionalities of the age in which they lived altogether wellbred men of the world  the answer that they learnt the ways of courts does not avail for if they had had no innate goodbreeding reticence respect for forms and customs they would never have come near courts at all  it is not a question of rank and fashion but of good feeling common sense unselfishness  goethe milton spenser shakespeare rabelais ariosto were none of them highborn men several of them lowborn who only rose to the society of highhorn men because they were themselves innately highbred polished complete without exaggerations affectations deformities weaknesses of mind and taste whatever may have been their weaknesses on certain points of morals  the man of all men most bepraised by the present generation of poets is perhaps wolfgang von goethe  why is it then that of all men he is the one whom they strive to be most unlike  and if this be good counsel for the man who merely wishesand no blame to himto sing about beautiful things in a beautiful way it applies with tenfold force to the poet who desires honestly to proclaim great truths  if he has to offend the prejudices of the world in important things that is all the more reason for his bowing to those prejudices in little things and being content to be like his neighbours in outward matters in order that he may make them like himself in inward ones  shall such a man dare to hinder his own message to drive away the very hearers to whom he believes himself to be sent for the sake of his own nerves laziness antipathies much more of his own vanity and pride  if he does so he is unfaithful to that very genius on which he prides himself  he denies its divinity by treating it as his own possession to be displayed or hidden as he chooses for his own enjoyment his own self glorification  well for such a man if a day comes to him in which he will look back with shame and selfreproach not merely on every scandal which he may have caused by breaking the moral and social laws of humanity by neglecting to restrain his appetites pay his bills and keep his engagements but also on every conceited word and look every gaucherie and rudeness every selfindulgent moroseness and fastidiousness as sins against the sacred charge which has been committed to him and determine with that jew of old who to judge from his letter to philemon was one of the most perfect gentlemen of gods making who ever walked this earth to become all things to all men if by any means he may save some    alexander smith and alexander pope    on reading this little book 61 and considering all the exaggerated praise and exaggerated blame which have been lavished on it we could not help falling into many thoughts about the history of english poetry for the last forty years and about its future destiny  great poets even true poets are becoming more and more rare among us there are those even who say that we have none an assertion which as long as mr tennyson lives we shall take the liberty of denying but were he which heaven forbid taken from us whom have we to succeed him  and he too is rather a poet of the sunset than of the dawnof the autumn than of the spring  his gorgeousness is that of the solemn and fading year not of its youth full of hope freshness gay and unconscious life  like some stately hollyhock or dahlia of this months gardens he endures while all other flowers are dying but all around is wintera mild one perhaps wherein a few annuals or pretty field weeds still linger on but like all mild winters especially prolific in fungi which too are not without their gaudiness even their beauty although bred only from the decay of higher organisms the plagiarists of the vegetable world  such is poetry in england while in america the case is not much better what more enormous scope for new poetic thought than that which the new world gives  yet the american poets even the best of them look lingeringly and longingly back to europe and her legends to her models and not to the best of themto her criticism and not to the best of thatand bestow but a very small portion of such genius as they have on america and her new forms of life  if they be nearer to the spring than we they are still deep enough in the winter  a few early flowers may be budding among them but the autumn crop is still in somewhat shabby and rainbedrabbled bloom  and for us where are our spring flowers  what sign of a new poetic school  still more what sign of the healthy resuscitation of any old one  what matter after all one says to oneself in despair reechoing mr carlyle  man was not sent into the world to write poetry  what we want is truth  of the former we have enough in all conscience just now  let the latter need be provided for by honest and righteous history and as for poets let the dead bury their dead and yet after all man will write poetry in spite of mr carlyle nay beings who are not men but mere forked radishes will write it man is a poetrywriting animal  perhaps he was meant to be one  at all events he can no more be kept from it than from eating  it is better with mr carlyles leave to believe that the existence of poetry indicates some universal human hunger whether after the beautiful or after fame or after the means of paying butchers bills and accepting it as a necessary evil which must be committed to see that it be committed as well or at least as little ill as possible  in excuse of which we may quote mr carlyle against himself reminding him of a saying of goethe once bepraised by him in print  we must take care of the beautiful for the useful will take care of itself  and never certainly since pope wrote his dunciad did the beautiful require more taking care of or evince less capacity for taking care of itself and never we must add was less capacity for taking care of it evinced by its accredited guardians of the press than at this present time if the reception given to mr smiths poems is to be taken as a fair expression of the public taste  now let it be fairly understood mr alexander smith is not the object of our reproaches  but mr alexander smiths models and flatterers  against him we have nothing whatsoever to say for him very much indeed  very young as is said selfeducated drudging for his daily bread in some dreary glasgow prisonhouse of brick and mortar he has seen the sky the sun and moonand moreover the sea report says for one day in his whole life and this is nearly the whole of his experience in natural objects  and he has felt too painfully for his peace of mind the contrast between his environment and that of othershis means of culture and that of othersand still more painfully the contrast between his environment and culture and that sense of beauty and power of melody which he does not deny that he has found in himself and which no one can deny who reads his poems fairly who reads even merely the opening page and keynote of the whole   for as a torrid sunset burns with gold up to the zenith fierce within my soul a passion burns from basement unto cope poesy poesy id give to thee as passionately my rich laden years my bubble pleasures and my awful joys as hero gave her trembling sighs to find delicious death on wet leanders lip bare bald and tawdry as a fingered moth is my poor life but with one smile thou canst clothe me with kingdoms  wilt thou smile on me wilt bid me die for thee  oh fair and cold as well may some wild maiden waste her love upon the calm front of a marble jove   now this scrap is by no menus a fair average specimen of mr smiths verse  but is not the selfeducated man who could teach himself amid glasgow smoke and noise to write such a distich as that exquisite one which we have given in italics to be judged lovingly and hopefully  what if he has often copied  what if in this very scrap chosen almost at random there should be a touch from tennysons two voices  and what if imitations nay caricatures be found in almost every page  is not the explanation simple enough and rather creditable than discreditable to mr smith  he takes as his models shelley keats and their followers  who is to blame for that  the glasgow youth or the public taste which has been exalting these authors more and more for the last twenty years as the great poets of the nineteenth century  if they are the proper ideals of the day who will blame him for following them as closely as possiblefor saturating his memory so thoroughly with their words and thoughts that he reproduces them unconsciously to himself  who will blame him for even consciously copying their images if they have said better than he the thing which he wants to say in the only poetical dialect which he knows  he does no more than all schools have done copy their own masters as the greek epicists and virgil copied homer as all succeeding latin epicists copied virgil as italians copied ariosto and tasso as every one who can copies shakespeare as the french school copied or thought they copied the classics and as a matter of duty used to justify any bold image in their notes not by its originality but by its being already in claudian or lucan or virgil or ovid as every poetaster and a great many who were more than poetasters twenty years ago used to copy scott and byron and as all poetasters now are copying the very same models as mr smith and failing while he succeeds  we by no means agree in the modern outcry for originality  is it absolutely demanded that no poet shall say anything whatsoever that any other poet has said  if so mr smith may well submit to a blame which he will bear in common with shakespeare chaucer pope and many another great name and especially with raphael himself who made no scruple of adopting not merely points of style but single motives and incidents from contemporaries and predecessors  who can look at any of his earlier pictures the crucifixion for instance at present in lord wards gallery at the egyptian hall without seeing that he has not merely felt the influence of perugino but copied him tried deliberately to be as like his master as he could  was this plagiarism  if so all education it would seem must be a mere training in plagiarism  for how is the student to learn except by copying his masters models  is the young painter or sculptor a plagiarist because he spends the first often the best years of his life in copying greek statues or the schoolboy for toiling at the reproduction of latin metres and images in what are honestly and fittingly called copies of verses  and what if the young artist shall choose as mr smith has done to put a few drawings into the exhibition or to carve and sell a few statuettes  what if the schoolboy grown into a gownsman shall contribute his share to a set of arundines cami or prolusiones etonienses  will any one who really knows what art or education means complain of them for having imitated their models however servilely  will he not rather hail such an imitation as a fair proof first of the students reverence for authoritya more important element of genius than most young folks fancyand next of his possessing any artistic power whatsoever  for surely if the greater contains the less the power of creating must contain that of imitating  a young authors power of accurate imitation is after all the primary and indispensable test of his having even the capability of becoming a poet  he who cannot write in a style which he does know will certainly not be able to invent a new style for himself  the first and simplest form in which any metrical ear or fancy or imagination can show itself must needs be in imitating existing models  innate good tastethat is true poetic geniuswill of course choose the best models in the long run  but not necessarily at first  what shall be the students earliest ideal must needs be determined for him by circumstance by the books to which he has access by the public opinion which he hears expressed  enough if he chooses as raphael did the best models which he knows and tries to exhaust them and learn all he can from them ready to quit them hereafter when he comes across better ones yet without throwing away what he has learnt  be faithful in a few things and thou shalt become ruler over many things is one of those eternal moral laws which like many others holds as true of art as it does of virtue  and on the whole judging mr alexander smith by this rule he has been faithful over a few things and therefore we have fair hope of him for the future  for mr smith does succeed not in copying one poet but in copying all and very often in improving on his models of the many conceits which he has borrowed from mr bailey there is hardly one which he has not made more true more pointed and more sweet nay in one or two places he has dared to mend john keats himself  but his whole merit is by no means confined to the faculty of imitation  though the life drama itself is the merest cento of reflections and images without coherence or organisation dramatic or logical yet single scenes like that with the peasant and that with the fallen outcast have firm selfconsistency and clearness of conception and these as a natural consequence are comparatively free from those tawdry spangles which deface the greater part of the poem  and moreover in the episode of the indian and the lady there is throughout a keeping in the tone as painters say sultry and languid yet rich and full of life like a gorgeous venetian picture which augurs even better for mr smiths future success than the two scenes just mentioned for consistency of thought may come with time and training but clearness of inward vision the faculty of imagination can be no more learnt than it can be dispensed with in this and this only it is true that poeta nascitur non fit just as no musical learning or practice can make a composer unless he first possess an innate ear for harmony and melody  and it must be said that it is just in the passages where mr smith is not copying where he forgets for awhile shelley keats and the rest and is content to be simply himself that he is best terse vivid sound manly simple  may he turn round some day and deliberately pulling out all borrowed feathers look at himself honestly and boldly in the glass and we will warrant him on the strength of the least gaudy and as yet unpraised passages in his poems that he will find himself after all more eagle than daw and quite well plumed enough by nature to fly at a higher because for him a more natural pitch than he has yet done  true he has written a great deal of nonsense nonsense in matter as well as in manner  but therein too he has only followed the reigning school  as for manner he does sometimes in imitating his models outherod herod  but why not  if herod be a worthy king let him be by all means outheroded if any man can do it  one cannot have too much of a good thing  if it be right to bedizen verses with metaphors and similes which have no reference either in tone or in subject to the matter in hand let there be as many of them as possible  if a saddle is a proper place for jewels then let the seat be paved with diamonds and emeralds and runjeet singhs harnessmaker be considered as a lofty artist for whose barbaric splendour mr peat and his melton customers are to forswear pigskin and severe simplicitynot to say utility and comfort  if poetic diction be different in species from plain english then let us have it as poetical as possible and as unlike english as ungrammatical abrupt involved transposed as the clumsiness carelessness or caprice of man can make it  if it be correct to express human thought by writing whole pages of vague and bald abstract metaphysic and then trying to explain them by concrete concetti which bear an entirely accidental and mystical likeness to the notion which they are to illustrate then let the metaphysic be as abstract as possible the concetti as fanciful and farfetched as possible  if marino and cowley be greater poets than ariosto and milton let young poets imitate the former with might and main and avoid spoiling their style by any perusal of the toointelligible common sense of the latter  if byrons moral which used to be thought execrable be really his great excellence and his style which used to be thought almost perfect unworthy of this age of progress then let us have his moral without his style his matter without his form orthat we may be sure of never falling for a moment into his besetting sins of terseness grace and completenesswithout any form at all  if poetry in order to be worthy of the nineteenth century ought to be as unlike as possible to homer or sophocles virgil or horace shakespeare or spenser dante or tasso let those tooidolised names be erased henceforth from the calendar let the ars poetica be consigned to flames and martinus scribleruss art of sinking placed forthwith on the list of the committee of council for education that not a working man in england may he ignorant that whatsoever superstitions about art may have haunted the benighted heathens who built the parthenon nous avons change tout cela  in one word if it be best and most fitting to write poetry in the style in which almost every one has been trying to write it since pope and plain sense went out and shelley and the seventh heaven came in let it be so written and let him who most perfectly so sets the age to music he presented by the assembled guild of critics not with the obsolete and too classic laurel but with an electroplated brass medal bearing the due inscription ars est nescire artem  and when in twelve months time he finds himself forgotten perhaps decried for the sake of the next aspirant let him reconsider himself try whether after all the common sense of the many will not prove a juster and a firmer standingground than the sentimentality and bad taste of the few and read alexander pope  in popes writings whatsoever he may not find he will find the very excellences after which our young poets strive in vain produced by their seeming opposites which are now despised and discarded naturalness produced by studious art sublimity by strict self restraint depth by clear simplicity pathos by easy grace and a morality infinitely more merciful as well as more righteous than the one now in vogue among the poetasters by honest faith in god if he be shocked by certain peculiarities of diction and by the fondness for perpetual antitheses let him remember that what seems strange to our day was natural and habitual in popes and that in the eyes of our grandchildren keatss and shelleys peculiarities will seem as monstrous as popes or johnsons do in ours  but if misled by the popular contempt for pope be should he inclined to answer this advice with a shrug and a smile we entreat him and all young poets to consider line by line word by word sound by sound only those once wellknown lines which many a brave and wise man of fifty years ago would have been unable to read without honourable tears   in the worst inns worst room with mat halfhung the floor of plaster and the walls of dung on once a flockbed but repaired with straw with tapetied curtains never meant to draw the george and garter dangling from that bed where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red great villiers lies  alas how changed from him that life of pleasure and that soul of whim gallant and gay in clivedens proud alcove the bower of wanton shrewsbury and love or just as gay at council in a ring of mimic statesmen and their merry king no wit to flatter left of all his store no fool to laugh at which he valued more there victor of his health of fortune friends and fame this lord of useless thousands ends   yes pope knew as well as wordsworth and our naturalisti that no physical fact was so mean or coarse as to be below the dignity of poetrywhen in its right place  he could draw a pathos and sublimity out of the dirty inn chamber such as wordsworth never elicited from tubs and daffodilsbecause he could use them according to the rules of art which are the rules of sound reason and of true taste  the answer to all this is ready nowadays  we are told that pope could easily be great in what he attempted because he never attempted any but small matters easily selfrestraining because his paces were naturally so slow above all easily clear because he is always shallow easily full of faith in what he did believe because he believed so very little  on the two former counts we may have something to say hereafter  on the two latter we will say at once that if it be argued as it often is that the reason of our modern poetical obscurity and vagueness lies in the greater depth of the questions which are now agitating thoughtful minds we do utterly deny it  human nature human temptations human problems are radically the same in every age by whatsoever outward difference of words they may seem distinguished  where is deeper philosophic thought true or false expressed in verse than in dante or in spensers two cantos of mutabilities  yet if they are difficult to understand their darkness is that of the deep blue sea  vague they never are obscure they never are because they see clearly what they want to say and how to say it  there is always a sound and coherent meaning in them to be found if it be searched for  the real cause of this modern vagueness is rather to be found in shallow and unsound culture and in that inability or carelessness about seeing any object clearly which besets our poets just now as the cause of antique clearness lies in the nobler and healthier manhood in the severer and more methodic habits of thought the sounder philosophic and critical training which enabled spenser and milton to draw up a state paper or to discourse deep metaphysics with the same manful possession of their subject which gives grace and completeness to the penseroso or the epithalamion  and if our poets have their doubts they should remember that those to whom doubt and inquiry are real and stern are not inclined to sing about them till they can sing poems of triumph over them  there has no temptation taken our modern poets save that which is common to man the temptation of wishing to make the laws of the universe and of art fit them as they do not feel inclined to make themselves fit the laws or care to find them out  what  do you wish asks some one a little contemptuously to measure the great growing nineteenth century by the thumbrule of alexander pope  no  but to measure the men who write in the nineteenth century by a man who wrote in the eighteenth to compare their advantages with his their circumstances with his  and then if possible to make them ashamed of their unmanliness  have you young poets of this day your struggles your chagrins  do you think the humpbacked dwarf every moment conscious at once of his deformity and his geniusconscious probably of far worse physical shame than any deformity can bring sewed up in buckram every morning and requiring a nurse like a childcaricatured lampooned slandered utterly without fault of his owninsulted and rejected by the fine lady whom he had dared to court in reality after being allowed and allured to flirt with her in rhymedo you suppose that this man had nothing to madden himto convert him into a sneering snarling misanthrope  yet was there one noble soul who met him who did not love him or whom he did not love  have you your doubts  do you find it difficult to make your own speculations even your own honest convictions square with the popular superstitions  what were your doubts your inward contradictions to those of a man who bred a papist and yet burning with the most intense scorn and hatred of lies and shams bigotries and priestcrafts could write that essay on man  read that young gentlemen of the jobswife school who fancy it a fine thing to tell your readers to curse god and die or at least to show the world in print how you could curse god by divine right of genius if you chose and be ashamed of your cowardly wailings  alexander pope went through doubt contradiction confusion to which yours are simple and light and conquered  he was a man of like passions with yourselves infected with the peculiar vices of his day narrow for his age was narrow shallow for his age was shallow a bonvivant for his age was a gluttonous and drunken one bitter furious and personal for men round him were such foul mouthed often and indecent as the rest were  nay his very power when he abuses it for his own ends of selfish spite and injured vanity makes him as all great men can be in words at least for in life he was far better than the men around him worse than his age he can outrival dennis in ferocity and congreve in filth  so much the worse for him in that account which he has long ago rendered up but in all times and places as far as we can judge the man was heartwhole more and not less righteous than his fellows  with his whole soul he hates what is evil as far as he can recognise it with his whole soul he loves what is good as far as he can recognise that  with his soul believes that there is a righteous and good god whose order no human folly or crime can destroy and he will say so and does say it clearly simply valiantly reverently in his essay on man  his theodicy is narrow shallow as was the philosophy of his age  but as far as it goes it is soundfaithful to god and to what he sees and knows  man is made in gods image mans justice is gods justice mans mercy is gods mercy mans science mans critic taste are insights into the laws of god himself  he does not pretend to solve the great problem  but he believes that it is solved from all eternity that god knows god loves and god rules that the righteous and faithful man may know enough of the solution to know his duty to see his way to justify god and as much as he knows he tells  there were in that diseased sensitive cripple no vain repinings no moonstruck howls no impious cries against god  why hast thou made me thus  to him god is a righteous god a god of order  science philosophy politics criticism poetry are parts of his orderthey are parts of the appointed onward path for mankind there are eternal laws for them there is a beautiful and fit order in poetry which is part of gods order which men have learnt ages ago for they too had their teaching from above to offend against which is absolutely wrong an offence to be put down mildly in those who offend ignorantly but those who offend from dulness from the incapacity to see the beautiful or from carelessness about it when praise or gain tempts them the other way have some moral defect in them they are what solomon calls fools  they are the enemies of man and he will hate them right sore even as though they were his own enemieswhich indeed they were  he knows by painful experience that they deserve no quarter that there is no use giving them any to spare them is to make them insolent to fondle the reptile is to be bitten by it true poetry as the messenger of heavenly beauty is decaying true refinement true loftiness of thought even true morality are at stake  and so he writes his dunciad  and would that he were here to write it over again and write it better  for write it again he surely would  and write it better he would also  with the greater cleanliness of our time with all the additional experience of history with the greater classical aesthetic and theological knowledge of our day the sins of our poets are as much less excusable than those of eusden blackmore cibber and the rest as popes dunciad on them would be more righteously severe  what for instance would the author of the essay on man say to anyone who now wrote p 137 for it really is not to be quoted of the life drama as the thoughts of his hero without any after atonement for the wanton insult it conveys toward him whom he dares in the same breath to call father simply because he wants to be something very fine and famous and selfglorifying and providence keeps him waiting awhile  has pope not said it already   persist by all divine in man unawed but learn ye dunces not to scorn your god   and yet no the gentle goddess would now lay no such restriction on her children for in popes day no man had discovered the new poetic plan for making the divine in man an excuse for scorning god and finding in the dignity of heavenborn genius free licence to upbraid on the very slightest grounds the being from whom the said genius pretends to derive his dignity  in one of his immortal saws he has cautioned us against making god in mans image  but it never entered into his simple head that man would complain of god for being made in a lower image than even his own  atheism he could conceive of the deeper absurdity of authotheism was left for our more enlightened times and more spiritual muses  it will be answered that all this blasphemy is not to be attributed to the author but to the man whose spiritual development he intends to sketch  to which we reply that no man has a right to bring his hero through such a state without showing how he came out of the slough as carefully as how he came into it especially when the said hero is set forth as a marvellously clever person and the last scene though full of beautiful womanly touches and of a higher morality than the rest of the book contains no amende honorable not even an explanation of the abominable stuff which the hero has been talking a few pages back  he leaps from the abyss to the seventh heaven but unfortunately for the spectators he leaps behind the scenes and they are none the wiser  and next people have no more right even for dramatic purposes to put such language into print for any purpose whatsoever than they have to print the grossest indecencies or the most disgusting details of torture and cruelty no one can accuse this magazine of any fondness for sanctimonious cant or lipreverence but if there be a father in heaven as mr smith confesses that there is or even merely a personal deity at all some sort of common decency in speaking of him should surely be preserved  no one would print pages of silly calumny and vulgar insult against his earthly father or even against a person for whom he had no special dislike and then excuse it by of course i dont think so  but if anyone did think so this would be a very smart way of saying what he thought  old aristotle would call such an act banausonin plain english blackguard and we do not see how it can be called anything else unless in the case of some utter brute in human form to whom there is no coenum and therefore no obscoenum no fanum and therefore no profanum  the common sense of mankind in all ages has condemned this sort of shamelessness even more than it has insults to parental and social ties and to all which raises man above the brute  let mr smith take note of this and let him if he loves himself mend speedily for of all styles wherein to become stereotyped the one which he has chosen is the worst because in it the greatest amount of insincerity is possible there is a tartarus in front of him as well as an olympus a hideous possibility very near him of insincere impiety merely for the purpose of startling of lawless fancy merely for the purpose of glittering and a still more hideous possibility of a revulsion to insincere cant combined with the same lawless fancy for the purpose of keeping well with the public in which to all appearances one of our most popular novelists not to mention the poet whose writings are most analogous to mr smiths now lies wallowing  whether he shall hereafter obey his evil angel and follow him or his good angel and become a great poet depends upon himself and above all upon his having courage to be himself and to forget himself two virtues which paradoxical as it may seem are correlatives  for the subjective poetin plain words the egotistis always comparing himself with every man he meets and therefore momentarily tempted to steal bits of their finery wherewith to patch his own rents while the man who is content to be simply what god has made him goes on from strength to strength developing almost unconsciously under a divine education by which his real personality and the salient points by which he is distinguished from his fellows become apparent with more and more distinctness of form and brilliance of light and shadow as those well know who have watched human character attain its clearest and grandest as well as its loveliest outlines not among hankerers after fame and power but on lonely sickbeds and during long unknown martyrdoms of humble selfsacrifice and loving drudgery  but whether or not mr smith shall purify himselfand he can do so if he will right noblythe world must be purified of his style of poetry if men are ever as he hopes to set his age to music much more if they are once more to stir the hearts of the many by tyrtaean strains such as may be needed before our hairs are gray  the poetry of doubt however pretty would stand us in little stead if we were threatened with a second armada  it will conduce little to the valour virtus manhood of any englishman to be informed by any poet even in the most melodious verse illustrated by the most startling and pan cosmic metaphors  see what a highlyorganised and peculiar stomachache i have had  does it not prove indisputably that i am not as other men are  what gospel there can be in such a message to any honest man who has either to till the earth plan a railroad colonise australia or fight his countrys enemies is hard to discover  hard indeed to discover how this most practical and therefore most poetical of ages is to be set to music when all those who talk about so doing persist obstinately in poring with introverted eyes over the state of their own digestionor creed  what man wants what art wants perhaps what the maker of them both wants is a poet who shall begin by confessing that he is as other men are and sing about things which concern all men in language which all men can understand  this is the only road to that gift of prophecy which most young poets are nowadays in such a hurry to arrogate to themselves  we can only tell what man will be by fair induction by knowing what he is what he has been  and it is most noteworthy that in this age in which there is more knowledge than there ever was of what man has been and more knowledge through innumerable novelists and those most subtle and finished ones of what man is that poetry should so carefully avoid drawing from this fresh stock of information in her soconfident horoscopes of what man will be  there is just now as wide a divorce between poetry and the common sense of all time as there is between poetry and modern knowledge our poets are not merely vague and confused they are altogether fragmentarydisjecta membra poetarum they need some uniting idea and what idea  our answer will probably be greeted with a laugh  nevertheless we answer simply what our poets want is faith  there is little or no faith nowadays  and without faith there can be no real art for art is the outward expression of firm coherent belief  and a poetry of doubt even a sceptical poetry in its true sense can never possess clear and sound form even organic form at all  how can you put into form that thought which is by its very nature formless  how can you group words round a central idea when you do not possess a central idea  shakespeare in his one sceptic tragedy has to desert the pure tragic form and hamlet remains the beauideal of the poetry of doubt  but what would a tragedy be in which the actors were all hamlets or rather scraps of hamlets  a drama of hamlet is only possible because the one sceptic is surrounded by characters who have some positive faith who do their work for good or evil undoubtingly while he is speculating about his and both ophelia and laertes fortinbras the king yea the very gravedigger know well enough what they want whether hamlet does or not  the whole play is in fact shakespeares subtle reductio ad absurdum of that very diseased type of mind which has been for the last forty years identified with geniuswith one difference namely that shakespeare with his usual clearness of conception exhibits the said intellectual type pure and simple while modern poets degrade and confuse it and all the questions dependent on it by mixing it up unnecessarily with all manner of moral weaknesses and very often moral crimes  but the poet is to have a faith nowadays of coursea faith in nature  this article of wordsworths poetical creed is to be assumed as the only necessary one and we are to ignore altogether the somewhat important fact that he had faith in a great deal besides nature and to make that faith in nature his sole differentia and source of inspiration  now we beg leave to express not merely our want of faith in this same faith in nature but even our ignorance of what it means  nature is certain phenomena appearances  faith in them is simply to believe that a red thing is red and a square thing square a sine qua non doubtless in poetry as in carpentry but which will produce no poetry but only dutch painting and gardeners cataloguesin a word that lowest form of art the merely descriptive and into this very style the modern naturalist poets from the times of southey and wordsworth have been continually falling and falling therefore into baldness and vulgarity  for mere description cannot represent even the outlines of a whole scene at once as the daguerreotype does they must describe it piecemeal much less can it represent that whole scene at once in all its glories of colour glow fragrance life motion  in short it cannot give life and spirit  all merely descriptive poetry can do is to give a dead catalogueto kill the butterfly and then write a monograph on it  and therefore there comes a natural revulsion from the baldness and puerility into which wordsworth too often fell by indulging his false theories on these matters  but a revulsion to what  to the laws of course which underlie the phenomena  but againto which laws  not merely to the physical ones else turners chemistry and watsons practice of medicine are great poems  true we have heard professor forbess book on glaciers called an epic poem and not without reason  but what gives that noble book its epic character is neither the glaciers nor the laws of them but the discovery of those laws  the methodic truthful valiant patient battle between man and nature his final victory his wresting from her the secret which had been locked for ages in the icecaves of the alps guarded by cold and fatigue danger and superstitious dread  for nature will be permanently interesting to the poet and appear to him in a truly poetic aspect only in as far as she is connected by him with spiritual and personal beings and becomes in his eyes either a person herself or the dwelling and organ of persons  the shortest scrap of wordpainting as thomsons seasons will sufficiently prove is wearisome and dead unless there be a living figure in the landscape or unless failing a living figure the scene is deliberately described with reference to the poet or the reader not as something in itself but as something seen by him and grouped and subordinated exactly as it would strike his eye and mind  but even this is insufficient  the heart of man demands more and so arises a craving after the old naturemythology of greece the old fairy legends of the middle age  the great poets of the renaissance both in england and in italy had a similar craving  but the aspect under which these ancient dreams are regarded by them is most significantly different  with spenser and ariosto fairies and elves gods and demons are regarded in their fancied connection with man  even in the age of pope when the gods and the rosicrucian sylphs have become alike poetical machinery this is their work  but among the moderns it is as connected with nature and giving a soul and a personality to her that they are most valued  the most pure utterance of this feeling is perhaps schillers gods of greece where the loss of the olympians is distinctly deplored because it has unpeopled not heaven but earth but the same tone runs through goethes classical walpurgis night where the old human twelve gods the antitypes and the friends of men in whom our forefathers delighted have vanished utterly and given place to semiphysical nereides tritons telchines psylli and seismos himself  keats in his wonderful endymion contrived to unite the two aspects of greek mythology as they never had been united before except by spenser in his garden of adonis  but the pantheistic notion as he himself says in lamia was the one which lay nearest his heart and in his hyperion he begins to deal wholly with the nature gods and after magnificent success leaves the poem unfinished most probably because he had become as his readers must weary of its utter want of human interest  for that after all is what is wanted in a poetical view of nature and that is what the poet in proportion to his want of dramatic faculty must draw from himself  he musthe does in these dayscolour nature with the records of his own mind and bestow a factitious life and interest on her by making her reflect his own joy or sorrow  if he be out of humour she must frown if he sigh she must roar if he bewhat he very seldom istolerably comfortable the birds have liberty to sing and the sun to shine  but by the time that he has arrived at this stage of his development or degradation the poet is hardly to be called a strong man he who is so munch the slave of his own moods that he must needs see no object save through them is not very likely to be able to resist the awe which natures grandeur and inscrutability brings with it and to say firmly and yet reverently   si fractus illibatur orbis impavidum ferient ruinae   he feels in spite of his conceit that nature is not going his way or looking his looks but going what he calls her own way what we call gods way  at all events he feels that he is lying when he represents the great universe as turned to his small set of pans pipes and all the more because he feels that conceal it as he will those same pans pipes are out of tune with each other  and so arises the habit of impersonating nature not after the manner of spenser whose purity of metaphor and philosophic method when he deals with nature is generally even more marvellous than the richness of his fancy as an organic whole but in her single and accidental phenomena and of ascribing not merely animal passions or animal enjoyment but human discursive intellect and moral sense to inanimate objects and talking as if a stick or a stone were more of a man than the poet isas indeed they very often may be  these like everything else are perfectly right in their own place where they express passion either pleasurable or painful passion that is not so intense as to sink into exhaustion or to be compelled to selfcontrol by the fear of madness  in these two cases as great dramatists know well enough the very violence of the emotion produces perfect simplicity as the hurricane blows the sea smooth  but where fanciful language is employed to express the extreme of passion it is felt to be absurd and is accordingly called rant and bombast  and where it is not used to express passion at all but merely the quiet and normal state of the poets mind or of his characters with regard to external nature when it is considered as it is by most of our modern poets the staple of poetry indeed poetic diction itself so that the more numerous and the stranger conceits an author can cram into his verses the finer poet he is then also it is called rant and bombast but of the most artificial insincere and in every sense of the word monstrous kind the offspring of an effeminate natureworship without selfrespect without true manhood because it exhibits the poet as the puppet of his own momentary sensations and not as a man superior to nature claiming his likeness to the author of nature by confessing and expressing the permanent laws of nature undisturbed by fleeting appearances without or fleeting tempers within  hence it is that as in all insincere and effete times the poetry of the day deals more and more with conceits and less and less with true metaphors  in fact hinc illae lachrymae  this is after all the primary symptom of disease in the public taste which has set us on writing this reviewthat critics all round are crying  an ill constructed whole no doubt but full of beautiful passagesthe word passages turning out to mean in plain english conceits  the simplest distinction perhaps between an image and a conceit is thisthat while both are analogies the image is founded on an analogy between the essential properties of two thingsthe conceit on an analogy between its accidents  images therefore whether metaphors or similes deal with laws conceits with private judgments  images belong to the imagination the power which sees things according to their real essence and inward life and conceits to the fancy or phantasy which only see things as they appear  to give an example or two from the life drama      his heart holds a deep hope as holds the wretched west the sunsets corse spit on insulted by the brutal rains     the passionpanting sea watches the unveiled beauty of the stars like a great hungry soul     great spirits who left upon the mountaintops of death a light that made them lovely     the moon arising from dark waves which plucked at her   and hundreds nay thousands more in this book whereof it must be said that beautiful or not in the eyes of the present generation and many of them are put into very beautiful language and refer to very beautiful natural objectsthey are not beautiful really and in themselves because they are mere conceits the analogies in them are fortuitous depending not on the nature of the things themselves but on the private fancy of the writer having no more real and logical coherence than a conundrum or a pun in plain english untrue only allowable to juliets or othellos while their selfpossession almost their reason is in temporary abeyance under the influence of joy or sorrow  every one must feel the exquisite fitness of juliets gallop apace ye fieryfooted steeds etc for one of her character in her circumstances  every one we trust and mr smith among the number will some day feel the exquisite unfitness of using such conceits as we have just quoted or any other page after page for all characters and chances  for the west is not wretched the rains never were brutal yet and do not insult the suns corpse being some millions of miles nearer us than the sun but only have happened once to seem to do so in the poets eyes  the sea does not pant with passion does not hunger after the beauty of the stars death has no mountaintops or any property which can be compared thereto and the dark wavesin that most beautiful conceit which follows and which mr smith has borrowed from mr bailey improving it marvellously neverthelessdo not pluck at the moon but only seem to do so  and what constitutes the beauty of this very conceit far the best of those we have chosenbut that it looks so very like an image so very like a law from being so very common and customary an ocular deception to one standing on a low shore at night  or again in a passage which has been already often quoted as exquisite and in its way is so      the bridegroom sea is toying with the shore his wedded bride and in the fulness of his marriage joy he decorates her tawny brow with shells retires a pace to see how fair she looks then proud runs up to kiss her   exquisite  yes but only exquisitely pretty  it is untruea false explanation of the rush and recoil of the waves  we learn nothing by these lines we gain no fresh analogy between the physical and the spiritual world not even between two different parts of the physical world  if the poetry of this age has a peculiar mission it is to declare that such an analogy exists throughout the two worlds then let poetry declare it  let it set forth a real intercommunion between man and nature grounded on a communion between man and god who made nature  let it accept natures laws as the laws of god truth scientific truth is the only real beauty  let god be true and every man a liar  now be it remembered that by far the greater proportion of this book consists of such thoughts as these and that these are what are called its beauties these are what young poets try more and more daily to inventconceits false analogies  be it remembered that the affectation of such conceits has always marked the decay and approaching death of a reigning school of poetry that when for instance the primeval forest of the elizabethan poets dwindled down into a barren scrub of vaughans and cowleys and herberts and crashawes this was the very form in which the deadly blight appeared  in vain did the poetasters frightened now and then at their own nonsense try to keep up the decaying dignity of poetry by drawing their conceits as poetasters do now from suns and galaxies earthquakes eclipses and the portentous and huge and gaudy in nature the lawlessness and irreverence for nature involved in the very worship of conceits went on degrading the tone of the conceits themselves till the very sense of true beauty and fitness seemed lost and a pious and refined gentleman like george herbert could actually dare to indite solemn conundrums to the supreme being and believe that he was writing devout poetry and looking through nature up to natures god when he delivered himself thus in one of his least offensive poems for the most sacred and most offensive of them we dare not quote lest we incur the same blame which we have bestowed on mr smith and sing of church festivals as   marrow of time eternity in brief compendiums epitomised the chief contents the indices the titlepages of all past present and succeeding ages sublimate graces antedated glories    the cream of holiness       the inventories    of future blessedness the florilegia of celestial stories spirit of joys the relishes and closes of angels music pearls dissolved roses perfumed sugard honeycombs   that manner happily for art was silenced by the stern truthloving common sense of the puritans  whatsoever else in their crusade against shams they were too hasty in sweeping away they were right at least in sweeping away such a sham as that  and now when a school has betaken itself to use the very same method in the cause of blasphemy instead of in that of cant the pope himself with his index prohibitus might be a welcome guest if he would but stop the noise and compel our doting muses to sit awhile in silence and reconsider themselves  in the meanwhile poets write about poets and poetry and guiding the age and curbing the world and waking it and thrilling it and making it start and weep and tremble and selfconceit only knows what else and yet the age is not guided or the world curbed or thrilled or waked or anything else by them  why should it be curb and thrill the world  the world is just now a most practical world and these men are utterly unpractical  the age is given up to physical science these men disregard and outrage it in every page by their false analogies  if they intend as they say to link heaven and earth by preaching the analogy of matter and spirit let them in the name of common prudence observe the laws of matter about which the world does know something and show their coincidence with the laws of spiritif indeed they know anything about the said laws loose conceits fancies of the private judgment were excusable enough in the elizabethan poets  in their day nature was still unconquered by science medieval superstitions still lingered in the minds of men and the magical notions of nature which they had inherited from the middle age received a corroboration from those neoplatonist dreamers whom they confounded with the true greek philosophers  but now that bacon has spoken and that europe has obeyed him surely among the most practical common sense and scientific nation of the earth severely scientific imagery imagery drawn from the inner laws of nature is necessary to touch the hearts of men  they know that the universe is not such as poets paint it they know that these pretty thoughts are only pretty thoughts springing from the caprice the vanity very often from the indigestion of the gentlemen who take the trouble to sing to them and they listen as they would to a band of street musicians and give them sixpence for their tune and go on with their work  the tune outside has nothing to do with the work inside  it will not help them to be wiser abler more valiantcertainly not more cheerful and hopeful men and therefore they care no more for it than they do for an opera or a pantomime if as much  whereupon the poets get disgusted with the same hardhearted prosaic worldwhich is trying to get its living like an industrious animal as it isand demand homagefor what  for making a noise pleasant or otherwise for not being as other men are  for pleading the eccentricities of genius as an excuse for sitting like naughty children in the middle of the schoolroom floor in everybodys way shouting and playing on penny trumpets and when begged to be quiet that other people may learn their lessons considering themselves insulted and pleading genius  geniushapless byword which like charity covers nowadays the multitude of sins all the seven deadly ones included is there any form of human folly which one has not heard excused by he is a genius you knowone must not judge him by common rules poor genius to have come to this  to be when confessed not a reason for being more of a man than others but an excuse for being less of a man less amenable than the herd to the common laws of humanity and therefore less able than they to comprehend its common duties common temptations common sins common virtues common destinies  of old the wise singer did by virtue of feeling with all and obeying with all learn to see for all to see eternal laws eternal analogies eternal consequences and so became a seer vates prophet but now he is become a genius a poetical pharisee a reviler of common laws and duties the slave of his own private judgment who prophesies out of his own heart and hath seen nothing but only the appearances of things distorted and coloured by genius  heaven send the word with many more a speedy burial  and what becomes of artistic form in the hands of such a school just what was to be expected  it is impossible to give outward form to that which is in its very nature formless like doubt and discontent  for on such subjects thought itself is not defined it has no limit no selfcoherence not even method or organic law  and in a poem as in all else the body must be formed according to the law of the inner life the utterance must be the expression the outward and visible antetype of the spirit which animates it  but where the thought is defined by no limits it cannot express itself in form for form is that which has limits  where it has no inward unity it cannot have any outward one  if the spirit be impatient of all moral rule its utterance will be equally impatient of all artistic rule and thus as we are now beginning to discover from experience the poetry of doubt will find itself unable to use those forms of verse which have been always held to be the highest tragedy epic the ballad and lastly even the subjective lyrical ode  for they too to judge by every great lyric which remains to us require a groundwork of consistent selfcoherent belief and they require also an appreciation of melody even more delicate and a verbal polish even more complete than any other form of poetic utterance  but where there is no melody within there will be no melody without  it is in vain to attempt the setting of spiritual discords to physical music  the mere practical patience and self restraint requisite to work out rhythm when fixed on will be wanting nay the fitting rhythm will never be found the subject itself being arhythmic and thus we shall have or rather alas do have a wider and wider divorce of sound and sense a greater and greater carelessness for polish and for the charm of musical utterance and watch the clear and spiritstirring melodies of the older poets swept away by a deluge of halfmetrical proserunmad diffuse unfinished unmusical to which any other metre than that in which it happens to have been written would have been equally appropriate because all are equally inappropriate  where men have nothing to sing it is not of the slightest consequence how they sing it  while poets persist in thinking and writing thus it is in vain for them to talk loud about the poets divine mission as the prophet of mankind the swayer of the universe and so forth  not that we believe the poet simply by virtue of being a singer to have any such power  while young gentlemen are talking about governing heaven and earth by verse wellingtons and peels arkwrights and stephensons frys and chisholms are doing it by plain practical prose and even of those who have moved and led the hearts of men by verse every one as far as we know has produced his magical effects by poetry of the very opposite forum to that which is now in fashion  what poet ever had more influence than homer  what poet is more utterly antipodal to our modern schools  there are certain hebrew psalms too which will be confessed even by those who differ most from them to have exercised some slight influence on human thought and action and to be likely to exercise the same for some time to come are they any more like our modern poetic forms than they are like our modern poetic matter  ay even in our own time what has been the form what the temper of all poetry from korner and heine which has made the german heart leap up but simplicity manhood clearness finished melody the very opposite in a word of our new school  and to look at home what is the modern poetry which lives on the lips and in the hearts of englishmen scotchmen irishmen  it is not only simple in form and language but much of it fitted by a severe exercise of artistic patience to tunes already existing  who does not remember how the marseillaise was born or how burnss scots wha ha wi wallace bled or the story of moores taking the old red fox march and giving it a new immortality as let erin remember the days of old while poor emmett sprang up and cried oh that i had twenty thousand irishmen marching to that tune  so it is even to this day and let those who hanker after poetic fame take note of it not a poem which is now really living but has gained its immortality by virtue of simplicity and positive faith  let the poets of the new school consider carefully wolfes sir john moore campbells hohenlinden mariners of england and rule britannia hoods song of the shirt and bridge of sighs and then ask themselves as men who would be poets  were it not better to have written any one of those glorious lyrics than all which john keats has left behind him  and let them be sure that howsoever they may answer the question to themselves the sound heart of the english people has already made its choice and that when that beautiful hero and leander in which hood has outrivalled the conceitmongers at their own weapons by virtue of the very terseness clearness and manliness which they neglect has been gathered to the limbo of the crashawes and marinos his song of the shirt and his bridge of sighs will be esteemed by great new english nations far beyond the seas for what they aretwo of the most noble lyric poems ever written by an english pen  if our poetasters talk with wordsworth of the dignity and pathos of the commonest human things they will find them there in perfection if they talk about the cravings of the new time they will find them there  if they want the truly sublime and the awful they will find them there also  but they will find none of their own favourite concetti hardly even a metaphor no taint of this new poetic diction into which we have now fallen after all our abuse of the far more manly and sincere poetic diction of the eighteenth century they will find no loitering by the way to argue and moralise and grumble at providence and show off the authors own genius and sensibility they will find in short two real works of art earnest melodious selfforgetful knowing clearly what they want to say and saying it in the shortest the simplest the calmest the most finished words  saying itrather taught to say it  for if that divine inspiration of poets of which the poetasters make such rash and irreverent boastings have indeed as all ages have held any reality corresponding to it it will rather be bestowed on such works as these appeals from unrighteous man to a righteous god than on men whose only claim to celestial help seems to be that mere passionate sensibility which our modern draco once described when speaking of poor john keats as an infinite hunger after all manner of pleasant things crying to the universe  oh that thou wert one great lump of sugar that i might suck thee  our task is ended  we have given as plainly as we can our reasons for the opinion which this magazine has expressed several times already that with the exception of mr allingham our young poets are a very hopeless generation and will so continue unless they utterly repent and amend  if they do not choose to awaken themselves from within all that is left for us is to hope that they may be awakened from without or by some radical revulsion in public taste be shown their own real value and durability and compelled to be true and manly under pain of being laughed at and forgotten  a general war might amid all its inevitable horrors sweep away at once the dyspeptic unbelief the insincere bigotry the effeminate frivolity which now paralyses our poetry as much as it does our action and strike from englands heart a lightning flash of noble deeds a thunder peal of noble song  such a case is neither an impossible nor a farfetched one let us not doubt that by some other means if not by that the immense volume of thought and power which is still among us will soon find its utterance and justify itself to after ages by showing in harmonious and selfrestrained poetry its kinship to the heroic and the beautiful of every age and clime  and till then till the sunshine and the thaw shall come and the spring flowers burst into bud and bloom heralding a new golden year in the worlds life let us even be content with our peagreen and orange fungi nay even admire them as not without their own tawdry beauty their clumsy fitness for after all they are products of nature though only of her dyspepsia and grow and breedas indeed cutaneous disorders doby an organic law of their own fulfilling their little destiny and then making according to professor way by no means bad manure  and so we take our leave of mr alexander smith entreating him if these pages meet his eye to consider three things namely that in as far as he has written poetry he is on the road to ruin by reason of following the worst possible models  that in as far as the prevailing taste has put these models before him he is neither to take much blame to himself nor to be in anywise disheartened for the future  that in as far as he shall utterly reverse his whole poetic method whether in morals or in aesthetics leave undone all that he has done and do all that he has not done he will become what he evidently by grace of god can become if he will namely a lasting and a good poet    tennyson 103    critics cannot in general be too punctilious in their respect for an incognito  if an author intended us to know his name he would put it on his titlepage  if he does not choose to do that we have no more right to pry into his secret than we have to discuss his family affairs or open his letters  but every rule has its exceptional cases and the book which stands first upon our list is surely such all the world somehow or other knows the author  his name has been mentioned unhesitatingly by several reviews already whether from private information or from the certainty which every wellread person must feel that there is but one man in england possessed at once of poetic talent and artistic experience sufficient for so noble a creation  we hope therefore that we shall not be considered impertinent if we ignore an incognito which all england has ignored before us and attribute in memoriam to the pen of the author of the princess  such a course will probably be the more useful one to our readers for this last work of our only living great poet seems to us at once the culmination of all his efforts and the key to many difficulties in his former writings  heaven forbid that we should say that it completes the circle of his powers  on the contrary it gives us hope of broader effort in new fields of thought and forms of art but it brings the development of his muse and of his creed to a positive and definite point  it enables us to claim one who has been hitherto regarded as belonging to a merely speculative and peirastic school as the willing and deliberate champion of vital christianity and of an orthodoxy the more sincere because it has worked upward through the abyss of doubt the more mighty for good because it justifies and consecrates the aesthetics and the philosophy of the present age  we are sure moreover that the author whatever right reasons he may have had for concealing his own name would have no quarrel against us for alluding to it were he aware of the idolatry with which every utterance of his is regarded by the cultivated young men of our day especially at the universities and of the infinite service of which this in memoriam may be to them if they are taught by it that their superiors are not ashamed of faith and that they will rise instead of falling fulfil instead of denying the cravings of their hearts and intellects if they will pass upwards with their teacher from the vague though noble expectations of locksley hall to the assured and everlasting facts of the proem to in memoriamin our eyes the noblest christian poem which england has produced for two centuries  to explain our meaning it will be necessary perhaps to go back to mr tennysons earlier writings of which he is said to be somewhat ashamed nowa fastidiousness with which we will not quarrel for it should be the rule of the poet forgetting those things which are behind to press on to those things which are before and to count not himself to have apprehended but no we will not finish the quotation let the readers of in memoriam finish it for themselves and see how after all the poet if he would reach perfection must be found by him who found st paul of old  in the meantime as a true poet must necessarily be in advance of his age mr tennysons earlier poems rather than these latter ones coincide with the tastes and speculations of the young men of this day  and in proportion we believe as they thoroughly appreciate the distinctive peculiarities of those poems will they be able to follow the author of them on his upward path  some of our readers we would fain hope remember as an era in their lives the first day on which they read those earlier poems how fifteen years ago mariana in the moated grange the dying swan the lady of shalott came to them as revelations  they seemed to themselves to have found at last a poet who promised not only to combine the cunning melody of moore the rich fulness of keats and the simplicity of wordsworth but one who was introducing a method of observing nature different from that of all the three and yet succeeding in everything which they had attempted often in vain both keats and moore had an eye for the beauty which lay in trivial and daily objects  but in both of them there was a want of deep religious reverence which kept moore playing gracefully upon the surface of phenomena without ever daring to dive into their laws or inner meaning and made poor keats fancy that he was rather to render nature poetical by bespangling her with florid ornament than simply to confess that she was already by the grace of god far beyond the need of his paint and gilding  even wordsworth himself had not full faith in the great dicta which he laid down in his famous introductory essay  deep as was his conviction that nature bore upon her simplest forms the fingermark of god he did not always dare simply to describe her as she was and leave her to reveal her own mystery  we do not say this in depreciation of one who stands now far above human praise or blame  the wonder is not that wordsworth rose no higher but that considering the level on which his taste was formed he had power to rise to the height above his age which he did attain  he did a mighty work  he has left the marks of his teaching upon every poet who has written verses worth reading for the last twenty years  the idea by which he conquered was as coleridge well sets forth the very one which in its practical results on his own poetry procured him loud and deserved ridicule  this which will be the root idea of the whole poetry of this generation was the dignity of nature in all her manifestations and not merely in those which may happen to suit the fastidiousness or manichaeism of any particular age  he may have been at times fanatical on his idea and have misused it till it became selfcontradictory because he could not see the correlative truths which should have limited it  but it is by fanatics by men of one great thought that great works are done and it is good for the time that a man arose in it of fearless honesty enough to write peter bell and the idiot boy to shake all the old methods of naturepainting to their roots and set every man seriously to ask himself what he meant or whether he meant anything real reverent or honest when he talked about poetic diction or the beauties of nature  and after all like all fanatics wordsworth was better than his own creed  as coleridge thoroughly shows in the second volume of the biographia literaria and as may be seen nowhere more strikingly than in his grand posthumous work his noblest poems and noblest stanzas are those in which his true poetic genius unconsciously to himself sets at naught his own pseudonaturalist dogmas  now mr tennyson while fully adopting wordsworths principle from the very first seemed by instinctive taste to have escaped the snares which had proved too subtle both for keats and wordsworth doubtless there are slight niaiseries after the manner of both those poets in the first editions of his earlier poems  he seems like most other great artists to have first tried imitations of various styles which already existed before he learnt the art of incorporating them into his own and learning from all his predecessors without losing his own individual peculiarities  but there are descriptive passages in them also which neither keats nor wordsworth could have written combining the honest sensuous observation which is common to them both with a selfrestrained simplicity which keats did not live long enough to attain and a stately and accurate melody an earnest songfulness to coin a word which wordsworth seldom attained and from his inaccurate and uncertain ear still seldomer preserved without the occurrence of a jar or a rattle a false quantity a false rapture or a bathos  and above all or rather beneath allfor we suspect that this has been throughout the very secret of mr tennysons powerthere was a hush and a reverent awe a sense of the mystery the infinitude the awfulness as well as of the mere beauty of wayside things which invested these poems as wholes with a peculiar richness depth and majesty of tone beside which both keatss and wordsworths methods of handling pastoral subjects looked like the colouring of julio romano or watteau by the side of correggio or titian  this deep simple faith in the divineness of nature as she appears which in our eyes is mr tennysons differentia is really the natural accompaniment of a quality at first sight its very opposite and for which he is often blamed by a prosaic world namely his subjective and transcendental mysticism  it is the mystic after all who will describe nature most simply because he sees most in her because he is most ready to believe that she will reveal to others the same message which she has revealed to him  men like behmen novalis and fourier who can soar into the inner cloudworld of mans spirit even though they lose their way there dazzled by excess of wondermen who like wordsworth can give utterance to such subtle anthropologic wisdom as the ode on the intimations of immortality will for that very reason most humbly and patiently consider the lilies of the field how they grow  and even so it is just because mr tennyson is far more than wordsworth mystical and what an ignorant and moneygetting generation idolatrous of mere sensuous activity calls dreamy that he has become the greatest naturalistic poet which england has seen for several centuries  the same faculty which enabled him to draw such subtle subjective pictures of womanhood as adeline isabel and eleanor enabled him to see and therefore simply to describe in one of the most distinctive and successful of his earlier poems how   the creeping mosses and clambering weeds    and the willow branches hoar and dank and the wavy swell of the soughing reeds    and the waveworn horns of the echoing bank and the silvery marish flowers that throng the desolate creeks and pools among were flooded over with eddying song   no doubt there are in the earlier poems exceptions to this style attempts to adorn nature and dazzle with a barbaric splendour akin to that of keatsas for instance in the recollections of the arabian nights  but how cold and gaudy in spite of individual beauties is that poem by the side of either of the marianas and especially of the one in which the scenery is drawn simply and faithfully from those counties which the world considers the quintessence of the prosaicthe english fens   upon the middle of the night    waking she heard the nightfowl crow the cock sang out an hour ere light    from the dark fen the oxens low came to her  without hope of change    in sleep she seemed to walk forlorn    till cold winds woke the grayeyed morn about the lonely moated grange        about a stonecast from the wall    a sluice with blackened waters slept and oer it many round and small    the clusterd marishmosses crept hard by a poplar shook alway    all silvergreen with gnarled bark    for leagues no other tree did mark the level waste the rounding gray   throughout all these exquisite lines occurs but one instance of what the vulgar call poetic diction  all is simple description in short and saxon words and yet who can deny the effect to be perfect superior to any similar passage in wordsworth  and why  because the passage quoted and indeed the whole poem is perfect in what artists call tonetone in the metre and in the sound of the words as well as in the images and the feelings expressed  the weariness the dreariness the dark mysterious waste exist alike within and without in the slow monotonous pace of the metre and the words as well as in the boundless fen and the heart of her who without hope of change in sleep did seem to walk forlorn  the same faith in nature the same instinctive correctness in melody springing from that correct insight into nature ran through the poems inspired by medieval legends  the very spirit of the old ballad writers with their combinations of mysticism and objectivity their freedom from any selfconscious attempt at reflective epithets or figures runs through them all  we are never jarred in them as we are in all the attempts at balladwriting and balladrestoring before mr tennysons time by discordant touches of the reflective in thought the picturesque in nature or the theatric in action  to illustrate our meaning readers may remember the ballad of fair emmeline in bishop percys reliques  the bishop confesses if we mistake not to have patched one end of the ballad  he need not have informed us of that fact while such lines as these following meet our eyes         the baron turned aside and wiped away the rising tears    he proudly strove to hide   no old ballad writer would have used such a complicated concetto another and even a worse instance is to be found in the difference between the old and new versions of the grand ballad of glasgerion in the original we hear how the elfin harper could   harp fish out of the water    and water out of a stone and milk out of a maidens breast    that bairn had never none   for which some benighted restorer substitutes   oh there was magic in his touch    and sorcery in his string   no doubt there was  but while the new poetaster informs you of the abstract notion the ancient poet gives you the concrete fact as mr tennyson has done with wonderful art in his exquisite st agnes where the saints subjective mysticism appears only as embodied in objective pictures   break up the heavens oh lord and far    through all yon starlight keen draw me thy bride a glittering star in raiment white and clean   sir walter scotts ballads fail just on the same point  even campbell cannot avoid an occasional false note of sentiment  in mr tennyson alone as we think the spirit of the middle age is perfectly reflected its delight not in the sublime and picturesque but in the green leaves and spring flowers for their own sakethe spirit of chaucer and of the robin hood garlandthe naturalism which revels as much in the hedgerow and garden as in alps and cataracts and italian skies and the other strong stimulants to the faculty of admiration which the palled taste of an unhealthy age from keats and byron down to browning has rushed abroad to seek  it is enough for mr tennysons truly english spirit to see how   on either side the river lie long fields of barley and of rye that clothe the wold and meet the sky and through the field the road runs by       to manytowerd camelot   or how   in the stormy east wind straining the pale yellow woods were waning the broad stream in his banks complaining heavily the low sky raining       over towerd camelot   give him but such scenery as that which he can see in every parish in england and he will find it a fit scene for an ideal myth subtler than a casuists questionings deep as the deepest heart of woman  but in this earlier volume the poet has not yet arrived at the art of combining his new speculations on man with his new mode of viewing nature  his objective pieces are too exclusively objective his subjective too exclusively subjective and where he deals with natural imagery in these latter he is too apt as in eleanore to fall back upon the old and received method of poetic diction though he never indulges in a commonplace or a stock epithet  but in the interval between 1830 and 1842 the needful interfusion of the two elements has taken place  and in locksley hall and the two voices we find the new doubts and questions of the time embodied naturally and organically in his own method of simple natural expression  for instance from the search for truth in the two voices   cry faint not climb  the summits lope beyond the furthest flights of hope wrapt in dense cloud from base to cope  sometimes a little corner shines as over rainy mist inclines a gleaming crag with belts of pines  i will go forward sayest thou i shall not fail to find her now look up the fold is on her brow   or again in locksley hall the poem which as we think deservedly has had most influence on the minds of the young men of our day   eagerhearted as a boy when first he leaves his fathers field and at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn sees in heaven the light of london flaring like a dreary dawn and his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then underneath the light he looks at in among the throngs of men men my brothers men the workers over reaping something new that which they have done but earnest of the things which they shall do   and all the grand prophetic passage following which is said we know not how truly to have won for the poet the respect of that great statesman whose loss all good men deplore  in saying that locksley hall has deservedly had so great an influence over the minds of the young we shall we are afraid have offended some who are accustomed to consider that poem as werterian and unhealthy  but in reality the spirit of the poem is simply antiwerterian  it is man rising out of sickness into healthnot conquered by werterism but conquering his selfish sorrow and the moral and intellectual paralysis which it produces by faith and hopefaith in the progress of science and civilisation hope in the final triumph of good  doubtless that is not the highest deliverancenot a permanent deliverance at all  faith in god and hope in christ alone can deliver a man once and for all from werterism or any other moral disease that truth was reserved for in memoriam but as far as locksley hall goes it is a step forwarda whole moral aeon beyond byron and shelley and a step too in the right direction just because it is a step forward because the path of deliverance is as locksley hall sets forth not backwards towards a fancied paradise of childhoodnot backward to grope after an unconsciousness which is now impossible an implicit faith which would be unworthy of the man but forward on the road on which god has been leading him carrying upward with him the aspirations of childhood and the bitter experience of youth to help the organised and trustful labour of manhood  there are in fact only two deliverances from werterism possible in the nineteenth century one is into popery and the other is      forward forward let us range let the peoples spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change through the shadow of the world we sweep into the younger day better fifty years of europe than a cycle of cathay   but such a combination of powers as mr tennysons naturally develop themselves into a high idyllic faculty for it is the very essence of the idyl to set forth the poetry which lies in the simpler manifestations of man and nature yet not explicitly by a reflective moralising on them as almost all our idyllistscowper gray crabbe and wordsworthhave been in the habit of doing but implicitly by investing them all with a rich and delightful tone of colouring perfect grace of manner perfect melody of rhythm which like a gorgeous summer atmosphere shall glorify without altering the most trivial and homely sights  and it is this very power as exhibited in the lord of burleigh audley court and the gardeners daughter which has made mr tennyson not merely the only english rival of theocritus and bion but in our opinion as much their superior as modern england is superior to ancient greece  yet in the princess perhaps mr tennyson rises higher still  the idyllic manner alternates with the satiric the pathetic even the sublime by such imperceptible gradations and continual delicate variations of key that the harmonious medley of his style becomes the fit outward expression of the bizarre and yet harmonious fairyland in which his fancy ranges  in this work too mr tennyson shows himself more than ever the poet of the day  in it more than ever the old is interpenetrated with the newthe domestic and scientific with the ideal and sentimental  he dares in every page to make use of modern words and notions from which the mingled clumsiness and archaism of his compeers shrinks as unpoetical though as we just said his stage is an ideal fairyland yet he has reached the ideal by the only true methodby bringing the middle age forward to the present one and not by ignoring the present to fall back on a cold and galvanised medievalism and thus he makes his medley a mirror of the nineteenth century possessed of its own new art and science its own new temptations and aspirations and yet grounded on and continually striving to reproduce the forms and experiences of all past time  the idea too of the princess is an essentially modern one  in every age women have been tempted by the possession of superior beauty intellect or strength of will to deny their own womanhood and attempt to stand alone as men whether on the ground of political intrigue ascetic saintship or philosophic pride  cleopatra and st hedwiga madame de stael and the princess are merely different manifestations of the same self willed and proud longing of woman to unsex herself and realise single and selfsustained some distorted and partial notion of her own as to what the angelic life should be  cleopatra acted out the pagan ideal of an angel st hedwiga the medieval one madame de stael hers with the peculiar notions of her time as to what spirituel might mean and in the princess mr tennyson has embodied the ideal of that nobler wider purer yet equally fallacious because equally unnatural analogue which we may meet too often up and down england now  he shows us the woman when she takes nor stand on the false masculine ground of intellect working out her own moral punishment by destroying in herself the tender heart of flesh  not even her vast purposes of philanthropy can preserve her for they are built up not on the womanhood which god has given her but on her own selfwill they change they fall they become inconsistent even as she does herself till at last she loses all feminine sensibility scornfully and stupidly she rejects and misunderstands the heart of man and then falling from pride to sternness from sternness to sheer inhumanity she punishes sisterly love as a crime robs the mother of her child and becomes all but a vengeful fury with all the peculiar faults of woman and none of the peculiar excellences of man  the poem being as its title imports a medley of jest and earnest allows a metrical licence of which we are often tempted to wish that its author had not availed himself yet the most unmetrical and apparently careless passages flow with a grace a lightness a colloquial ease and frolic which perhaps only heighten the effect of the serious parts and serve as a foil to set off the unrivalled finish and melody of these latter  in these come out all mr tennysons instinctive choice of tone his mastery of language which always fits the right word to the right thing and that word always the simplest one and the perfect ear for melody which makes it superfluous to set to music poetry which read by the veriest schoolboy makes music of itself  the poem we are glad to say is so well known that it seems unnecessary to quote from it yet there are here and there gems of sound and expression of which however well our readers may know them we cannot forbear reminding them again  for instance the end of the idyl in book vii beginning come down o maid the whole of which is perhaps one of the most perfect fruits of the poets genius   myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn the moan of doves in immemorial elms and murmuring of innumerable bees   who after three such lines will talk of english as a harsh and clumsy language and seek in the effeminate and monotonous italian for expressive melody of sound  who cannot hear in them the rapid rippling of the water the stately calmness of the wooddoves note and in the repetition of short syllables and soft liquids in the last line the   murmuring of innumerable bees   or again what combination of richness with simplicity in such a passage as this      breathe upon my brows in that fine air i tremble all the past melts mistlike into this bright hour and this i scarce believe and all the rich to come reels as the golden autumn woodland reels athwart the smoke of burning leaves   how mr tennyson can have attained the prodigal fulness of thought and imagery which distinguishes this poem and especially the last canto without his style ever becoming overloaded seldom even confused is perhaps one of the greatest marvels of the whole production  the songs themselves which have been inserted between the cantos in the last edition of the book seem perfect as they are wasted and smothered among the surrounding fertility till we discover that they stand there not merely for the sake of their intrinsic beauty but serve to call back the readers mind at every pause in the tale of the princesss folly to that very healthy ideal of womanhood which she has spurned  at the end of the first canto fresh from the description of the female college with its professoresses and hostleresses and other utopian monsters we turn the page and   as through the land at eve we went    and pluckd the ripend ears we fell out my wife and i    and kissed again with tears  and blessings on the fallingout    that all the more endears when we fall out with those we love    and kiss again with tears  for when we came where lies the child    we lost in other years there above the little grave    we kissed again with tears   between the next two cantos intervenes the wellknown cradlesong perhaps the best of all and at the next interval is the equally wellknown buglesong the idea of which is that of twinlabour and twinfame in a pair of lovers   our echoes roll from soul to soul and grow for ever and for ever   in the next the memory of wife and child inspirits the soldier in the field in the next the sight of the fallen heros child opens the sluices of his widows tears and in the last and perhaps the most beautiful of all the poet has succeeded in the new edition in superadding a new form of emotion to a canto in which he seemed to have exhausted every resource of pathos which his subject allowed and prepares us for the triumph of that art by which he makes us after all love the heroine whom he at first taught us to hate and despise till we see that the naughtiness is after all one that must be kissed and not whipped out of her and look on smiling while she repents with prince harry of old not in sackcloth and ashes but in new silk and old sack   ask me no more  the moon may draw the sea    the cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape    with fold to fold of mountain or of cape but o too fond when have i answered thee       ask me no more  ask me no more  what answer should i give    i love not hollow cheek or faded eye    yet o my friend i will not have thee die ask me no more lest i should bid thee live       ask me no more  ask me no more  thy fate and mine are seald    i strove against the stream and all in vain    let the great river take me to the main no more dear love for at a touch i yield       ask me no more   we now come to in memoriam a collection of poems on a vast variety of subjects but all united as their name implies to the memory of a departed friend  we know not whether to envy morethe poet the object of his admiration or that object the monument which has been consecrated to his nobleness  for in this latest and highest volume written at various intervals during a long series of years all the poets peculiar excellences with all that he has acquired from others seem to have been fused down into a perfect unity and brought to bear on his subject with that care and finish which only a labour of love can inspire  we only now know the whole man all his art all his insight all his faculty of discerning the piu nell uno and the uno nell piu  as he says himself   my love has talked with rocks and trees    he finds on misty mountainground    his own vast shadow glorycrowned he sees himself in all he sees   everything reminds him of the dead  every joy or sorrow of man every aspect of nature from   the forest crackd the waters curld    the cattle huddled on the lea  the thousand waves of wheat that ripple round the lonely grange   in every place where in old days they had met and conversed in every dark wrestling of the spirit with the doubts and fears of manhood throughout the whole outward universe of nature and the whole inward universe of spirit the soul of his dead friend broodsat first a memory shrouded in blank despair then a living presence a ministering spirit answering doubts calming fears stirring up noble aspirations utter humility leading the poet upward step by step to faith and peace and hope  not that there runs throughout the book a conscious or organic method  the poems seem often merely to be united by the identity of their metre so exquisitely chosen that while the major rhyme in the second and third lines of each stanza gives the solidity and selfrestraint required by such deep themes the mournful minor rhyme of each first and fourth line always leads the ear to expect something beyond and enables the poets thoughts to wander sadly on from stanza to stanza and poem to poem in an endless chain of   linked sweetness long drawn out   there are records of risings and fallings again of alternate cloud and sunshine throughout the book earnest and passionate yet never bitter humble yet never abject with a depth and vehemence of affection passing the love of woman yet without a taint of sentimentality selfrestrained and dignified without ever narrowing into artificial coldness altogether rivalling the sonnets of shakespeare and all knit together into one spiritual unity by the proem at the opening of the volumein our eyes the noblest english christian poem which several centuries have seen  we shall not quote the very poems which we should most wish to sink into mens hearts  let each man find for himself those which suit him best and meditate on them in silence  they are fit only to be read solemnly in our purest and most thoughtful moods in the solitude of our chamber or by the side of those we love with thanks to the great heart who has taken courage to bestow on us the record of his own friendship doubt and triumph  it has been often asked why mr tennysons great and varied powers had never been concentrated on one immortal work  the epic the lyric the idyllic faculties perhaps the dramatic also seemed to be all there and yet all sundered scattered about in small fragmentary poems  in memoriam as we think explains the paradox  mr tennyson had been employed on higher more truly divine and yet more truly human work than either epos or drama  within the unseen and alone truly real world which underlies and explains this mere time shadow which men miscall the real he had been going down into the depths and ascending into the heights led like dante of old by the guiding of a mighty spirit  and in this volume the record of seventeen years we have the result of those spiritual experiences in a form calculated as we believe to be a priceless benefit to many an earnest seeker in this generation and perhaps to stir up some who are priding themselves on a cold dilettantism and barren epicurism into something like a living faith and hope  blessed and delightful it is to find that even in these new ages the creeds which so many fancy to be at their last gasp are still the final and highest succour not merely of the peasant and the outcast but of the subtle artist and the daring speculator  blessed it is to find the most cunning poet of our day able to combine the complicated rhythm and melody of modern times with the old truths which gave heart to martyrs at the stake and to see in the science and the history of the nineteenth century new and living fulfilments of the words which we learnt at our mothers knee  blessed thrice blessed to find that heroworship is not yet passed away that the heart of man still beats young and fresh that the old tales of david and jonathan damon and pythias socrates and alcibiades shakespeare and his nameless friend of love passing the love of woman ennobled by its own humility deeper than death and mightier than the grave can still blossom out if it be but in one heart here and there to show men still how sooner or later he that loveth knoweth god for god is love    burns and his school 127    four faces among the portraits of modern men great or small strike us as supremely beautiful not merely in expression but in the form and proportion and harmony of features  shakespeare raffaelle goethe burns  one would expect it to be so for the mind makes the body not the body the mind and the inward beauty seldom fails to express itself in the outward as a visible sign of the invisible grace or disgrace of the wearer  not that it is so always  a paul apostle of the gentiles may be ordained to be in presence weak in speech contemptible hampered by some thorn in the fleshto interfere apparently with the success of his mission perhaps for the same wise purpose of providence which sent socrates to the athenians the worshippers of physical beauty in the ugliest of human bodies that they or rather those of them to whom eyes to see had been given might learn that soul is after all independent of matter and not its creature and its slave  but in the generality of cases physiognomy is a sound and faithful science and tells us if not alas what the man might have been still what he has become  yet even this former problem what he might have been may often be solved for us by youthful portraits before sin and sorrow and weakness have had their will upon the features and therefore when we spoke of these four beautiful faces we alluded in each case to the earliest portraits of each genius which we could recollect placing them side by side we must be allowed to demand for that of robert burns an honourable station among them  of shakespeares we do not speak for it seems to us to combine in itself the elements of all the other three but of the rest we question whether burns be not after all if not the noblest still the most lovablethe most like what we should wish that of a teacher of men to be  raffaelle the most striking portrait of him perhaps is the fullface pencil sketch by his own hand in the taylor gallery at oxfordthough without a taint of littleness or effeminacy is soft melancholy formed entirely to receive and to elaborate in silence  his is a face to be kissed not worshipped  goethe even in his earliest portraits looks as if his expression depended too much on his own will  there is a selfconscious power and purpose and self restraint and all but scorn upon those glorious lineaments which might win worship and did but not love except as the child of enthusiasm or of relationship  but burnss face to judge of it by the early portrait of him by nasmyth must have been a face like that of joseph of old of whom the rabbis relate that he was mobbed by the egyptian ladies whenever he walked the streets  the magic of that countenance making burns at once tempter and tempted may explain many a sad story  the features certainly are not perfectly regular there is no superabundance of the charm of mere animal health in the outline or colour  but the marks of intellectual beauty in the face are of the highest order capable of being but too triumphant among a people of deep thought and feeling  the lips ripe yet not coarse or loose full of passion and the faculty of enjoyment are parted as if forced to speak by the inner fulness of the heart the features are rounded rich and tender and yet the bones show thought massively and manfully everywhere the eyes laugh out upon you with boundless good humour and sweetness with simple eager gentle surprisea gleam as of the morning star looking forth upon the wonder of a newborn worldaltogether   a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill   bestow on such a man the wittiest and most winning eloquencea rich flow of spirits and fulness of health and lifea deep sense of wonder and beauty in the earth and manan instinct of the dynamic and supernatural laws which underlie and vivify this material universe and its appearances healthy yet irregular and unscientific all but superstitiousturn him loose in any country in europe during the latter half of the eighteenth century and it will not be difficult alas to cast his horoscope  and what an age in which to be turned loosefor loose he must go to solve the problem of existence for himself  the grand simple old scottish education which he got from his parents must prove narrow and unsatisfying for so rich and manifold a character not because it was in itself imperfect not because it did not contain implicitly all things necessary for his salvationin every sense all laws which he might require for his afterlife guidance but because it contained so much of them as yet only implicitly because it was not yet conscious of its own breadth and depth and power of satisfying the new doubts and cravings of such minds and such times as burnss it may be that burns was the devoted victim by whose fall it was to be taught that it must awaken and expand and renew its youth in shapes equally sound but more complex and scientific  but it had not done so then  and when burns found himself gradually growing beyond his fathers teaching in one direction and tempted beyond it in another and a lower one what was there in those times to take up his education at the point where it had been left unfinished  he saw around him in plenty animal goodnature and courage barbaric honesty and hospitalitymore perhaps than he would see now for the upward progress into civilised excellences is sure to be balanced by some loss of savage onesbut reckless shallow above all drunken  it was a harddrinking coarse materialist age  the higher culture of scotland especially was all but exclusively frenchnot a good kind while voltaire and volney still remained unanswered and les liaisons dangereuses were accepted by all young gentlemen and a great many young ladies who could read french as the best account of the relation of the sexes  besides the philosophy of that day like its criticism was altogether mechanical nay as it now seems materialist in its ultimate and logical results  criticism was outward and of the form merely  the world was not believed to be already and in itself mysterious and supernatural and the poet was not defined as the man who could see and proclaim that supernatural element  before it was admired it was to be raised above nature into the region of the picturesque or whatnot and the poet was the man who gave it this factitious and superinduced beauty by a certain kompsologia and meteoroepeia called poetic diction now happily becoming extinct mainly we believe under the influence of burns although he himself thought it his duty to bedizen his verses therewith and though it was destined to flourish for many a year more in the temple of the father of lies like a jar of paper flowers on a popish altar  no wonder that in such a time a genius like burns should receive not only no guidance but no finer appreciation  true he was admired petted flattered for that the man was wonderful no one could doubt but we question whether he was understood whether if that very flowery and magniloquent style which we now consider his great failing had been away he would not have been passed over by the many as a writer of vulgar doggrel  true the old simple balladmuse of scotland still dropped a gem from her treasures here and there even in the eighteenth century itselfwitness auld robin gray  but who suspected that they were gems of which scotland fifty years afterwards would be prouder and more greedy than of all the second hand french culture which seemed to her then the highest earthly attainment  the review of burns in an early number of the edinburgh review said to be from the pen of the late lord jeffrey shows as clearly as anything can the utterly inconsistent and bewildered feeling with which the world must have regarded such a phenomenon alas there was inconsistency and bewilderment enough in the phenomenon itself but that only made confusion worse confounded the confusion was already there even in the mind of the more practical literary men who ought one would have thought also to have been the most deepsighted  but no  the reviewer turns the strange thing over and over and inside outand some fifteen years after it has vanished out of the world having said out its say and done all that it had to do he still finds it too utterly abnormal to make up his mind about in any clear or consistent way and gets thoroughly cross with it and calls it hard names because it will not fit into any established pigeonhole or drawer of the then existing anthropological museum  burns is a literary prodigy and yet it is a derogation to him to consider him as one  and that we find not as we should have expected because he possessed genius which would have made success a matter of course in any rank but because he was so well educatedhaving acquired a competent knowledge of french together with the elements of latin and geometry and before he had composed a single stanza was far more intimately acquainted with pope shakespeare and thomson than ninetenths of the youths who leave school for the university etc etcin short because he was so well educated that his becoming robert burns the immortal poet was a matter of course and necessity  and yet a page or two on the great reason why it was more easy for robert burns the cottar to become an original and vigorous poet rather than for any one of the herd of scholars and academical literati who are depressed and discouraged by perusing the most celebrated writers and conversing with the most intelligent judges is found to be that the literature and refinement of the age do not exist for a rustic and illiterate individual and consequently the present time is to him what the rude times of old were to the vigorous writer who adorned them  in short the great reason of robert burnss success was that he did not possess that education the possession of which proves him to be no prodigy though the review begins by calling him one and coupling him with stephen duck and thomas dermody  now if the best critic of the age writing fifteen years after burnss death found himself between the horns of such a dilemma which indeed like those of an old arnee bull meet at the points and form a complete circle of contradictionswhat must have been the bewilderment of lesser folk during the prodigys very lifetime what must indeed have been his own bewilderment at himself however manfully he may have kept it down  no wonder that he was unguided either by himself or by others  we do not blame them him we must deeply blame yet not as we ought to blame ourselves did we yield in the least to those temptations under which burns fell  biographies of burns and those good ones according to the standard of biographies in these days are said to exist we cannot say that we have as yet cared to read them  there are several other biographies even more important to be read first when they are written  shakespeare has found as yet no biographer has not even left behind him materials for a biography such at least as are considered worth using  indeed we question whether such a biography would be of any use whatever to the world for the man who cannot by studying his dramas in some tolerably accurate chronological order and using as a running accompaniment and closet commentary those awe inspiring sonnets of his attain to some clear notion of what sort of life william shakespeare must have led would not see him much the clearer for many folios of anecdote  for after all the best biography of every sincere man is sure to be his own works here he has set down transferred as in a figure all that has happened to him inward or outward or rather all which has formed him produced a permanent effect upon his mind and heart and knowing that you know all you need know and are content being glad to escape the personality and gossip of names and places and of dates even except in as far as they enable you to place one step of his mental growth before or after another  of the honest man this holds true always and almost always of the dishonest man the man of cant affectation hypocrisy for even if he pretend in his novel or his poem to be what he is not he still shows you thereby what he thinks he ought to have been or at least what he thinks that the world thinks he ought to have been and confesses to you in the most naive and confidential way like one who talks in his sleep what learning he has or has not had what society he has or has not seen and that in the very act of trying to prove the contrary  nay the smaller the man or woman and the less worth deciphering his biography the more surely will he show you if you have eyes to see and time to look what sort of people offended him twenty years ago what meanness he would have liked to indulge in if he had dared when young and for what other meanness he relinquished it as he grew up of what periodical he stood in awe when he took pen in hand and so forth  whether his books treat of love or political economy theology or geology it is there the history of the man legibly printed for those who care to read it  in these poems and letters of burns we apprehend is to be found a truer history than any anecdote can supply of the things which happened to himself and moreover of the most notable things which went on in scotland between 1759 and 1796  this latter assertion may seem startling when we consider that we find in these poems no mention whatsoever of the discoveries of steamboats and spinningjennies the rise of the great manufacturing cities the revolution in scottish agriculture or even in scottish metaphysics  but after all the history of a nation is the history of the men and not of the things thereof and the history of those men is the history of their hearts and not of their purses or even of their heads and the history of one man who has felt in himself the heart experiences of his generation and anticipated many belonging to the next generation is so far the collective history of that generation and of muchno man can say how muchof the next generation and such a man bearing within his single soul two generations of workingmen we take robert burns to have been and his poems as such a contemporaneous history of scotland the equal to which we are not likely to see written for this generation or several to come  such a man sent out into such an age would naturally have a hard and a confused battle to fight would probably unless he fell under the guidance of some mastermind end se ipso minor stunted and sadly deformed as burns did  his works are after all only the disjecta membra poetae full of hints of a great mighthavebeen  hints of the keenest and most dramatic appreciation of human action and thought  hints of an unbounded fancy playing gracefully in the excess of its strength with the vastest images as in that robe of the scottish muse in which   deep lights and shades bold mingling threw       a lustre grand and seemd to my astonished view       a wellknown land   the image and the next few stanzas which dilate it might be a translation from dantes paradiso so broad terse vivid the painters touch  hints too of a humour which like that of shakespeare rises at times by sheer depth of insight into the sublime as when   hornie did the laigh kirk watch just like a winking baudrons   hints of a power of verbal wit which had it been sharpened in such a perpetual wordbattle as that amid which shakespeare lived from the age of twenty might have rivalled shakespeares own which even now asserts its force by a hundred little nevertobeforgotten phrases scattered through his poems which stick like barbed arrows in the memory of every reader  and as for his tendernessthe quality without which all other poetic excellence is barrenit gushes forth toward every creature animate and inanimate with one exception namely the hypocrite ever alike spiacente a dio e ai nemici sui and therefore intolerable to robert burnss honesty whether he be fighting for or against the cause of right  again we say there are evidences of a versatile and manifold faculty in this man which with a stronger will and a larger education might have placed him as an equal by the side of those great names which we mentioned together with his at the commencement of this article  but one thing burns wanted and of that one thing his age helped to deprive himthe education which comes by reverence  looking round in such a time with his keen power of insight his keen sense of humour what was there to worship  lord jeffrey or whosoever was the author of the review in the edinburgh says disparagingly that burns had as much education as shakespeare  so he very probably had if education mean booklearning  nay more of the practical education of the fireside the sober industrious godfearing education and drawing out of the manhood by act and example burns may have had more under his good father than shakespeare under his though the family life of the small english burgher in elizabeths time would have generally presented as we suspect the very same aspect of staid manfulness and godliness which a scotch farmers did fifty years ago  but let that be as it may burns was not born into an elizabethan age  he did not see around him raleighs and sidneys cecils and hookers drakes and frobishers spensers and jonsons southamptons and willoughbys with an elizabeth guiding and moulding the great whole a crowned titaness terrible and strong and wisea woman who whether right or wrong bowed the proudest if not to love yet still to obey  that was the secret of shakespeares power  heroic himself he was born into an age of heroes  you see it in his works  not a play but gives patent evidence that to him all forms of human magnanimity were common and wayside flowersamong the humours of men which he and ben jonson used to wander forth together to observe  and thus he could give living action and speech to the ancient noblenesses of rome and the middle age for he had walked and conversed with them unchanged in everything but in the dress  had he known greek literature he could have recalled to imperishable life such men as cimon and aristides such deeds as marathon and salamis  for had we not had our own salamis acted within a few years of his birth and were not the heroes of it still walking among men  it was surely this continual presence of men of worship this atmosphere of admiration and respect and trust in which shakespeare must have lived which tamed down the wild selfwill of the deerstealing fugitive from stratford into the calm largeeyed philosopher tolerant and loving and full of faith in a species made in the likeness of god  not so with burns  one feels painfully in his poems the want of great characters and still more painfully that he has not drawn them simply because they were not there to draw  that he has a true eye for what is noble when he sees it let his lament for glencairn testify and the stanzas in his vision in which with a highbred grace which many a courtly poet of his day might have envied he alludes to one and another scottish worthy of his time  there is no vein of saucy and envious banausia in the man even in his most graceless sneer his faultif fault it beis that he cannot and will not pretend to respect that which he knows to be unworthy of respect  he sees around him and above him as well as below him an average of men and things dishonest sensual ungodly shallow ridiculous by reason of their own lusts and passions and he will not apply to the shams of dignity and worth the words which were meant for their realities  after all he does but say what every one round him was feeling and thinking but he said it and hypocritical respectability shrank shrieking from the mirror of her own inner heart  but it was all the worse for him  in the sins of others he saw an excuse for his own  losing respect for and faith in his brothermen he lost as a matter of course respect for himself faith in himself  the hypocrisy which persecutes in the name of law whether political or moral while in private it transgresses the very law which is for ever on its tongue is turned by his passionate and sorelytempted character into a too easy excuse for disbelieving in the obligation of any law whatsoever  he ceases to worship and therefore to be himself worshipfuland we know the rest  he might have still worshipped god  he might and surely amid all his sins doubts and confusions the remembrance of the old faith learned at his parents knee does haunt him still as a beautiful regretand sometimes in his bitterest hours shine out before his poor broken heart as an everlasting pharos lighting him homewards after all  whether he reached that home or not none on earth can tell  but his writings show if anything can that the vestalfire of conscience still burned within though choked again and again with bitter ashes and foul smoke  consider the time in which he lived when it was as with the people so with the priest and the grand old lifetree of the scottish kirk now green and vigorous with fresh leaves and flowers was all crusted with foul scurf and moss and seemed to have ceased growing and to be crumbling down into decay consider the terrible contradiction between faith and practice which must have met the eyes of the man before he could write with the same penand one as honestly as the otherthe cottars saturday night and holy willies prayer  but those times are past and the men who acted in them gone to another tribunal  let the dead bury their dead and in the meantime instead of cursing the misguided genius let us consider whether we have not also something for which to thank him whether as competent judges of him aver from their own experience those very seeming blasphemies of his have not produced more good than evil whether though a savour of death unto death to conceited and rebellious spirits they may not have helped to open the eyes of the wise to the extent to which the general eighteenthcentury rottenness had infected scotland and to make intolerable a state of things which ought to have been intolerable even if burns had never written  we are not attacking the reviewer far less the edinburgh review which some years after this not only made the amende honorable to burns but showed a frank impartiality only too rare in the reviews of these days by publishing in its pages the noble article on burns which has since appeared separately in mr carlyles miscellanies we only wish to show from the reviewers own words the element in which burns had to work the judges before whom he had to plead and the change which as we think very much by the influence of his own poems has passed upon the minds of men  how few are there who would pen now about him such a sentence as this  he is that is was having gone to his account fifteen years before perpetually making a parade of his own inflammability and imprudence and talking with much selfcomplacency and exultation of the offence he has occasioned to the sober and correct part of mankinda very small part of mankind one would have thought in the british isles at least about the end of the last century  but it was the fashion then as usual to substitute the praise of virtues for the practice of them and threebottle and tentumbler men had a very good right of course to admire sobriety and correctness and to denounce any twobottle and sixtumbler man who was not ashamed to confess in print the weaknesses which they confessed only by word of mouth  just and yet not just  true burns does make a parade of his thoughtlessness and worse but why because he gloried in it  he must be a very skin deep critic who cannot see even in the most insolent of those blameworthy utterances an inward shame and selfreproach which if any man had ever felt in himself he would be in nowise inclined to laugh at it in others  why it is the very shame which wrings those poems out of him  they are the attempt of the strong man fettered to laugh at his own consciousness of slaveryto deny the existence of his chainsto pretend to himself that he likes them  to us some of those wildest rob the ranter bursts of blackguardism are most deeply mournful hardly needing that the sympathies which they stir up should be heightened by the little scraps of prayer and bitter repentance which lie up and down among their uglier brethren the disjecta membra of a great de profundis perhaps not all unheard these latter pieces are most significant  the very doggrel of them the total absence of any attempt at ornament in diction or polish in metre is proof complete of their deep heartwrung sincerity  they are like the wail of a lost child rather than the remorse of a titan  the heart of the man was so young to the last the boyvein in him as perhaps in all great poets beating on through manhood for good and for evil  no there was parade there as of the lost woman who tries to hide her selfdisgust by staring you out of countenance but of complacency and exultation none  on one point namely politics burnss higher sympathies seem to have been awakened  it had been better for him in a worldly point of view that they had not  in an intellectual and even in a moral point of view far worse  a fellowfeeling with the french revolution in the mind of a young man of that day was a sign of moral health which we should have been sorry to miss in him  unable to foresee the outcome of the great struggle having lost faith in those everlasting truths religious and political which it was madly setting at naught what could it appear to him but an awakening from the dead a return to young and genial health a purifying thunderstorm  such was his dream the dream of thousands more and not so wrong a one after all  for that since that fearful outburst of the nether pit all europe has arisen and awakened into manifold and beautiful new life who can deny  we are not what we were but better or rather with boundless means of being better if we will we have entered a fresh era of time for good and evil the fact is patent in every sermon we hear in every book we read in every invention even the most paltry which we see registered  shall we think hardly of the man who saw the dawn of our own day and welcomed it cheerfully and hopefully even though he fancied the mistspectres to be elements of the true sunrise and knew notand who knowsthe purposes of him whose paths are in the great deep and his ways past finding out  at least the greater part of his influence on the times which have followed him is to be ascribed to that very radicalism which in the eyes of the respectable around him had sealed his doom and consigned him to ignoble oblivion  it has been with the working men who read him a passport for the rest of his writings it has allured them to listen to him when he spoke of high and holy things which but for him they might have long ago tossed away as worthless in the recklessness of ignorance and discontent they could trust his cottars saturday night they could believe that he spoke from his heart when in deep anguish he cries to the god whom he had forgotten while they would have turned with a distrustful sneer from the sermon of the sleek and comfortable minister who in their eyes however humbly born had deserted his class and gone over to the camp of the enemy and the fleshpots of egypt  after the time of burns as was to be expected scottish song multiplies itself tenfold  the nation becomes awakened to the treasures of its own old literature and attempts what after all alas is but a revival and like most revivals not altogether a successful one  of the twelve hundred songs contained in mr whitelaws excellent collection whereof more than a hundred and fifty are either wholly or partly burnss the small proportion written before him are decidedly far superior in value to those written after him a discouraging fact though not difficult to explain if we consider the great social changes which have been proceeding the sterner subjects of thought which have been arising during the last halfcentury  true song requires for its atmosphere a state rather of careless arcadian prosperity than of struggle and doubt of earnest looking forward to an unknown future and pardonable regret for a dying past and in that state the mind of the masses throughout north britain has been weltering confusedly for the last few years  the new and more complex era into which we are passing has not yet sufficiently opened itself to be sung about men hardly know what it is much less what it will be and while they are hard at work creating it they have no breath to spare in talking of it  one thing they do see and feel painfully enough at times namely that the old scottish pastoral life is passing away before the combined influence of manufactures and the largefarm system to be replaced doubtless hereafter by something better but in the meanwhile dragging down with it in its decay but too much that can ill be spared of that old society which inspired ramsay and burns hence the later scottish songwriters seldom really sing their proses want the unconscious lilt and flash of their old models they will hardly go the true test of a song without music  the true test we say again of a song  who needs music however fitting and beautiful the accustomed air may happen to be to roys wife of aldivalloch or the bride cam out o the byre or either of the casts of the flowers of the forest or to auld lang syne itself they bubble right up out of the heart and by virtue of their inner and unconscious melody which all that is true to the heart has in it shape themselves into a song and are not shaped by any notes whatsoever  so with many most indeed of burnss and a few of allan cunninghams the wet sheet and a flowing sail for instance but the great majority of these later songs seem if the truth is to be spoken inspirations at second hand of people writing about things which they would like to feel and which they ought to feel because others used to feel them in old times but which they do not feel as their forefathers felta sort of poetical tractarianism in short  their metre betrays them as well as their words in both they are continually wandering unconsciously to themselves into the elegiacexcept when on one subject whereon the muse of scotia still warbles at first hand and from the depths of her heartnamely alas the barley bree  and yet never even on this beloved theme has she risen again to the height of burnss bacchanalian songs  but when sober there is a sadness about the scottish muse nowadays as perhaps there ought to beand the utterances of hers which ring the truest are laments  we question whether in all mr whitelaws collection there is a single modern poem placing burns as the transition point between the old and new which rises so high or pierces so deep with all its pastoral simplicity as smiberts widows lament   afore the lammas tide    had dwind the birken tree in a our waterside    nae wife was blest like me a kind gudeman and twa    sweet bairns were round me here but theyre a taen awa    sin the fa o the year  sair trouble cam our gate    and made me when it cam a bird without a mate    a ewe without a lamb our hay was yet to maw    and our corn was yet to shear when they a dwined awa    in the fa o the year  i daurna look afield    for aye i trow to see the form that was a bield    to my wee bairns and me but wind and weet and snaw    they

march winds blaw    may she far far frae here meet them a thats awa    sin the fa o the year   it seems strange why the man who could write this who shows in the minor key of metre which he has so skilfully chosen such an instinct for the true music of words could not have written much more  and yet perhaps we have ourselves given the reason already there was not much more to sing about  the fashion of imitating old jacobite songs is past the mine now being exhausted to the great comfort of sincerity and common sense  the peasantry whose courtship rich in animal health yet not over pure and refined allan ramsay sang a hundred years ago are learning to think and act and emigrate as well as to make love  the age of theocritus and bion has given place toshall we say the age of the caesars or the irruption of the barbariansand the lovesingers of the north are beginning to feel that if that passion is to retain any longer its rightful place in their popular poetry it must be spoken of henceforth in words as lofty and refined as those in which the most educated and the most gifted speak of it  hence in the transition between the old animalism and the new spiritualism a jumble of the two elements not always felicitous attempts at ambitious description after burnss worst manner at subjective sentiment after the worst manner of the world in general and yet all the while a consciousness that there was something worth keeping in the simple objective style of the old school without which the new thoughtfulness would be hollow and barren and windy and so the two are patched together new cloth into an old garment making the rent worse  accordingly these new songs are universally troubled with the disease of epithets  ryans exquisite lass wi the bonny blue een is utterly spoiled by two offences of this kind   shell steal out to meet her loved donald again   and   the worlds false and vanishing scene   as allan cunninghams still more exquisite lass of preston mill is by one subjective figure   six hills are woolly with my sheep    six vales are lowing with my kye   burns doubtless committed the same fault again and again but in his time it was the fashion and the older models for models they are and will remain for ever had not been studied and analysed as they have been since  burns indeed actually spoiled one or two of his own songs by altering them from their first cast to suit the sentimental taste of his time  the first version for instance of the banks and braes o bonnie doon is far superior to the second and more popular one because it dares to go without epithets compare the second stanza of each   thoult break my heart thou bonnie bird    that sings upon the bough thou minds me o the happy days    when my fause love was true       thoult break my heart thou warbling bird    that wantons through the flowery thorn thou minds me o departed joys    departed never to return   what is said in the latter stanza which has not been said in the former and said more dramatically more as the images would really present themselves to the speakers mind  it would be enough for him that the bird was bonnie and singing and his very sorrow would lead him to analyse and describe as little as possible a thing which so painfully contrasted with his own feelings whether the thorn was flowery or not would not have mattered to him unless he had some distinct association with the thornflowers in which case he would have brought out the image full and separate and not merely thrown it in as a makeweight to thornand this is the great reason why epithets are nine times out of ten mistakes in song and ballad poetry he never would have thought of departed before he thought of joys  a very little consideration of the actual processes of thought in such a case will show the truth of our observation and the instinctive wisdom of the older songwriters in putting the epithet as often as possible after the noun instead of before it even at the expense of grammar  they are bad things at all times in song poetry these epithets and accordingly we find that the best german writers like uhland and heine get rid of them as much as possible and succeed thereby every word striking and ringing down with full force no cushion of an epithet intruding between the readers brainanvil and the poets hammer to break the blow  in uhlands three burschen if we recollect right there are but two epithets and those of the simplest descriptive kind  thy fair daughter and a black pall  were there more we question whether the poet would have succeeded as he has done in making our flesh creep as he leads us on from line to line and verse to verse  so tennyson the greatest of our living poets eschews as much as possible in his later writings these same epithets except in cases where they are themselves objective and pictorialin short the very things which he wants you to look at as for instance      and into silver arrows break the sailing moon in creek and cove   this is fair enough but indeed after laying down our rule we must confess that it is very difficult to keep always true to it in a language which does not like the latin and german allow us to put our adjectives very much where we choose  nevertheless whether we can avoid it or not every time we place before the noun an epithet which like departed joys relates to our consciousness concerning the object and not merely to the object itself or an epithet which like flowery thorn gives us before we get to the object itself those accidents of the object which we only discern by a second look by analysis and reflectionfor the thorn if in the flower would look to us at the first glance not flowery but white snowy or what you will which expresses colour and not scientific fact every time we repeat this is done the poet descends from the objective and dramatic domain of song into the subjective and reflective one of elegy  but the field in which burnss influence has been as was to be expected most important and most widely felt is in the poems of working men  he first proved that it was possible to become a poet and a cultivated man without deserting his class either in station or in sympathies nay that the healthiest and noblest elements of a lowlyborn poets mind might be perhaps must be the very feelings and thoughts which he brought up with him from below not those which he received from above in the course of his artificial culture from the example of burns therefore many a working man who would otherwise have died and given no sign has taken courage and spoken out the thought within him in verse or prose not always wisely and well but in all cases as it seems to us in the belief that he had a sort of divine right to speak and be heard since burns had broken down the artificial icewall of centuries and asserted by act as well as song that a mans a man for a that  almost every volume of working mens poetry which we have read seems to re echo poor nicolls spirited though somewhat overstrained address to the scottish genius   this is the natal day of him    who born in want and poverty burst from his fetters and arose    the freest of the free  arose to tell the watching earth    what lowly men could feel and do to show that mighty heavenlike souls    in cottage hamlets grew  burns thou hast given us a name    to shield us from the taunts of scorn the plant that creeps amid the soil    a glorious flower has borne  before the proudest of the earth    we stand with an uplifted brow like us thou wast a toilworn man    and we are noble now   the critic looking calmly on may indeed question whether this new fashion of versewriting among working men has been always conducive to their own happiness  as for absolute success as poets that was not to be expected of one in a hundred so that we must not be disappointed if among the volumes of working mens poetry of which we give a list at the head of our article only two should be found on perusal to contain any writing of a very high order although these volumes form a very small portion of the verses which have been written during the last forty years by men engaged in the rudest and most monotonous toil  to every man so writing the art doubtless is an ennobling one  the habit of expressing thought in verse not only indicates culture but is a culture in itself of a very high order  it teaches the writer to think tersely and definitely it evokes in him the humanising sense of grace and melody not merely by enticing him to study good models but by the very act of composition  it gives him a vent for sorrows doubts and aspirations which might otherwise fret and canker within breeding as they too often do in the utterly dumb english peasant selfdevouring meditation dogged melancholy and fierce fanaticism and if the effect of versewriting had stopped there all had been well but bad models have had their effect as well as good ones on the halftutored taste of the working men and engendered in them but too often a fondness for frothy magniloquence and ferocious raving neither morally nor aesthetically profitable to themselves or their readers  there are excuses for the fault the young of all ranks naturally enough mistake noise for awfulness and violence for strength and there is generally but too much in the biographies of these working poets to explain if not to excuse a vein of bitterness which they certainly did not learn from their master burns  the two poets who have done them most harm in teaching the evil trick of cursing and swearing are shelley and the cornlaw rhymer and one can well imagine how seducing two such models must be to men struggling to utter their own complaints  of shelley this is not the place to speak  but of the cornlaw rhymer we may say here that howsoever he may have been indebted to burnss example for the notion of writing at all he has profited very little by burnss own poems  instead of the genial loving tone of the great scotchman we find in elliott a tone of deliberate savageness all the more ugly because evidently intentional  he tries to curse he delightsmay we be forgiven if we misjudge the manin cursing he makes a science of it he defiles of malice prepense the loveliest and sweetest thoughts and scenes and he can be most sweet by giving some sudden sickening revulsion to his readers feelings and he does it generally with a power which makes it at once as painful to the calmer reader as alluring to those who are struggling with the same temptations as the poet  now and then his trick drags him down into sheer fustian and bombast but not always  there is a terrible dantean vividness of imagination about him perhaps unequalled in england in his generation  his poems are like his countenance coarse and ungoverned yet with an intensity of eye a rugged massiveness of feature which would be grand but for the seeming deficiency of love and of humourloves twin and inseparable brother  therefore it is that although single passages may be found in his writings of which milton himself need not have been ashamed his efforts at dramatic poetry are utter failures dark monstrous unrelieved by any really human vein of feeling or character  as in feature so in mind he has not even the delicate and graceful organisation which made up in milton for the want of tenderness and so enabled him to write if not a drama yet still the sweetest of masques and idyls  rather belonging to the same school than to that of burns though never degrading itself by elliotts ferocity is that extraordinary poem the purgatory of suicides by thomas cooper  as he is still in the prime of life and capable of doing more and better than he yet has done we will not comment on it as freely as we have on elliott except to regret a similar want of softness and sweetness and also of a clearness and logical connection of thought in which elliott seldom fails except when cursing  the imagination is hardly as vivid as elliotts though the fancy and invention the polish of the style and the indications of profound thought on all subjects within the poets reach are superior in every way to those of the cornlaw rhymer and when we consider that the man who wrote it had to gather his huge store of classic and historic anecdote while earning his living first as a shoemaker and then as a wesleyan country preacher we can only praise and excuse and hope that the day may come when talents of so high an order will find some healthier channel for their energies than that in which they now are flowing  our readers may wonder at not seeing the ettrick shepherds poems among the list at the head of the article  it seems to us however that we have done right in omitting them  doubtless he too was awakened into song by the example of burns but he seems to us to owe little to his great predecessor beyond the general consciousness that there was a virgin field of poetry in scotch scenery manners and legendsa debt which walter scott himself probably owed to the ayrshire peasant just as much as hogg did  indeed we perhaps are right in saying that had burns not lived neither wilson galt allan cunningham or the crowd of lesser writers who have found material for their fancy in scotch peculiarities would have written as they have  the three first names wilsons above all must have been in any case distinguished yet it is surely no derogation to some of the most exquisite rural sketches in christopher norths recreations to claim them as the intellectual fosterchildren of the cottars saturday night  in this respect certainly the ettrick shepherd has a place in burnss school and in our own opinion one which has been very much overrated  but the deeper elements of burnss mind those which have especially endeared him to the working man reappear very little or not at all in hogg  he left his class too much below him became too much of the mere aesthetic prodigy and member of a literary clique frittered away his great talents in brilliant talk and insincere jacobite songs and in fine worked no deliverance on the earth  it is sad to have to say this  but we had it forced upon us painfully enough a few days ago when rereading kilmeny  there may be beautiful passages in it but it is not coherent not natural not honest  it is throughout an affectation of the manichaean sentimentalsublime which god never yet put into the heart of any brawny longheaded practical borderer and which he therefore probably put into his own head or as we call it affected for the time being a method of poetry writing which comes forth out of nothing and into nothing must return  this is unfortunate perhaps for the world for we question whether a man of talents in anywise to be compared with those of the ettrick shepherd has followed in the footsteps of burns  poor tannahill whose sad story is but too well known perished early at the age of thirtysix leaving behind him a good many pretty lovesongs of no great intrinsic value if the specimens of them given in mr whitelaws collection are to be accepted as the best  like all burnss successors including even walter scott and hogg we have but to compare him with his original to see how altogether unrivalled on his own ground the ayrshire farmer was  in one feature only tannahills poems and those later than him except where pedantically archaist like many of motherwells are an improvement on burns  namely in the more easy and complete interfusion of the two dialects the norse scotch and the romanesque english which allan ramsay attempted in vain to unite while burns though not succeeding by any means perfectly welded them together into something of continuity and harmonythus doing for the language of his own country very much what chaucer did for that of englanda happy union in the opinion of those who as we do look on the vernacular norse scotch as no barbaric dialect but as an independent tongue possessing a copiousness melody terseness and picturesqueness which makes it both in prose and verse a far better vehicle than the popular english for many forms of thought  perhaps the young peasant who most expressly stands out as the pupil and successor of burns is robert nicoll  he is a lesser poet doubtless than his master and a lesser man if the size and number of his capabilities be looked at but he is a greater man in that from the beginning to the end of his career he seems to have kept that very wholeness of heart and head which poor burns lost nicolls story is mutatis mutandis that of the bethunes and many a noble young scotsman more  parents holding a farm between perth and dunkeld they and theirs before them for generations inhabitants of the neighbourhood decent honest godfearing people  the farm is lost by reverses and manfully robert nicolls father becomes a day labourer on the fields which he lately rented  and there begins for the boy from his earliest recollections a life of steady sturdy drudgery  but they must have been grand old folk these parents and in no wise addicted to wringing their hands over the great might havebeen  like true scots bible lovers they do believe in a god and in a will of god underlying absolute loving and believe that the mighthavebeen ought not to have been simply because it has not been and so they put their shoulders to the new collar patiently cheerfully hopefully and teach the boys to do the same  the mother especially as so many great mens mothers do stands out large and heroic from the time when the farm being gone she the ardent bookwoman finds her time too precious to be spent in reading and sets little robert to read to her as she workswhat a pictureto the last sad day when wanting money to come up to leeds to see her dying darling she shore for the siller rather than borrow it and her sons life is like her owna most pure joyous valiant little epic  robert does not even take to work as something beyond himself uninteresting and painful which however must be done courageously  he lives in it enjoys it as his proper element one which is no more a burden and an exertion to him than the rush of the strid is to the trout who plays and feels in it day and night unconscious of the amount of muscular strength which he puts forth in merely keeping his place in the stream  whether carrying kenilworth in his plaid to the woods to read while herding or selling currants and whisky as the perth storekeepers apprentice or keeping his little circulating library in dundee tormenting his pure heart with the thought of the twenty pounds which his mother has borrowed wherewith to start him or editing the leeds times or lying on his early deathbed just as life seems to be opening clear and broad before him he   bates not a jot of heart or hope   but steers right onward singing over his work without bluster or selfgratulation for very joy at having work to do  there is a keen practical insight about him rarely combined in these days with his singleminded determination to do good in his generation  his eye is single and his whole body full of light   it would indeed writes the grocers boy encouraging his despondent and somewhat werterean friend be hangmans work to write articles one day to be forgotten tomorrow if that were all but you forget the comfortthe repayment  if one prejudice is overthrown one error rendered untenable if but one step in advance be the consequence of your articles and minethe consequences of the labour of all true menare we not deeply repaid   or again in a right noble letter to his noble mother   that money of rs hangs like a millstone about my neck  if i had paid it i would never borrow again from mortal man  but do not mistake me mother i am not one of those men who faint and falter in the great battle of life  god has given me too strong a heart for that  i look upon earth as a place where every man is set to struggle and to work that he may be made humble and purehearted and fit for that better land for which earth is a preparationto which earth is the gate    if men would but consider how little of real evil there is in all the ills of which they are so much afraid poverty includedthere would be more virtue and happiness and less world and mammonworship on earth than is  i think mother that to me has been given talent and if so that talent was given to make it useful to man   and yet there is a quiet selfrespect about him withal   in my short course through life says he in confidence to a friend at oneandtwenty i have never feared an enemy or failed a friend and i live in the hope i never shall  for the rest i have written my heart in my poems and rude and unfinished and hasty as they are it can be read there    from seven years of age to this very hour i have been dependent only on my own head and hands for everythingfor very bread  long years agoay even in childhoodadversity made me think and feel and suffer and would pride allow me i could tell the world many a deep tragedy enacted in the heart of a poor forgotten uncaredfor boy    but i thank god that though i felt and suffered the scathing blast neither blunted my perceptions of natural and moral beauty nor by withering the affections of my heart made me a selfish man often when i look back i wonder how i bore the burdenhow i did not end the evil day at once and for ever   such is the man in his normal state and as was to be expected gods blessing rests on him  whatever he sets his hand to succeeds within a few weeks of his taking the editorship of the leeds times its circulation begins to rise rapidly as was to be expected with an honest man to guide it  for nicolls political creed though perhaps neither very deep nor wide lies clear and single before him as everything else which he does  he believes naturally enough in ultraradicalism according to the fashions of the reform bill era that is the right thing and for that he will work day and night body and soul and if needs be die  there in the editors den at leeds he begins to see the truth of what you told me about the worlds unworthiness but stop a little  i am not sad as yet     if i am hindered from feeling the soul of poetry among woods and fields i yet trust i am struggling for something worth prizing something of which i am not ashamed and need not be  if there be aught on earth worth aspiring to it is the lot of him who is enabled to do something for his miserable and suffering fellowmen and this you and i will try to do at least  his friend is put to work a ministerial paper with orders not to be rash but to elevate the population gradually and finding those orders to imply a considerable leaning towards the byends lukewarm and facingbothways school kicks over the traces wisely in nicolls eyes and breaks loose   keep up your spirits says honest nicoll  you are higher at this moment in my estimation in your own and that of every honest man than you ever were before  taits advice was just such as i should have expected of him honest as honesty itself  you must never again accept a paper but where you can tell the whole truth without fear or favour     tell e the brokenloose editors ladylove from me to estimate as she ought the nobility and determination of the man who has dared to act as you have done  prudent men will say that you are hasty  but you have done right whatever may be the consequences   this is the spirit of robert nicoll the spirit which is the fruit of early purity and selfrestraint of living on breadandcheese and water that he may buy books of walking out to the inch of perth at four oclock on summer mornings to write and read in peace before he returns to the currants and the whisky  the nervous simplicity of the man come out in the very nervous simplicity of the prose he writes and though there be nothing very new or elevated in it or indeed in his poems themselves we call on our readers to admire a phenomenon so rare in the upper classes at least in these days and taking a lesson from the peasants son rejoice with us that a man is born into the world  for nicoll as few do practises what he preaches  it seems to him once on a time right and necessary that sir william molesworth should be returned for leeds and nicoll having so determined throws himself body and soul into the contest with such ardour that his wife afterwards said and we can well believe it that if sir william had failed robert would have died on the instantwhy not  having once made up his mind that that was the just and right thing the thing which was absolutely good for leeds and the human beings who lived in it was it not a thing to die for even if it had been but the election of a new beadle  the advanced sentry is set to guard some obscure worthless dikeendobscure and worthless in itself but to him a centre of infinite duty  true the fate of the camp does not depend on its being taken if the enemy round it there are plenty behind to blow them out again  but that is no reason whatsoever why he before any odds should throw his musket over his shoulder and retreat gracefully to the lines  he was set there to stand by that whether dikeend or representation of leeds that is the right thing for him and for that right he will fight and if he be killed die  so have all brave men felt and so have all brave deeds been done since man walked the earth  it is because that spirit the spirit of faith has died out among us that so few brave deeds are done now except on battlefields and in hovels whereof none but god and the angels know  so the man prospers  several years of honourable and self restraining love bring him a wife beautiful loving worshipping his talents a help meet for him such as god will send at times to those whom he loves  kind men meet and love and help himthe johnstones mr tait william and mary howitt sir william molesworth hearing of his last illness sends him unsolicited fifty pounds which as we understand it nicoll accepts without foolish bluster about independence  why notman should help man and be helped by him would he not have done as much for sir william  nothing to us proves nicolls heartwholeness more than the way in which he talks of his benefactors in a tone of simple gratitude and affection without fawning and without vapouring  the man has too much selfrespect to consider himself lowered by accepting a favour  but he must go after all  the editors den at leeds is not the place for lungs bred on perthshire breezes and work rises before him huger and heavier as he goes on till he drops under the ever increasing load  he will not believe it at first  in sweet childlike playful letters he tells his mother that it is nothing it has done him goodopened the grave before his eyes and taught him to think of death  he trusts that he has not borne this and suffered and thought in vain  this too he hopes is to be a fresh lessonpage of experience for his work  alas a few months more of bitter suffering and of generous kindness and love from all around himand it is over with him at the age of twentythree  shall we regret himshall we not rather believe that god knew best and considering the unhealthy moral atmosphere of the secondclass press and the strange confused ways into which old ultraradicalism finding itself too narrow for the new problems of the day has stumbled and floundered during the last fifteen years believe that he might have been a worse man had he been a longerlived one and thank heaven that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come  as it is he ends as he began  the first poem in his book is the ha bible and the last written a few days before his death is still the deathsong of a manwithout fear without repining without boasting blessing and loving the earth which he leaves yet with a clear joyful eye upwards and outwards and homewards  and so ends his little epic as we called it  may scotland see many such another  the actual poetic value of his verses is not firstrate by any means he is far inferior to burns in range of subject as he is in humour and pathos  indeed there is very little of these latter qualities in him anywhererather playfulness flashes of childlike fun as in the provost and bonnie bessie lee  but he has attained a mastery over english a simplicity and quiet which burns never did and also we need not say a moral purity  his poems illustrative of the scotch peasantry are charming throughoutalive and bright with touches of real humanity and sympathy with characters apparently antipodal to his own  his more earnest poems are somewhat tainted with that cardinal fault of his school of which he steered so clear in prosefine words yet he never like the cornlaw rhymer falls a cursing  he is evidently not a good hater even of priests and kings and aristocrats and superstition or perhaps he worked all that froth safely over and off in debatingclub speeches and leading articles and left us in these poems the genuine metheglin of his inner heart sweet clear and strong for there is no form of lovable or right thing which this man has come across which he does not seem to have appreciated besides pure love and the beauties of naturethose on which every man of poetic power and a great many of none as a matter of course have a word to sayhe can feel for and with the drunken beggar and the warriors of the ruined manorhouse and the monks of the abbey and the old mailed normans with their priest with cross and counted beads in the little saxon chapelthings which a radical editor might have been excused for passing by with a sneer  his verses to his wife are a delicious little glimpse of eden and his peoples anthem rises into somewhat of true grandeur by virtue of simplicity   lord from thy blessed throne sorrow look down upon       god save the poor teach them true liberty make them from tyrants free let their homes happy be       god save the poor  the arms of wicked men do thou with might restrain       god save the poor raise thou their lowliness succour thou their distress thou whom the meanest bless       god save the poor  give them stanch honesty let their pride manly be       god save the poor help them to hold the right give them both truth and might lord of all life and light       god save the poor   and so we leave robert nicoll with the parting remark that if the poems illustrative of the feelings of the intelligent and religious among the workingclasses of scotland be fair samples of that which they profess to be scotland may thank god that in spite of temporary manufacturing rotheaps she is still whole at heart and that the influence of her great peasant poet though it may seem at first likely to be adverse to christianity has helped as we have already hinted to purify and not to taint to destroy the fungus but not to touch the heart of the grand old covenantkirk lifetree  still sweeter and alas still sadder is the story of the two bethunes  if nicolls life as we have said be a solitary melody and short though triumphant strain of workmusic theirs is a harmony and true concert of fellowjoys fellowsorrows fellowdrudgery fellowauthorship mutual throughout lovely in their jointlife and in their deaths not far divided  alexander survives his brother john only long enough to write his memoirs and then follows and we have his story given us by mr mcombie in a simple unassuming little volumenot to be read without many thoughts perhaps not rightly without tears  mr mcombie has been wise enough not to attempt panegyric  he is all but prolix in details filling up some half of his volume with letters of preternatural length from alexander to his publishers and critics and from the said publishers and critics to alexander altogether of an unromantic and business like cast but entirely successful in doing that which a book should donamely in showing the world that here was a man of like passions with ourselves who bore from boyhood to the grave hunger cold wet rags brutalising and healthdestroying toil and all the storms of the world the flesh and the devil and conquered them every one  alexander is set at fourteen to throw earth out of a ditch so deep that it requires the full strength of a grown man and loses flesh and health under the exertion he is twice blown up with his own blast in quarrying and left for dead recovers slowly maimed and scarred with the loss of an eye  john when not thirteen is set to stonebreaking on the roads during intense cold and has to keep himself from being frostbitten and heartbroken by monkey gambols takes to the weaving trade and having helped his family by the most desperate economy to save ten pounds wherewith to buy looms begins to work them with his brother as an apprentice and finds the whole outlay rendered useless the very same year by the failures of 1825 26  so the two return to daylabour at fourteenpence aday  john in a struggle to do taskwork honestly overexerts himself and ruins his digestion for life  next year he is set in november to clean out a watercourse kneedeep in water then to take marl from a pit and then to drain standing water off a swamp during an intense december frost and finds himself laid down with a three months cough and all but sleepless illness laying the foundation of the consumption which destroyed him  but the two brothers will not give in  poetry they will write and they write it to the best of their powers on scraps of paper after the drudgery of the day in a cabin pervious to every shower teaching themselves the right spelling of the words from some christian remembrancer or otherapparently not our meek and unbiassed contemporary of that name and all this without neglecting their work a day or even an hour when the weather permittedthe only thing which tempted them to fret beinghear it readers and perpendthe being kept at home by rain and snow then an additional malady apparently some calculous one comes on john and stops by him for the six remaining years of his life  yet between 1826 and 1832 john had saved fourteen pounds out of his miserable earnings to be expended to the last farthing on his brothers recovery from the second quarry accident  surely the devil is trying hard to spoil these men  but no  they are made perfect by sufferings  in the house with one long narrow room and a small vacant space at the end of it lighted by a single pane of glass they write and write untiring during the long summer evenings poetry tales of the scottish peasant life which at last bring them in somewhat and a work on practical economy which is bepraised and corrected by kind critics in edinburgh and at last published without a sale  perhaps one cause of its failure might be found in those very corrections  there were too many violent political allusions in it complains their good mentor of edinburgh and persuades them seemingly the most meek and teachable of heroes to omit them though alexander while submitting pleads fairly enough for retaining them in a passage which we will give as a specimen of the sort of english possible to be acquired by a scotch daylabourer selfeducated all but the rudiments of reading and writing and a few lectures on popular poetry from a young student of aberdeen now the rev mr adamson who must look back on the friendship which he bore these two young men as one of the noblest pages in his life   talk to the many of religion and they will put on a long face confess that it is a thing of the greatest importance to alland go away and forget the whole  talk to them of education they will readily acknowledge that its a braw thing to be weel learned and begin a lamentation which is only shorter than the lamentations of jeremiah because they cannot make it as long on the ignorance of the age in which they live but they neither stir hand nor foot in the matter  but speak to them of politics and their excited countenances and kindling eye show in a moment how deeply they are interested  politics are therefore an important feature and an almost indispensable element in such a work as mine  had it consisted solely of exhortations to industry and rules of economy it would have been dismissed with an ou ay its braw for him to crack that way  but if he were whaur we are deed he wad just hae to do as we do  but by mixing up the science with politics and giving it an occasional political impetus a different result may be reasonably expected  in these days no man can be considered a patriot or friend of the poor who is not also a politician   it is amusing bythebye to see how the world changes its codes of respectability and how what is anathema in one generation becomes trite orthodoxy in the next  the political sins in the work were that my brother had attacked the cornlaws with some severity and i have attempted to level a battery against that sort of servile homage which the poor pay to the rich  there is no use pursuing the story much farther  they again save a little money and need it for the estate on which they have lived from childhood changing hands they are with their aged father expelled from the dear old dogkennel to find houseroom where they can  why notit was not in the bond  the house did not belong to them nothing of it at least which could be specified in any known lease  true there may have been associations  but what associations can men be expected to cultivate on fourteenpence aday so they must forth with their two aged parents and build with their own hands a new house elsewhere having saved some thirty pounds from the sale of their writings  the house as we understand stands to this dayhereafter to become a sort of artisans caaba and pilgrims station only second to burnss grave  that at least it will become whenever the meaning of the words worth and worship shall become rightly understood among us  for what are these men if they are not heroes and saints  not of the popish sort abject and effeminate but of the true human evangelic sort masculine and grandlike the figures in raffaelles cartoons compared with those of fra bartolomeo  not from superstition not from selfish prudence but from devotion to their aged parents and the righteous dread of dependence they die voluntary celibates although their writings show that they too could have loved as nobly as they did all other things  the extreme of endurance selfrestraint of conquest of the flesh outward as well as inward is the lifelong lot of these men and they go through it  they have their share of injustice tyranny disappointment one by one each bright boys dream of success and renown is scourged out of their minds and sternly and lovingly their father in heaven teaches them the lesson of all lessons  by what hours of misery and blank despair that faith was purchased we can only guess the simple strong men give us the result but never dream of sitting down and analysing the process for the worlds amusement or their own glorification  we question indeed whether they could have told us whether the mere fact of a mans being able to dissect himself in public or in private is not proofpatent that he is no man but only a shell of a man with works inside which can of course be exhibited and taken to piecesa rather more difficult matter with flesh and blood  if we believe that god is educating the when the where and the how are not only unimportant but considering who is the teacher unfathomable to us and it is enough to be able to believe with john bethune that the lord of all things is influencing us through all things whether sacraments or sabbaths or sungleams or showersall things are ours for all are his and we are his and he is oursand for the rest to say with the same john bethune   oh god of glory thou hast treasured up    for me my little portion of distress but with each draughtin every bitter cup    thy hand hath mixed to make its soreness less some cordial drop for which thy name i bless and offer up my mite of thankfulness    thou hast chastised my frame with dire disease long obdurate and painful and thy hand    hath wrung cold sweatdrops from my brow for these i thank thee too  though pangs at thy command have compassed me about still with the blow patience sustained my soul amid its woe   of the actual literary merit of these mens writings there is less to be said  however extraordinary considering the circumstances under which they were written may be the polish and melody of johns verse or the genuine spiritual health deep deathanddevildefying earnestness and shrewd practical wisdom which shines through all that either brother writes they do not possess any of that fertile originality which alone would have enabled them as it did burns to compete with the literary savants who though for the most part of inferior genius have the help of information and appliances from which they were shut out  judging them as the true critic like the true moralist is bound to do according to what they had not according to what they had not they are men who with average advantages might have been famous in their day  god thought it better for them to hide them in his tabernacle from the strife of tongues andseldom believed truismhe knows best  alexander shall not according to his early dreams earn nine hundred pounds by writing a book like burns even though his ideal method of spending be to buy all the boys in the parish new shoes with iron tackets and heels and send them home with shillings for their mothers and feed their fathers on wheat bread and milk with tea and bannocks for sabbathdays and build a house for the poor old toil stiffened man whom he once saw draining the hill field with a yard full of gooseberries and an appletreenot that nor even as the world judges better than that shall he be allowed to do  the poor for whom he writes his practical economy shall not even care to read it and he shall go down to the grave a failure and a lost thing in the eyes of men  but not in the eyes of grand godfearing old alison christie his mother as he brings her scrap by scrap the proofs of their dead idols poems which she has prayed to be spared just to see once in print and when the last halfsheet is read loses her sight for evernot in her eyes nor in those of god who saw him in the cold winter mornings wearing johns clothes to warm them for the dying man before he got up  his grief at his brothers death is inconsolable  he feels for the first time in his life what a lot is hisfor he feels for the first time that   parent and friend and brother gone i stand upon the earth alone   four years he lingers friends begin to arise from one quarter and another but he not altogether wisely or well refuses all pecuniary help  at last mr hugh miller recommends him to be editor of a projected nonintrusion paper in dumfries with a salary to him boundless of 100l ayear  too late  the iron has entered too deeply into his soul in a few weeks more he is lying in his brothers gravelovely and pleasant in their lives and in their deaths not divided  william thom of inverury is a poet altogether of the same school his rhymes and recollections of a handloom weaver are superior to those of either nicoll or the bethunes the little lovesongs in the volume reminding us of burnss best manner and the two languages in which he writes being better amalgamated as it seems to us than in any scotch songwriter  moreover there is a terseness strength and grace about some of these little songs which would put to shame many a volume of vague and windy verse which the press sees yearly sent forth by men who instead of working at the loom have been pampered from their childhood with all the means and appliances of good taste and classic cultivation  we have room only for one specimen of his verse not the most highly finished but of a beauty which can speak for itself   dreamings of the bereaved  the morning breaks bonny oer mountain and stream an troubles the hallowed breath of my dream the gowd light of morning is sweet

nights deathly reign wi souls of the dearest i mingle me then the gowd light of morning is lightless to me but oh for the night with its ghost revelrie   but even more interesting than the poems themselves is the autobiographical account prefixed with its vivid sketches of factory life in aberdeen of the old regime of 1770 when four days did the weavers worksunday monday tuesday were of course jubilee  lawn frills gorged  freely from under the wrists of his fine blue gilt buttoned coat  he dusted his head with white flour on sunday smirked and wore a cane walked in clean slippers on monday tuesday heard him talk war bravado quote volney and get drunk  weaving commenced gradually on wednesday  then were little children pirn fillers and such were taught to steal warily past the gatekeeper concealing the bottle  these wee smugglers had a drop for their services over and above their chances of profiting by the elegant and edifying discussions uttered in their hearing  infidelity was then getting fashionable  but by the time thom enters on his seventeen years weaving in 1814 the nemesis has come  wages are six shillings aweek where they had been forty but the weaver of forty shillings with money instead of wit had bequeathed his vices to the weaver of six shillings with wit instead of money  the introduction of machinery works evil rather than good on account of the reckless way in which it is used and the reckless material which it uses  vacancies in the factory daily made were daily filled by male and female workers often queer enough people and from all partsnone too coarse for using  the pickpocket trained to the loom six months in bridewell came forth a journeyman weaver and his precious experiences were infused into the common moral puddle and in due time did their work  no wonder that the distinctive character of all sunk away  man became less manlywoman unlovely and rude  no wonder that the factory like too many more though a thriving concern to its owners becomes a prime nursery of vice and sorrow  virtue perished utterly within its walls and was dreamed of no more or if remembered at all only in a deep and woful sense of selfdebasementa struggling to forget where it was hopeless to obtain  but to us almost the most interesting passage in his book and certainly the one which bears most directly on the general purpose of this article is one in which he speaks of the effects of song on himself and his fellow factoryworkers   moore was doing all he could for lovesick boys and girls yet they had never enough  nearer and dearer to hearts like ours was the ettrick shepherd then in his full tide of song and story but nearer and dearer still than he or any living songster was our illfated fellowcraftsman tannahill  poor weaver chiel what we owe to you your braes of balquidder and yon burnside and gloomy winter and the minstrels wailing ditty and the noble gleneiffer  oh how they did ring above the rattle of a thousand shuttles  let me again proclaim the debt which we owe to these song spirits as they walked in melody from loom to loom ministering to the lowhearted and when the breast was filled with everything but hope and happiness let only break out the healthy and vigorous chorus a mans a man for a that and the fagged weaver brightens up    who dare measure the restraining influences of these very songs  to us they were all instead of sermons  had one of us been bold enough to enter a church he must have been ejected for the sake of decency his forlorn and curiously patched habiliments would have contested the point of attraction with the ordinary eloquence of that period church bells rang not for us  poets were indeed our priests  but for those the last relic of moral existence would have passed away song was the dewdrop which gathered during the long dark night of despondency and was sure to glitter in the very first blink of the sun  you might have seen auld robin gray wet the eyes that could be tearless amid cold and hunger and weariness and pain  surely surely then there was to that heart one passage left   making all allowance for natural and pardonable highcolouring we recommend this most weighty and significant passage to the attention of all readers and draw an argumentum a fortiori from the high estimation in which thom holds those very songs of tannahills of which we just now spoke somewhat depreciatingly for the extreme importance which we attach to popular poetry as an agent of incalculable power in moulding the minds of nations  the popular poetry of germany has held that great nation together united and heartwhole for centuries in spite of every disadvantage of internal division and the bad influence of foreign taste and the greatest of their poets have not thought it beneath them to add their contributions and their very best to the common treasure meant not only for the luxurious and learned but for the workman and the child at school  in great britain on the contrary the people have been left to form their own tastes and choose their own modes of utterance with great results both for good and evil and there has sprung up before the new impulse which burns gave to popular poetry a considerable literatureconsiderable not only from its truth and real artistic merit but far more so from its being addressed principally to the working classes  even more important is this peoples literature question in our eyes than the more palpable factors of the education question about which we now hear such ado it does seem to us that to take every possible precaution about the spiritual truth which children are taught in school and then leave to chance the more impressive and abiding teaching which popular literature songs especially give them out of doors is as great a niaiserie as that of the tractarians who insisted on getting into the pulpit in their surplices as a sign that the clergy only had the right of preaching to the people while they forgot that by means of a free press of the licence of which they too were not slack to avail themselves every pennyaliner was preaching to the people daily and would do so maugre their surplices to the end of time the man who makes the peoples songs is a true popular preacher whatsoever true or false he sends forth will not be carried home as a sermon often is merely in heads to be forgotten before the week is out  it will ring in the ears and cling round the imagination and follow the pupil to the workshop and the tavern and the fireside even to the deathbed such power is in the magic of rhyme  the emigrant deep in australian forests may take down chalmerss sermons on sabbath evenings from the scanty shelf  but the songs of burns have been haunting his lips and cheering his heart and moulding him unconsciously to himself in clearing and in pasture all the weary week  true if he be what a scotchman should be more than one old hebrew psalm has brought its message to him during these weekdays but there are feelings of his nature on which those psalms not from defect but from their very purpose do not touch  how is he to express them but in the songs which echo them these will keep alive and intensify in him and in the children who learn them from his lips all which is like themselves  is it we ask again to be left to chance what sort of songs these shall be  as for poetry written for the working classes by the upper such attempts at it as we yet have seen may be considered nil  the upper must learn to know more of the lower and to make the lower know more of thema frankness of which we honestly believe they will never have to repent  moreover they must read burns a little more and cavaliers and jacobites a little less  as it is their efforts have been as yet exactly in that direction which would most safely secure the blessings of undisturbed obscurity  whether secular or spiritual they have thought proper to adopt a certain tommygood child tone which whether to glasgow artisans or dorsetshire labourers or indeed for any human being who is grinding among the iron facts of life is to say the least nauseous and the only use of their poematicula has been to demonstrate practically the existence of a great and fearful gulf between those who have and those who have not in thought as well as in purse which must be in the former article at least bridged over as soon as possible if we are to remain one people much longer  the attempts at verse for children are somewhat more successfula certain little moral songs especially said to emanate from the tractarian school yet full of a health spirit and wild sweetness which makes its authoress in our eyes wiser than her teachers  but this is our way  we are too apt to be afraid of the men and take to the children as our pis aller covering our despair of dealing with the majority the adult population in a pompous display of machinery for influencing that very small fraction the children  oh but the destinies of the empire depend on the rising generation  who has told us sohow do we know that they do not depend on the risen generation  who are likely to do more work during our lifetime for good and evilthose who are now between fifteen and fiveandforty or those who are between five and fifteen  yet for those former the many and the working and the powerful all we seem to be inclined to do is to parody scripture and say  he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he that is filthy let him be filthy still  not that we ask any one to sit down and out of mere benevolence to write songs for the people  wooden out of a wooden birthplace would such go forth to feed fires not spirits  but if any man shall read these pages to whom god has given a truly poetic temperament a gallant heart a melodious ear a quick and sympathetic eye for all forms of human joy and sorrow and humour and grandeur an insight which can discern the outlines of the butterfly when clothed in the roughest and most rugged chrysalishide if the teachers of his heart and purposes and not merely of his taste and sentiments have been the great songs of his own and of every land and age if he can see in the divine poetry of david and solomon of isaiah and jeremiah and above all in the parables of him who spake as never man spake the models and elemental laws of a peoples poetry alike according to the will of god and the heart of man if he can welcome gallantly and hopefully the future and yet know that it must be unless it would be a monster and a machine the loving and obedient child of the past if he can speak of the subjects which alone will interest the many on love marriage the sorrows of the poor their hopes political and social their wrongs as well as their sins and duties and that with a fervour and passion akin to the spirit of burns and elliott yet with more calmness more purity more wisdom and therefore with more hope as one who stands upon a vantageground of education and culture sympathising none the less with those who struggle behind him in the valley of the shadow of death yet seeing from the mountain peaks the coming dawn invisible as yet to them then let that man think it no fall but rather a noble rise to leave awhile the barren glacier ranges of pure art for the fertile gardens of practical and popular song and write for the many and with the many in words such as they can understand remembering that that which is simplest is always deepest that the many contain in themselves the few and that when he speaks to the wanderer and the drudge he speaks to the elemental and primeval man and in him speaks to all who have risen out of him  let him try undiscouraged by inevitable failures and if at last he succeeds in giving vent to one song which will cheer hardworn hearts at the loom and the forge or wake one paupers heart with the hope that his children are destined not to die as he died or recall amid canadian forests or australian sheepwalks one thrill of love for the old country her liberties and her laws and her religion to the settlers heart let that man know that he has earned a higher place among the spirits of the wise and good by doing in spite of the unpleasantness of selfdenial the duty which lay nearest him than if he had out rivalled goethe on his own classic ground and made all the cultivated and the comfortable of the earth desert for the exquisite creations of his fancy faust and tasso and iphigenie    the poetry of sacred and legendary art 187    much attention has been excited this year by the alleged fulfilment of a prophecy that the papal power was to receive its deathblowin temporal matters at leastduring the past year 1848  for ourselves we have no more faith in mr fleming the obsolete author who has so suddenly revived in the public esteem than we have in many other interpreters of prophecy  their shallow and bigoted views of past history are enough to damp our faith in their discernment of the future  it does seem that people ought to understand what has been before they predict what will be  history is the track of gods footsteps through time it is in his dealings with our forefathers that we may expect to find the laws by which he will deal with us  not that mr flemings conjecture must be false among a thousand guesses there ought surely to be one right one  and it is almost impossible for earnest men to bend their whole minds however clumsily to one branch of study without arriving at some truth or other  the interpreters of prophecy therefore like all other interpreters have our best wishes though not our sanguine hopes but in the meantime there are surely signs of the approaching ruin of popery more certain than any speculations on the mystic numbers of the revelation  we should point to recent booksnot to books which merely expose rome that has been done long ago usque ad nauseambut to books which do her justice  to mr maitlands dark ages lord lindsays christian art and last but not least to the very charming work of mrs jameson whose title heads this review  in them and in a host of similar works in germany which dr wisemans party hail as signs of coming triumph we fancy we see the deathwarrant of romanism because they prove that rome has nearly done her workthat the protestants are learning the lesson for the sake of which providence has so long borne with that monstrous system  when popery has no more truth to teach us but not till then will it vanish away into its native night  we entreat protestant readers not to be alarmed at us  we have not the slightest tendency toward the stimulants of popery either in their roman unmixed state or in their diluted oxford form  we are with all humility more protestant than protestantism itself our fastidious nostril more sensitive of jesuits than even those of the author of hawkstone has led us at moments to fancy that we scent indulgences in conduitstreet chapel and discern inquisitors in exeter hall itself  seriously none believe more firmly than ourselves that the cause of protestantism is the cause of liberty of civilisation of truth the cause of man and god  and because we think mrs jamesons book especially protestant both in manner and intention and likely to do service to the good cause we are setting to work herein to praise and recommend it  for the time we think for calling popery ill names is past though to abstain is certainly sometimes a sore restraint for english spirits as mrs jameson herself we suspect has found but romanism has been exposed and refuted triumphantly every month for centuries and yet the romish nations are not converted and too many english families of late have found by sad experience that such arguments as are in vogue are powerless to dissuade the young from rushing headlong into the very superstitions which they have been taught from their childhood to deride  the truth is protestantism may well cry  save me from my friends  we have attacked rome too often on shallow grounds and finding our arguments weak have found it necessary to overstate them  we have got angry and caught up the first weapon which came to hand and have only cut our own fingers  we have very nearly burnt the church of england over our heads in our hurry to make a bonfire of the pope  we have been too proud to make ourselves acquainted with the very tenets which we exposed and have made a merit of reading no popish books but such as we were sure would give us a handle for attack and not even them without the precaution of getting into a safe passion beforehand  we have dealt in exaggerations in special pleadings in vile and reckless imputations of motive in suppressions of all palliating facts  we have outraged the common feelings of humanity by remaining blind to the virtues of noble and holy men because they were papists as if a good deed was not good in italy as well as in england  we have talked as if god had doomed to hopeless vileness in this world and reprobation in the next millions of christian people simply because they were born of romish and not of protestant fathers  and we have our reward we have fared like the old woman who would not tell the children what a well was for fear they should fall into one  we see educated and pious englishmen joining the romish communion simply from ignorance of rome and have no talisman wherewith to disenchant them  our medicines produce no effect on them and all we can do is like quacks to increase the dose  of course if ten boxes of morisons pills have killed a man it only proves thathe ought to have taken twelve of them  we are jesting but as an ulster orangeman would say it is in good protestant earnest  in the meantime some of the deepest cravings of the human heart have been left utterly unsatisfied  and be it remembered that such universal cravings are more than fancies they are indications of deep spiritual wants which unless we supply them with the good food which god has made for them will supply themselves with poison indications of spiritual faculties which it is as wicked to stunt or distort by miseducation as it is to maim our own limbs or stupefy our understanding  our humanity is an awful and divine gift our business is to educate it throughoutgod alone must judge which part of it shall preponderate over the rest  but in the last generation and alas in this alsolittle or no proper care has been taken of the love for all which is romantic marvellous heroic which exists in every ingenuous child  schoolboys indeed might if they chose in playhours gloat over the seven champions of christendom or lemprieres gods and goddesses girls might perhaps be allowed to devour by stealth a few fairy tales or the arabian nights but it was only by connivance that their longings were satisfied from the scraps of moslemism paganismanywhere but from christianity protestantism had nothing to do with the imaginationin fact it was a question whether reasonable people had any whether the devil was not the original maker of that troublesome faculty in man woman and child  poetry itself was with most parents a dram to be given like dalbys carminative as a pisaller when children could not possibly be kept quiet by miss edgeworth or mrs mangnall  then as the children grew up and began to know something of history and art two still higher cravings began to seize on many of them if they were at all of deep and earnest character  a desire to associate with religion their new love for the beautiful and a reverence for antiquity a wish to find some bond of union between themselves and the fifteen centuries of christianity which elapsed before the reformation  they applied to protestant teachers and protestant books and received too often the answer that the gospel had nothing to do with artart was either pagan or popish and as for the centuries before the reformation they and all in them belonged utterly to darkness and the pit  as for the heroes of early christianity they were madmen or humbugs their legends devilish and filthy puerilities  they went to the artists and literary men and received the same answer  the medieval writers were fools classical art was the only art all painters before the age of raphael superstitious bunglers  to be sure as fuseli said christianity had helped art a little but then it was the christianity of julio and leonein short of the worst age of popery  these falsehoods have worked out their own punishment  the young are examining for themselves and finding that we have deceived them a revulsion in their feelings has taken place similar to that which took place in germany some halfcentury ago  they are reading the histories of the middle ages and if we call them barbarousthey will grant it and then quote instances of individual heroism and piety which they defy us or any honest man not to admire  they are reading the old legends and when we call them superstitiousthey grant it and then produce passages in which the highest doctrines of christianity are embodied in the most pathetic and noble stories they are looking for themselves at the anteraphaellic artists and when we tell them that fra angelicos pictures are weak affected illdrawn illcolouredthey grant it and then ask us if we can deny the sweetness the purity the rapt devotion the saintly virtue which shines forth from his faces  they ask us how beautiful and holy words or figures can be inspired by an evil spirit  they ask us why they are to deny the excellence of tales and pictures which make men more pure and humble more earnest and noble  they tell us truly that all beauty is gods stamp and that all beauty ought to be consecrated to his service  and then they ask us  if protestantism denies that she can consecrate the beautiful how can you wonder if we love the romanism which can  you say that popery created these glorious schools of art how can you wonder if like overbeck we take the faith for the sake of the art which it inspired  to all which be it true or false and it is both are we to answer merely by shutting our eyes and ears tight and yelling no popery or are we to say boldly to them  we confess ourselves in fault we sympathise with your longings we confess that protestantism has not satisfied them but we assert that the only cause is that protestantism has not been true to herself that art like every other product of the free human spirit is her domain and not poperys that these legends these pictures are beautiful just in as far as they contain in them the germs of those eternal truths about man nature and god which the reformation delivered from bondage that you can admire them and yet remain thorough protestants and more that unless you do remain protestants you will never enter into their full beauty and significance because you will lose sight of those very facts and ideas from which they derive all their healthy power over you  these thoughts are not our own they are uttered all over england thank god just now by many voices and in many forms if they had been boldly spoken during the last fifteen years many a noble spirit we believe might have remained in the church of its fathers which has now taken refuge in romanism from the fruits of mis education  one great reason why romanism has been suffered to drag on its existence is we humbly think that it might force us at last to say this  we have been long learning the lesson till we have learnt it thoroughly romanism will exist and we shall never be safe from its allurements  these thoughts may help to explain our opening sentences as well as the extreme pleasure with which we hail the appearance of mrs jamesons work  the authoress has been struck during her examination of the works of christian artists with the extreme ignorance which prevails in england on the subjects which they portray  we have had she says in an introduction every word of which we recommend as replete with the truest christian philosophy   inquiries into the principles of taste treatises on the sublime and beautiful anecdotes of painting and we abound in antiquarian essays on disputed pictures and mutilated statues but up to a late period any inquiry into the true spirit and significance of works of art as connected with the history of religion and civilisation would have appeared ridiculous or perhaps dangerous  we should have had another cry of no popery and acts of parliament prohibiting the importation of saints and madonnasp xxi   and what should we have gained by it but more ignorance of the excuses for popery and therefore of its real dangers  if protestantism be the truth knowledge of whatsoever kind can only further it  we have found it so in the case of classical literature why should we strain at a gnat and swallow a camel  our boys have not taken to worshipping jupiter and juno by reading about them  we never feared that they would  we knew that we should not make them pagans by teaching them justly to admire the poetry the philosophy the personal virtues of pagans  and in fact the few who since the revival of letters have deserted christianity for what they called philosophic heathenism have in almost every case sympathised not with the excellences but with the worst vices of the greek and roman  they have been men like leo x or the medici who ready to be profligates under any religion found in heathenism only an excuse for their darling sins  the same will be the fruits of a real understanding of the medieval religion  it will only endanger those who carried already the danger in themselves and would have fallen into some other snare if this had been away  why should we fancy that protestantism like the romanism which it opposes is a plant that will not bear the light and can only be protected at the expense of the knowledge of facts  why will we forgot the great spiritual law which mrs jameson and others in these days are fully recognising that we cannot safely combat the errors of any man or system without first giving them full credit for whatever excellences they may retain  such a course is the true fruit of that free spirit of protestantism which ought to delight in recognising good to whatever party it may belong which asserts that every good gift and perfect gift comes directly from above and not through the channel of particular formularies or priesthoods which because it loves faith and virtue for their own sakes and not as mere parts of a catholic system can recognise them and delight in them wherever it finds them   upon these creations of ancient art as mrs jameson says we cannot look as those did for whom they were created we cannot annihilate the centuries which lie between us and them we cannot in simplicity of heart forget the artist in the image he has placed before us nor supply what may be deficient in his work through a reverentially excited fancy  we are critical not credulous  we no longer accept this polytheistic form of christianity and there is little danger i suppose of our falling again into the strange excesses of superstition to which it led  but if i have not much sympathy with modern imitations of medieval art still less can i sympathise with that narrow puritanical jealousy which holds the monuments of a real and earnest faith in contempt  all that god has permitted to exist once in the past should be considered as the possession of the present sacred for example or warning and held as the foundation on which to build up what is better and purerintrod p xx   mrs jameson here speaks in the name of a large and rapidly increasing class  the craving for religious art of which we spoke above is spreading far and wide even in dissenting chapels we see occasional attempts at architectural splendour which would have been considered twenty years ago heretical or idolatrous  and yet with all this there is as mrs jameson says a curious ignorance with regard to the subject of medieval art even though it has now become a reigning fashion among us   we have learned perhaps after running through half the galleries and churches in europe to distinguish a few of the attributes and characteristic figures which meet us at every turn yet without any clear idea of their meaning derivation or relative propriety  the palm of victory we know designates the martyr triumphant in death we so far emulate the critical sagacity of the gardener in zeluco that we have learned to distinguish st laurence by his gridiron and st catherine by her wheel  we are not at a loss to recognise the magdalenes loose hair and lifted eye even when without her skull and her vase of ointment  we learn to know st francis by his brown habit and shaven crown and wasted ardent features but how do we distinguish him from st anthony or st dominick  as for st george and the dragonfrom the st george of the louvreraphaelswho sits his horse with the elegant tranquillity of one assured of celestial aid down to him who swings on a signpost at mine hostesss doorhe is our familiar acquaintance  but who is that lovely being in the first blush of youth who bearing aloft the symbolic cross stands with one foot on the vanquished dragon  that is a copy after raphael  and who is that majestic creature holding her palmbranch while the unicorn crouches at her feet  that is the famous moretto at vienna  are we satisfied  not in the least but we try to look wiser and pass on  in the old times the painters of these legendary scenes and subjects could always reckon securely on certain associations and certain sympathies in the minds of the spectators  we have outgrown these associations we repudiate these sympathies  we have taken these works from their consecrated localities in which they once held each their dedicated place and we have hung them in our drawingrooms and our dressingrooms over our pianos and our sideboards and now what do they say to us  that magdalene weeping amid her hair who once spoke comfort to the soul of the fallen sinnerthat sebastian arrowpierced whose upward ardent glance spoke of courage and hope to the tyrantridden serfthat poor tortured slave to whose aid st mark comes sweeping down from abovecan they speak to us of nothing save flowing lines and correct drawing and gorgeous colour  must we be told that one is a titian the other a guido the third a tintoret before we dare to melt into compassion or admiration or the moment we refer to their ancient religious signification and influence must it be with disdain or with pity  this as it appears to me is to take not a rational but rather a most irrational as well as a most irreverent view of the question  it is to confine the pleasure and improvement to be derived from works of art within very narrow bounds it is to seal up a fountain of the richest poetry and to shut out a thousand ennobling and inspiring thoughts happily there is a growing appreciation of these larger principles of criticism as applied to the study of art  people look at the pictures which hang round their walls and have an awakening suspicion that there is more in them than meets the eyemore than mere connoisseurship can interpret and that they have another a deeper significance than has been dreamed of by picture dealers and picture collectors or even picture criticsintrod xxiii   on these grounds mrs jameson treats of the poetry of sacred and legendary art  her first volume contains a general sketch of the legends connected with angels with the scriptural personages and the primitive fathers  her second the histories of most of those sainted personages who lived or are supposed to have lived in the first ages of christianity and whose real history founded on fact or tradition has been so disfigured by poetical embroidery that they have in some sort the air of ideal beings  each story is followed by a series of short but brilliant criticisms on those pictures in which the story has been embodied by painters of various schools and periods and illustrated by numerous spirited etchings and woodcuts which add greatly to the value and intelligibility of the work  a future volume is promised which shall contain the legends of the monastic orders and the history of the franciscans and the dominicans considered merely in their connection with the revival and the development of the fine arts in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuriesa work which if it equal the one before us will doubtless be hailed by those conversant with that wonderful phase of human history as a valuable addition to our psychologic and aesthetic literature  we ought to petition also for a volume which should contain the life of the saviour and the legends of the virgin mary though this latter subject we are afraid will be too difficult for even mrs jamesons tact and delicacy to make tolerable to english readers so thoroughly has the virgin mary as especial patroness of purity been intermixed in her legends with every form of prudish and prurient foulmindedness 199  the authoress has wisely abstained from all controversial matters in her preface she begs that it may be clearly understood that she has taken throughout the aesthetic and not the religious view of these productions of art which in as far as they are informed with a true and earnest feeling and steeped in that beauty which emanates from genius inspired by faith may cease to be religion but cannot cease to be poetry and as poetry only she says i have considered them  in a word mrs jameson has done for them what schoolmasters and schoolboys bishops and royal academicians have been doing for centuries by greek plays and greek statues without having incurred as we said above the slightest suspicion of wanting to worship heathen gods and goddesses  not that she views these stories with the cold unbelieving eye of a goethe merely as studies of artistic effect she often transgresses her rule of impartiality and just where we should wish her to do so  her geniality cannot avoid an occasional burst of feeling such as concludes her notice of the stories about the magdalene and the other beatified penitents   poets have sung and moralists and sages have taught that for the frail woman there was nothing left but to die or if more remained for her to suffer there was at least nothing left for her to be or dono choice between sackcloth and ashes and the livery of sin  the beatified penitents of the early christian church spoke another lessonspoke divinely of hope for the fallen hope without self abasement or defiance  we in these days acknowledge no such saints we have even done our best to dethrone mary magdalene but we have martyrsby the pang without the palmand one at least among these who has not died without lifting up a voice of eloquent and solemn warning who has borne her palm on earth and whose starry crown may be seen on high even now amid the constellations of geniusvol ii p 386   to whom the authoress may allude in this touching passage our simplicity cannot guess in the least  we may therefore without the suspicion of partiality say to the noble spirit of purity compassion and true liberality which breathes throughout this whole chapter go on and conquer  nor again can mrs jamesons english honesty avoid an occasional slip of delicate sarcasm for instance in the story of st filomena a brandnew saint whose discovery at rome in 1802 produced there an excitement which we should suspect was very much wanted which we recommend to all our readers as an instance of the state into which the virtues of honesty and common sense seem to have fallen in the eternal cityof humbugs  no doubt there are many such cases of imposture among the list of saints and martyrs yet granting all which have been exposed and more there still remains a list of authentic stories sadder and stranger than any romance of mans invention to read which without deep sympathy and admiration our hearts must be callous or bigoted indeed  as mrs jameson herself well says vol ii p 137   when in the daily service of our church we repeat these words of the sublime hymn the noble army of martyrs praise thee i wonder sometimes whether it be with a full appreciation of their meaning whether we do really reflect on all that this noble army of martyrs has conquered for us  did they indeed glorify god through their courage and seal their faith in their redeemer with their blood and if it be so how is it that we christians have learned to look coldly upon the effigies of those who sowed the seed of the harvest which we have reapedsanguis martyrum semen christianorum  we may admit that the reverence paid to them in former days was unreasonable and excessive that credulity and ignorance have in many instances falsified the actions imputed to them that enthusiasm has magnified their numbers beyond all belief that when the communion with martyrs was associated with the presence of their material remains the passion for relics led to a thousand abuses and the belief in their intercession to a thousand superstitions  but why in uprooting the false uproot also the beautiful and the true   thoroughly and practically convinced as we are of the truth of these words it gave us some pain when in the work of a very worthy person the church in the catacombs by dr maitland not the author of the dark ages we found as far as we could perceive a wish to advance the protestant cause by throwing general doubt on the old martyrologies and their monuments in the roman catacombs  if we shall have judged hastily we shall be ready to apologise  none as we have said before more firmly believe that the protestant cause is the good cause none are more reverentially inclined toward all honest critical investigations more anxious to see all truth the bible itself sifted and tested in every possible method but we must protest against what certainly seems too contemptuous a rejection of a mass of historic evidence hitherto undoubted except by the school of voltaire and of the hasty denial of the meaning of christian and martyrologic symbols as well known to antiquaries as stonehenge or magna charta  at the same time dr maitlands book seems the work of a righteous and earnest man and it is not its object but its method of which we complain  the whole question of martyrology a far more important one than historians generally fancy requires a thorough investigation critical and historical it has to be done and especially just now  the germans the civil engineers of the intellectual world ought to do it for us and no doubt will  but those who undertake it must bring to the work not only impartiality but enthusiasm it is the spirit only after all which can quicken the eye which can free the understanding from the idols of laziness prejudice and hasty induction  to talk philosophically of such matters a man must love them he must set to work with a christian sympathy and a manly admiration for those old spiritual heroes to whose virtue and endurance europe owes it that she is not now a den of heathen savages  he must be ready to assume everything about them to be true which is neither absurd immoral nor unsupported by the same amount of evidence which he would require for any other historic fact  and just because this very tone of mindenthusiastic but not idolatrous discriminating but not captiousruns through mrs jamesons work we hail it with especial pleasure as a fresh move in a truly philosophic and christian direction  indeed for that branch of the subject which she has taken in hand not the history but the poetry of legends and of the art which they awakened she derives a peculiar fitness not merely from her own literary talents and acquaintance with continental art but also from the very fact of her being an english wife and mother  women ought perhaps always to make the best criticsat once more quicksighted more tasteful more sympathetic than ourselves whose proper business is creation perhaps in utopia they will take the reviewers business entirely off our hands as they are said to be doing already bythebye in one leading periodical  but of all critics an english matron ought to be the bestopen as she should be by her womanhood to all tender and admiring sympathies accustomed by her protestant education to unsullied purity of thought and inheriting from her race not only freedom of mind and reverence for antiquity but the far higher birthright of english honesty  and such a genial and honest spirit we think runs through this book  another difficult task perhaps the most difficult of all the authoress has well performed  we mean the handling of stories whose facts she partly or wholly disbelieves while she admires and loves their spirit and moral or doctrines to pronounce on whose truth or falsehood is beyond her subject  this difficulty mr newman in the lives of the english saints edited and partly written by him turned with wonderful astuteness to the advantage of romanism but others more honest have not been so victorious  witness the painfully uncertain impression left by some parts of one or two of those masterly articles on romish heroes which appeared in the quarterly review an uncertainty which we have the fullest reason to believe was most foreign to the reviewers mind and conscience even mr macaulays brilliant history here and there falls into the same snare  no one but those who have tried it can be aware of the extreme difficulty of preventing the dramatic historian from degenerating into an apologist or heating into a sneerer or understand the ease with which an earnest author in a case like the present becomes frantically reckless under the certainty that say what he will he will be called a jesuit by the protestants an infidel by the papists a pantheist by the ultrahighchurch and a rogue by all three  now we certainly shall not say that mrs jameson is greater than the writers just mentioned but we must say that female tact and deep devotional feeling cut the gordian knot which has puzzled more cunning heads  not that mrs jameson is faultless we want something yet in the telling of a christian fairytale and know not what we want  but never were legends narrated with more discernment and simplicity than these  as an instance take the legend of st dorothea vol ii p 184 which is especially one of those stories of sainted personages who as mrs jameson says lived or are supposed to have lived in the first ages of christianity  and whose real history founded on fact or tradition has been so disguised by poetical embroidery that they have in some sort the air of ideal beings and which may therefore be taken as a complete test of the authoresss tact and honesty   in the province of cappadocia and in the city of caesarea dwelt a noble virgin whose name was dorothea  in the whole city there was none to be compared to her in beauty and grace of person  she was a christian and served god day and night with prayers with fasting and with alms  the governor of the city by name sapritius or fabricius was a very terrible persecutor of the christians and hearing of the maiden and of her great beauty he ordered her to be brought before him  she came with her mantle folded on her bosom and her eyes meekly cast down  the governor asked who art thou and she replied  i am dorothea a virgin and a servant of jesus christ he said  thou must serve our gods or die  she answered mildly be it so the sooner shall i stand in the presence of him whom i most desire to behold  then the governor asked her  whom meanest thou  she replied  i mean the son of god christ mine espoused his dwelling is paradise by his side are joys eternal and in his garden grow celestial fruits and roses that never fade  then sapritius overcome by her eloquence and beauty ordered her to be carried back to her dungeon  and he sent to her two sisters whose names were calista and christeta who had once been christians but who from terror of the torments with which they were threatened had renounced their faith in christ  to these women the governor promised large rewards if they would induce dorothea to follow their evil example and they nothing doubting of success boldly undertook the task  the result however was far different for dorothea full of courage and constancy reproved them as one having authority and drew such a picture of the joys they had forfeited through their falsehood and cowardice that they fell at her feet saying  o blessed dorothea pray for us that through thy intercession our sins may be forgiven and our penitence accepted  and she did so and when they had left the dungeon they proclaimed aloud that they were servants of christ  then the governor furious commanded that they should be burned and that dorothea should witness their torments  and she stood by bravely encouraging them and saying  o my sisters fear not suffer to the end for these transient pangs shall be followed by the joys of eternal life  thus they died  and dorothea herself was condemned to be tortured cruelly and then beheaded  the first part of her sentence she endured with invincible fortitude  she was then led forth to death and as she went a young man a lawyer of the city named theophilus who had been present when she was first brought before the governor called to her mockingly  ha fair maiden goest thou to join thy bridegroom  send me i pray thee of the fruits and flowers of that same garden of which thou hast spoken i would fain taste of them  and dorothea looking on him inclined her head with a gentle smile and said  thy request o theophilus is granted  whereat he laughed aloud with his companions but she went on cheerfully to death  when she came to the place of execution she knelt down and prayed and suddenly appeared at her side a beautiful boy with hair bright as sunbeams   a smoothfaced glorious thing with thousand blessings dancing in his eyes   in his hand he held a basket containing three apples and three freshgathered and fragrant roses  she said to him carry these to theophilus say that dorothea hath sent them and that i go before him to the garden whence they came and await him there  with these words she bent her neck and received the deathstroke  meantime the angel for it was an angel went to seek theophilus and found him still laughing in merry mood over the idea of the promised gift  the angel placed before him the basket of celestial fruit and flowers saying  dorothea sends thee this and vanished  what words can express the wonder of theophilus  struck by the prodigy operated in his favour his heart melted within him he tasted of the celestial fruit and a new life was his he proclaimed himself a servant of christ and following the example of dorothea suffered with like constancy in the cause of truth and obtained the crown of martyrdom   we have chosen this legend just because it is in itself as superstitious and fantastic as any in the book  we happen to hold the dream of the spiritual marriage as there set forth in especial abhorrence and we have no doubt mrs jameson does so also we are well aware of the pernicious effect which this doctrine has exercised on matrimonial purity among the southern nations that by making chastity synonymous with celibacy it degraded married faithfulness into a restriction which there were penalties for breaking but no rewards for keeping  we see clearly enough the cowardice the shortsightedness of fancying that man can insure the safety of his soul by fleeing from the worldin plain english deserting the post to which god has called him like the monks and nuns of old  we believe that the numbers of the early martyrs have been exaggerated  we believe that they were like ourselves imperfect and inconsistent human beings that on the showing of the legends and fathers themselves their testimony for the truth was too often impaired by superstition fanaticism or passion  but granting all this we must still say in the words of one who cannot be suspected of romanisingthe great dr arnold   divide the sum total of reported martyrs by twenty by fifty if you will after all you have a number of persons of all ages and sexes suffering cruel torments and deaths for conscience sake and for christs and by their sufferings manifestly with gods blessing insuring the triumph of christs gospel  neither do i think that we consider the excellence of this martyr spirit half enough   indeed we do not  let all the abatements mentioned above and more be granted yet even then when we remember that the world from which jerome or anthony fled was even worse than that denounced by juvenal and persiusthat the nuptials which as legends say were often offered the virgin martyrs as alternatives for death were such as employed the foul pens of petronius and martialthat the tyrants whom they spurned were such as live in the pages of suetonius and the augustae historiae scriptoresthat the gods whom they were commanded to worship the rites in which they were to join were those over which ovid and apuleius had gloated which lucian had held up to the contempt of heathendom itselfthat the tortures which they preferred to apostacy and to foul crimes were by the confessions of the heathens themselves too horrible for pen to tellit does raise a flush of indignation to hear some sleek bigotsceptic bred up in the safety and luxury of modern england among habeas corpus acts and endowed churches trying from his warm fireside to sneer away the awful responsibilities and the heroic fortitude of valiant men and tender girls to whose piety and courage he owes the very enlightenment the very civilisation of which he boasts  it is an error doubtless and a fearful one to worship even such as them  but the error when it arose was at worst the caricature of a blessed truth  even for the sinful surely it was better to admire holiness than to worship their own sin  shame on those who calling themselves christians repine that a cecilia or a magdalen replaced an isis and a venus or who can fancy that they are serving protestantism by tracing malevolent likenesses between even the idolatry of a saint and the idolatry of a devil  true there was idolatry in both as gross in one as the other  and what wonder what wonder if amid a world of courtesans the nun was worshipped at least god allowed it and will man be wiser than god  the times of that ignorance he winked at  the lie that was in it he did not interfere to punish  he did more he let it work out as all lies will their own punishment  we may see that in the miserable century which preceded the glorious reformation we may see it in the present state of spain and italy  the crust of lies we say punished itself to the germ of truth within it we partly owe that we are christian men this day  but granting or rather boldly asserting all this and smiling as much as we choose at the tale of st dorotheas celestial basket is it not absolutely and in spite of all an exquisite story  is it likely to make people better or worse  we might believe the whole of it and yet we need not therefore turn idolaters and worship sweet dorothea for a goddess  but if as we trust in god is the case we are too wise to believe it allif even we see no reason and there is not much for believing one single word of ityet still we ask is it not an exquisite story  is there not heroism in it greater than of all the ajaxes and achilles who ever blustered on this earth is there not power greater than of kingsgods strength made perfect in womans weakness  tender forgiveness the saviours own likeness glimpses brilliant and true at the core however distorted and miscoloured of that spiritual world where the wicked cease from troubling where the meek alone shall inherit the earth where as protestants too believe all that is spotless and beautiful in nature as well as in man shall bloom for ever perfect  it is especially in her descriptions of paintings that mrs jamesons great talents are displayed  nowhere do we recollect criticisms more genial brilliant picturesque than those which are scattered through these pages  often they have deeper merits and descend to those fundamental laws of beauty and of religion by which all christian art must ultimately be tested  mrs jameson has certainly a powerful inductive faculty she comprehends at once the idea 210 and central law of a work of art and sketches it in a few vivid and masterly touches and really to use a hack quotation honestly for once in thoughts which breathe and words which burn  as an instance we must be allowed to quote at length this charming passage on angel paintings so valuable does it seem not only as information but as a specimen of what criticism should be   on the revival of art we find the byzantine idea of angels everywhere prevailing  the angels in cimabues famous virgin and child enthroned are grand creatures rather stern but this arose i think from his inability to express beauty  the colossal angels at assisi solemn sceptred kingly forms all alike in action and attitude appeared to me magnificent  in the angels of giotto we see the commencement of a softer grace and a purer taste further developed by some of his scholars  benozzo gozzoli and orcagna have left in the campo santo examples of the most graceful and fanciful treatment  of benozzos angels in the ricardi palace i have spoken at length  his master angelico worthy the name never reached the same power of expressing the rapturous rejoicing of celestial beings but his conception of the angelic nature remains unapproached unapproachable  it is only his for it was the gentle passionless refined nature of the recluse which stamped itself there  angelicos angels are unearthly not so much in form as in sentiment and superhuman not in power but in purity in other hands any imitation of his soft ethereal grace would become feeble and insipid  with their long robes falling round their feet and drooping manycoloured wings they seem not to fly or to walk but to float along smooth sliding without step  blessed blessed creatures love us only love us for we dare not task your soft serene beatitude by asking you to help us  there is more sympathy with humanity in francias angels  they look as if they could weep as well as love and sing        correggios angels are grand and lovely but they are like children enlarged and sublimated not like spirits taking the form of children where they smile it is trulyas annibal caracci expresses itcon una naturalezza et simplicita che innamora e sforza a ridere con loro  but the smile in many of correggios angel heads has something sublime and spiritual as well as simple and natural  and titians angels impress me in a similar manneri mean those in the glorious assumption at venicewith their childish forms and features but an expression caught from beholding the face of our father that is in heaven it is glorified in fancy  i remember standing before this picture contemplating those lovely spirits one after another until a thrill came over me like that which i felt when mendelssohn played the organi became music while i listened the face of one of those angels is to the face of a child just what that of the virgin in the same picture is compared with the fairest of the daughters of earth  it is not here superiority of beauty but mind and music and love kneaded as it were into form and colour  but raphael excelling in all things is here excellent above all his angels combine in a higher degree than any other the various faculties and attributes in which the fancy loves to clothe these pure immortal beatified creatures  the angels of giotti of benozzo of fiesole are if not female feminine those of filippo lippi and of andrea masculine but you cannot say of those of raphael that they are masculine or feminine  the idea of sex is wholly lost in the blending of power intelligence and grace  in his early pictures grace is the predominant characteristic as in the dancing and singing angels in his coronation of the virgin  in his later pictures the sentiment in his ministering angels is more spiritual more dignified  as a perfect example of grand and poetical feeling i may cite the angels as regents of the planets in the capella chigiana  the cupola represents in a circle the creation of the solar system according to the theological and astronomical or rather astrological notions which then prevaileda hundred years before the starry galileo and his woes  in the centre is the creator around in eight compartments we have first the angel of the celestial sphere who seems to be listening to the divine mandate  let there be light in the firmament of heaven then follow in their order the sun the moon mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn  the name of each planet is expressed by its mythological representative the sun by apollo the moon by diana and over each presides a grand colossalwinged spirit seated or reclining on a portion of the zodiac as on a throne  i have selected two angels to give an idea of this peculiar and poetical treatment the union of the theological and the mythological attributes is in the classical taste of the time and quite miltonic  in raphaels childangels the expression of power and intelligence as well as innocence is quite wonderful for instance look at the two angel boys in the dresden madonna di san sisto and the angels or celestial genii who bear along the almighty when he appears to noah no one has expressed like raphael the action of flight except perhaps rembrandt  the angel who descends to crown santa felicita cleaves the air with the action of a swallow  and the angel in rembrandts tobit soars like a lark with upward motion spurning the earth  michael angelo rarely gave wings to his angels i scarcely recollect an instance except the angel in the annunciation and his exaggerated human forms his colossal creatures in which the idea of power is conveyed through attitude and muscular action are to my taste worse than unpleasing  my admiration for this wonderful man is so profound that i can afford to say this  his angels are superhuman but hardly angelic  and while in raphaels angels we do not feel the want of wings we feel while looking at those of michael angelo that not even the sailbroad vans with which satan laboured through the surging abyss of chaos could suffice to lift those titanic forms from earth and sustain them in midair  the group of angels over the last judgment flinging their mighty limbs about and those that surround the descending figure of christ in the conversion of st paul may be referred to here as characteristic examples  the angels blowing their trumpets puff and strain like so many troopers  surely this is not angelic  there may be power great imaginative and artistic powerexhibited in the conception of form but in the beings themselves there is more of effort than of power  serenity tranquillity beatitude ethereal purity spiritual grace are out of the question   in this passage we may remark an excellence in mrs jamesons mode of thought which has become lately somewhat rare  we mean a freedom from that bigoted and fantastic habit of mind which leads nowadays the worshippers of high art to exalt the early schools to the disadvantage of all others and to talk as if christian painting had expired with perugino  we were much struck with our authoresss power of finding spiritual truth and beauty in titians assumption one of the very pictures in which the highart party are wont to see nothing but coarseness and earthliness of conception  she having we suppose a more acute as well as a more healthy eye for the beautiful and the spiritual and therefore able to perceive its slightest traces wherever they exist sees in those earthly faces of the great masters an expression caught from beholding the face of our father that is in heaven  the face of one of those angels she continues is to the face of a child just what that of the virgin in the same picture is compared with the fairest of the daughters of earth  it is not here superiority of beauty but mind and music and love kneaded as it were into form and colour  mrs jameson acknowledges her great obligations to m rio and all students of art must be thankful to him for the taste learning and earnest religious feeling which he has expended on the history of the earlier schools of painting  an honest man doubtless he is but it does not follow alas in this piecemeal world that he should write an honest book  and his bigotry stands in painful contrast to the genial and comprehensive spirit by which mrs jameson seems able to appreciate the specific beauties of all schools and masters  m rios theory and he is the spokesman of a large party is unless we much misjudge him thisthat the anteraphaelic is the only christian art and that all the excellences of these early painters came from their romanism all their faults from his two great bugbearsbyzantinism and paganism  in his eyes the byzantine idea of art was manichean in which we fully coincide but add that the idea of the early italian painters was almost equally so  and that almost all in them that was not manichean they owe not to their romanism or their asceticism but to their healthy laymans common sense and to the influence of that very classical art which they are said to have been pious enough to despise  bigoted and ascetic romanists have been in all ages in a hurry to call people manicheans all the more fiercely because their own consciences must have hinted to them that they were somewhat manichean themselves when a man suspects his own honesty he is of course inclined to prove himself blameless by shouting the loudest against the dishonesty of others  now m rio sees clearly and philosophically enough what is the root of manicheanismthe denial that that which is natural beautiful human belongs to god  he imputes it justly to those byzantine artists who fancied it carnal to attribute beauty to the saviour or to the virgin mary and tried to prove their own spirituality by representing their sacred personages in the extreme of ugliness and emaciation though some of the specimens of their painting which mrs jameson gives proves that this abhorrence of beauty was not so universal as m  rio would have us believe  we agree with him that this absurdity was learned from them by earlier and semibarbarous italian artists that these latter rapidly escaped from it and began rightly to embody their conceptions in beautiful forms and yet we must urge against them too the charge of manicheanism and of a spiritual eclecticism also far deeper and more pernicious than the mere outward eclecticism of manner which has drawn down hard names on the school of the caracci  for an eclectic if it mean anything means thisone who in any branch of art or science refuses to acknowledge bacons great law that nature is only conquered by obeying her who will not take a full and reverent view of the whole mass of facts with which he has to deal and from them deducing the fundamental laws of his subject obey them whithersoever they may lead but who picks and chooses out of them just so many as may be pleasant to his private taste and then constructs a partial system which differs from the essential ideas of nature in proportion to the number of facts which he has determined to discard  and such a course was pursued in the art by the ascetic painters between the time of giotto and raphael  their idea of beauty was a partial and a manichean one in their adoration for a fictitious angelic nature made up from all which is negative in humanity they were prone to despise all by which man is brought in contact with this earththe beauties of sex of strength of activity of grandeur of form all that is in which greek art excels  their ideal of beauty was altogether effeminate  they prudishly despised the anatomic study of the human figure of landscape and chiaroscuro  spiritual expression with them was everything but it was only the expression of the passive spiritual faculties of innocence devotion meekness resignationall good but not the whole of humanity  not that they could be quite consistent in their theory  they were forced to paint their very angels as human beings and a standard of human beauty they had to find somewhere and they found one strange to say exactly like that of the old pagan statues wings and allfor the wings of christian angels are copied exactly from those of greek genii and only differing in that ascetic and emasculate tone which was peculiar to themselves  here is a dilemma which the worshippers of high art have slurred over  where did angelico de fiesole get the idea of beauty which dictated his exquisite angels  we shall not i suppose agree with those who attribute it to direct inspiration and speak of it as the reward of the prayer and fasting by which the good monk used to prepare himself for painting  must we then confess that he borrowed his beauties from the faces of the prettiest nuns with whom he was acquainted  that would be sad naturalism and sad eclecticism too considering that he must have seen among his italian sisters a great many beauties of a very different type from that which he has chosen to copy though we suppose of gods making equally with that of his favourites  or did he in spite of himself steal a sideglance now and then at some of the unrivalled antique statues of his country and copy on the sly any feature or proportion in them which was emasculate enough to be worked into his pictures  that too is likely enough nay it is certain  we are perfectly astonished how any draughtsman at least how such a critic as m rio can look at the early italian painters without tracing everywhere in them the classic touch the peculiar tendency to mathematic curves in the outlines which is the distinctive peculiarity of greek art  is not giotto the father of italian art full of it in every line  is not perugino  is not the angel of lorenzo credi in mrs jamesons woodcut  is not francia except just where he is stiff and soft and clumsy  is not fra angelico himself  is it not just the absence of this greek tendency to mathematical forms in the german painters before albert durer which makes the specific difference evident to every boy between the drawing of the teutonic and italian schools  but if so what becomes of the theory which calls pagan art by all manner of hard names which dates the downfall of christian art from the moment when painters first lent an eye to its pernicious seductions  how can those escape the charge of eclecticism who without going to the rootidea of greek art filched from its outside just as much as suited their purpose  and how lastly can m rios school of critics escape the charge of manichean contempt for gods world and man not as ascetics have fancied him but as god has made him when they think it a sufficient condemnation of a picture to call it naturalistic when they talk and act about art as if the domain of the beautiful were the devils kingdom from which some few species of form and elements were to be stolen by christian painters and twisted from their original evil destination into the service of religion  on the other hand we owe much to those early ascetic painters their works are a possession for ever  no future school of religious art will be able to rise to eminence without taking full cognisance of them and learning from them their secret  they taught artists and priests and laymen too that beauty is only worthy of admiration when it is the outward sacrament of the beauty of the soul within they helped to deliver men from that idolatry to merely animal strength and loveliness into which they were in danger of falling in ferocious ages and among the relics of roman luxury they asserted the superiority of the spirit over the flesh according to their light they were faithful preachers of the great christian truth that devoted faith and not fierce selfwill is mans glory  well did their pictures tell to brutal peasant and to still more brutal warrior that gods might was best shown forth not in the elephantine pride of a hercules or the titanic struggles of a laocoon but in the weakness of martyred women and of warriors who were content meekly to endure shame and death for the sake of him who conquered by sufferings and bore all human weaknesses who was led as a lamb to the slaughter and like a sheep dumb before the shearer opened not his mouth  we must conclude with a few words on one point on which we differ somewhat from mrs jamesonthe allegoric origin of certain legendary stories  she calls the story of the fiend under the form of a dragon devouring st margaret and then bursting at the sign of the cross while the saint escaped unhurt another form of the familiar allegorythe power of sin overcome by the power of the cross  and again vol ii p 4   the legend of st george came to us from the east where under various forms as apollo and the python as bellerophon and the chimaera as perseus and the seamonster we see perpetually recurring the mythic allegory by which was figured the conquest achieved by beneficent power over the tyranny of wickedness and which reappears in christian art in the legends of st michael and half a hundred other saints   to us these stories seem to have had by no means an allegorical but rather a strictly historic foundation and our reasons for this opinion may possibly interest some readers  allegory strictly so called is the offspring of an advanced and not of a semibarbarous state of society  its home is in the east not the east of barbarous pontine countries peopled by men of our own race where the legend of st george is allowed to have sprung up but of the civilised metaphysical darkhaired races of egypt syria and hindostan  the objectivity of the gothic mind has never had any sympathy with it  the teutonic races like the earlier greeks before they were tinctured with eastern thought had always wanted historic facts dates names and places  they even found it necessary to import their saints to locate mary magdalene at marseilles joseph of arimathea at glastonbury the three magi at cologne before they could thoroughly love or understand them englishmen especially cannot write allegories  john bunyan alone succeeded tolerably but only because his characters and language were such as he had encountered daily at every fireside and in every meetinghouse  but spenser wandered perpetually away or rather rose up from his plan into mere dramatic narrative  his work and other english allegories are hardly allegoric at all but rather symbolic spiritual laws in them are not expressed by arbitrary ciphers but embodied in imaginary examples sufficiently startling or simple to form a plain key to other and deeper instances of the same law  they are analogous to those symbolic devotional pictures in which the madonna and saints of all ages are grouped together with the painters own contemporariesno allegories at all but the plain embodiment of a fact in which the artist believed not only the communion of all saints but also their habit of assisting often in visible form the christians of his own time  these distinctions may seem oversubtle but our meaning will surely be plain to anyone who will compare the faerie queen or the legend of st george with the gnostic or hindoo reveries and the fantastic and truly eastern interpretation of scripture which the european monks borrowed from egypt  our opinion is that in the old legends the moral did not create the story but the story the moral and that the story had generally a nucleus of fact within all its distortions and exaggerations  this holds good of the odinic and grecian myths all are now more or less inclined to believe that the deities of zeuss or odins dynasties were real conquerors or civilisers of flesh and blood like the manco capac of the peruvians and that it was around records of their real victories over barbarous aborigines and over the brute powers of nature that extravagant myths grew up till more civilised generations began to say  these tales must have some meaningthey must be either allegories or nonsense and then fancied that in the remaining thread of fact they found a clue to the mystic sense of the whole  such we suspect has been the history of st george and the dragon as well as of apollo and the python  it is very hard to have to give up the dear old dragon who haunted our nursery dreams especially when there is no reason for it  we have no patience with antiquaries who tell us that the dragons who guarded princesses were merely the winding walls or moats of their castles  what use then pray was there in the famous nether garment with which regnar lodbrog shaggy trousers choked the dragon who guarded his ladylove  and regnar was a real piece of flesh and blood as king aella and our saxon forefathers found to their cost his awful deathdirge and the effect which it produced are well known to historians  we cannot give up regnars trousers for we suspect the key to the whole dragonquestion is in the pocket of them  seriously why should not those dragons have been simply what the greek word dragon meanswhat the earliest romances the norse myths and the superstitions of the peasantry in many parts of england to this day assert them to have beenmighty worms huge snakes  all will agree that the python the representative in the old world of the boaconstrictor of the new lingered in the homeric age if not later both in greece and in italy  it existed on the opposite coast of africa where it is now extinct in the time of regulus we believe from the traditions of all nations that it existed to a far later date in more remote and barbarous parts of europe  there is every reason to suppose that it still lingered in england after the invasion of the cymrisay not earlier than bc 600for it was among them an object of worship and we question whether they would have been likely to have adored a foreign animal and as at abury built enormous temples in imitation of its windings and called them by its name  the only answer to these traditions has as yet been that no reptile of that bulk is known in cold climates  yet the python still lingers in the hungarian marshes  a few years ago a huge snake as large as the pythons of hindostan spread havoc among the flocks and terror among the peasantry  had it been ariostos orc an a priori argument from science would have had weight  a marsupiate sea monster is horribly unorthodox and the dragon too has doubtless been made a monster of but most unjustly  his legs have been patched on by crocodileslaying crusaders while his wingswhere did they come from  from the traditions of flying serpents which have so strangely haunted the deserts of upper egypt from the time of the old hebrew prophets and which may not after all be such lies as folk fancy  how scientific prigs shook with laughter at the notion of a flying dragon till one day geology revealed to them in the pterodactylus that a real flying dragon on the model of carlo crivellis in mrs jamesons book with wings before and legs behind only more monstrous than that and than all the dreams of seba and aldrovandus though some of theirs to be sure have seven heads got its living once on a time in this very island of england  but such is the way of this wise world  when le vaillant in the last century assured the parisians that he had shot a giraffe at the cape he was politely informed that the giraffe was fabulous extinctin short that he lied and now behold the respectable old unicorn and good tories ought to rejoice to hear it has been discovered at last by a german naturalist von muller in abyssinia just where our fathers told us to look for it  and why should we not find the flying serpent too  the interior of africa is as yet an unknown world of wonders and we may yet discover there for aught we know the descendants of the very satyr who chatted with st anthony  no doubt the discovery of huge fossil animals as mrs jameson says on the high authority of professor owen may have modified our ancestors notions of dragons  but in the old serpent worship we believe the real explanation of these stories is to be found  there is no doubt that human victims and even young maidens were offered to these snakegods even the sunny mythology of greece retains horrible traces of such customs which lingered in arcadia the mountain fastness of the old and conquered race  similar cruelties existed among the mexicans and there are but too many traces of it throughout the history of heathendom  the same superstition may as the legends assert have lingered on or been at least revived during the later ages of the empire in remote provinces left in their primeval barbarism at the same time that they were brutalised by the fiendish exhibitions of the circus which the roman governors found it their interest to introduce everywhere  thus the serpent became naturally regarded as the manifestation of the evil spirit by christians as well as by the old hebrews thus also it became the presiding genius of the malaria and fever which arose from the fens haunted by ita superstition which gave rise to the theory that the tales of hercules and the hydra apollo and the mudpython st george and the dragon were sanitaryreform allegories and the monsters whose poisonous breath destroyed cattle and young maidens only typhus and consumption  we see no reason why early christian heroes should not have actually met with such snakegods and felt themselves bound like southeys madoc or daniel in the old rabbinical story whose truth has never been disproved to destroy the monsters at all risk  we see no reason either why their righteous daring may not have been crowned with victory and suspect that on such events were gradually built up the dragonslaying legends which charmed all europe and grew in extravagances and absurdities till they began to degenerate into the bombast of the seven champions and expired in the immortal ballad of the dragon of wantley in which more of more hall on the morning of his battle with the monster invoked the saints no more but   to make him strong and mighty    he drank by the tale    six pots of ale and a quart of aquavitae   so ended the sublime sport of dragonslaying  its only remnant may now be seen in borneo whither that noble christian man bishop macdougall took out the other day a sixchambered rifle on the ground that while the alligators ate his schoolchildren at sarawak it was his duty as a bishop to shoot the alligators    on english composition    introductory lectures given at queens college london 1848  an introductory lecture on english composition is i think as much needed as one on any other subject taught in this college  for in the first place i am not sure whether we all mean the same thing when we speak of english composition and in the next place i believe that pupils themselves are very often best able to tell their teachers what sort of instruction they require  i purpose therefore today not only to explain freely my intentions with regard to this course of lectures but to ask you to explain freely your own wants  i must suppose however that the ladies who attend here wish to be taught how to write english better  now the art of writing english is i should say the art of speaking english and speech may be used for any one of three purposes  to conceal thought as the french diplomatist defined its use to conceal the want of thought as the majority of popular writers and orators seem nowadays to employ it or again to express thought which would seem to have been the original destination of the gift of language  i am therefore i suppose in duty bound to take for granted that you come here to be taught to express your thoughts better  the whole matter then will very much depend on what thoughts you have to express  for the form of the symbol must depend on the form of the thing symbolised as the medal does upon its die and thus style and language are the sacraments of thoughts the outward and visible signs of the inward and spiritual grace or want of grace in the writer  and even where language is employed to conceal either thought or want thereof it generally tells a truer tale than it was meant to do  out of the abundance of the heart the mouth must speak and the hollowness or foolishness of the spirit will show itself in spite of all cunning sleights in unconscious peculiarities or defects of style  hence i say style as the expression of thought will depend entirely on what there is within to be expressed on the character of the writers mind and heart  we all allow this implicitly in the epithets which we apply to different styles  we talk of a vigorous a soft a weak a frigid an obscure style not meaning that the words and sentences in themselves are vigorous soft weak or even obscure for the words and their arrangement may be simple enough all the while  no you speak of the quality of the thoughts conveyed in the words that a style is powerful because the writer is feeling and thinking strongly and clearly weak or frigid because his feelings on the subject have been weak or cold obscure to you because his thoughts have been obscure to himselfbecause in short he has not clearly imagined to himself the notion which he wishes to embody  the meaning of the very words expression and composition prove the truth of my assertion  expression is literally the pressing out into palpable form that which is already within us and composition in the same way is the composing or putting together of materials already existingthe form and method of the composition depend mainly on the form and quality of the materials  you cannot compose a rope of sand or a round globe of square stonesand my friend mr strettell will tell you in his lectures on grammar that words are just as stubborn and intractable materials as sand or stone and that we cannot alter their meaning or value a single shade for they derive that meaning from a higher fountain than the soul of man from the word of god the fount of utterance who inspires all true and noble thought and speechwho vindicated language as his own gift and mans invention in that miracle of the day of pentecost  and i am bound to follow up mr strettells teaching by telling you that what holds true of words and of their grammatic and logical composition holds true also of their aesthetic and artistic composition of style of rhythm of poetry and oratory  every principle of these which is true and good that is which produces beauty is to be taken as an inspiration from above as depending not on the will of man but of god not on any abstract rules of pedants invention but on the eternal necessities and harmony on the being of god himself  these may seem lofty words but i do not think they are likely to make us loftyminded  i think that the belief of them will tend to make us all more reverent and earnest in examining the utterances of others more simple and truthful in giving vent to our own fearing equally all prejudiced and hasty criticism all selfwilled mannerism all display of fine words as sins against the divine dignity of language  from these assertions i think we may conclude what is the true method of studying style  the critical examination of good authors looking at language as an inspiration and its laws as things independent of us eternal and divine we must search into them as we would into any other set of facts in nature or the bible by patient induction  we must not be content with any traditional maxims or abstract rules such as have been put forth in blair and lord kaimes for these are merely worked out by the head and can give us no insight into the magic which touches the heart all abstract rules of criticism indeed are very barren  we may read whole folios of them without getting one step farther than we were at first viz that what is beautiful is beautiful  indeed these abstract rules generally tend to narrow our notions of what is beautiful in their attempt to explain spiritual things by the carnal understanding  all they do is to explain them away and so those who depend on them are tempted to deny the beauty of every thing which cannot be thus analysed and explained away according to the established rule and method  i shall have to point out this again to you when we come to speak of the pope and johnson school of critics and the way in which they wrote whole folios on shakespeare without ever penetrating a single step deeper towards the secret of his sublimity  it was just this idolatry of abstract rules which made johnson call bishop percys invaluable collection of ancient ballads stuff and nonsense  it was this which made voltaire talk of hamlet as the ravings of a drunken savage because forsooth it could not be crammed into the artificial rules of french tragedy  it is this which even at this day makes some men of highlycultivated taste declare that they can see no poetry in the writings of mr tennyson the cause little as they are aware of it simply being that neither his excellences nor his faults are after the model of the etonian classical school which reigned in england fifty years ago  when these critics speak of that with which they sympathise they are admirable  they become childish only when they resolve to bind all by maxims which may suit themselves  we must then i think absolutely eschew any abstract rules as startingpoints  what rules we may require we must neither borrow nor invent but discover during the course of our reading  we must take passages whose power and beauty is universally acknowledged and try by reverently and patiently dissecting them to see into the secret of their charm to see why and how they are the best possible expressions of the authors mind  then for the wider laws of art we may proceed to examine whole works single elegies essays and dramas  in carrying out all this it will be safest as always to follow the course of nature and begin where god begins with us  for as every one of us is truly a microcosm a whole miniature world within ourselves so is the history of each individual more or less the history of the whole human race and there are few of us but pass through the same course of intellectual growth through which the whole english nation has passed with an exactness and perfection proportionate of course to the richness and vigour of each persons character  now as in the nation so in the individual poetry springs up before prose  look at the history of english literature how completely it is the history of our own childhood and adolescence in its successive fashions  first fairy talesthen ballads of adventure love and warthen a new tinge of foreign thought and feeling generally french as it was with the english nation in the twelfth and thirteenth centuriesthen elegiac and reflective poetrythen classic art begins to influence our ripening youth as it did the youth of our nation in the sixteenth century and delight in dramatic poetry follows as a natural consequenceand last but not least as the fruit of all these changes a vigorous and matured prose  for indeed as elocution is the highest melody so is true prose the highest poetry  consider how in an air the melody is limited to a few arbitrary notes and recurs at arbitrary periods while the more scientific the melody becomes the more numerous and nearly allied are the notes employed and the more complex and uncertain is their recurrencein short the nearer does the melody of the air approach to the melody of elocution in which the notes of the voice ought continually to be passing into each other by imperceptible gradations and their recurrence to depend entirely on the emotions conveyed in the subject words  just so poetry employs a confined and arbitrary metre and a periodic recurrence of sounds which disappear gradually in its higher forms of the ode and the drama till the poetry at last passes into prose a free and evershifting flow of every imaginable rhythm and metre determined by no arbitrary rules but only by the spiritual intent of the subject  the same will hold good of whole prose compositions when compared with whole poems  prose then is highest  to write a perfect prose must be your ultimate object in attending these lectures but we must walk before we can run and walk with leadingstrings before we can walk alone and such leadingstrings are verse and rhyme  some tradition of this is still kept up in the practice of making boys write latin and greek verses at school which is of real service to the intellect even when most carelessly employed and which when earnestly carried out is one great cause of the public school and university mans superiority in style to most selfeducated authors  and why should womens writings be in any respect inferior to that of men if they are only willing to follow out the same method of selfeducation  do not fancy when i say that we must learn poetry before we learn prose that i am only advancing a paradox mere talking is no more prose than mere rhyme is poetry  monsieur jourdain in molieres comedy makes i suspect a very great mistake when he tells his master  if that means prose ive been talking prose all my life i fancy the good man had been no more talking prose than an awkward country boy has been really walking all his life because he has been contriving somehow to put one leg before the other  to see what walking is we must look at the perfectlydrilled soldier or at the perfectlyaccomplished lady who has been taught to dance in order that she may know how to walk  dancing has been well called the poetry of motion but the tender grace the easy dignity in every gesture of daily life which the perfect dancer exhibits answers exactly to that highlyorganised prose which ought to be the offspring of a critical acquaintance with poetry  miltons matchless prose style for instance grows naturally from his matchless power over rhyme and metre  practice in versification might be unnecessary if we were all born worldgeniuses so would practice in dancing if every lady had the figure of a venus and the garden of eden for a playground  but even the ancient greeks amid every advantage of climate dress and physical beauty considered a thorough instruction in all athletic and graceful exercises as indispensably necessary not only to a boys but also to a girls education and in like manner i think the exquisite models of prose with which english literature abounds will not supersede the necessity of a careful training in versification nay will rather make such a training all the more requisite for those who wish to imitate such excellence pray understand me  by using the word imitate i do not mean that i wish you to ape the style of any favourite author  your aim will not be to write like this man or that woman but to write like yourselves being of course responsible for what yourselves are like do not be afraid to let the peculiarities of your different characters show yourselves in your styles  your prose may be the rougher for it but it will be at least honest and all mannerism is dishonesty an attempt to gain beauty at the expense of truthful expression which invariably defeats its own ends and produces an unpleasing effect so necessarily one are truth and beauty  so far then from wishing to foster in you any artificial mannerism mannerism is that foul enchanter from whom above all others i am sworn en preux chevalier to deliver you  as professor maurice warned me when i undertook this lectureship my object in teaching you about styles should be that you may have no style at all  but mannerism can be only avoided by the most thorough practice and knowledge  halfeducated writers are always mannerists while as the ancient canon says the perfection of art is to conceal artto depart from uncultivated and therefore defective nature to rise again through art to a more organised and therefore more simple naturalness  just as to carry on the analogy which i employed just now it is only the perfect dancer who arrives at that height of art at which her movements seem dictated not by conscious science but unconscious nature  i do hope then that the study and still more the practice of versification may produce in you the same good effects which they do in young men that they may give you a habit of portioning out your thoughts distinctly and authentically in a more simple condensed and expressive style that they may teach you what elevation of language what class of sounds what flow of words may best suit your tone of thought and feeling that they may prevent in you that tendency to monotonous repetition and vain wordiness which is the bosom sin of most uneducated prose writers not only of the ladies of the nineteenth century but of the middle age monks who having in general no poetry on which to form their taste except the effeminate and bombastic productions of the dying roman empire fell into a certain washy prolixity which has made monk latin a byword and puts one sadly in mind of what is too truly called young ladies english  i should like then to begin with two or three of the early ballads and carefully analyse them with you  i am convinced that in them we may discover many of the great primary laws of composition as well as the secrets of sublimity and pathos in their very simplest manifestations  it may be that there are some here to whom the study of old ballads may be a little distasteful who are in an age when the only poetry which has charms is the subjective and selfconscious poetry of the heartto whom a stanza of childe harolde may seem worth all the ballads that ever were written  but let me remind them that woman is by her sex an educator that every one here must expect ay hope to be employed at some time or other in training the minds of children then let me ask them to recall the years in which objective poems those which dealt with events ballads fairy tales down to nursery rhymes were their favourite intellectual food and let me ask them whether it will not be worth while for the sake of the children whom they may hereafter influence to bestow a little thought on this earlier form of verse  i must add too that without some understanding of these same ballads we shall never arrive at a critical appreciation of shakespeare  for the english drama springs from an intermarriage between this same ballad poetry the poetry of incidents and that subjective elegiac poetry which deals with the feelings and consciousnesses of man  they are the two poles by whose union our drama is formed and some critical knowledge of both of them will be as i said necessary before we can study it  after the ballads we ought i think to know a little about the early norman poetry whose fusion with the pure north saxon ballad school produced chaucer and the poets previous to the reformation we shall proceed to chaucer himself then to the rise of the drama then to the poets of the elizabethan age  i shall analyse a few of shakespeares masterpieces then speak of milton and spenser thence pass to the prose of sidney hooker bacon taylor and our later great authors  thus our composition lectures will follow an historical method parallel with and i hope illustrative of the lectures on english history  but it will not be enough i am afraid to study the style of others without attempting something yourselves  no criticism teaches so much as the criticism of our own works  and i hope therefore that you will not think that i ask too much of you when i propose that weekly prose and verse compositions on set subjects be sent in by the class  to the examination of these the latter half of each lecture may be devoted and the first halfhour to the study of various authors  and in order that i may be able to speak my mind freely on them i should propose that they be anonymous  i hope that you will all trust me when i tell you that those who have themselves experienced what labour attends the task of composition are generally most tender and charitable in judging of the work of others and that whatever remarks i may make will be such only as a man has a right to make on a womans composition  and if i may seem to be asking anything new or troublesome i beg you to remember that it is the primary idea of this college to vindicate womens right to an education in all points equal to that of men the difference between them being determined not by any fancied inferiority of mind but simply by the distinct offices and character of the sexes  and surely when you recollect the long drudgery at greek and latin verses which is required of every highlyeducated man and the high importance which has attached to them for centuries in the opinion of englishmen you cannot think that i am too exigeant in asking you for a few sets of english verses  believe me that you ought to find their beneficial effect in producing as i said before a measured deliberate style of expression a habit of calling up clear and distinct images on all subjects a power of condensing and arranging your thoughts such as no practice in prose themes can ever give  if you are disappointed of these results it will not be the fault of this longproved method of teaching but of my own inability to carry it out  indeed i cannot too strongly confess my own ignorance or fear my own inability  i stand aghast when i compare my means and my idea but i believe that by teaching thou shalt learn is a rule of which i too shall take the benefit and having begun these lectures in the name of him who is the word and with the firm intention of asserting throughout his claims as the inspirer of all language and of all art i may perhaps hope for the fulfilment of his own promise  be not anxious what you shall speak for it shall be given you in that day and in that hour what you shall speak    on english literature    introductory lecture given at queens college london 1848  an introductory lecture must i suppose be considered as a sort of artexhibition or advertisement of the wares hereafter to be furnished by the lecturer  if these on actual use should prove to fall far short of the promise conveyed in the programme hearers must remember that the lecturer is bound even to his own shame to set forth in all commencements the most perfect method of teaching which he can devise in order that human frailty may have something at which to aim at the same time begging all to consider that in this piecemeal world it is sufficient not so much to have realised ones ideal as earnestly to have tried to realise it according to the measure of each mans gifts  besides what may not be fulfilled in a first course or in a first generation of teachers may still be effected by those who follow them  it is but fair to expect that if this institution shall prove as i pray god it may a centre of female education worthy of the wants of the coming age the method and the practice of the college will be developing as years bring experience and wider eyerange till we become truly able to teach the english woman of the nineteenth century to bear her part in an era which as i believe more and more bids fair to eclipse in faith and in art in science and in polity any and every period of glory which christendom has yet beheld  the first requisite i think for a modern course of english literature is that it be a whole course or none  the literary education of woman has too often fallen into the fault of our elegant extracts and beauties of british poetry  it has neither begun at the beginning nor ended at the end  the young have been taught to admire the laurels of parnassus but only after they have been clipped and pollarded like a dutch shrubbery  the roots which connect them with mythic antiquity and the fresh leaves and flowers of the growing present have been generally cut off with care and the middle part only has been allowed to be usedtoo often of course a sufficiently tough and dry stem  this method is no doubt easy because it saves teachers the trouble of investigating antiquity and saves them too the still more delicate task of judging contemporaneous authorsbut like all half measures it has bred less good than evil  if we could silence a free press and the very free tongues of modern society if we could clip the busy imaginative craving mind of youth on the procrustean bed of use and wont the method might succeed but we can do neitherthe young will read and will hear and the consequence is a general complaint that the minds of young women are outgrowing their mothers guidance that they are reading books which their mothers never dreamt of reading of many of which they never heard many at least whose good and evil they have had no means of investigating that the authors which really interest and influence the minds of the young are just the ones which have formed no part of their education and therefore those for judging of which they have received no adequate rules that in short in literature as in many things education in england is far behind the wants of the age  now this is all wrong and ruinous  the mothers mind should be the lodestar of the daughters  anything which loosens the bond of filial reverence of filial resignation is even more destructive if possible to womanhood than to manhoodthe certain bane of both and the evil fruits are evident enoughselfwill and selfconceit in the less gentle restlessness and dissatisfaction in many of the meekest and gentlest talents seem with most a curse instead of a blessing clever and earnest young women like young men are beginning to wander up and down in all sorts of eclecticisms and dilettanteismsone year they find out that the dark ages were not altogether barbarous and by a revulsion of feeling natural to youth they begin to adore them as a very galaxy of light beauty and holiness  then they begin to crave naturally enough for some real understanding of this strange everdeveloping nineteenth century some real sympathy with its new wonders some real sphere of labour in it and this drives them to devour the very newest authorsany book whatever which seems to open for them the riddle of the mighty and mysterious present which is forcing itself on their attention through every sense  and so up and down amid confusions and oscillations from pole to pole and equally eclectic at either pole from st augustin and mr pugin to goethe and george sand and all intensified and coloured by that tender enthusiasm that craving for something to worship which is a womans highest grace or her bitterest cursewander these poor noahs doves without either ark of shelter or rest for the sole of their foot sometimes alas over strange oceanwastes into gulfs of errortoo sad to speak of here and will wander more and more till teachers begin boldly to face reality and interpret to them both the old and the new lest they misinterpret them for themselves  the educators of the present generation must meet the cravings of the young spirit with the bread of life or they will gorge themselves with poison  telling them that they ought not to be hungry will not stop their hunger shutting our eyes to facts will only make us stumble over them the sooner hiding our eyes in the sand like the hunted ostrich will not hide us from the iron necessity of circumstances or from the almighty will of him who is saying in these days to society in language unmistakable  educate or fall to pieces  speak the whole truth to the young or take the consequences of your cowardice  on these grounds i should wish to see established in this college a really entire course of english literature such as shall give correct reverent and loving views of every period from the earliest legends and poetry of the middle age up to the latest of our modern authors and in the case of the higher classes if it should hereafter be found practicable lectures devoted to the criticism of such authors as may be exercising any real influence upon the minds of english women  this i think should be our ideal it must be attempted cautiously and step by step  it will not be attained at the first trial certainly not by the first lecturer sufficient if each succeeding teacher shall leave something more taught some fresh extension of the range of knowledge which is thought fit for his scholars  i said that the ages of history were analogous to the ages of man and that each age of literature was the truest picture of the history of its day and for this very reason english literature is the best perhaps the only teacher of english history to women especially for it seems to me that it is principally by the help of such an extended literary course that we can cultivate a just and enlarged taste which will connect education with the deepest feelings of the heart  it seems hardly fair or reasonable either to confine the reading of the young to any certain fancied augustan age of authors i mean those of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries especially when that age requires in order to appreciate it a far more developed mind a far greater experience of mankind and of the world than falls to the lot of one young woman out of a thousand  strong meat for men and milk for babes  but why are we to force on any age spiritual food unfitted for it  if we do we shall be likely only to engender a lasting disgust for that by which our pupils might have fully profited had they only been introduced to it when they were ready for it  and this actually happens with english literature  by having the socalled standard works thrust upon them too early and then only in a fragmentary form not fresh and whole but cut up into the very driest hay the young too often neglect in afterlife the very books which then might become the guides of their taste  hence proceed in the minds of the young sudden and irregular revulsions of affection for different schools of writing  and all revolutions in the individual as well as in the nation are sure to be accompanied by some dead loss of what has been already gained some disruption of feelings some renunciation of principles which ought to have been preserved something which might have borne fruit is sure to be crushed in the earthquake  many before me must surely have felt this  do none here remember how when they first escaped from the dry classdrudgery of pope and johnson they snatched greedily at the forbidden fruit of byron perhaps of shelley and sentimental novel writers innumerable  how when the luscious melancholy of their morbid selfconsciousness began to pall on the appetite they fled for refuge as suddenly to mere poetry of description and action to southey scott the balladliterature of all ages  how when the craving returned perhaps unconsciously to themselves to understand the wondrous heart of man they tried to satisfy it with deep draughts of wordsworths celestial and pure simplicity  how again they tired of that too gentle and unworldly strain and sought in shakespeare something more exciting more genial more rich in the facts and passions of daily life  how even his allembracing genius failed to satisfy them because he did not palpably connect for them their fancy and their passions with their religious faithand so they wandered out again over the sea of literature heaven only knows whither in search of a school of authors yet alas unborn  for the true literature of the nineteenth century the literature which shall set forth in worthy strains the relation of the two greatest facts namely of the universe and of christ which shall transfigure all our enlarged knowledge of science and of society of nature of art and man with the eternal truths of the gospel that poetry of the future is not yet here  but it is coming ay even at the doors when this great era shall become conscious of its high vocation and the author too shall claim his priestly calling and the poets of the world like the kingdoms of the world shall become the poets of god and of his christ  but to return  should we not rather in education follow that method which providence has already mapped out for us  if we are bound as of course we are to teach our pupils to breathe freely on the highest mountainpeaks of shakespeares art how can we more certainly train them to do so than by leading them along the same upward path by which shakespeare himself rosethrough the various changes of taste the gradual developments of literature through which the english mind had been passing before shakespeares time for there was a literature before shakespeare  had there not been neither would there have been a shakespeare  critics are now beginning to see that the old fancy which made shakespeare spring up at once a selfperfected poet like minerva fullarmed from the head of jove was a superstition of pedants who neither knew the ages before the great poet nor the man himself except that little of him which seemed to square with their shallow mechanical taste  the old fairy superstition the old legends and ballads the old chronicles of feudal war and chivalry the earlier moralities and mysteries and tragicomic attemptsthese were the roots of his poetic treethey must be the roots of any literary education which can teach us to appreciate him  these fed shakespeares youth why should they not feed our childrens  why indeed  that inborn delight of the young in all that is marvellous and fantastichas that a merely evil root no surely  it is a most pure part of their spiritual nature a part of the heaven which lies about us in our infancy angelwings with which the free child leaps the prisonwalls of sense and custom and the drudgery of earthly lifelike the wild dreams of childhood it is a godappointed means for keeping alive what noble wordsworth calls         those obstinate questionings    of sense and outward things    fallings from us vanishings    blank misgivings of a creature moving about in worlds not realised    by which      though inland far we be    our souls have sight of that immortal sea    which brought us hither    can in a moment travel thither and see the children sporting on the shore and hear the mighty waters rolling evermore   and those old dreams of our ancestors in the childhood of england they are fantastic enough no doubt and unreal but yet they are most true and most practical if we but use them as parables and symbols of human feeling and everlasting truth  what after all is any event of earth palpable as it may seem but like them a shadow and a ghostly dream till it has touched our hearts till we have found out and obeyed its spiritual lesson  be sure that one really pure legend or ballad may bring gods truth and heavens beauty more directly home to the young spirit than whole volumes of dry abstract didactic morality  outward things beauty action nature are the great problems for the young  god has put them in a visible world that by what they see they may learn to know the unseen and we must begin to feed their minds with that literature which deals most with visible things with passion manifested in action which we shall find in the early writing of our middle ages for then the collective mind of our nation was passing through its natural stages of childhood and budding youth as every nation and every single individual must at some time or other do a true young england always significant and precious to the young  i said there was a literary art before shakespearean art more simple more childlike more girlish as it were and therefore all the more adapted for young minds  but also an art most vigorous and pure in point of style thoroughly fitted to give its readers the first elements of taste which must lie at the root of even the most complex aesthetics  i know no higher specimens of poetic style considering the subject and the belief of the time about them than may be found in many of our old ballads  how many poets are there in england now who could have written the twa bairns or sir patrick spens  how many such histories as old william of malmesbury in spite of all his foolish monk miracles  as few now as there were then and as for lying legendsthey had their superstitions and we have ours and the next generation will stare at our strange doings as much as we stare at our forefathers  for our forefathers they were we owe them filial reverence thoughtful attention and morewe must know them ere we can know ourselves  the only key to the present is the past  but i must go farther still and after premising that the english classics so called of the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries will of course form the bulk of the lectures i must plead for some instruction in the works of recent and living authors  i cannot see why we are to teach the young about the past and not about the present  after all they have to live now and at no other time in this same nineteenth century lies their work  it may be unfortunate but we cannot help it  i do not see why we should wish to help it i know no century which the world has yet seen so well worth living in  let us thank god that we are here now and joyfully try to understand where we are and what our work is here  as for all superstitions about the good old times and fancies that they belonged to god while this age belongs only to man blind chance and the evil one let us cast them from us as the suggestions of an evil lying spirit as the natural parents of laziness pedantry popery and unbelief  and therefore let us not fear to tell our children the meaning of this present day and of all its different voices  let us not be content to say to them as we have been doing we will see you well instructed in the past but you must make out the present for yourselves  why if the past is worth explaining far more is the presentthe pressing noisy complex present where our workfield lies the most intricate of all states of society and of all schools of literature yet known and therefore the very one requiring most explanation  how rich in strange and touching utterances have been the last fifty years of english literature  do you think that god has been teaching us nothing in them  will he not make our children listen to that teaching whether we like or not  and suppose our most modern writers had added nothing to the stock of national knowledge which i most fervently deny yet are they not actually influencing the minds of the young and can we prevent their doing so either directly or indirectly  if we do not find them right teaching about their own day will they not be sure to find selfchosen teachers about it themselves who will be almost certainly the first who may come to hand and therefore as likely as not to be bad teachers  and do we not see every day that it is just the most tender the most enthusiastic the most precious spirits who are most likely to be misled because their honest disgust at the follies of the day has most utterly outgrown their critical training  and that lazy wholesale disapprobation of living writers so common and convenient what does it do but injure all reverence for parents and teachers when the young find out that the poet who as they were told was a bungler and a charlatan somehow continues to touch the purest and noblest nerves of their souls and that the author who was said to be dangerous and unchristian somehow makes them more dutiful more earnest more industrious more loving to the poor  i speak of actual cases  would to god they were not daily ones  is it not then the wiser because the more simple and trustful method both to god and our children to say  you shall read living authors and we will teach you how to read them you like every child that is born into the world must eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil we will see that you have your senses exercised to discern between that good and that evil  you shall have the writers for whom you long as far as consists with common prudence and morality and more you shall be taught them  all we ask of you is to be patient and humble believe us you will never really appreciate these writers you will not even rationally enjoy their beauties unless you submit to a course of intellectual training like that through which most of them have passed and through which certainly this nation which produced them has passed in the successive stages of its growth  the best method i think of working out these principles would be to devote a few lectures in the last term of every complete course to the examination of some select works of recent writers chosen under the sanction of the educational committee  but i must plead for whole works  extracts and select beauties are about as practical as the worthy in the old story who wishing to sell his house brought one of the bricks to market as a specimen  it is equally unfair on the author and on the pupil for it is impossible to show the merits or demerits of a work of art even to explain the truth or falsehood of any particular passage except by viewing the book as an organic whole  and as for the fear of raising a desire to read more of an author than may be properwhen a work has once been pointed out as really hurtful the rest must be left to the best safeguard which i have yet discovered in man or womanthe pupils own honour  such a knowledge of english literature would tend no less i think to the spread of healthy historic views among us  the literature of every nation is its autobiography  even in its most complex and artistic forms it is still a wonderfully artless and unconscious record of its doubts and its faith its sorrows and its triumphs at each era of its existence  wonderfully artless and correctbecause all utterances which were not faithful to their time which did not touch some sympathetic chord in their hearts souls are pretty sure to have been swept out into wholesome oblivion and only the most genuine and earnest left behind for posterity  the history of england indeed is the literature of englandbut one very different from any school history or other now in vogue  you will find it neither a mere list of acts of parliament and recordoffice like some nor yet an antiquarian gallery of costumes and armour like others nor a mere wargazette and report of killed and wounded from time to time least of all not a debretts peerage and catalogue of kings and queens whose names are given while their souls are ignored but a true spiritual history of englanda picture of the spirits of our old forefathers who worked and fought and sorrowed and died for us on whose accumulated labours we now here stand that i call a historynot of one class of offices or events but of the living human souls of english men and english women  and therefore one most adapted to the mind of woman one which will call into fullest exercise her blessed faculty of sympathy that pure and tender heart of flesh which teaches her always to find her highest interest in mankind simply as mankind to see the divine most completely in the human to prefer the incarnate to the disembodied the personal to the abstract the pathetic to the intellectual to see and truly in the most common tale of village love or sorrow a mystery deeper and more divine than lies in all the theories of politicians or the fixed ideas of the sage  such a course of history would quicken womens inborn personal interest in the actors of this lifedrama and be quickened by it in return as indeed it ought  for it is thus that god intended woman to look instinctively at the world  would to god that she would teach us men to look at it thus likewise  would to god that she would in these days claim and fulfil to the uttermost her vocation as the priestess of charitythat womans heart would help to deliver man from bondage to his own tyrannous and alltooexclusive brain from our idolatry of mere dead laws and printed booksfrom our daily sin of looking at men not as our struggling and suffering brothers but as mere symbols of certain formulae incarnations of sets of opinions wheels in some iron libertygrinding or christianity spinning machine which we miscall society or civilisation or worst misnomer of all the church  this i take to be one of the highest aims of womanto preach charity love and brotherhood  but in this nineteenth century hunting everywhere for law and organisation refusing loyalty to anything which cannot range itself under its theories she will never get a hearing till her knowledge of the past becomes more organised and methodic  as it is now for want of large manysided views of the past her admiration is too apt to attach itself to some two or three characters only in the herolist of all the ages  then comes the temptation to thrust aside all which interferes with her favourite idols and so the very heart given her for universal sympathy becomes the organ of an exclusive bigotry and she who should have taught man to love too often only embitters his hate  i claim therefore as necessary for the education of the future that woman should be initiated into the thoughts and feelings of her countrymen in every age from the wildest legends of the past to the most palpable naturalism of the present and that not merely in a chronological order sometimes not in chronological order at all but in a true spiritual sequence that knowing the hearts of many she may in after life be able to comfort the hearts of all  but there is yet another advantage in an extended study of english literaturei mean the more national tone which it ought to give the thoughts of the rising generation  of course to repress the reading of foreign books to strive after any national exclusiveness or mere johnbullism of mind in an age of railroads and free press would be simply absurdand more it would be fighting against the will of god revealed in events  he has put the literary treasures of the continent into our hands we must joyfully accept them and earnestly exhaust them  this age is craving for what it calls catholicity for more complete interchange and brotherhood of thought between all the nations of the earth  this spirit is stirring in the young especially and i believe that god himself has inspired it because i see that he has first revealed the means of gratifying the desire at that very time in which it has arisen  but every observant person must be aware that this tendency has produced its evils as well as its good  there is a general complaint that the minds of young women are becoming unenglish that their foreign reading does not merely supply the deficiencies of their english studies but too often completely supersedes them that the whole tone of their thoughts is too often taken from french or german writings that by some means or other the standard works of english literature are becoming very much undervalued and neglected by the young people of this day and that selfwill and irregular eclecticism are the natural results  i must say that i consider the greater part of these evils as the natural consequence of past miseducation as the just punishment of the old system which attached the most disproportionate importance to mere acquirements and those mostly of foreign languages foreign music and so forth while the well of english undefiled and not only that but english literature history patriotism too often english religion have been made quite minor considerations therefore so few of the young have any healthy and firm english standard whereby to try and judge foreign thought  therefore they fancy when they meet with anything deep and attractive in foreign works that because they have no such thoughts put before them in english authors no such thoughts exist in them  but happily we may do much towards mending this state of things by making our pupils thoroughly conversant with the aesthetic treasures of english literature  from them i firmly believe they may derive sufficient rules whereby to separate in foreign books the true from the false the necessary from the accidental the eternal truth from its peculiar national vesture  above all we shall give them a better chance of seeing things from that side from which god intended english women to see them  for as surely as there is an english view of everything so surely god intends us to take that view and he who gave us our english character intends us to develop its peculiarities as he intends the french woman to develop hers that so each nation by learning to understand itself may learn to understand and therefore to profit by its neighbour  he who has not cultivated his own plot of ground will hardly know much about the tillage of his neighbours land  and she who does not appreciate the mind of her own countrymen will never form any true judgment of the mind of foreigners  let english women be sure that the best way to understand the heroines of the continent is not by mimicking them however noble they may be not by trying to become a sham rahel or a sham de sevigne but a real elizabeth fry felicia hemans or hannah more  what indeed entitles either madame de sevigne or rahel to fame but their very nationalitythat intensely local style of language and feeling which clothes their genius with a living body instead of leaving it in the abstractions of a dreary cosmopolitism the one i suppose would be called the very beauideal not of woman but of the french womanthe other the ideal not even of the jewess but of the german jewess  we may admire wherever we find worth but if we try to imitate we only caricature  excellence grows in all climes transplants to none  the palm luxuriates only in the tropics the alprose only beside eternal snows  only by standing on our own native earth can we enjoy or even see aright the distant stars  if we try to reach them we shall at once lose sight of them and drop helpless in a new element unfitted for our limbs  teach then the young by an extended knowledge of english literature thoroughly to comprehend the english spirit thoroughly to see that the english mind has its peculiar calling on gods earth which alone and no other it can fulfil  teach them thoroughly to appreciate the artistic and intellectual excellences of their own country but by no means in a spirit of narrow bigotry  tell them fairly our national faultsteach them to unravel those faults from our national virtues and then there will be no danger of the prejudiced english woman becoming by a sudden revulsion an equally prejudiced cosmopolite and eclectic as soon as she discovers that her own nation does not monopolise all human perfections and so trying to become german italian french woman all at oncea heterogeneous chaos of imitations very probably with the faults of all three characters and the graces of none  god has given us our own prophets our own heroines  to recognise those prophets to imitate those heroines is the duty which lies nearest to the english woman and therefore the duty which god intends her to fulfil  i should wish therefore in the first few lectures on english literature to glance at the character of our old saxon ancestors and the legends connected with their first invasion of the country and above all at the magnificent fables of king arthur and his times which exercised so great an influence on the english mind and were in fact although originally celtic so thoroughly adopted and naturalised by the saxon as to reappear under different forms in every age and form the keynote of most of our fictions from geoffrey of monmouth and the medieval ballads up to chaucer spenser shakespeare and at last milton and blackmore  this series of legends will i think as we trace its development bring us in contact one by one with the corresponding developments of the english character and unless i am much mistaken enable us to explain many of its peculiarities  of course nothing more than sketches can be given but i think nothing more is required for any one but the professed historian for young people especially it is sufficient to understand the tone of human feeling expressed by legends rather than to enter into any critical dissertations on their historic truth  they need after all principles rather than facts  to educate them truly we must give them inductive habits of thought and teach them to deduce from a few facts a law which makes plain all similar ones and so acquire the habit of extracting from every story somewhat of its kernel of spiritual meaning  but again to educate them truly we must ourselves have faith we must believe that in every one there is a spiritual eye which can perceive those great principles when they are once fairly presented to it that in all there are some noble instincts some pure yearnings after wisdom and taste and usefulness which if we only appeal to them trustfully through the examples of the past and the excitements of the present will wake into conscious life  above all both pupils and teachers must never forget that all these things were written for their examples that though circumstances and creeds schools and tastes may alter yet the heart of man and the duty of man remain unchanged and that while   the old order changes giving place to the new and god fulfils himself in many ways   yet again   through the ages one unaltered purpose runs   and the principles of truth and beauty are the same as when the everlasting spirit from whom they come brooded upon the face of the primeval seas  but once more we must and will by gods help try to realise the purpose of this college by boldly facing the facts of the age and of our own office  and therefore we shall not shrink from the task however delicate and difficult of speaking to our hearers as to women  our teaching must be no sexless heartless abstraction  we must try to make all which we tell them bear on the great purpose of unfolding to woman her own calling in all agesher especial calling in this one  we must incite them to realise the chivalrous belief of our old forefathers among their saxon forests that something divine dwelt in the counsels of woman but on the other hand we must continually remind them that they will attain that divine instinct not by renouncing their sex but by fulfilling it by becoming true women and not bad imitations of men by educating their heads for the sake of their hearts not their hearts for the sake of their heads by claiming womans divine vocation as the priestess of purity of beauty and of love by educating themselves to become with gods blessing worthy wives and mothers of a mighty nation of workers in an age when the voice of the everworking god is proclaiming through the thunder of falling dynasties and crumbling idols  he that will not work neither shall he eat    grots and groves 269    this lecture is intended to be suggestive rather than didactic to set you thinking and inquiring for yourselves rather than learning at secondhand from me  some among my audience i doubt not will neither need to be taught by me nor to be stirred up to inquiry for themselves  they are already probably antiquarians already better acquainted with the subject than i am  but they will i hope remember that i am only trying to excite a general interest in that very architecture in which they delight and so to make the public do justice to their labours  they will therefore i trust   be to my faults a little blind be to my virtues very kind   and if my architectural theories do not seem to them correct in all detailswellfounded i believe them myself to beremember that if it be a light matter to me or to the audience whether any special and pet fancy of mine should be exactly true or not yet it is not a light matter that my hearers should be awakenedand too many just now need an actual awakeningto a right pure and wholesome judgment on questions of art especially when the soundness of that judgment depends as in this case on sound judgments about human history as well as about natural objects  now it befell me that fresh from the tropic forests and with their forms hanging always as it were in the background of my eye i was impressed more and more vividly the longer i looked with the likeness of those forest forms to the forms of our own cathedral of chester  the grand and graceful chapterhouse transformed itself into one of those green bowers which once seen and never to be seen again make one at once richer and poorer for the rest of life the fans of groining sprang from the short columns just as do the feathered boughs of the far more beautiful maximiliana palm and just of the same size and shape and met overhead as i have seen them meet in aisles longer by far than our cathedral nave  the free upright shafts which give such strength and yet such lightness to the mullions of each window pierced upward through those curving lines as do the stems of young trees through the fronds of palm and like them carried the eye and the fancy up into the infinite and took off a sense of oppression and captivity which the weight of the roof might have produced  in the nave in the choir the same vision of the tropic forest haunted me  the fluted columns not only resembled but seemed copied from the fluted stems beneath which i had ridden in the primeval woods their bases their capitals seemed copied from the bulgings at the collar of the root and at the spring of the boughs produced by a check of the redundant sap and were garlanded often enough like the capitals of the columns with delicate tracery of parasite leaves and flowers the mouldings of the arches seemed copied from the parallel bundles of the curving bamboo shoots and even the flatter roof of the nave and transepts had its antitype in that highest level of the forest aisles where the trees having climbed at last to the lightfood which they seek care no longer to grow upward but spread out in huge limbs almost horizontal reminding the eye of the fourcentred arch which marks the period of perpendicular gothic  nay to this day there is one point in our cathedral which to me keeps up the illusion still  as i enter the choir and look upward toward the left i cannot help seeing in the tabernacle work of the stalls the slender and aspiring forms of the rastrajo the delicate second growth which as it were rushes upward from the earth wherever the forest is cleared and above it in the tall lines of the northwest pier of the towereven though defaced along the inner face of the western arch by ugly and needless perpendicular panellingi seem to see the stems of huge cedars or balatas or ceibas curving over as they would do into the great beams of the transept roof some seventy feet above the ground  nay so far will the fancy lead that i have seemed to see in the stained glass between the tracery of the windows such gorgeous sheets of colour as sometimes flash on the eye when far aloft between high stems and boughs you catch sight of some great tree ablaze with flowers either its own or those of a parasite yellow or crimson white or purple and over them again the cloudless blue  now i know well that all these dreams are dreams that the men who built our northern cathedrals never saw these forest forms and that the likeness of their work to those of tropic nature is at most only a corroboration of mr ruskins dictum that the gothic did not arise out of but developed itself into a resemblance to vegetation    it was no chance suggestion of the form of an arch from the bending of a bough but the gradual and continual discovery of a beauty in natural forms which could be more and more transferred into those of stone which influenced at once the hearts of the people and the form of the edifice  so true is this that by a pure and noble copying of the vegetable beauty which they had seen in their own clime the medieval craftsmen went so faras i have shown youas to anticipate forms of vegetable beauty peculiar to tropic climes which they had not seen a fresh proof if proof were needed that beauty is something absolute and independent of man and not as some think only relative and what happens to be pleasant to the eye of this man or that  but thinking over this matter and reading over too that which mr ruskin has written thereon in his stones of venice vol ii cap vi on the nature of gothic i came to certain further conclusions or at least surmiseswhich i put before you tonight in hopes that if they have no other effect on you they will at least stir some of you up to read mr ruskins works  now mr ruskin says  that the original conception of gothic architecture has been derived from vegetation from the symmetry of avenues and the interlacing of branches is a strange and vain supposition  it is a theory which never could have existed for a moment in the mind of any person acquainted with early gothic but however idle as a theory it is most valuable as a testimony to the character of the perfected style  doubtless so  but you must remember always that the subject of my lecture is grots and groves that i am speaking not of gothic architecture in general but of gothic ecclesiastical architecture and more almost exclusively of the ecclesiastical architecture of the teutonic or northern nations because in them as i think the resemblance between the temple and the forest reached the fullest exactness  now the original idea of a christian church was that of a grota cave  that is a historic fact  the christianity which was passed on to us began to worship hidden and persecuted in the catacombs of rome it may be often around the martyrs tombs by the dim light of candle or of torch  the candles on the roman altars whatever they have been made to symbolise since then are the hereditary memorials of that fact  throughout the north in these isles as much as in any land the idea of the grot was in like wise the idea of a church the saint or hermit built himself a cell dark massive intended to exclude light as well as weather or took refuge in a cave  there he prayed and worshipped and gathered others to pray and worship round him during his life  there he often enough became an object of worship in his turn after his death  in after ages his cave was ornamented like that of the hermit of montmajour by arles or his cellchapel enlarged as those of the scotch and irish saints have been again and again till at last a stately minster rose above it still the idea that the church was to be a grot haunted the minds of builders  but side by side with the christian grot there was throughout the north another form of temple dedicated to very different gods namely the trees from whose mighty stems hung the heads of the victims of odin or of thorthe horse the goat and in time of calamity or pestilence of men  trees and not grots were the temples of our forefathers  scholars know wellbut they must excuse my quoting it for the sake of those who are not scholarsthe famous passage of tacitus which tells how our forefathers held it beneath the dignity of the gods to coop them within walls or liken them to any human countenance but consecrated groves and woods and called by the name of gods that mystery which they held by faith alone and the equally famous passage of claudian about the vast silence of the black forest and groves awful with ancient superstition and oaks barbarian deities and lucans groves inviolate from all antiquity and altars stained with human blood  to worship in such spots was an abomination to the early christian it was as much a test of heathendom as the eating of horseflesh sacred to odin and therefore unclean to christian men  the lombard laws and others forbid expressly the lingering remnants of grove worship  st boniface and other early missionaries hewed down in defiance the sacred oaks and paid sometimes for their valour with their lives  it is no wonder then if long centuries elapsed ere the likeness of vegetable forms began to reappear in the christian churches of the north  and yet both grot and grove were equally the natural temples which the religious instinct of all deephearted peoples conscious of sin and conscious too of yearnings after a perfection not to be found on earth chooses from the earliest stage of awakening civilisation  in them alone before he had strength and skill to build nobly for himself could man find darkness the mother of mystery and awe in which he is reminded perforce of his own ignorance and weakness in which he learns first to remember unseen powers sometimes to his comfort and elevation sometimes only to his terror and debasement darkness and with it silence and solitude in which he can collect himself and shut out the noise and glare the meanness and the coarseness of the world and be alone awhile with his own thoughts his own fancy his own conscience his own soul  but for awhile as i have said that darkness solitude and silence were to be sought in the grot not in the grove  then christianity conquered the empire  it adapted not merely its architecture but its very buildings to its worship  the roman basilica became the christian church a noble form of building enough though one in which was neither darkness solitude nor silence but crowded congregations clappingor otherwisethe popular preacher or fighting about the election of a bishop or a pope till the holy place ran with christian blood  the deephearted northern turned away in weariness and disgust from those vast halls fitted only for the feverish superstition of a profligate and wornout civilisation and took himself amid his own rocks and forests moors and shores to a simpler and sterner architecture which should express a creed sterner and at heart far simpler though dogmatically the same  and this is to my mind the difference and the noble difference between the socalled norman architecture which came hither about the time of the conquest and that of romanised italy  but the normans were a conquering race and one which conquered be it always remembered in england at least in the name and by the authority of rome  their ecclesiastics like the ecclesiastics on the continent were the representatives of roman civilisation of romes right intellectual and spiritual to rule the world  therefore their architecture like their creed was roman  they took the massive towering roman forms which expressed domination and piled them one on the other to express the domination of christian rome over the souls as they had represented the domination of heathen rome over the bodies of men  and so side by side with the towers of the norman keep rose the towers of the norman cathedral the two signs of a double servitude  but with the thirteenth century there dawned an age in northern europe which i may boldly call an heroic ageheroic in its virtues and in its crimes an age of rich passionate youth or rather of early manhood full of aspirations of chivalry of selfsacrifice as strange and terrible as it was beautiful and noble even when most misguided  the teutonic nations of europeour own forefathers most of allhaving absorbed all that heathen rome could teach them at least for the time being began to think for themselves to have poets philosophers historians architects of their own  the thirteenth century was especially an age of aspiration and its architects expressed in building quite unlike those of the preceding centuries the aspirations of the time  the pointed arch had been introduced half a century before  it may be that the crusaders saw it in the east and brought it home  it may be that it originated from the quadripartite vaulting of the normans the segmental groins of which crossing diagonally produced to appearance the pointed arch  it may be that it was derived from that mystical figure of a pointed oval form the vesica piscis  it may be lastly that it was suggested simply by the intersection of semicircular arches so frequently found in ornamental arcades  the last cause may perhaps be the true one but it matters little whence the pointed arch came  it matters much what it meant to those who introduced it  and at the beginning of the transition or seminorman period it seems to have meant nothing  it was not till the thirteenth century that it had gradually received as it were a soul and had become the exponent of a great idea  as the norman architecture and its forms had signified domination so the early english as we call it signified aspirationan idea which was perfected as far as it could be in what we call the decorated style  there is an evident gap i had almost said a gulf between the architectural mind of the eleventh and that of the thirteenth century  a vertical tendency a longing after lightness and freedom appears and with them a longing to reproduce the graces of nature and art  and here i ask you to look for yourselves at the buildings of this new erathere is a beautiful specimen in yonder arcade 278and judge for yourselves whether they and even more than they the decorated style into which they developed do not remind you of the forest shapes  and if they remind you must they not have reminded those who shaped them  can it have been otherwise  we know that the men who built were earnest  the carefulness the reverence of their work have given a subject for some of mr ruskins noblest chapters a text for some of his noblest sermons  we know that they were students of vegetable form  that is proved by the flowers the leaves even the birds with which they enwreathed their capitals and enriched their mouldings  look up there and see  you cannot look at any good churchwork from the thirteenth to the middle of the fifteenth century with out seeing that leaves and flowers were perpetually in the workmans mind  do you fancy that stems and boughs were never in his mind  he kept doubtless in remembrance the fundamental idea that the christian church should symbolise a grot or cave  he could do no less while he again and again saw hermits around him dwelling and worshipping in caves as they had done ages before in egypt and syria while he fixed again and again the site of his convent and his minster in some secluded valley guarded by cliffs and rocks like vale crucis in north wales but his minster stood often not among rocks only but amid trees in some clearing in the primeval forest as vale crucis was then  at least he could not pass from minster to minster from town to town without journeying through long miles of forest  do you think that the awful shapes and shadows of that forest never haunted his imagination as he built  he would have cut down ruthlessly as his predecessors the early missionaries did the sacred trees amid which thor and odin had been worshipped by the heathen saxons amid which still darker deities were still worshipped by the heathen tribes of eastern europe  but he was the descendant of men who had worshipped in those groves and the glamour of them was upon him still  he peopled the wild forest with demons and fairies but that did not surely prevent his feeling its ennobling grandeur its chastening loneliness  his ancestors had held the oaks for trees of god even as the jews held the cedar and the hindoos likewise for the deodara pine is not only botanists tell us the same as the cedar of lebanon but its very namethe deodarasignifies naught else but the tree of god  his ancestors i say had held the oaks for trees of god  it may be that as the monk sat beneath their shade with his bible on his knee like good st boniface in the fulda forest he found that his ancestors were right  to understand what sort of trees they were from which he got his inspiration you must look not at an average english wood perpetually thinned out as the trees arrive at middle age  still less must you look at the pines oaks beeches of an english park where each tree has had space to develop itself freely into a more or less rounded form  you must not even look at the tropic forests for there from the immense diversity of forms twenty varieties of tree will grow beneath each other forming a closepacked heap of boughs and leaves from the ground to a hundred feet and more aloft  you should look at the north american forests of social trees especially of pines and firs where trees of one species crowded together and competing with equal advantages for the air and light form themselves into one wilderness of straight smooth shafts surmounted by a flat sheet of foliage held up by boughs like the ribs of a groined roof while underneath the ground is bare as a cathedral floor  you all know surely the hemlock spruce of america which while growing by itself in open ground is the most wilful and fantastic as well as the most graceful of all the firs imitating the shape not of its kindred but of an enormous tuft of fern  yet if you look at the same tree when it has struggled long for life from its youth amid other trees of its own kind and its own age you find that the lower boughs have died off from want of light leaving not a scar behind  the upper boughs have reached at once the light and their natural term of years  they are content to live and little more  the central trunk no longer sends up each year a fresh perpendicular shoot to aspire above the rest but as weary of struggling ambition as they are is content to become more and more their equal as the years pass by  and this is a law of social forest trees which you must bear in mind whenever i speak of the influence of treeforms on gothic architecture  such forms as these are rare enough in europe now  i never understood how possible how common they must have been in medieval europe till i saw in the forest of fontainebleau a few oaks like the oak of charlemagne and the bouquet du roi at whose age i dare not guess but whose size and shape showed them to have once formed part of a continuous wood the like whereof remains not in these islesperhaps not east of the carpathian mountains  in them a clear shaft of at least sixty it may be eighty feet carries a flat head of boughs each in itself a tree  in such a grove i thought the heathen gaul even the heathen frank worshipped beneath trees of god  such trees i thought centuries after inspired the genius of every builder of gothic aisles and roofs  thus at least we can explain that rigidity which mr ruskin tells us is a special element of gothic architecture  greek and egyptian buildings he saysand i should have added roman building also in proportion to their age ie to the amount of the roman elements in themstand for the most part by their own weight and mass one stone passively incumbent on another  but in the gothic vaults and traceries there is a stiffness analogous to that of the bones of a limb or fibres of a tree an elastic tension and communication of force from part to part and also a studious expression of this throughout every part of the building  in a word gothic vaulting and tracery have been studiously made like to boughs of trees  were those boughs present to the mind of the architect  or is the coincidence merely fortuitous  you know already how i should answer the cusped arch too was it actually not intended to imitate vegetation  mr ruskin seems to think so  he says that it is merely the special application to the arch of the great ornamental system of foliation which whether simple as in the cusped arch or complicated as in tracery arose out of the love of leafage  not that the form of the arch is intended to imitate a leaf but to be invested with the same characters of beauty which the designer had discovered in the leaf  now i differ from mr ruskin with extreme hesitation  i agree that the cusped arch is not meant to imitate a leaf  i think with mr ruskin that it was probably first adopted on account of its superior strength and that it afterwards took the form of a bough  but i cannot as yet believe that it was not at last intended to imitate a bough a bough of a very common form and one in which active rigidity is peculiarly shown  i mean a bough which has forked  if the lower fork has died off for want of light we obtain something like the simply cusped arch  if it be still living but short and stunted in comparison with the higher forkwe obtain it seems to me something like the foliated cusp both likenesses being near enough to those of common objects to make it possible that those objects may have suggested them  and thus more and more boldly the medieval architect learnt to copy boughs stems and at last the whole effect as far always as stone would allow of a combination of rock and tree of grot and grove  so he formed his minsters as i believe upon the model of those leafy minsters in which he walked to meditate amid the aisles which god not man has built  he sent their columns aloft like the boles of ancient trees  he wreathed their capitals sometimes their very shafts with flowers and creeping shoots  he threw their arches out and interwove the groinings of their vaults like the boughroofage overhead  he decked with foliage and fruit the bosses above and the corbels below  he sent up out of those corbels upright shafts along the walls in the likeness of the trees which sprang out of the rocks above his head  he raised those walls into great cliffs  he pierced them with the arches of the triforium as with hermits cells  he represented in the horizontal sills of his windows and in his horizontal stringcourses the horizontal strata of the rocks  he opened the windows into high and lofty glades broken as in the forest by the tracery of stems and boughs through which was seen not merely the outer but the upper world  for he craved as all true artists crave for light and colour and had the sky above been one perpetual blue he might have been content with it and left his glass transparent  but in that dark dank northern clime rain and snowstorm black cloud and gray mist were all that he was like to see outside for nine months in the year  so he took such light and colour as nature gave in her few gayer moods and set aloft his stainedglass windows the hues of the noonday and the rainbow and the sunrise and the sunset and the purple of the heather and the gold of the gorse and the azure of the bugloss and the crimson of the poppy and among them in gorgeous robes the angels and the saints of heaven and the memories of heroic virtues and heroic sufferings that he might lift up his own eyes and heart for ever out of the dark dank sad world of the cold north with all its coarsenesses and its crimes toward a realm of perpetual holiness amid a perpetual summer of beauty and of light as one whofor he was true to nature even in thatfrom between the black jaws of a narrow glen or from beneath the black shade of gnarled trees catches a glimpse of far lands gay with gardens and cottages and purple mountain ranges and the faroff sea and the hazy horizon melting into the hazy sky and finds his heart carried out into an infinite at once of freedom and of repose  and so out of the cliffs and the forests he shaped the inside of his church  and how did he shape the outside  look for yourselves and judge  but look not at chester but at salisbury  look at those churches which carry not mere towers but spires or at least pinnacled towers approaching the pyramidal form  the outside form of every gothic cathedral must be considered imperfect if it does not culminate in something pyramidal  the especial want of all greek and roman buildings with which we are acquainted is the absencesave in a few and unimportant casesof the pyramidal form  the egyptians knew at least the worth of the obelisk but the greeks and romans hardly knew even that  their buildings are flattopped  their builders were contented with the earth as it was  there was a great truth involved in that which i am the last to deny  but religions which like the buddhist or the christian nurse a noble selfdiscontent are sure to adopt sooner or later an upward and aspiring form of building  it is not merely that fancying heaven to be above earth they point towards heaven  there is a deeper natural language in the pyramidal form of a growing tree  it symbolises growth or the desire of growth  the norman tower does nothing of the kind  it does not aspire to grow  looki mention an instance with which i am most familiarat the norman tower of bury st edmunds  it is gracefulawful if you willbut there is no aspiration in it  it is stately but selfcontent  its horizontal courses circular arches above all its flat skyline seem to have risen enough and wish to rise no higher  for it has no touch of that unrest of soul which is expressed by the spire and still more by the compound spire with its pinnacles crockets finialswhich are finials only in name for they do not finish and are really terminal buds as it were longing to open and grow upward even as the crockets are bracts and leaves thrown off as the shoot has grown  you feel surely the truth of these last words  you cannot look at the canopy work or the pinnacle work of this cathedral without seeing that they do not merely suggest buds and leaves but that the buds and leaves are there carven before your eyes  i myself cannot look at the tabernacle work of our stalls without being reminded of the young pine forests which clothe the hampshire moors  but if the details are copied from vegetable forms why not the whole  is not a spire like a growing tree a tabernacle like a firtree a compound spire like a group of firs  and if we can see that do you fancy that the man who planned the spire did not see it as clearly as we do and perhaps more clearly still  i am aware of course that norman architecture had sometimes its pinnacle a mere conical or polygonal capping  i am aware that this form only more and more slender lasted on in england during the thirteenth and the early part of the fourteenth century and on the continent under many modifications one english kind whereof is usually called a broach of which you have a beautiful specimen in the new church at hoole  now no one will deny that that broach is beautiful  but it would be difficult to prove that its form was taken from a north european tree  the cypress was unknown probably to our northern architects the lombardy poplarwhich has wandered hither i know not when all the way from cashmerehad not wandered then i believe farther than north italy  the form is rather that of mere stone of the obelisk or of the mountainpeak and they in fact may have at first suggested the spire  the grandeur of an isolated mountain even of a dolmen or single upright stone is evident to all  but it is the grandeur not of aspiration but of defiance not of the christian not even of the stoic but rather of the epicurean  it saysi cannot rise  i do not care to rise  i will be contentedly and valiantly that which i am and face circumstances though i cannot conquer them  but it is defiance under defeat  the mountain peak does not grow but only decays  fretted by rains peeled by frost splintered by lightning it must down at last and crumble into earth were it as old as hard as lofty as the matterhorn itself  and while it stands it wants not only aspiration it wants tenderness it wants humility it wants the unrest which tenderness and humility must breed and which mr ruskin so clearly recognises in the best gothic art  and meanwhile it wants naturalness  the mere smooth spire or broachi had almost said even the spire of salisburyis like no tall or commanding object in nature  it is merely the caricature of oneit may be of the mountainpeak  the outline must be broken must be softened before it can express the soul of a creed which in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries far more than now was one of penitence as well as of aspiration of passionate emotion as well as of lofty faith  but a shape which will express that soul must be sought not among mineral but among vegetable forms  and remember always if we feel thus even now how much more must those medieval men of genius have felt thus whose work we now dare only copy line by line  soas it seems to methey sought among vegetable forms for what they needed  and they found it at once in the pine or rather the firthe spruce and silver firs of their own forests  they are not of course indigenous to england  but they are so common through all the rest of europe that not only would the form suggest itself to a continental architect but to any english clerk who travelled as all did who could across the alps to rome  the firtree not growing on level ground like the oaks of fontainebleau into one flat roof of foliage but clinging to the hillside and the crag old above young spire above spire whorl above whorlfor the young shoots of each whorl of boughs point upward in the spring and now and then a whole bough breaking away as it were into free space turns upward altogether and forms a secondary spire on the same treethis surely was the form which the medieval architect seized to clothe with it the sides and roof of the stone mountain which he had built piling up pinnacles and spires each crocketed at the angles that like a group of firs upon an isolated rock every point of the building might seem in act to grow toward heaven till his idea culminated in that glorious minster of cologne which if it ever be completed will be the likeness of one forestclothed group of cliffs surrounded by three enormous pines  one feature of the norman temple he could keep for it was copied from the same nature which he was trying to copynamely the high pitched roof and gables  mr ruskin lays it down as a law that the acute angle in roofs gables spires is the distinguishing mark of northern gothic  it was adopted most probably at first from domestic buildings  a northern house or barn must have a high pitched roof or the snow will not slip off it  but that fact was not discovered by man it was copied by him from the rocks around he saw the mountainpeak jut black and bare above the snows of winter he saw those snows slip down in sheets rush down in torrents under the sun from the steep slabs of rock which coped the hillside and he copied in his roofs the rocks above his town  but as the love for decorations arose he would deck his roofs as nature had decked hers till the gray sheets of the cathedral slates should stand out amid pinnacles and turrets rich with foliage as the gray mountainsides stood out amid knolls of feathery birch and towering pine  he failed though he failed nobly  he never succeeded in attaining a perfectly natural style  the medieval architects were crippled to the last by the tradition of artificial roman forms  they began improving them into naturalness without any clear notion of what they wanted and when that notion became clear it was too late  take as an instance the tracery of their windows  it is true as mr ruskin says that they began by piercing holes in a wall of the form of a leaf which developed in the rose window into the form of a star inside and of a flower outside  look at such aloft there  then by introducing mullions and traceries into the lower part of the window they added stem and bough forms to those flower forms  but the two did not fit  look at the west window of our choir and you will see what i mean  the upright mullions break off into bough curves graceful enough  but these are cut shortas i hold spoiledby circular and triangular forms of rose and trefoil resting on them as such forms never rest in nature and the whole though beautiful is only half beautiful  it is fragmentary unmeaningbarbaric because unnatural  they failed too it may be from the very paucity of the vegetable forms they could find to copy among the flora of this colder clime and so stopped short in drawing from nature ran off into mere purposeless luxuriance  had they been able to add to their stock of memories a hundred forms which they would have seen in the tropics they might have gone on for centuries copying nature without exhausting her  and yet did they exhaust even the few forms of beauty which they saw around them  it must be confessed that they did not  i believe that they could not because they dared not  the unnaturalness of the creed which they expressed always hampered them  it forbade them to look nature freely and lovingly in the face  it forbade themas one glaring exampleto know anything truly of the most beautiful of all natural objectsthe human form  they were tempted perpetually to take nature as ornament not as basis and they yielded at last to the temptation till in the age of perpendicular architecture their very ornament became unnatural again because conventional untrue meaningless  but the creed for which they worked was dying by that time and therefore the art which expressed it must needs die too  and even that death or rather the approach of it was symbolised truly in the flatter roof the fourcentred arch the flattopped tower of the fifteenthcentury church  the creed had ceased to aspire  so did the architecture  it had ceased to grow  so did the temple  and the arch sank lower and the rafters grew more horizontal and the likeness to the old tree content to grow no more took the place of the likeness to the young tree struggling toward the sky  and nowunless you are tired of listening to mea few practical words  we are restoring our old cathedral stone by stone after its ancient model  we are also trying to build a new church  we are building itas most new churches in england are now builtin a pure gothic style  are we doing right  i do not mean morally right  it is always morally right to build a new church if needed whatever be its architecture  it is always morally right to restore an old church if it be beautiful and noble as an heirloom handed down to us by our ancestors which we have no righti say no rightfor the sake of our children and of our childrens children to leave to ruin  but are we artistically aesthetically right  is the best gothic fit for our worship  does it express our belief  or shall we choose some other style  i say that it is and that it is so because it is a style which if not founded on nature has taken into itself more of nature of nature beautiful and healthy than any other style  with greater knowledge of nature both geographical and scientific fresh styles of architecture may and will arise as much more beautiful and as much more natural than the gothic as gothic is more beautiful and natural than the norman  till then we must take the best models which we have use them and as it were use them up and exhaust them  by that time we may have learnt to improve on them and to build churches more gothic than gothic itself more like grot and grove than even a northern cathedral  that is the direction in which we must work  and if any shall say to us as it has been said ere nowafter all your new gothic churches are but imitations shams borrowed symbols which to you symbolise nothing  they are romish churches meant to express romish doctrine built for a protestant creed which they do not express and for a protestant worship which they will not fit  then we shall answer not so  the objection might be true if we built norman or romanesque churches for we should then be returning to that very foreign and unnatural style which rome taught our forefathers and from which they escaped gradually into the comparative freedom the comparative naturalness of that true gothic of which mr ruskin says so well   it is gladdening to remember that in its utmost nobleness the very temper which has been thought most adverse to it the protestant temper of selfdependence and inquiry were expressed in every case faith and aspiration there were in every christian ecclesiastical building from the first century to the fifteenth  but the moral habits to which england in this age owes the kind of greatness which she hasthe habits of philosophical investigation of accurate thought of domestic seclusion and independence of stern self reliance and sincere upright searching into religious truthwere only traceable in the features which were the distinctive creations of the gothic schools in the varied foliage and thorny fretwork and shadowy niche and buttressed pier and fearless height of subtle pinnacle and crested tower sent like an unperplexed question up to heaven   so says mr ruskin  i for one endorse his gallant words  and i think that a strong proof of their truth is to be found in two facts which seem at first paradoxical  first that the new roman catholic churches on the continenti speak especially of france which is the most highlycultivated romanist countryare like those which the jesuits built in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries less and less gothic  the former were shamclassic the latter are rather of a new fantastic romanesque or rather byzantinesque style which is a real retrogression from gothic towards earlier and less natural schools  next that the puritan communions the kirk of scotland and the english nonconformists as they are becoming more cultivatedand there are now many highlycultivated men among themare introducing gothic architecture more and more into their churches  there are elements in it it seems which do not contradict their puritanism elements which they can adapt to their own worship namely the very elements which mr ruskin has discerned  but if they can do so how much more can we of the church of england as long as we go on where our medieval forefathers left off as long as we keep to the most perfect types of their work in waiting for the day when we shall be able to surpass them by making our work even more naturalistic than theirs more truly expressive of the highest aspirations of humanity so long we are reverencing them and that latent protestantism in them which produced at last the reformation  and if any should say  nevertheless your protestant gothic church though you made it ten times more beautiful and more symbolic than cologne minster itself would still be a sham  for where would be your images  and still more where would be your host  do you not know that in the medieval church the vistas of its arcades the alternation of its lights and shadows the gradations of its colouring and all its carefully subordinated wealth of art pointed to were concentrated round one sacred spot as a curve however vast its sweep through space tends at every moment toward a single focus  and that spot that focus was and is still in every romish church the body of god present upon the altar in the form of bread without him what is all your building  your church is empty your altar bare a throne without a king an eyesocket without an eye  my friends if we be true children of those old worthies whom tacitus saw worshipping beneath the german oaks we shall have but one answer to that scoff  we know it and we glory in the fact  we glory in it as the old jews gloried in it when the roman soldiers bursting through the temple and into the holy of holies itself paused in wonder and in awe when they beheld neither god nor image of god butblank yet allsuggestivethe empty mercyseat  like theirs our altar is an empty throne for it symbolises our worship of him who dwelleth not in temples made with hands whom the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain  our eyesocket holds no eye  for it symbolises our worship of that eye which is over all the earth which is about our path and about our bed and spies out all our ways  we need no artificial and material presence of deity  for we believe in that one eternal and universal real presenceof which it is written he is not far from anyone of us for in god we live and move and have our being and again  lo i am with you even to the end of the world and again  wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them  he is the god of nature as well as the god of grace  forever he looks down on all things which he has made and behold they are very good  and therefore we dare offer to him in our churches the most perfect works of naturalistic art and shape them into copies of whatever beauty he has shown us in man or woman in cove or mountainpeak in tree or flower even in bird or butterfly  but himselfwho can see him  except the humble and the contrite heart to whom he reveals himself as a spirit to be worshipped in spirit and in truth and not in bread nor wood nor stone nor gold nor quintessential diamond  so we shall obey the sound instinct of our christian forefathers when they shaped their churches into forest aisles and decked them with the boughs of the woodland and the flowers of the field  but we shall obey too that sounder instinct of theirs which made them at last cast out of their own temples as misplaced and unnatural things the idols which they had inherited from rome  so we shall obey the sound instinct of our heathen forefathers when they worshipped the unknown god beneath the oaks of the primeval forests  but we shall obey too that sounder instinct of theirs which taught them this at least concerning godthat it was beneath his dignity to coop him within walls and that the grandest forms of nature as well as the deepest consciousness of their own souls revealed to them a mysterious being who was to be beheld by faith alone    hours with the mystics 299    few readers of this magazine probably know anything about mystics know even what the term means  but as it is plainly connected with the adjective mystical they probably suppose it to denote some sort of vague dreamy sentimental and therefore useless and undesirable personage  nor can we blame them if they do so for mysticism is a form of thought and feeling now all but extinct in england  there are probably not ten thorough mystics among all our millions the mystic philosophers are very little read by our scholars and read not for but in spite of their mysticism and our popular theology has so completely rid itself of any mystic elements that our divines look with utter disfavour upon it use the word always as a term of opprobrium and interpret the mystic expressions in our liturgy which mostly occur in the collectsaccording to the philosophy of locke really ignorant it would seem that they were written by platonist mystics  we do not blame them either save in as far as teachers of men are blameworthy for being ignorant of any form of thought which has ever had a living hold upon good and earnest men and may therefore take hold of them again  but the english are not now a mystic people any more than the old romans were their habit of mind their destiny in the world are like those of the romans altogether practical and who can be surprised if they do not think about what they are not called upon to think about  nevertheless it is quite a mistake to suppose that mysticism is by its own nature unpractical  the greatest and most prosperous races of antiquitythe egyptians babylonians hindoos greekshad the mystic element as strong and living in them as the germans have now and certainly we cannot call them unpractical peoples  they fell and came to ruinas the germans may dowhen their mysticism became unpractical  but their thought remained to be translated into practice by sounderhearted races than themselves  rome learnt from greece and did in some confused imperfect way that which greece only dreamed just as future nations may act hereafter nobly and usefully on the truths which germans discover only to put in a book and smoke over  for they are terribly practical people these mystics quiet students and devotees as they may seem  they go or seem to go down to the roots of things after a way of their own and lay foundations on whichbe they sound or unsoundthose who come after them cannot choose but build as we are building now  for our forefathers were mystics for generations they were mystics in the forests of germany and in the dales of norway they were mystics in the convents and the universities of the middle ages they were mystics all the deepest and noblest minds of them during the elizabethan era  even now the few mystic writers of this island are exercising more influence on thought than any other men for good or for evil coleridge and alexander knox have changed the minds and with them the acts of thousands and when they are accused of having originated unknowingly the whole tractarian movement those who have watched english thought carefully can only answer that on the confession of the elder tractarians themselves the allegation is true  but that they originated a dozen other movements beside in the most opposite directions and that freethinking emersonians will be as ready as romish perverts and good plain english churchmen to confess that the critical point of their life was determined by the writings of the fakeer of highgate  at this very time too the only real mystic of any genius who is writing and teaching is exercising more practical influence infusing more vigorous life into the minds of thousands of men and women than all the other teachers of england put together and has set rolling a ball which may in the next half century gather into an avalanche perhaps utterly different in form material and direction from all which he expects  so much for mystics being unpractical  if we look faithfully into the meaning of their name we shall see why for good or for evil they cannot be unpractical why they let them be the most self absorbed of recluses are the very men who sow the seeds of great schools great national and political movements even great religions  a mysticaccording to the greek etymologyshould signify one who is initiated into mysteries one whose eyes are opened to see things which other people cannot see  and the true mystic in all ages and countries has believed that this was the case with him  he believes that there is an invisible world as well as a visible oneso do most men  but the mystic believes also that this same invisible world is not merely a supernumerary one world more over and above the earth on which he lives and the stars over his head but that it is the cause of them and the ground of them that it was the cause of them at first and is the cause of them now even to the budding of every flower and the falling of every pebble to the ground and therefore that having been before this visible world it will be after it and endure just as real living and eternal though matter were annihilated tomorrow  but on this showing every christian nay every religious man is a mystic for he believes in an invisible world  the answer is found in the plain fact that good christians here in england do not think so themselves that they dislike and dread mysticism would not understand it if it were preached to them are more puzzled by those utterances of st john which mystics have always claimed as justifying their theories than by any part of their bibles  there is a positive and conscious difference between popular metaphysics and mysticism and it seems to lie in this  the invisible world in which englishmen in general believe is one which happens to be invisible now but which will not be so hereafter  when they speak of the other world they mean a place which their bodily eyes will see some day and could see now if they were allowed when they speak of spirits they mean ghosts who could and perhaps do make themselves visible to mens bodily eyes  we are not inquiring here whether they be right or wrong we are only specifying a common form of human thought  the mystic on the other hand believes that the invisible world is so by its very nature and must be so for ever  he lives therein now he holds and will live in it through eternity  but he will see it never with any bodily eyes not even with the eyes of any future glorified body  it is ipso facto not to be seen only to be believed in never for him will faith be changed for sight as the popular theologians say that it will for this invisible world is only to be spiritually discerned  this is the mystic idea pure and simple of course there are various grades of it as there are of the popular one for no man holds his own creed and nothing more and it is good for him in this piecemeal and shortsighted world that he should not  were he overtrue to his own idea he would become a fanatic perhaps a madman  and so the modern evangelical of the venn and newton school to whom mysticism is neology and nehushtan when he speaks of spiritual experiences uses the adjective in its purely mystic sense while bernard of cluny in his once famous hymn hic breve vivitur mingles the two conceptions of the unseen world in inextricable confusion  between these two extreme poles in fact we have every variety of thought and it is good for us that we should have them for no one man or school of men can grasp the whole truth and every intermediate modification supplies some link in the great cycle of facts which its neighbours have overlooked  in the minds who have held this belief that the unseen world is the only real and eternal one there has generally existed a belief more or less confused that the visible world is in some mysterious way a pattern or symbol of the invisible one that its physical laws are the analogues of the spiritual laws of the eternal world  a belief of which mr vaughan seems to think lightly though if it be untrue we can hardly see how that metaphoric illustration in which he indulges so freely and which he often uses in a masterly and graceful way can be anything but useless trifling  for what is a metaphor or a simile but a mere paralogismhaving nothing to do with the matter in hand and not to be allowed for a moment to influence the readers judgment unless there be some real and objective analogyhomology we should call itbetween the physical phenomenon from which the symbol is taken and the spiritual truth which it is meant to illustrate  what divineness what logical weight in our lords parables unless he was by them trying to show his hearers that the laws which they saw at work in the lilies of the field in the most common occupations of men were but lower manifestations of the laws by which are governed the inmost workings of the human spirit  what triflers on any other ground were socrates and plato what triflers too shakespeare and spenser  indeed we should say that it is the belief conscious or unconscious of the eternal correlation of the physical and spiritual worlds which alone constitutes the essence of a poet  of course this idea led and would necessarily lead to follies and fancies enough as long as the phenomena of nature were not carefully studied and her laws scientifically investigated and all the dreams of paracelsus or van helmont cardan or crollius baptista porta or behmen are but the natural and pardonable errors of minds which while they felt deeply the sanctity and mystery of nature had no baconian philosophy to tell them what nature actually was and what she actually said  but their idea lives still and will live as long as the belief in a one god lives  the physical and spiritual worlds cannot be separated by an impassable gulf  they must in some way or other reflect each other even in their minutest phenomena for so only can they both reflect that absolute primeval unity in whom they both live and move and have their being  mr vaughans object however has not been to work out in his book such problems as these had he done so he would have made his readers understand better what mysticism is he would have avoided several hasty epithets by the use of which he has we think deceived himself into the notion that he has settled a matter by calling it a hard name he would have explained perhaps to himself and to us many strange and seemingly contradictory facts in the annals of mysticism  but he would also not have written so readable a book  on the whole he has taken the right course though one wishes that he had carried it out more methodically  a few friends literate and comfortable men and righthearted christians withal meet together to talk over these same mystics and to read papers and extracts which will give a general notion of the subject from the earliest historic times  the gentlemen talk about and about a little too much they are a little too fond of illustrations of the popular pulpit style they are often apt to say each his say with very little care of what the previous speaker has uttered in fact these conversations are as conversations not good but as centres of thought they are excellent  there is not a page nor a paragraph in which there is not something well worth recollecting and often reflections very wise and weighty indeed which show that whether or not mr vaughan has thoroughly grasped the subject of mysticism he has grasped and made part of his own mind and heart many things far more practically important than mysticism or any other form of thought and no one ought to rise up from the perusal of his book without finding himself if not a better at least a more thoughtful man and perhaps a humble one also as he learns how many more struggles and doubts discoveries sorrows and joys the human race has passed through than are contained in his own private experience  the true value of the book is that though not exhaustive of the subject it is suggestive  it affords the best indeed the only general sketch of the subject which we have in england and gives therein boundless food for future thought and reading and the country parson or the thoughtful professional man who has no time to follow out the question for himself much less to hunt out and examine original documents may learn from these pages a thousand curious and interesting hints about men of like passions with himself and about old times the history of whichas of all times was not the history of their kings and queens but of the creeds and deeds of the masses who worked and failed and sorrowed and rejoiced again unknown to fame  whatsoever meanwhile their own conclusions may be on the subjectmatter of the book they will hardly fail to admire the extraordinary variety and fulness of mr vaughans reading and wonder when they hearunless we are wrongly informedthat he is quite a young man   how one small head could compass all he knew   he begins with the mysticism of the hindoo yogis  and to this as we shall hereafter show he hardly does justice but we wish now to point out in detail the extended range of subjects of each of which the book gives some general notion  from the hindoos he passes to philo and the neoplatonists from them to the pseudodionysius and the mysticism of the early eastern church  he then traces shrewdly enough the influence of the pseudoareopagite and the easterns on the bolder and more practical minds of the western latins and gives a sketch of bernard and his abbey of clairvaux which brings pleasantly enough before us the ways and works of a longdead world which was all but inconceivable to us till mr carlyle disinterred it in his picture of abbot sampson the hero of past and present  we are next introduced to the mystic schoolmenhugo and richard of st victor and then to a far more interesting class of men and one with which mr vaughan has more sympathy than with any of his characters perhaps because he knows more about them  his chapters on the german mysticism of the fourteenth century his imaginary yet fruitful chronicle of adolf of arnstein with its glimpses of meister eckart suso the nameless wild ruysbroek and tauler himself are admirable if merely as historic studies and should be and we doubt not will be read by many as practical commentaries on the theologia germanica and on the selection from taulers sermons now in course of publication  had all the book been written as these chapters are we should not have had a word of complaint to make save when we find the author passing over without a word of comment utterances which right or wrong contain the very keynote and central idea of the men whom he is holding up to admiration and as we think of mysticism itself  there is for instance a paragraph attributed to ruysbroek in p 275 vol i which whether true or falseand we believe it to be essentially trueis so inexpressibly important both in the subject which it treats and in the way in which it treats it that twenty pages of comment on it would not have been misdevoted  yet it is passed by without a word  going forward to the age of the reformation the book then gives us a spirited glimpse of john bokelson and the munster anabaptists of carlstadt and the zurichian prophets and then dwells at some length on the attempt of that day to combine physical and spiritual science in occult philosophy  we have enough to make us wish to hear more of cornelius agrippa paracelsus and behmen with their alchemy true magic doctrines of sympathies 309 signatures of things cabbala and gamahea and the rest of that now fallen inverted pyramid of pseudoscience  his estimate of behmen and his writings we may observe in passing is both sound and charitable and speaks as much for mr vaughans heart as for his head  then we have a little about the rosicrucians and the comte de gabalis and the theory of the rabbis from whom the rosicrucians borrowed so much all told in the same lively manner all utterly new to ninetynine readers out of a hundred all indicating we are bound to say a much more extensive reading than appears on the page itself  from these he passes to the mysticism of the counterreformation especially to the two great spanish mystics st theresa and st john of the cross  here again he is new and interesting but we must regret that he has not been as merciful to theresa as he has to poor little john  he then devotes some eighty pagesand very well employed they are in detailing the strange and sad story of madame guyon and the quietist movement at louis quatorzes court  much of this he has taken with all due acknowledgment from upham but he has told the story most pleasantly in his own way and these pages will give a better notion of fenelon and of the eagle for eagle read vulture of meaux old bossuet than they are likely to find elsewhere in the same compass  following chronological order as nearly as he can he next passes to george fox and the early quakers introducing a curiousand in our own case quite novellittle episode concerning the history of hai ebn yokhdan a medieval arabian romance which old barclay seems to have got hold of and pressed into the service of his sect taking it for literal truth  the twelfth book is devoted to swedenborg and a very valuable little sketch it is and one which goes far to clear up the moral character and the reputation for sanity also of that muchcalumniated philosopher whom the world knows only as a dreaming false prophet forgetting that even if he was that he was also a sound and severe scientific labourer to whom our modern physical science is most deeply indebted  this is a short sketch of the contents of a book which is a really valuable addition to english literature and which is as interesting as it is instructive  but mr vaughan must forgive us if we tell him frankly that he has not exhausted the subject that he has hardly defined mysticism at allat least has defined it by its outward results and that without classifying them and that he has not grasped the central idea of the subject  there were more things in these same mystics than are dreamt of in his philosophy and he has missed seeing them because he has put himself rather in the attitude of a judge than of an inquirer  he has not had respect and trust enough for the men and women of whom he writes and is too much inclined to laugh at them and treat them de haut en bas  he has trusted too much to his own great power of logical analysis and his equally great power of illustration and is therefore apt to mistake the being able to put a mans thoughts into words for him for the being really able to understand him  to understand any man we must have sympathy for him even affection  no intellectual acuteness no amount even of mere pity for his errors will enable us to see the man from within and put our own souls into the place of his soul  to do that one must feel and confess within oneself the seed of the same errors which one reproves in him one must have passed more or less through his temptations doubts hunger of heart and brain and one cannot help questioning as one reads mr vaughans book whether he has really done this in the case of those of whom he writes  he should have remembered too how little any young man can have experienced of the terrible sorrows which branded into the hearts of these old devotees the truths to which they clung more than to life while they too often warped their hearts into morbidity and caused alike their folly and their wisdom  gently indeed should we speak even of the dreams of some selfimagined bride of christ when we picture to ourselves the bitter agonies which must have been endured ere a human soul could develop so fantastically diseased a growth  she was only a hysterical nun well and what more tragical object to those who will look patiently and lovingly at human nature than a hysterical nun  she may have been driven into a convent by some disappointment in love  and has not disappointed affection been confessed in all climes and ages to enshroud its victim ever after in a sanctuary of reverent pity  if sorrow broke her brains as well as broke her heart shall we do aught but love her the more for her capacity of love  or she may have entered the convent as thousands did in girlish simplicity to escape from a world she had not tried before she had discovered that the world could give her something which the convent could not  what more tragical than her discovery in herself of a capacity for love which could never be satisfied within that prison  and when that capacity began to vindicate itself in strange forms of disease seemingly to her supernatural often agonising often degrading and at the same time strange contradiction mixed itself up with her noblest thoughts to ennoble them still more and inspire her not only with a desire of physical selftorture which would seem holy both in her own eyes and her priests but with a love for all that is fair and lofty for selfdevotion and selfsacrificeshall we blame hershall we even smile at her if after the dreadful question  is this the possession of a demon had alternated with is this the inspiration of a god she settled down as the only escape from madness and suicide into the latter thought and believed that she found in the ideal and perfect manhood of one whom she was told to revere and love as a god and who had sacrificed his own life for her a substitute for that merely human affection from which she was for ever debarred  why blame her for not numbering that which was wanting or making straight that which was crooked  let god judge her not we  and the fit critics of her conduct are not the easy gentlemanlike scholars like mr vaughans athertons and gowers discussing the aberrations of fanaticism over wine and walnuts or the gay girl kate hardly even the happy mother mrs atherton but those whose hairs are gray with sorrow who have been softened at once and hardened in the fire of god who have cried out of the bottomless deep like david while lover and friend were hid away from them and laid amid the corpses of their dead hopes dead health dead joy as on a ghastly battlefield stript among the dead like those who are wounded and cut away from gods hands who have struggled drowning in the horrible mire of doubt and have felt all gods billows and waves sweep over them till they were weary of crying and their sight failed for waiting so long upon god and all the faith and prayer which was left was thou wilt not leave my soul in hell nor suffer thy holy one to see corruption  be it understood however for fear of any mistake that we hold mr vaughan to be simply and altogether right in his main idea  his one test for all these people and all which they said or did iswere they made practically better men and women thereby  he sees clearly that the spiritual is none other than the moralthat which has to do with right and wrong and he has a righteous contempt for everything and anything however graceful and reverent and artistic and devout and celestial and supercelestial except in as far as he finds it making better men and women do better work at everyday life  but even on this ground we must protest against such a sketch as this even of one of the least honourable of the middleage saints   atherton  angela de foligni who made herself miserablei must say something the converse of flourishedabout the beginning of the fourteenth century was a fine model pupil of this sort a genuine daughter of st francis  her mother her husband her children dead she is alone and sorrowful  she betakes herself to violent devotion falls illsuffers incessant anguish from a complication of disordershas rapturous consolations and terrific temptationsis dashed in a moment from a seat of glory above the empyrean      very amusing is it not  to have ones mother husband children diethe most commonplace sort of thingswhat over ones wine and walnuts one describes as being alone and sorrowful  men who having tasted the blessings conveyed in those few words have also found the horror conveyed in them have no epithets for the state of mind in which such a fate would leave them  they simply pray that if that hour came they might just have faith enough left not to curse god and die  amusing too her falling ill and suffering under a complication of disorders especially if those disorders were the fruit of combined grief and widowhood  amusing also her betaking herself to violent devotion  in the first place if devotion be a good thing could she have too much of it  if it be the way to make people good as is commonly held by all christian sects could she become too good  the more important question which springs out of the fact we will ask presently  she has rapturous consolations and terrific temptations  did the consolations come first and were the temptations a revulsion from spiritual exaltation into spiritual collapse and melancholy or did the temptations come first and the consolations come after to save her from madness and despair either may be the case perhaps both were  but somewhat more of care should have been taken in expressing so important a spiritual sequence as either case exhibits  it is twelve years and more since we studied the history of the b angela de foligni and many another kindred saint and we cannot recollect what were the terrific temptations what was the floor of hell which the poor thing saw yawning beneath her feet  but we must ask mr vaughan has he ever read boccaccio or any of the italian novelists up to the seventeenth century  and if so can he not understand how angela de foligni the lovely italian widow of the fourteenth century had her terrific temptations to which if she had yielded she might have fallen to the lowest pit of hell let that word mean what it may and temptations all the more terrific because she saw every widow round her considering them no temptations at all but yielding to them going out to invite them in the most businesslike nay dutylike way  what if she had rapturous consolations  what if she did pour out to one who was worthy not of less but of more affection than she offered in her passionate southern heart in language which in our colder northerns would be mere hypocrisy yet which she had been taught to believe lawful by that interpretation of the canticles which be it always remembered is common to evangelicals and to romanists  what if even in reward for her righteous belief that what she saw all widows round her doing was abominable and to be avoided at all risks she were permitted to enjoy a passionate affection which after all was not misplaced  there are mysteries in religion as in all things where it is better not to intrude behind the veil  wisdom is justified of all her children  and folly may be justified of some of her children also  equally unfair it seems to us is the notice of st brigittain our eyes a beautiful and noble figure  a widow she tooand what worlds of sorrow are there in that word especially when applied to the pure deephearted northern woman as she wasshe leaves her scandinavian pineforests to worship and to give wherever she can till she arrives at rome the centre of the universe the seat of christs vicegerent the city of god the gate of paradise  thousands of weary miles she travels through danger and sorrowand when she finds it behold it is a lie and a sham not the gate of paradise but the gate of sodom and of hell  was not that enough to madden her if mad she became  what matter after that her angel dictated discourses on the blessed virgin bombastic invocations to the saviours eyes ears hairthey were at least the best objects of worship which the age gave her  in one thing she was right and kept her first love  what was not quite so bad she gives to the world a series of revelations in which the vices of popes and prelates are lashed unsparingly and threatened with speedy judgment  not quite so bad  to us the whole phenomenon wears an utterly different aspect  at the risk of her life at the risk of being burned alive did anyone ever consider what that meansthe noble norsewoman like an alruna maid of old hurls out her divine hereditary hatred of sin and filth and lies  at last she falls back on christ himself as the only home for a homeless soul in such an evil time  and she is not burnt alive  the hand of one mightier than she is over her and she is safe under the shadow of his wings till her weary work is done and she goes home her righteousness accepted for his sake  her folly hysterics dreamscall them by what base name we will forgiven and forgotten for the sake of her many sorrows and her faithfulness to the end  but whatever fault we can find with these sketches we can find none with mr vaughans reflections on them   what a condemning comment on the pretended tender mercies of the church are those narratives which rome delights to parade of the sufferings mental and bodily which her devotees were instructed to inflict upon themselves  i am reminded of the thirsting mule which has in some countries to strike with his hoof among the spines of the cactus and drink with lamed foot and bleeding lips the few drops of milk which ooze from the broken thorns  affectionate suffering natures came to rome for comfort but her scanty kindness is only to be drawn with anguish from the cruel sharpness of asceticism  the worldly the audacious escape easily but these pliant excitable temperaments so anxiously in earnest may be made useful  the more dangerous frightful or unnatural their performances the more profit for their keepers  men and women are trained by torturing processes to deny their nature and then they are exhibited to bring grist to the milllike birds and beasts forced to postures and services against the laws of their beinglike those who must perform perilous feats on ropes or with lions nightly hazarding their lives to fill the pockets of a manager  the self devotedness of which rome boasts so much is a selfdevotion she has always thus made the most of for herself  calculating men who have thought only of the interest of the priesthood have known well how best to stimulate and to display the spasmodic movements of a brainsick disinterestedness  i have not the shadow of a doubt that once and again some priest might have been seen with cold gray eye endeavouring to do a stroke of diplomacy by means of the enthusiastic catherine making the fancied ambassadress of heaven in reality the tool of a schemer  such unquestionable virtues as these visionaries may some of them have possessed cannot be fairly set down to the credit of the church which has used them all for mercenary or ambitious purposes and infected them everywhere with a morbid character  some of these mystics floating down the great ecclesiastical current of the middle age appear to me like the trees carried away by the inundation of some mighty tropical river  they drift along the stream passive lifeless broken yet they are covered with gay verdure the aquatic plants hang and twine about the sodden timber and the draggled leaves the trunk is a sailing garden of flowers  but the adornment is that of natureit is the decoration of another and a strange element  the roots are in the air the boughs which should be full of birds are in the flood covered by its alien products swimming side by side with the alligator  so has this priestcraft swept its victims from their natural place and independent growth to clothe them in their helplessness with a false spiritual adornment neither scriptural nor human but ecclesiasticalthe native product of that overwhelming superstition which has subverted and enslaved their nature  the church of rome takes care that while simple souls think they are cultivating christian graces they shall be forging their own chains that their attempts to honour god shall always dishonour because they disenfranchise themselves  to be humble to be obedient to be charitable under such direction is to be contentedly ignorant pitiably abject and notoriously swindled   mr vaughan cannot be too severe upon the romish priesthood  but it is one thing to dismiss with summary contempt men who as they do keep the keys of knowledge and neither enter in themselves nor suffer others to enter and quite another thing to apply the same summary jurisdiction to men who under whatsoever confusions are feeling earnestly and honestly after truth  and therefore we regret exceedingly the mock trial which he has introduced into his introduction  we regret it for his own sake for it will drive away from the bookindeed it has driventhoughtful and reverent people who having a strong though vague inclination toward the mystics might be very profitably taught by the after pages to separate the evil from the good in the bernards and guyons whom they admire they scarce know why and will shock too scholars to whom hindoo and persian thoughts on these subjects are matters not of ridicule but of solemn and earnest investigation  besides the question is not so easily settled  putting aside the flippancy of the passage it involves something very like a petitio principii to ask offhand  does the man mean a living union of heart to christ a spiritual fellowship or converse with the father when he talks of the union of the believer with godparticipation in the divine nature  for first what we want to know is the meaning of the wordswhat means living what union what heart  they are terms common to the mystic and to the popular religionist only differently interpreted and in the meanings attributed to them lies nothing less than the whole worldold dispute between nominalist and realist not yet to be settled in two lines by two gentlemen over their wine much less ignored as a thing settled beyond all dispute already  if by living union of heart withmr vaughan meant identity of morals withhe should have said so  but he should have borne in mind that all the great evangelicals have meant much more than this by those words that on the whole instead of consideringas he seems to do and we dothe moral and the spiritual as identical they have put them in antithesis to each other and looked down upon mere morality just because it did not seem to them to involve that supernatural transcendental mystic element which they considered that they found in scripture  from luther to owen and baxter from them to wesley cecil and venn newton bridges the great evangelical authorities would not very clearly or consistently for they were but poor metaphysicians but honestly and earnestly have accepted some modified form of the mystics theory even to the discerning in particular thoughts frames impulses and inward witnessings immediate communications from heaven  surely mr vaughan must be aware that the majority of vital christians on this ground are among his mystic offenders and that those who deny such possibilities are but too liable to be stigmatised as pelagians and rationalists  his friend atherton is bound to show cause why those names are not to be applied to him as he is bound to show what he means by living union with christ and why he complains of the mystic for desiring participation in the divine nature  if he does so he only desires what the new testament formally and word for word promises him whatsoever be the meaning of the term he is not to be blamed for using it  mr vaughan cannot have forgotten the many expressions both of st paul and st john which do at first sight go far to justify the mystic though they are but seldom heard and more seldom boldly commented on in modern pulpitsof christ being formed in men dwelling in men of god dwelling in man and man in god of christ being the life of men of men living and moving and having their being in god and many another passage  if these be mere metaphors let the fact be stated with due reason for it  but there is no sin or shame in interpreting them in that literal and realist sense in which they seem at first sight to have been written  the first duty of a scholar who sets before himself to investigate the phenomena of mysticism so called should be to answer these questions  can there be a direct communication above and beyond sense or consciousness between the human spirit and god the spirit  and if so what are its conditions where its limits to transcend which is to fall into mysticism  and it is just this which mr vaughan fails in doing  in his sketch for instance of the mysticism of india he gives us a very clear and save in two points sound summary of that round of notions occurring to minds of similar make under similar circumstances which is common to mystics in ancient india and in modern christendom   summarily i would say this hindoo mysticism  1  lays claim to disinterested love as opposed to a mercenary religion  2  reacts against the ceremonial prescription and pedantic literalism of the vedas  3  identifies in its pantheism subject and object worshipper and worshipped  4  aims at ultimate absorption in the infinite  5  inculcates as the way to this dissolution absolute passivity withdrawal into the inmost self cessation of all the powers  giving recipes for procuring this beatific torpor or trance  6  believes that eternity may thus be realised in time  7  has its mythical miraculous pretensions ie its theurgic department  8  and finally advises the learner in this kind of religion to submit himself implicitly to a spiritual guidehis guru   against the two latter articles we except  the theurgic department of mysticismunfortunately but too commonseems to us always to have been as it certainly was in neoplatonism the despairing return to that ceremonialism which it had begun by shaking off when it was disappointed in reaching its high aim by its proper method the use of the guru or father confessor which mr vaughan confesses to be inconsistent with mysticism is to be explained in the same wayhe is a last refuge after disappointment  but as for the first six counts  is the hindoo mystic a worse or a better man for holding them  are they on the whole right or wrong is not disinterested love nobler than a mercenary religion  is it not right to protest against ceremonial prescriptions and to say with the later prophets and psalmists of the jews  thinkest thou that he will eat bulls flesh and drink the blood of goats sacrifice and burntoffering thou wouldst not    i come to do thy will o god  what is even if he will look calmly into it the pantheistic identification of subject and object worshipper and worshipped but the clumsy yet honest effort of the human mind to say to itself  doing gods will is the real end and aim of man the yogi looks round upon his fellowmen and sees that all their misery and shame come from selfwill he looks within and finds that all which makes him miserable angry lustful greedy after this and that comes from the same selfwill  and he asks himself  how shall i escape from this torment of selfhow shall i tame my wayward will till it shall become one with the harmonious beautiful and absolute will which made all things  at least i will try to do it whatever it shall cost me  i will give up all for which men live wife and child the sights scents sounds of this fair earth all things whatever they be which men call enjoyment i will make this life one long torture if need be but this rebel will of mine i will conquer  i ask for no reward  that may come in some future life but what care i  i am now miserable by reason of the lusts which war in my members the peace which i shall gain in being freed from them will be its own reward  after all i give up little  all those things round methe primeval forest and the sacred stream of ganga the mighty himalaya mount of god ay the illimitable vault of heaven above me sun and starswhat are they but such stuff as dreams are made of  brahm thought and they became something and somewhere  he may think again and they will become nothing and nowhere  are these eternal greater than i worth troubling my mind about  nothing is eternal but the thought which made them and will unmake them  they are only venerable in my eyes because each of them is a thought of brahms  and i too have thought i alone of all the kinds of living things  am i not then akin to god what better for me than to sit down and think as brahm thinks and so enjoy my eternal heritage leaving for those who cannot think the passions and pleasures which they share in common with the beasts of the field so i shall become more and more like brahmwill his will think his thoughts till i lose utterly this housefiend of self and become one with god  is this a man to be despised  is he a sickly dreamer or a too valiant hero and if any one be shocked at this last utterance let him consider carefully the words which he may hear on sunday  then we dwell in christ and christ in us we are one with christ and christ with us  that belief is surely not a false one  shall we abhor the yogi because he has seen sitting alone there amid idolatry and licentiousness despotism and priestcraft that the ideal goal of man is what we confess it to be in the communion service  shall we not rather wonder and rejoice over the magnificent utterance in that bhagavatgita which mr vaughan takes for the textbook of hindoo mysticism where krishna the teacher human and yet god himself speaks thus   there is nothing greater than i all things hang on me as precious gems upon a string     i am life in all things and zeal in the zealous  i am the eternal seed of nature  i am the understanding of the wise the glory of the proud the strength of the strong free from lust and anger     those who trust in me know brahm the supreme and incorruptible     in this body i am the teacher of worship  he who thinks of me will find me  he who finds me returns not again to mortal birth     i am the sacrifice i am the worship i am the incense i am the fire i am the victim i am the father and mother of the world i am the road of the good the comforter the creator the witness the asylum and the friend they who serve other gods with a firm belief involuntarily worship me  i am the same to all mankind  they who serve me in adoration are in me  if one whose ways are ever so evil serve me alone he becometh of a virtuous spirit and obtaineth eternal happiness  even women and the tribes of visya and soodra shall go the supreme journey if they take sanctuary with me how much more my holy servants the brahmins and the ragarshees  consider this world as a finite and joyless place and serve me   there may be confused words scattered up and down here there are still more confused wordsnot immoral onesround them which we have omitted but we ask once and for all is this true or is it not  is there a being who answers to this description or is there not  and if there be was it not a light price to pay for the discovery of him to sit upon the sacred grass called koos with his mind fixed on one object alone keeping his head neck and body steady without motion his eyes fixed upon the point of his nose looking at no other place aroundor any other simple even childish practical means of getting rid of the disturbing bustle and noise of the outward timeworld that he might see the eternal world which underlies it  what if the discovery be imperfect the figure in many features erroneous  is not the wonder to us the honour to him that the figure should be there at all  inexplicable to us on any ground save that one common to the bhagavatgita to the gospel he who seeks me shall find me  what if he knew but in part and saw through a glass darkly  was there not an inspired apostle who could but say the very same thing of himself and look forward to a future life in which he would know even as he was known  it is well worth observing too that so far from the moral of this bhagavatgita issuing in mere contemplative quietism its purpose is essentially practical  it arises out of arjouns doubt whether he shall join in the battle which he sees raging below him it results in his being commanded to join in it and fight like a man  we cannot see as mr vaughan does an unholy indifference in the moral  arjoun shrinks from fighting because friends and relatives are engaged on both sides and he dreads hell if he kills one of them  the answer to his doubt is after all the only one which makes war permissible to a christian who looks on all men as his brothers  you are a ksahtree a soldier your duty is to fight  do your duty and leave the consequences of it to him who commanded the duty  you cannot kill these mens souls any more than they can yours  you can only kill their mortal bodies the fate of their souls and yours depends on their moral state  kill their bodies then if it be your duty instead of tormenting yourself with scruples which are not really scruples of conscience only selfish fears of harm to yourself and leave their souls to the care of him who made them and knows them and cares more for them than you do  this seems to be the plain outcome of the teaching  what is it mutatis mutandis but the sermon coldblooded or not which every righteous soldier has to preach to himself day by day as long as his duty commands him to kill his human brothers  yet the fact is undeniable that hindoo mysticism has failed of practical resultthat it has died down into brutal fakeerism  we look in vain however in mr vaughans chapter for an explanation of this fact save his assertion which we deny that hindoo mysticism was in essence and at its root wrong and rotten  mr maurice moral and metaphysical philosophy p 46 seems to point to a more charitable solution  the hindoo he says whatsoever vast discovery he may have made at an early period of a mysterious teacher near him working on his spirit who is at the same time lord over nature began the search from himselfhe had no other point from whence to beginand therefore it ended in himself  the purification of his individual soul became practically his highest conceivable end to carry out that he must separate from society  yet the more he tries to escape self the more he finds self for what are his thoughts about brahm his thoughts about krishna save his own thoughts  is brahm a projection of his own soul  to sink in him does it mean to be nothing  am i after all my own law  and hence the downward career into stupid indifferentism even into antinomian profligacy  the hebrew on the other hand begins from the belief of an objective external god but one who cares for more than his individual soul as one who is the everpresent guide and teacher and ruler of his whole nation who regards that nation as a whole a one person and that not merely one present generation but all past or future as a one israellawgivers prophets priests warriors  all classes are his ministers  he is essentially a political deity who cares infinitely for the polity of a nation and therefore bestows one upon thema law of jehovah  gradually under this teaching the hebrew rises to the very idea of an inward teacher which the yogi had and to a far purer and clearer form of that idea but he is not tempted by it to selfish individualism or contemplative isolation as long as he is true to the old mosaic belief that this being is the political deity the king of kings  the pharisee becomes a selfish individualist just because he has forgotten this the essene a selfish mystic for the same reason philo and the jewish mystics of alexandria lose in like manner all notion that jehovah is the lawgiver and ruler and archetype of family and of national life christianity retained the idea it brought out the meaning of the old jewish polity in its highest form for that very reason it was able to bring out the meaning of the mystic idea in its highest form also without injury to mens work as members of families as citizens as practical men of the world and so to conquer at last that manichaean hatred of marriage and parentage which from the first to the sixteenth century shed its upas shade over the church  and here let us say boldly to mr vaughan and to our readers  as long as the salvation of a mans own soul is set forth in all pulpits as the first and last end and aim of mortal existence as long as christianity is dwelt on merely as influencing individuals each apartas brands plucked one here and another there from the general burningso long will mysticism in its highest form be the refuge of the strongest spirits and in its more base and diseased forms the refuge of the weak and sentimental spirits  they will say each in his own way  you confess that there can be a direct relation communion inspiration from god to my soul as i sit alone in my chamber  you do not think that there is such between god and what you call the world between him and nations as wholesfamilies churches schools of thought as wholes that he does not take a special interest or exercise a special influence over the ways and works of menover science commerce civilisation colonisation all which affects the earthly destinies of the race  all these you call secular to admit his influence over them for their own sake though of course he overrules them for the sake of his elect savours of pantheism  is it so  then we will give up the world  we will cling to the one fact which you confess to be certain about usthat we can take refuge in god each in the loneliness of his chamber from all the vain turmoil of a race which is hastening heedless into endless misery  you may call us mystics or what you will  we will possess our souls in patience and turn away our eyes from vanity  we will commune with our own hearts in solitude and be still  we will not even mingle in your religious world the world which you have invented for yourselves after denying that gods human world is sacred for it seems to us as full of intrigue ambition party spirit falsehood bitterness and ignorance as the political world or the fashionable world or the scientific world and we will have none of it  leave us alone with god  this has been the true reason of mystical isolation in every age and country  so thought macarius and the christian fakeers of the thebaid  so thought the medieval monks and nuns  so thought the german quietists when they revolted from the fierce degradation of decaying lutheranism  so are hundreds thinking now so may thousands think ere long  if the individualising phase of christianity which is now dominant shall long retain its ascendancy and the creed of dr cumming and mr spurgeon become that of the british people our purest and noblest spirits will act here with regard to religion as the purest and noblest in america have acted with regard to politics they will withdraw each into the sanctuary of his own heart and leave the battlefield to rival demagogues  they will do wrong it may be  isolation involves laziness pride cowardice but if sober england during the next halfcentury should be astonished by an outburst of mysticism as grand in some respects as fantastic in others as that of the thirteenth or the seventeenth centuries the blame if blame there be will lie with those leaders of the public conscience who after having debased alike the church of england and the dissenting sects with a selfish individualism which was as foreign to the old cromwellite ironside as to the high church divine have tried to debar their disciples from that peaceful and graceful mysticism which is the only excusable or tolerable form of religion beginning and ending in self  let it be always borne in mind that quakerism was not a protest against or a revulsion from the church of england but from calvinism  the steeplehouses against which george fox testified were not served by henry mores cudworths or norrises  not even by dogmatist highchurchmen but by calvinist ministers who had ejected them  george fox developed his own scheme such as it was because the popular protestantism of his day failed to meet the deepest wants of his heart because as he used to say it gave him a dead christ and he required a living christ  doctrines about who christ is he held are not christ himself  doctrines about what he has done for man are not he himself  fox held that if christ be a living person he must act when he acted directly on the most inward and central personality of him george fox and his desire was satisfied by the discovery of the indwelling logos or rather by its rediscovery after it had fallen into oblivion for centuries whether he were right or wrong he is a fresh instance of a mans arriving alone and unassisted at the same idea at which mystics of all ages and countries have arrived  a fresh corroboration of our belief that there must be some reality corresponding to a notion which has manifested itself so variously and among so many thousands of every creed and has yet arrived by whatsoever different paths at one and the same result  that he was more or less rightthat there is nothing in the essence of mysticism contrary to practical morality mr vaughan himself fully confesses  in his fair and liberal chapters on fox and the early quakers he does full justice to their intense practical benevolence to the important fact that fox only lived to do good of any and every kind as often as a sorrow to be soothed or an evil to be remedied crossed his path  we only wish that he had also brought in the curious and affecting account of foxs interview with cromwell in which he tells us and we will take foxs word against any man that the protector gave him to understand almost with tears that there was that in foxs faith which he was seeking in vain from the ministers around him  all we ask of mr vaughan is not to be afraid of his own evident liking for fox of his own evident liking for tauler and his school not to put aside the question which their doctrines involve with such halfutterances as   the quakers are wrong i think in separating particular movements and monitions as divine  but at the same time the witness of the spirit as regards our state before god is something more i believe than the mere attestation to the written word   as for the former of these two sentences he may be quite right for aught we know  but it must be said on the other hand that not merely quakers but decent men of every creed and age havewe may dare to say in proportion to their devoutnessbelieved in such monitions and that it is hard to see how any man could have arrived at the belief that a living person was working on him and not a mere impersonal principle law or afflatusspirit of the universe or other metaphor for hiding materialismunless by believing rightly or wrongly in such monitions  for our only inductive conception of a living person demands that that person shall make himself felt by separate acts  but against the second sentence we must protest  the question in hand is not whether this witness of the spirit is something more than anything else but whether it exists at all and what it is why was the book written save to help toward the solution of this very matter  the question all through has been  can an immediate influence be exercised by the spirit of god on the spirit of man mr vaughan assents and says we cannot see why that there is no mysticism in such a belief  be that as it may what that influence is and how exercised is all through the de quo agitur of mysticism mr vaughan however seems here for awhile to be talking realism through an admirable page well worth perusal pp 264 265  yet his grasp is not sure  we soon find him saying what more and fox would alike deny that the story of christs life and death is our souls food  no christ himself iswould the catholic church and the mystic alike answer  and here again the whole matter in dispute is unconsciously to mr vaughan opened up in one word  and if this sentence does not bear directly on that problem on what does it bear  it was therefore with extreme disappointment that on reading this and saying to ourselves  now we shall hear at last what mr vaughan himself thinks on the matter we found that he literally turned the subject off as if not worth investigation by making the next speaker answer apropos of nothing that the traditional ascetism of the friends is their fatal defect as a body  why too has mr vaughan devoted a few lines only to the great english platonists more norris smith of jesus gale and cudworth he says indeed that they are scarcely mystics except in as far as platonism is always in a measure mystical  in our sense of the word they were all of them mystics and of a very lofty type but surely henry more is a mystic in mr vaughans sense also  if the author of conjectura cabbalistica be not a mystical writer he himself uses the term without shame who is  we hope to see much in this book condensed much modified much worked out instead of being left fragmentary and embryotic but whether our hope be fulfilled or not a useful and honourable future is before the man who could write such a book as this is in spite of all defects    since the above was written mr vaughans premature death has robbed us of a man who might have done brave work by lessening through his own learning the intellectual gulf which now exists between english churchmen and dissenters  dis aliter visum  but mr vaughans death does not i think render it necessary for me to alter any of the opinions expressed here and least of all that in the last sentence fulfilled now more perfectly than i could have foreseen    frederick denison maurice 337 in memoriam    on friday the fifth of april a noteworthy assemblage gathered round an open vault in a corner of highgate cemetery  some hundreds of persons closely packed up the steep banks among the trees and shrubs had found in that grave a common bond of brotherhood  i say in that grave  they were no sect clique or school of disciples held together by community of opinions  they were simply men and women held together for the moment at least by love of a man and that man as they had believed a man of god  all shades of opinion almost of creed were represented there though the majority were members of the church of englandmany probably reconciled to that church by him who lay below  all sorts and conditions of men and indeed of women were there for he had had a word for all sorts and conditions of men  most of them had never seen each other before would never see each other again  but each felt that the man however unknown to him who stood next him was indeed a brother in loyalty to that beautiful soul beautiful face beautiful smile beautiful voice from which in public or in secret each had received noble impulses tender consolation loving correction and clearer and juster conceptions of god of duty of the meaning of themselves and of the universe  and when they turned and left his body there the worldas one said who served him gallantly and long seemed darker now he had left it but he had stayed here long enough to do the work for which he was fitted  he had wasted no time but died like a valiant man at his work and of his work  he might have been buried in westminster abbey  there was no lack of men of mark who held that such a public recognition of his worth was due not only to the man himself but to the honour of the church of england  his life had been one of rare sanctity he was a philosopher of learning and acuteness unsurpassed by any man of his generation he had done more than any man of that generation to defend the churchs doctrines to recommend her to highlycultivated men and women to bring within her pale those who had been born outside it or had wandered from it to reconcile the revolutionary party among the workmen of the great cities with christianity order law to make all ranks understand that if christianity meant anything it meant that a man should not merely strive to save his own soul after death but that he should live here the life of a true citizen virtuous earnest helpful to his human brethren  he had been the originator of or at least the chief mover in workingmens colleges schemes for the higher education of women for the protection of the weak and the oppressed  he had been the champion the organiser the helper with his own money and time of that co operative movementthe very germ of the economy of the futurewhich seems now destined to spread and with right good results to far other classes and in far other forms than those of which mr maurice was thinking fiveandtwenty years ago  his whole life had been one of unceasing labour for that which he believed to be truth and right and for the practical amelioration of his fellow creatures  he had not an enemy unless it were here and there a bigot or a dishonest mantwo classes who could not abide him because they knew well that he could not abide them  but for the rest those from whom he had differed most with whom he had engaged ere now in the sharpest controversy had learned to admire his sanctity charity courtesyfor he was the most perfect of gentlemenas well as to respect his genius and learning  he had been welcomed to cambridge by all the finer spirits of the university as professor of moral philosophy and as such and as the parish priest of st edwards he had done his workas far as failing health allowedas none but he could do it  nothing save his own tooscrupulous sense of honour had prevented him from accepting some higher ecclesiastical prefermentwhich he would have used alas not for literary leisure nor for the physical rest which he absolutely required but merely as an excuse for greater and more arduous toil  if such a man was not the man whom the church of england would delight to honour who was the man  but he was gone and a grave among englands worthies was all that could be offered him now and it was offered  but those whose will on such a point was law judged it to be more in keeping with the exquisite modesty and humility of frederick denison maurice that he should be laid out of sight though not out of mind by the side of his father and his mother  well  be it so  at least that green nook at highgate will be a sacred spot to hundredsit may be to thousandswho owe him more than they will care to tell to any created being  it was after all in thisin his personal influencethat mr maurice was greatest  true he was a great and rare thinker  those who wish to satisfy themselves of this should measure the capaciousness of his intellect by studyingnot by merely reading his boyle lectures on the religions of the world and that kingdom of christ the ablest apology for the catholic faith which england has seen for more than two hundred years  the ablest and perhaps practically the most successful for it has made the catholic faith look living rational practical and practicable to hundreds who could rest neither in modified puritanism nor modified romanism and still less in scepticism however earnest  the fact that it is written from a realist point of view as all mr maurices books are will make it obscure to many readers  nominalism is just now so utterly in the ascendant that most persons seem to have lost the power of thinking as well as of talking by any other method  but when the tide of thought shall turn this and the rest of mr maurices works will become not only precious but luminous to a generation which will have recollected that substance does not mean matter that a person is not the net result of his circumstances and that the real is not the visible actual but the invisible ideal  if anyone again would test mr maurices faculty as an interpreter of scripture let him study the two volumes on the gospel and the epistles of st john and study too the two volumes on the old testament which have been as a fact the means of delivering more than one or two from both the rationalist and the mythicist theories of interpretation  i mention these only as peculiar examples of mr maurices power  to those who have read nothing of his i would say take up what book you will you will be sure to find in it something new to you something noble something which if you can act on it will make you a better man  and if anyone on making the trial should say  but i do not understand the book  it is to me a new world then it must be answered  if you wish to read only books which you can understand at first sight confine yourself to periodical literature  as for finding yourself in a new world is it not good sometimes to do thatto discover how vast the universe of mind as well as of matter is that it contains many worlds and that wise and beautiful souls may and do live in more worlds than your own  much has been said of the obscurity of mr maurices style  it is a question whether any great thinker will be anything but obscure at times simply because he is possessed by conceptions beyond his powers of expression  but the conceptions may be clear enough and it may be worth the wise mans while to search for them under the imperfect words  only thusto take an illustrious instancehas st paul often the most obscure of writers become luminous to students and there are those who will hold that st paul is by no means understood yet and that the calvinistic system which has been built upon his epistles has been built up upon a total ignoring of the greater part of them and a total misunderstanding of the remainder  yet for all that no christian man will lightly shut up st paul as too obscure for use  really when one considers what worthless verbiage which men have ere now and do still take infinite pains to make themselves fancy that they understand one is tempted to impatience when men confess that they will not take the trouble of trying to understand mr maurice  yet after all i know no work which gives a fairer measure of mr maurices intellect both political and exegetic and a fairer measure likewise of the plain downright common sense which he brought to bear on each of so many subjects than his commentary on the very book which is supposed to have least connection with common sense and on which common sense has as yet been seldom employed namely the apocalypse of st john  that his method of interpretation is the right one can hardly be doubted by those who perceive that it is the one and only method on which any fair exegesis is possiblenamely to ask  what must these words have meant to those to whom they were actually spoken  that mr maurice is more reverent by being more accurate more spiritual by being more practical in his interpretation than commentators on this book have usually been will be seen the more the book is studied and found to be what any and every commentary on the revelation ought to bea mine of political wisdom  sayings will be found which will escape the grasp of most readers as indeed they do mine so pregnant are they and swift revealing like the lightningflash at night a whole vision  but only for a moments space  the reader may find also details of interpretation which are open to doubt if so he will remember that no man would have shrunk with more horror than mr maurice from the assumption of infallibility  meanwhile that the authors manly confidence in the reasonableness of his method will be justified hereafter i must hope if the book of revelation is to remain as god grant it may the political textbook of the christian church  on one matter however mr maurice is never obscureon questions of right and wrong  as with st paul his theology however seemingly abstruse always results in some lesson of plain practical morality to do the right and eschew the wrong and that not from hope of reward or fear of punishmentin which case the right ceases to be rightbut because a man loves the right and hates the wrong about this there is no hesitation or evasion in mr maurices writings  if any man is in search of a mere philosophy like the neoplatonists of old or of a mere system of dogmas by assenting to which he will gain a right to look down on the unorthodox while he is absolved from the duty of becoming a better man than he is and as good a man as he can bethen let him beware of mr maurices books lest while searching merely for thoughts that breathe he should stumble upon words that burn and were meant to burn  his books like himself are full of that greek that capacity of indignation which plato says is the root of all virtues  there was something it has been well said so awful and yet so christlike in its awful sternness in the expression which came over that beautiful face when he heard of anything base or cruel or wicked that it brought home to the bystander our lords judgment of sin  and here perhaps lay the secret of the extraordinary personal influence which he exercised namely in that truly formidable element which underlaid a character which as one said of him combined all that was noblest in man and woman all the tenderness and all the strength all the sensitiveness and all the fire of both and with that a humility which made men feel the utter baseness meanness of all pretension  for can there be true love without wholesome fear  and does not the old elizabethan my dear dread express the noblest voluntary relation in which two human souls can stand to each other  perfect love casteth out fear  yes but where is love perfect among imperfect beings save a mothers for her child  for all the rest it is through fear that love is made perfect fear which bridles and guides the lover with aweeven though misplacedof the beloved ones perfections with dreadnever misplacedof the beloved ones contempt  and therefore it is that souls who have the germ of nobleness within are drawn to souls more noble than themselves just because needing guidance they cling to one before whom they dare not say or do or even think an ignoble thing  and if these higher souls areas they usually arenot merely formidable but tender likewise and true then the influence which they may gain is unbounded for goodor alas for evilboth to themselves and to those that worship them  woe to the man who finding that god has given him influence over human beings for their good begins to use it after awhile first only to carry out through them his own little system of the universe and found a school or sect and at last by steady and necessary degradation mainly to feed his own vanity and his own animal sense of power  but mr maurice above all men whom i have ever met conquered both these temptations  for first he had no system of the universe  to have founded a sect or even a school would be he once said a sure sign that he was wrong and was leading others wrong  he was a catholic and a theologian and he wished all men to be such likewise to be so he held they must know god in christ  if they knew god then with them as with himself they would have the key which would unlock all knowledge ecclesiastical eschatological religious as it is commonly called historic political social  nay even so he hoped that knowledge of god would prove at last to be the key to the right understanding of that physical science of which he unfortunately for the world knew but too little but which he accepted with a loyal trust in god and in fact as the voice of god which won him respect and love from men of science to whom his theology was a foreign world  if he could make men know god and therefore if he could make men know that god was teaching them that no man could see a thing unless god first showed it to himthen all would go well and they might follow the logos with old socrates whithersoever he led  therefore he tried not so much to alter mens convictions as like socrates to make them respect their own convictions to be true to their own deepest instincts true to the very words which they used so carelessly ignorant alike of their meaning and their wealth  he wished all men all churches all nations to be true to the light which they had already to whatsoever was godlike and therefore godgiven in their own thoughts and so to rise from their partial apprehensions their scattered gleams of light toward that full knowledge and light which was containedso he said even with his dying lipsin the orthodox catholic faith  this was the ideal of the man and his work and it left him neither courage nor time to found a school or promulgate a system  god had his own system  a system vaster than augustines vaster than dantes vaster than all the thoughts of all thinkers orthodox and heterodox put together for god was his own system and by him all things consisted and in him they lived and moved and had their being and he was here living and working and we were living and working in him and had instead of building systems of our own to find out his eternal laws for men for nations for churches for only in obedience to them is life  yes a man who held this could found no system  other foundation he used to say can no man lay save that which is laid even jesus christ  and as he said it his voice and eye told those who heard him that it was to him the most potent the most inevitable the most terrible and yet the most hopeful of all facts  as for temptations to vanity and love of powerhe may have had to fight with them in the heyday of youth and genius and perhaps ambition  but the stories of his childhood are stories of the same generosity courtesy unselfishness which graced his later years at least if he had been tempted he had conquered  in more than fiveandtwenty years i have known no being so utterly unselfish so utterly humble so utterly careless of power or influence for the mere enjoymentand a terrible enjoyment it isof using them staunch to his own opinion only when it seemed to involve some moral principle he was almost too ready to yield it in all practical matters to anyone whom he supposed to possess more practical knowledge than he  to distrust himself to accuse himself to confess his proneness to hard judgments while to the eye of those who knew him and the facts he was exercising a splendid charity and magnanimity to hold himself up as a warning of wasted time while he was but too literally working himself to deaththis was the childlike temper which made some lower spirits now and then glad to escape from their consciousness of his superiority by patronising and pitying him causing in himfor he was as all such great men are like to be instinct with genial humoura certain quiet goodnatured amusement but nothing more  but it was that very humility that very selfdistrust combined so strangely with manful strength and sternness which drew to him humble souls selfdistrustful souls who like him were full of the divine discontent who livedas perhaps all men should liveangry with themselves ashamed of themselves and more and more angry and ashamed as their own ideal grew and with it their consciousness of defection from that ideal  to him as to david in the wilderness gathered those who were spiritually discontented and spiritually in debt and he was a captain over them because like david he talked to them not of his own genius or his own doctrines but of the living god who had helped their forefathers and would help them likewise  how great his influence was what an amount of teaching consolation reproof instruction in righteousness that man found time to pour into heart after heart with a fit word for man and for woman how wide his sympathies how deep his understanding of the human heart how many sorrows he has lightened how many wandering feet set right will never be known till the day when the secrets of all hearts are disclosed  his forthcoming biography if as is hoped it contains a selection from his vast correspondence will tell something of all this  but how little  the most valuable of his letters will be those which were meant for no eye but the recipients and which no recipient would give to the worldhardly to an ideal church and what he has done will have to be estimated by wise men hereafter when as in the case of most great geniuses a hundred indirect influences subtle various often seemingly contradictory will be found to have had their origin in frederick maurice  and thus i end what little i have dared to say  there is much behind even more worth saying which must not be said  perhaps some far wiser men than i will think that i have said too much already and be inclined to answer me as elisha of old answered the over meddling sons of the prophets  knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today  yea i know it  hold ye your peace    footnotes  0  the edition of literary and general essays that this

method of arrangement is quite unworthy of the rest as the action would be split into the opposite corners of the picture and the post of honour in the centre occupied by a figure of secondary

this very error by labelling the picture with a description of its subject  directly under the central figure is written sergius paulus proconsul embraces the christian faith at the preaching of paul
