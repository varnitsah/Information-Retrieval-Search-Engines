10068095	the deerslayer  by james fenimore cooper     chapter i       there is a pleasure in the pathless woods     there is a rapture on the lonely shore     there is society where none intrudes     by the deep sea and music in its roar     i love not man the less but nature more     from these our interviews in which i steal     from all i may be or have been before     to mingle with the universe and feel     what i can neer express yet cannot all conceal      childe harold  on the human imagination events produce the effects of time thus he who has travelled far and seen much is apt to fancy that he has lived long and the history that most abounds in important incidents soonest assumes the aspect of antiquity in no other way can we account for the venerable air that is already gathering around american annals when the mind reverts to the earliest days of colonial history the period seems remote and obscure the thousand changes that thicken along the links of recollections throwing back the origin of the nation to a day so distant as seemingly to reach the mists of time and yet four lives of ordinary duration would suffice to transmit from mouth to mouth in the form of tradition all that civilized man has achieved within the limits of the republic although new york alone possesses a population materially exceeding that of either of the four smallest kingdoms of europe or materially exceeding that of the entire swiss confederation it is little more than two centuries since the dutch commenced their settlement rescuing the region from the savage state thus what seems venerable by an accumulation of changes is reduced to familiarity when we come seriously to consider it solely in connection with time  this glance into the perspective of the past will prepare the reader to look at the pictures we are about to sketch with less surprise than he might otherwise feel and a few additional explanations may carry him back in imagination to the precise condition of society that we desire to delineate it is matter of history that the settlements on the eastern shores of the hudson such as claverack kinderhook and even poughkeepsie were not regarded as safe from indian incursions a century since and there is still standing on the banks of the same river and within musketshot of the wharves of albany a residence of a younger branch of the van rensselaers that has loopholes constructed for defence against the same crafty enemy although it dates from a period scarcely so distant other similar memorials of the infancy of the country are to be found scattered through what is now deemed the very centre of american civilization affording the plainest proofs that all we possess of security from invasion and hostile violence is the growth of but little more than the time that is frequently fulfilled by a single human life  the incidents of this tale occurred between the years 1740 and 1745 when the settled portions of the colony of new york were confined to the four atlantic counties a narrow belt of country on each side of the hudson extending from its mouth to the falls near its head and to a few advanced neighborhoods on the mohawk and the schoharie broad belts of the virgin wilderness not only reached the shores of the first river but they even crossed it stretching away into new england and affording forest covers to the noiseless moccasin of the native warrior as he trod the secret and bloody warpath a birdseye view of the whole region east of the mississippi must then have offered one vast expanse of woods relieved by a comparatively narrow fringe of cultivation along the sea dotted by the glittering surfaces of lakes and intersected by the waving lines of river in such a vast picture of solemn solitude the district of country we design to paint sinks into insignificance though we feel encouraged to proceed by the conviction that with slight and immaterial distinctions he who succeeds in giving an accurate idea of any portion of this wild region must necessarily convey a tolerably correct notion of the whole  whatever may be the changes produced by man the eternal round of the seasons is unbroken summer and winter seedtime and harvest return in their stated order with a sublime precision affording to man one of the noblest of all the occasions he enjoys of proving the high powers of his farreaching mind in compassing the laws that control their exact uniformity and in calculating their neverending revolutions  centuries of summer suns had warmed the tops of the same noble oaks and pines sending their heats even to the tenacious roots when voices were heard calling to each other in the depths of a forest of which the leafy surface lay bathed in the brilliant light of a cloudless day in june while the trunks of the trees rose in gloomy grandeur in the shades beneath the calls were in different tones evidently proceeding from two men who had lost their way and were searching in different directions for their path at length a shout proclaimed success and presently a man of gigantic mould broke out of the tangled labyrinth of a small swamp emerging into an opening that appeared to have been formed partly by the ravages of the wind and partly by those of fire this little area which afforded a good view of the sky although it was pretty well filled with dead trees lay on the side of one of the high hills or low mountains into which nearly the whole surface of the adjacent country was broken  here is room to breathe in exclaimed the liberated forester as soon as he found himself under a clear sky shaking his huge frame like a mastiff that has just escaped from a snowbank hurrah deerslayer here is daylight at last and yonder is the lake  these words were scarcely uttered when the second forester dashed aside the bushes of the swamp and appeared in the area after making a hurried adjustment of his arms and disordered dress he joined his companion who had already begun his disposition for a halt  do you know this spot demanded the one called deerslayer or do you shout at the sight of the sun  both lad both i know the spot and am not sorry to see so useful a frind as the sun now we have got the pints of the compass in our minds once more and t will be our own faults if we let anything turn them topsyturvy agin as has just happened my name is not hurry harry if this be not the very spot where the landhunters camped the last summer and passed a week see i yonder are the dead bushes of their bower and here is the spring much as i like the sun boy ive no occasion for it to tell me it is noon this stomach of mine is as good a timepiece as is to be found in the colony and it already pints to halfpast twelve so open the wallet and let us wind up for another six hours run  at this suggestion both set themselves about making the preparations necessary for their usual frugal but hearty meal we will profit by this pause in the discourse to give the reader some idea of the appearance of the men each of whom is destined to enact no insignificant part in our legend  it would not have been easy to find a more noble specimen of vigorous manhood than was offered in the person of him who called himself hurry harry his real name was henry march but the frontiersmen having caught the practice of giving sobriquets from the indians the appellation of hurry was far oftener applied to him than his proper designation and not unfrequently he was termed hurry skurry a nickname he had obtained from a dashing reckless offhand manner and a physical restlessness that kept him so constantly on the move as to cause him to be known along the whole line of scattered habitations that lay between the province and the canadas the stature of hurry harry exceeded six feet four and being unusually well proportioned his strength fully realized the idea created by his gigantic frame the face did no discredit to the rest of the man for it was both goodhumored and handsome his air was free and though his manner necessarily partook of the rudeness of a border life the grandeur that pervaded so noble a physique prevented it from becoming altogether vulgar  deerslayer as hurry called his companion was a very different person in appearance as well as in character in stature he stood about six feet in his moccasins but his frame was comparatively light and slender showing muscles however that promised unusual agility if not unusual strength his face would have had little to recommend it except youth were it not for an expression that seldom failed to win upon those who had leisure to examine it and to yield to the feeling of confidence it created this expression was simply that of guileless truth sustained by an earnestness of purpose and a sincerity of feeling that rendered it remarkable at times this air of integrity seemed to be so simple as to awaken the suspicion of a want of the usual means to discriminate between artifice and truth but few came in serious contact with the man without losing this distrust in respect for his opinions and motives  both these frontiersmen were still young hurry having reached the age of six or eight and twenty while deerslayer was several years his junior their attire needs no particular description though it may be well to add that it was composed in no small degree of dressed deerskins and had the usual signs of belonging to those who pass their time between the skirts of civilized society and the boundless forests there was notwithstanding some attention to smartness and the picturesque in the arrangements of deerslayers dress more particularly in the part connected with his arms and accoutrements his rifle was in perfect condition the handle of his huntingknife was neatly carved his powderhorn was ornamented with suitable devices lightly cut into the material and his shotpouch was decorated with wampum  on the other hand hurry harry either from constitutional recklessness or from a secret consciousness how little his appearance required artificial aids wore everything in a careless slovenly manner as if he felt a noble scorn for the trifling accessories of dress and ornaments perhaps the peculiar effect of his fine form and great stature was increased rather than lessened by this unstudied and disdainful air of indifference  come deerslayer fall to and prove that you have a delaware stomach as you say you have had a delaware edication cried hurry setting the example by opening his mouth to receive a slice of cold venison steak that would have made an entire meal for a european peasant fall to lad and prove your manhood on this poor devil of a doe with your teeth as youve already done with your rifle  nay nay hurry theres little manhood in killing a doe and that too out of season though there might be some in bringing down a painter or a catamount returned the other disposing himself to comply the delawares have given me my name not so much on account of a bold heart as on account of a quick eye and an actyve foot there may not be any cowardyce in overcoming a deer but sartain it is theres no great valor  the delawares themselves are no heroes muttered hurry through his teeth the mouth being too full to permit it to be fairly opened or they would never have allowed them loping vagabonds the mingos to make them women  that matter is not rightly understoodhas never been rightly explained said deerslayer earnestly for he was as zealous a friend as his companion was dangerous as an enemy the mengwe fill the woods with their lies and misconstruct words and treaties i have now lived ten years with the delawares and know them to be as manful as any other nation when the proper time to strike comes  harkee master deerslayer since we are on the subject we may as well open our minds to each other in a mantoman way answer me one question you have had so much luck among the game as to have gotten a title it would seem but did you ever hit anything human or intelligible did you ever pull trigger on an inimy that was capable of pulling one upon you  this question produced a singular collision between mortification and correct feeling in the bosom of the youth that was easily to be traced in the workings of his ingenuous countenance the struggle was short however uprightness of heart soon getting the better of false pride and frontier boastfulness  to own the truth i never did answered deerslayer seeing that a fitting occasion never offered the delawares have been peaceable since my sojourn with em and i hold it to be onlawful to take the life of man except in open and generous warfare  what did you never find a fellow thieving among your traps and skins and do the law on him with your own hands by way of saving the magistrates trouble in the settlements and the rogue himself the cost of the suit  i am no trapper hurry returned the young man proudly i live by the rifle a wepon at which i will not turn my back on any man of my years atween the hudson and the st lawrence i never offer a skin that has not a hole in its head besides them which natur made to see with or to breathe through  ay ay this is all very well in the animal way though it makes but a poor figure alongside of scalps and ambushes shooting an indian from an ambush is acting up to his own principles and now we have what you call a lawful war on our hands the sooner you wipe that disgrace off your character the sounder will be your sleep if it only come from knowing there is one inimy the less prowling in the woods i shall not frequent your society long friend natty unless you look higher than fourfooted beasts to practice your rifle on  our journey is nearly ended you say master march and we can part tonight if you see occasion i have a frind waiting for me who will think it no disgrace to consort with a fellowcreatur that has never yet slain his kind  i wish i knew what has brought that skulking delaware into this part of the country so early in the season muttered hurry to himself in a way to show equally distrust and a recklessness of its betrayal where did you say the young chief was to give you the meeting  at a small round rock near the foot of the lake where they tell me the tribes are given to resorting to make their treaties and to bury their hatchets this rock have i often heard the delawares mention though lake and rock are equally strangers to me the country is claimed by both mingos and mohicans and is a sort of common territory to fish and hunt through in time of peace though what it may become in wartime the lord only knows  common territory exclaimed hurry laughing aloud i should like to know what floating tom hutter would say to that he claims the lake as his own property in vartue of fifteen years possession and will not be likely to give it up to either mingo or delaware without a battle for it  and what will the colony say to such a quarrelall this country must have some owner the gentry pushing their cravings into the wilderness even where they never dare to ventur in their own persons to look at the land they own  that may do in other quarters of the colony deerslayer but it will not do here not a human being the lord excepted owns a foot of sile in this part of the country pen was never put to paper consarning either hill or valley hereaway as ive heard old tom say time and agin and so he claims the best right to it of any man breathing and what tom claims hell be very likely to maintain  by what ive heard you say hurry this floating tom must be an oncommon mortal neither mingo delaware nor paleface his possession too has been long by your tell and altogether beyond frontier endurance whats the mans history and natur  why as to old toms human natur it is not much like other mens human natur but more like a muskrats human natar seeing that he takes more to the ways of that animal than to the ways of any other fellowcreatur some think he was a free liver on the salt water in his youth and a companion of a sartain kidd who was hanged for piracy long afore you and i were born or acquainted and that he came up into these regions thinking that the kings cruisers could never cross the mountains and that he might enjoy the plunder peaceably in the woods  then he was wrong hurry very wrong a man can enjoy plunder peaceably nowhere  thats much as his turn of mind may happen to be ive known them that never could enjoy it at all unless it was in the midst of a jollification and them again that enjoyed it best in a corner some men have no peace if they dont find plunder and some if they do human nature is crooked in these matters old tom seems to belong to neither set as he enjoys his if plunder he has really got with his darters in a very quiet and comfortable way and wishes for no more  ay he has darters too ive heard the delawares whove hunted this a way tell their histories of these young women is there no mother hurry  there was once as in reason but she has now been dead and sunk these two good years  anan said deerslayer looking up at his companion in a little surprise  dead and sunk i say and i hope thats good english the old fellow lowered his wife into the lake by way of seeing the last of her as i can testify being an eyewitness of the ceremony but whether tom did it to save digging which is no easy job among roots or out of a consait that water washes away sin sooner than arth is more than i can say  was the poor woman oncommon wicked that her husband should take so much pains with her body  not onreasonable though she had her faults i consider judith hutter to have been as graceful and about as likely to make a good ind as any woman who had lived so long beyond the sound of church bells and i conclude old tom sunk her as much by way of saving pains as by way of taking it there was a little steel in her temper its true and as old hutter is pretty much flint they struck out sparks onceandawhile but on the whole they might be said to live amicable like when they did kindle the listeners got some such insights into their past lives as one gets into the darker parts of the woods when a stray gleam of sunshine finds its way down to the roots of the trees but judith i shall always esteem as its recommend enough to one woman to be the mother of such a creatur as her darter judith hutter  ay judith was the name the delawares mentioned though it was pronounced after a fashion of their own from their discourse i do not think the girl would much please my fancy  thy fancy exclaimed march taking fire equally at the indifference and at the presumption of his companion what the devil have you to do with a fancy and that too consarning one like judith you are but a boya sapling that has scarce got root judith has had men among her suitors ever since she was fifteen which is now near five years and will not be apt even to cast a look upon a halfgrown creatur like you  it is june and there is not a cloud atween us and the sun hurry so all this heat is not wanted answered the other altogether undisturbed any one may have a fancy and a squirrel has a right to make up his mind touching a catamount  ay but it might not be wise always to let the catamount know it growled march but youre young and thoughtless and ill overlook your ignorance come deerslayer he added with a goodnatured laugh after pausing a moment to reflect come deerslayer we are sworn friends and will not quarrel about a lightminded jilting jade just because she happens to be handsome more especially as you have never seen her judith is only for a man whose teeth show the full marks and its foolish to be afeard of a boy what did the delawares say of the hussy for an indian after all has his notions of womankind as well as a white man  they said she was fair to look on and pleasant of speech but overgiven to admirers and lightminded  they are devils incarnate after all what schoolmaster is a match for an indian in looking into natur some people think they are only good on a trail or the warpath but i say that they are philosophers and understand a man as well as they understand a beaver and a woman as well as they understand either now thats judiths character to a ribbon to own the truth to you deerslayer i should have married the gal two years since if it had not been for two particular things one of which was this very lightmindedness  and what may have been the other demanded the hunter who continued to eat like one that took very little interest in the subject  tother was an insartainty about her having me the hussy is handsome and she knows it boy not a tree that is growing in these hills is straighter or waves in the wind with an easier bend nor did you ever see the doe that bounded with a more natral motion if that was all every tongue would sound her praises but she has such failings that i find it hard to overlook them and sometimes i swear ill never visit the lake again  which is the reason that you always come back nothing is ever made more sure by swearing about it  ah deerslayer you are a novelty in these particulars keeping as true to education as if you had never left the settlements with me the case is different and i never want to clinch an idee that i do not feel a wish to swear about it if you knowd all that i know consarning judith youd find a justification for a little cussing now the officers sometimes stray over to the lake from the forts on the mohawk to fish and hunt and then the creatur seems beside herself you can see in the manner which she wears her finery and the airs she gives herself with the gallants  that is unseemly in a poor mans darter returned deerslayer gravely the officers are all gentry and can only look on such as judith with evil intentions  theres the unsartainty and the damper i have my misgivings about a particular captain and jude has no one to blame but her own folly if im right on the whole i wish to look upon her as modest and becoming and yet the clouds that drive among these hills are not more unsartain not a dozen white men have ever laid eyes upon her since she was a child and yet her airs with two or three of these officers are extinguishers  i would think no more of such a woman but turn my mind altogether to the forest that will not deceive you being ordered and ruled by a hand that never wavers  if you knowd judith you would see how much easier it is to say this than it would be to do it could i bring my mind to be easy about the officers i would carry the gal off to the mohawk by force make her marry me in spite of her whiffling and leave old tom to the care of hetty his other child who if she be not as handsome or as quickwitted as her sister is much the most dutiful  is there another bird in the same nest asked deerslayer raising his eyes with a species of halfawakened curiosity the delawares spoke to me only of one  thats natral enough when judith hutter and hetty hutter are in question hetty is only comely while her sister i tell thee boy is such another as is not to be found atween this and the sea judith is as full of wit and talk and cunning as an old indian orator while poor hetty is at the best but compass meant us  anan inquired again the deerslayer  why what the officers call compass meant us which i understand to signify that she means always to go in the right direction but sometimes does not know how compassfor the pint and meant us for the intention no poor hetty is what i call on the verge of ignorance and sometimes she stumbles on one side of the line and sometimes on tother  them are beings that the lord has in his special care said deerslayer solemnly for he looks carefully to all who fall short of their proper share of reason the redskins honor and respect them who are so gifted knowing that the evil spirit delights more to dwell in an artful body than in one that has no cunning to work upon  ill answer for it then that he will not remain long with poor hetty for the child is just compass meant us as i have told you old tom has a feeling for the gal and so has judith quickwitted and glorious as she is herself else would i not answer for her being altogether safe among the sort of men that sometimes meet on the lake shore  i thought this water an unknown and littlefrequented sheet observed the deerslayer evidently uneasy at the idea of being too near the world  its all that lad the eyes of twenty white men never having been laid on it still twenty truebred frontiersmenhunters and trappers and scouts and the likecan do a deal of mischief if they try t would be an awful thing to me deerslayer did i find judith married after an absence of six months  have you the gals faith to encourage you to hope otherwise  not at all i know not how it is im goodlooking boythat much i can see in any spring on which the sun shinesand yet i could not get the hussy to a promise or even a cordial willing smile though she will laugh by the hour if she has dared to marry in my absence shed be like to know the pleasures of widowhood afore she is twenty  you would not harm the man she has chosen hurry simply because she found him more to her liking than yourself  why not if an enemy crosses my path will i not beat him out of it look at me am i a man like to let any sneaking crawling skintrader get the better of me in a matter that touches me as near as the kindness of judith hutter besides when we live beyond law we must be our own judges and executioners and if a man should be found dead in the woods who is there to say who slew him even admitting that the colony took the matter in hand and made a stir about it  if that man should be judith hutters husband after what has passed i might tell enough at least to put the colony on the trail  youhalfgrown venisonhunting bantling you dare to think of informing against hurry harry in so much as a matter touching a mink or a woodchuck  i would dare to speak truth hurry consarning you or any man that ever lived  march looked at his companion for a moment in silent amazement then seizing him by the throat with both hands he shook his comparatively slight frame with a violence that menaced the dislocation of some of the bones nor was this done jocularly for anger flashed from the giants eyes and there were certain signs that seemed to threaten much more earnestness than the occasion would appear to call for whatever might be the real intention of march and it is probable there was none settled in his mind it is certain that he was unusually aroused and most men who found themselves throttled by one of a mould so gigantic in such a mood and in a solitude so deep and helpless would have felt intimidated and tempted to yield even the right not so however with deerslayer his countenance remained unmoved his hand did not shake and his answer was given in a voice that did not resort to the artifice of louder tones even by way of proving its owners resolution  you may shake hurry until you bring down the mountain he said quietly but nothing beside truth will you shake from me it is probable that judith hutter has no husband to slay and you may never have a chance to waylay one else would i tell her of your threat in the first conversation i held with the gal  march released his grip and sat regarding the other in silent astonishment  i thought we had been friends he at length added but youve got the last secret of mine that will ever enter your ears  i want none if they are to be like this i know we live in the woods hurry and are thought to be beyond human lawsand perhaps we are so in fact whatever it may be in rightbut there is a law and a lawmaker that rule across the whole continent he that flies in the face of either need not call me a friend  damme deerslayer if i do not believe you are at heart a moravian and no fairminded plaindealing hunter as youve pretended to be  fairminded or not hurry you will find me as plaindealing in deeds as i am in words but this giving way to sudden anger is foolish and proves how little you have sojourned with the red man judith hutter no doubt is still single and you spoke but as the tongue ran and not as the heart felt theres my hand and we will say and think no more about it  hurry seemed more surprised than ever then he burst forth in a loud goodnatured laugh which brought tears to his eyes after this he accepted the offered hand and the parties became friends  t would have been foolish to quarrel about an idee march cried as he resumed his meal and more like lawyers in the towns than like sensible men in the woods they tell me deerslayer much illblood grows out of idees among the people in the lower counties and that they sometimes get to extremities upon them  that do theythat do they and about other matters that might better be left to take care of themselves i have heard the moravians say that there are lands in which men quarrel even consarning their religion and if they can get their tempers up on such a subject hurry the lord have marcy on em howsoever there is no occasion for our following their example and more especially about a husband that this judith hutter may never see or never wish to see for my part i feel more curosity about the feeblewitted sister than about your beauty theres something that comes close to a mans feelins when he meets with a fellowcreatur that has all the outward show of an accountable mortal and who fails of being what he seems only through a lack of reason this is bad enough in a man but when it comes to a woman and she a young and maybe a winning creatur it touches all the pitiful thoughts his natur has god knows hurry that such poor things be defenceless enough with all their wits about em but its a cruel fortun when that great protector and guide fails em  hark deerslayeryou know what the hunters and trappers and peltrymen in general be and their best friends will not deny that they are headstrong and given to having their own way without much bethinking em of other peoples rights or feelinsand yet i dont think the man is to be found in all this region who would harm hetty hutter if he could no not even a redskin  therein frind hurry you do the delawares at least and all their allied tribes only justice for a redskin looks upon a being thus struck by gods power as especially under his care i rejoice to hear what you say however i rejoice to hear it but as the sun is beginning to turn towards the afternoons sky had we not better strike the trail again and make forward that we may get an opportunity of seeing these wonderful sisters  harry march giving a cheerful assent the remnants of the meal were soon collected then the travelers shouldered their packs resumed their arms and quitting the little area of light they again plunged into the deep shadows of the forest    chapter ii      thourt passing from the lakes green side     and the hunters hearth away     for the time of flowers for the summers pride     daughter thou canst not stay      mrs  hemans edith  a tale of the woods ii  19194    our two adventurers had not far to go hurry knew the direction as soon as he had found the open spot and the spring and he now led on with the confident step of a man assured of his object the forest was dark as a matter of course but it was no longer obstructed by underbrush and the footing was firm and dry after proceeding near a mile march stopped and began to cast about him with an inquiring look examining the different objects with care and occasionally turning his eyes on the trunks of the fallen trees with which the ground was well sprinkled as is usually the case in an american wood especially in those parts of the country where timber has not yet become valuable  this must be the place deerslayer march at length observed here is a beech by the side of a hemlock with three pines at hand and yonder is a white birch with a broken top and yet i see no rock nor any of the branches bent down as i told you would be the case  broken branches are onskilful landmarks as the least experenced know that branches dont often break of themselves returned the other and they also lead to suspicion and discoveries the delawares never trust to broken branches unless it is in friendly times and on an open trail as for the beeches and pines and hemlocks why they are to be seen on all sides of us not only by twos and threes but by forties and fifties and hundreds  very true deerslayer but you never calculate on position here is a beech and a hemlock  yes and there is another beech and a hemlock as loving as two brothers or for that matter more loving than some brothers and yonder are others for neither tree is a rarity in these woods i fear me hurry you are better at trapping beaver and shooting bears than at leading on a blindish sort of a trail ha theres what you wish to find ater all  now deerslayer this is one of your delaware pretensions for hang me if i see anything but these trees which do seem to start up around us in a most onaccountable and perplexing manner  look thisaway hurryhere in a line with the black oakdont you see the crooked sapling that is hooked up in the branches of the basswood near it now that sapling was once snowridden and got the bend by its weight but it never straightened itself and fastened itself in among the basswood branches in the way you see the hand of man did that act of kindness for it  that hand was mine exclaimed hurry i found the slender young thing bent to the airth like an unfortunate creatur borne down by misfortune and stuck it up where you see it after all deerslayer i must allow youre getting to have an oncommon good eye for the woods  tis improving hurrytis improving i will acknowledge but tis only a childs eye compared to some i know theres tamenund now though a man so old that few remember when he was in his prime tamenund lets nothing escape his look which is more like the scent of a hound than the sight of an eye then uncas the father of chingachgook and the lawful chief of the mohicans is another that it is almost hopeless to pass unseen im improving i will allowim improving but far from being perfect as yet  and who is this chingachgook of whom you talk so much deerslayer asked hurry as he moved off in the direction of the righted sapling a loping redskin at the best i make no question  not so hurry but the best of loping redskins as you call em if he had his rights he would be a great chief but as it is he is only a brave and justminded delaware respected and even obeyed in some thingstis true but of a fallen race and belonging to a fallen people ah harry march twould warm the heart within you to sit in their lodges of a winters night and listen to the traditions of the ancient greatness and power of the mohicans  harkee frind nathaniel said hurry stopping short to face his companion in order that his words might carry greater weight with them if a man believed all that other people choose to say in their own favor he might get an oversized opinion of them and an undersized opinion of himself these redskins are notable boasters and i set down more than half of their traditions as pure talk  there is truth in what you say hurry ill not deny it for ive seen it and believe it they do boast but then that is a gift from natur and its sinful to withstand natral gifts see this is the spot you come to find this remark cut short the discourse and both the men now gave all their attention to the object immediately before them deerslayer pointed out to his companion the trunk of a huge linden or basswood as it is termed in the language of the country which had filled its time and fallen by its own weight this tree like so many millions of its brethren lay where it had fallen and was mouldering under the slow but certain influence of the seasons the decay however had attacked its centre even while it stood erect in the pride of vegetation bellowing out its heart as disease sometimes destroys the vitals of animal life even while a fair exterior is presented to the observer as the trunk lay stretched for near a hundred feet along the earth the quick eye of the hunter detected this peculiarity and from this and other circumstances he knew it to be the tree of which march was in search  ay here we have what we want cried hurry looking in at the larger end of the linden everything is as snug as if it had been left in an old womans cupboard come lend me a hand deerslayer and well be afloat in half an hour  at this call the hunter joined his companion and the two went to work deliberately and regularly like men accustomed to the sort of thing in which they were employed in the first place hurry removed some pieces of bark that lay before the large opening in the tree and which the other declared to be disposed in a way that would have been more likely to attract attention than to conceal the cover had any straggler passed that way the two then drew out a bark canoe containing its seats paddles and other appliances even to fishinglines and rods this vessel was by no means small but such was its comparative lightness and so gigantic was the strength of hurry that the latter shouldered it with seeming ease declining all assistance even in the act of raising it to the awkward position in which he was obliged to hold it  lead ahead deerslayer said march and open the bushes the rest i can do for myself  the other obeyed and the men left the spot deerslayer clearing the way for his companion and inclining to the right or to the left as the latter directed in about ten minutes they both broke suddenly into the brilliant light of the sun on a low gravelly point that was washed by water on quite half its outline  an exclamation of surprise broke from the lips of deerslayer an exclamation that was low and guardedly made however for his habits were much more thoughtful and regulated than those of the reckless hurry when on reaching the margin of the lake he beheld the view that unexpectedly met his gaze it was in truth sufficiently striking to merit a brief description on a level with the point lay a broad sheet of water so placid and limpid that it resembled a bed of the pure mountain atmosphere compressed into a setting of hills and woods its length was about three leagues while its breadth was irregular expanding to half a league or even more opposite to the point and contracting to less than half that distance more to the southward of course its margin was irregular being indented by bays and broken by many projecting low points at its northern or nearest end it was bounded by an isolated mountain lower land falling off east and west gracefully relieving the sweep of the outline still the character of the country was mountainous high hills or low mountains rising abruptly from the water on quite nine tenths of its circuit the exceptions indeed only served a little to vary the scene and even beyond the parts of the shore that were comparatively low the background was high though more distant  but the most striking peculiarities of this scene were its solemn solitude and sweet repose on all sides wherever the eye turned nothing met it but the mirrorlike surface of the lake the placid view of heaven and the dense setting of woods so rich and fleecy were the outlines of the forest that scarce an opening could be seen the whole visible earth from the rounded mountaintop to the waters edge presenting one unvaried hue of unbroken verdure as if vegetation were not satisfied with a triumph so complete the trees overhung the lake itself shooting out towards the light and there were miles along its eastern shore where a boat might have pulled beneath the branches of dark rembrandtlooking hemlocks quivering aspens and melancholy pines in a word the hand of man had never yet defaced or deformed any part of this native scene which lay bathed in the sunlight a glorious picture of affluent forest grandeur softened by the balminess of june and relieved by the beautiful variety afforded by the presence of so broad an expanse of water  this is grandtis solemntis an edication of itself to look upon exclaimed deerslayer as he stood leaning on his rifle and gazing to the right and left north and south above and beneath in whichever direction his eye could wander not a tree disturbed even by redskin hand as i can discover but everything left in the ordering of the lord to live and die according to his own designs and laws hurry your judith ought to be a moral and well disposed young woman if she has passed half the time you mention in the centre of a spot so favored  thats naked truth and yet the gal has the vagaries all her time has not been passed here howsoever old tom having the custom afore i knowd him of going to spend the winters in the neighborhood of the settlers or under the guns of the forts no no jude has caught more than is for her good from the settlers and especially from the gallantifying officers  if she hasif she has hurry this is a school to set her mind right agin but what is this i see off here abreast of us that seems too small for an island and too large for a boat though it stands in the midst of the water  why that is what these galantine gentry from the forts call muskrat castle and old tom himself will grin at the name though it bears so hard on his own natur and character tis the stationary house there being two this which never moves and the other that floats being sometimes in one part of the lake and sometimes in another the last goes by the name of the ark though what may be the meaning of the word is more than i can tell you  it must come from the missionaries hurry whom i have heard speak and read of such a thing they say that the arth was once covered with water and that noah with his children was saved from drowning by building a vessel called an ark in which he embarked in season some of the delawares believe this tradition and some deny it but it behooves you and me as white men born to put our faith in its truth do you see anything of this ark  tis down south no doubt or anchored in some of the bays but the canoe is ready and fifteen minutes will carry two such paddles as yourn and mine to the castle  at this suggestion deerslayer helped his companion to place the different articles in the canoe which was already afloat this was no sooner done than the two frontiermen embarked and by a vigorous push sent the light bark some eight or ten rods from the shore hurry now took the seat in the stern while deerslayer placed himself forward and by leisurely but steady strokes of the paddles the canoe glided across the placid sheet towards the extraordinarylooking structure that the former had styled muskrat castle several times the men ceased paddling and looked about them at the scene as new glimpses opened from behind points enabling them to see farther down the lake or to get broader views of the wooded mountains the only changes however were in the new forms of the hills the varying curvature of the bays and the wider reaches of the valley south the whole earth apparently being clothed in a galadress of leaves  this is a sight to warm the heart exclaimed deerslayer when they had thus stopped for the fourth or fifth time the lake seems made to let us get an insight into the noble forests and land and water alike stand in the beauty of gods providence do you say hurry that there is no man who calls himself lawful owner of all these glories  none but the king lad he may pretend to some right of that natur but he is so far away that his claim will never trouble old tom hutter who has got possession and is like to keep it as long as his life lasts tom is no squatter not being on land i call him a floater  i invy that man i know its wrong and i strive agin the feelin but i invy that man dont think hurry that im consorting any plan to put myself in his moccasins for such a thought doesnt harbor in my mind but i cant help a little invy tis a natral feelin and the best of us are but natral ater all and give way to such feelins at times  youve only to marry hetty to inherit half the estate cried hurry laughing the gal is comely nay if it wasnt for her sisters beauty she would be even handsome and then her wits are so small that you may easily convart her into one of your own way of thinking in all things do you take hetty off the old fellows hands and ill engage hell give you an interest in every deer you can knock over within five miles of his lake  does game abound suddenly demanded the other who paid but little attention to marchs raillery  it has the country to itself scarce a trigger is pulled on it and as for the trappers this is not a region they greatly frequent i ought not to be so much here myself but jude pulls one way while the beaver pulls another more than a hundred spanish dollars has that creatur cost me the last two seasons and yet i could not forego the wish to look upon her face once more  do the redmen often visit this lake hurry continued deerslayer pursuing his own train of thought  why they come and go sometimes in parties and sometimes singly the country seems to belong to no native tribe in particular and so it has fallen into the hands of the hutter tribe the old man tells me that some sharp ones have been wheedling the mohawks for an indian deed in order to get a title out of the colony but nothing has come of it seeing that no one heavy enough for such a trade has yet meddled with the matter the hunters have a good lifelease still of this wilderness  so much the better so much the better hurry if i was king of england the man that felled one of these trees without good occasion for the timber should be banished to a desarted and forlorn region in which no fourfooted animal ever trod right glad am i that chingachgook appinted our meeting on this lake for hitherto eye of mine never looked on such a glorious spectacle  thats because youve kept so much among the delawares in whose country there are no lakes now farther north and farther west these bits of water abound and youre young and may yet live to see em but though there be other lakes deerslayer theres no other judith hutter  at this remark his companion smiled and then he dropped his paddle into the water as if in consideration of a lovers haste both now pulled vigorously until they got within a hundred yards of the castle as hurry familiarly called the house of hutter when they again ceased paddling the admirer of judith restraining his impatience the more readily as he perceived that the building was untenanted at the moment this new pause was to enable deerslayer to survey the singular edifice which was of a construction so novel as to merit a particular description  muskrat castle as the house had been facetiously named by some waggish officer stood in the open lake at a distance of fully a quarter of a mile from the nearest shore on every other side the water extended much farther the precise position being distant about two miles from the northern end of the sheet and near if not quite a mile from its eastern shore as there was not the smallest appearance of any island but the house stood on piles with the water flowing beneath it and deerslayer had already discovered that the lake was of a great depth he was fain to ask an explanation of this singular circumstance hurry solved the difficulty by telling him that on this spot alone a long narrow shoal which extended for a few hundred yards in a north and south direction rose within six or eight feet of the surface of the lake and that hutter had driven piles into it and placed his habitation on them for the purpose of security  the old fellow was burnt out three times atween the indians and the hunters and in one affray with the redskins he lost his only son since which time he has taken to the water for safety no one can attack him here without coming in a boat and the plunder and scalps would scarce be worth the trouble of digging out canoes then its by no means sartain which would whip in such a scrimmage for old tom is well supplied with arms and ammunition and the castle as you may see is a tight breastwork agin light shot  deerslayer had some theoretical knowledge of frontier warfare though he had never yet been called on to raise his hand in anger against a fellowcreature he saw that hurry did not overrate the strength of this position in a military point of view since it would not be easy to attack it without exposing the assailants to the fire of the besieged a good deal of art had also been manifested in the disposition of the timber of which the building was constructed and which afforded a protection much greater than was usual to the ordinary logcabins of the frontier the sides and ends were composed of the trunks of large pines cut about nine feet long and placed upright instead of being laid horizontally as was the practice of the country these logs were squared on three sides and had large tenons on each end massive sills were secured on the heads of the piles with suitable grooves dug out of their upper surfaces which had been squared for the purpose and the lower tenons of the upright pieces were placed in these grooves giving them secure fastening below plates had been laid on the upper ends of the upright logs and were kept in their places by a similar contrivance the several corners of the structure being well fastened by scarfing and pinning the sills and plates the doors were made of smaller logs similarly squared and the roof was composed of light poles firmly united and well covered with bark  the effect of this ingenious arrangement was to give its owner a house that could be approached only by water the sides of which were composed of logs closely wedged together which were two feet thick in their thinnest parts and which could be separated only by a deliberate and laborious use of human hands or by the slow operation of time the outer surface of the building was rude and uneven the logs being of unequal sizes but the squared surfaces within gave both the sides and door as uniform an appearance as was desired either for use or show the chimney was not the least singular portion of the castle as hurry made his companion observe while he explained the process by which it had been made the material was a stiff clay properly worked which had been put together in a mould of sticks and suffered to harden a foot or two at a time commencing at the bottom when the entire chimney had thus been raised and had been properly bound in with outward props a brisk fire was kindled and kept going until it was burned to something like a brickred this had not been an easy operation nor had it succeeded entirely but by dint of filling the cracks with fresh clay a safe fireplace and chimney had been obtained in the end this part of the work stood on the logdoor secured beneath by an extra pile there were a few other peculiarities about this dwelling which will better appear in the course of the narrative  old tom is full of contrivances added hurry and he set his heart on the success of his chimney which threatened more than once to give out altogether but perseverance will even overcome smoke and now he has a comfortable cabin of it though it did promise at one time to be a chinky sort of a flue to carry flames and fire  you seem to know the whole history of the castle hurry chimney and sides said deerslayer smiling is love so overcoming that it causes a man to study the story of his sweethearts habitation  partly that lad and partly eyesight returned the goodnatured giant laughing there was a large gang of us in the lake the summer the old fellow built and we helped him along with the job i raised no small part of the weight of them uprights with my own shoulders and the axes flew i can inform you master natty while we were beeing it among the trees ashore the old devil is no way stingy about food and as we had often eat at his hearth we thought we would just house him comfortably afore we went to albany with our skins yes many is the meal ive swallowed in tom hutters cabins and hetty though so weak in the way of wits has a wonderful particular way about a fryingpan or a gridiron  while the parties were thus discoursing the canoe had been gradually drawing nearer to the castle and was now so close as to require but a single stroke of a paddle to reach the landing this was at a floored platform in front of the entrance that might have been some twenty feet square  old tom calls this sort of a wharf his dooryard observed hurry as he fastened the canoe after he and his companion had left it and the gallants from the forts have named it the castle court though what a court can have to do here is more than i can tell you seeing that there is no law tis as i supposed not a soul within but the whole family is off on a vyge of discovery  while hurry was bustling about the dooryard examining the fishingspears rods nets and other similar appliances of a frontier cabin deerslayer whose manner was altogether more rebuked and quiet entered the building with a curiosity that was not usually exhibited by one so long trained in indian habits the interior of the castle was as faultlessly neat as its exterior was novel the entire space some twenty feet by forty was subdivided into several small sleepingrooms the apartment into which he first entered serving equally for the ordinary uses of its inmates and for a kitchen the furniture was of the strange mixture that it is not uncommon to find in the remotely situated logtenements of the interior most of it was rude and to the last degree rustic but there was a clock with a handsome case of dark wood in a corner and two or three chairs with a table and bureau that had evidently come from some dwelling of more than usual pretension the clock was industriously ticking but its leadenlooking hands did no discredit to their dull aspect for they pointed to the hour of eleven though the sun plainly showed it was some time past the turn of the day there was also a dark massive chest the kitchen utensils were of the simplest kind and far from numerous but every article was in its place and showed the nicest care in its condition  after deerslayer had cast a look about him in the outer room he raised a wooden latch and entered a narrow passage that divided the inner end of the house into two equal parts frontier usages being no way scrupulous and his curiosity being strongly excited the young man now opened a door and found himself in a bedroom a single glance sufficed to show that the apartment belonged to females the bed was of the feathers of wild geese and filled nearly to overflowing but it lay in a rude bunk raised only a foot from the door on one side of it were arranged on pegs various dresses of a quality much superior to what one would expect to meet in such a place with ribbons and other similar articles to correspond pretty shoes with handsome silver buckles such as were then worn by females in easy circumstances were not wanting and no less than six fans of gay colors were placed half open in a way to catch the eye by their conceits and hues even the pillow on this side of the bed was covered with finer linen than its companion and it was ornamented with a small ruffle a cap coquettishly decorated with ribbons hung above it and a pair of long gloves such as were rarely used in those days by persons of the laboring classes were pinned ostentatiously to it as if with an intention to exhibit them there if they could not be shown on the owners arms  all this deerslayer saw and noted with a degree of minuteness that would have done credit to the habitual observation of his friends the delawares nor did he fail to perceive the distinction that existed between the appearances on the different sides of the bed the head of which stood against the wall on that opposite to the one just described everything was homely and uninviting except through its perfect neatness the few garments that were hanging from the pegs were of the coarsest materials and of the commonest forms while nothing seemed made for show of ribbons there was not one nor was there either cap or kerchief beyond those which hutters daughters might be fairly entitled to wear  it was now several years since deerslayer had been in a spot especially devoted to the uses of females of his own color and race the sight brought back to his mind a rush of childish recollections and he lingered in the room with a tenderness of feeling to which he had long been a stranger he bethought him of his mother whose homely vestments he remembered to have seen hanging on pegs like those which he felt must belong to hetty hutter and he bethought himself of a sister whose incipient and native taste for finery had exhibited itself somewhat in the manner of that of judith though necessarily in a less degree these little resemblances opened a long hidden vein of sensations and as he quitted the room it was with a saddened mien he looked no further but returned slowly and thoughtfully towards the dooryard  if old tom has taken to a new calling and has been trying his hand at the traps cried hurry who had been coolly examining the borderers implements if that is his humor and youre disposed to remain in these parts we can make an oncommon comfortable season of it for while the old man and i outknowledge the beaver you can fish and knock down the deer to keep body and soul together ive always give the poorest hunters half a share but one as actyve and sartain as yourself might expect a full one  thankee hurry thankee with all my heartbut i do a little beavering for myself as occasions offer tis true the delawares call me deerslayer but its not so much because im pretty fatal with the venison as because that while i kill so many bucks and does ive never yet taken the life of a fellowcreatur they say their traditions do not tell of another who had shed so much blood of animals that had not shed the blood of man  i hope they dont account you chickenhearted lad a fainthearted man is like a notailed beaver  i dont believe hurry that they account me as outoftheway timorsome even though they may not account me as outoftheway brave but im not quarrelsome and that goes a great way towards keeping blood off the hands among the hunters and redskins and then harry march it keeps blood off the conscience too  well for my part i account game a redskin and a frenchman as pretty much the same thing though im as onquarrelsome a man too as there is in all the colonies i despise a quarreller as i do a curdog but one has no need to be overscrupulsome when its the right time to show the flint  i look upon him as the most of a man who acts nearest the right hurry but this is a glorious spot and my eyes never aweary looking at it  tis your first acquaintance with a lake and these ideas come over us all at such times lakes have a gentle character as i say being pretty much water and land and points and bays  as this definition by no means met the feelings that were uppermost in the mind of the young hunter he made no immediate answer but stood gazing at the dark hills and the glassy water in silent enjoyment  have the governors or the kings people given this lake a name he suddenly asked as if struck with a new idea if theyve not begun to blaze their trees and set up their compasses and line off their maps its likely theyve not bethought them to disturb natur with a name  theyve not got to that yet and the last time i went in with skins one of the kings surveyors was questioning me consarning all the region hereabouts he had heard that there was a lake in this quarter and had got some general notions about it such as that there was water and hills but how much of either he knowd no more than you know of the mohawk tongue i didnt open the trap any wider than was necessary giving him but poor encouragement in the way of farms and clearings in short i left on his mind some such opinion of this country as a man gets of a spring of dirty water with a path to it that is so muddy that one mires afore he sets out he told me they hadnt got the spot down yet on their maps though i conclude that is a mistake for he showed me his parchment and there is a lake down on it where there is no lake in fact and which is about fifty miles from the place where it ought to be if they meant it for this i dont think my account will encourage him to mark down another by way of improvement  here hurry laughed heartily such tricks being particularly grateful to a set of men who dreaded the approaches of civilization as a curtailment of their own lawless empire the egregious errors that existed in the maps of the day all of which were made in europe were moreover a standing topic of ridicule among them for if they had not science enough to make any better themselves they had sufficient local information to detect the gross blunders contained in those that existed any one who will take the trouble to compare these unanswerable evidences of the topographical skill of our fathers a century since with the more accurate sketches of our own time will at once perceive that the men of the woods had a sufficient justification for all their criticism on this branch of the skill of the colonial governments which did not at all hesitate to place a river or a lake a degree or two out of the way even though they lay within a days march of the inhabited parts of the country  im glad it has no name resumed deerslayer or at least no paleface name for their christenings always foretell waste and destruction no doubt howsoever the redskins have their modes of knowing it and the hunters and trappers too they are likely to call the place by something reasonable and resembling  as for the tribes each has its tongue and its own way of calling things and they treat this part of the world just as they treat all others among ourselves weve got to calling the place the glimmerglass seeing that its whole basin is so often hinged with pines cast upward to its face as if it would throw back the hills that hang over it  there is an outlet i know for all lakes have outlets and the rock at which i am to meet chingachgook stands near an outlet has that no colonyname yet  in that particular theyve got the advantage of us having one end and that the biggest in their own keeping theyve given it a name which has found its way up to its source names natrally working up stream no doubt deerslayer youve seen the susquehannah down in the delaware country  that have i and hunted along its banks a hundred times  that and this are the same in fact and i suppose the same in sound i am glad theyve been compelled to keep the redmens name for it would be too hard to rob them of both land and name  deerslayer made no answer but he stood leaning on his rifle gazing at the view which so much delighted him the reader is not to suppose however that it was the picturesque alone which so strongly attracted his attention the spot was very lovely of a truth and it was then seen in one of its most favorable moments the surface of the lake being as smooth as glass and as limpid as pure air throwing back the mountains clothed in dark pines along the whole of its eastern boundary the points thrusting forward their trees even to nearly horizontal lines while the bays were seen glittering through an occasional arch beneath left by a vault fretted with branches and leaves it was the air of deep reposethe solitudes that spoke of scenes and forests untouched by the hands of manthe reign of nature in a word that gave so much pure delight to one of his habits and turn of mind still he felt though it was unconsciously like a poet also if he found a pleasure in studying this large and to him unusual opening into the mysteries and forms of the woods as one is gratified in getting broader views of any subject that has long occupied his thoughts he was not insensible to the innate loveliness of such a landscape neither but felt a portion of that soothing of the spirit which is a common attendant of a scene so thoroughly pervaded by the holy cairn of nature    chapter iii      come shall we go and kill us venison     and yet it irks me the poor dappled foals     being native burghers of this desert city     should in their own confines with forked heads     have their round haunches gored      as you like it iii2125  hurry harry thought more of the beauties of judith hutter than of those of the glimmerglass and its accompanying scenery as soon as he had taken a sufficiently intimate survey of floating toms implements therefore he summoned his companion to the canoe that they might go down the lake in quest of the family previously to embarking however hurry carefully examined the whole of the northern end of the water with an indifferent ships glass that formed a part of hutters effects in this scrutiny no part of the shore was overlooked the bays and points in particular being subjected to a closer inquiry than the rest of the wooded boundary  tis as i thought said hurry laying aside the glass the old fellow is drifting about the south end this fine weather and has left the castle to defend itself well now we know that he is not up thisaway twill be but a small matter to paddle down and hunt him up in his hidingplace  does master hutter think it necessary to burrow on this lake inquired deerslayer as he followed his companion into the canoe to my eye it is such a solitude as one might open his whole soul in and fear no one to disarrange his thoughts or his worship  you forget your friends the mingos and all the french savages is there a spot on arth deerslayer to which them disquiet rogues dont go where is the lake or even the deer lick that the blackguards dont find out and having found out dont sooner or later discolour its water with blood  i hear no good character of em sartainly friend hurry though ive never been called on yet to meet them or any other mortal on the warpath i dare to say that such a lovely spot as this would not be likely to be overlooked by such plunderers for though ive not been in the way of quarreling with them tribes myself the delawares give me such an account of em that ive pretty much set em down in my own mind as thorough miscreants  you may do that with a safe conscience or for that matter any other savage you may happen to meet  here deerslayer protested and as they went paddling down the lake a hot discussion was maintained concerning the respective merits of the palefaces and the redskins hurry had all the prejudices and antipathies of a white hunter who generally regards the indian as a sort of natural competitor and not unfrequently as a natural enemy as a matter of course he was loud clamorous dogmatical and not very argumentative deerslayer on the other hand manifested a very different temper proving by the moderation of his language the fairness of his views and the simplicity of his distinctions that he possessed every disposition to hear reason a strong innate desire to do justice and an ingenuousness that was singularly indisposed to have recourse to sophism to maintain an argument or to defend a prejudice still he was not altogether free from the influence of the latter feeling this tyrant of the human mind which ruses on it prey through a thousand avenues almost as soon as men begin to think and feel and which seldom relinquishes its iron sway until they cease to do either had made some impression on even the just propensities of this individual who probably offered in these particulars a fair specimen of what absence from bad example the want of temptation to go wrong and native good feeling can render youth  you will allow deerslayer that a mingo is more than half devil cried hurry following up the discussion with an animation that touched closely on ferocity though you want to overpersuade me that the delaware tribe is pretty much made up of angels now i gainsay that proposal consarning white men even all white men are not faultless and therefore all indians cant be faultless and so your argument is out at the elbow in the start but this is what i call reason heres three colors on arth white black and red white is the highest color and therefore the best man black comes next and is put to live in the neighborhood of the white man as tolerable and fit to be made use of and red comes last which shows that those that made em never expected an indian to be accounted as more than half human  god made all three alike hurry  alike do you call a nigger like a white man or me like an indian  you go off at halfcock and dont hear me out god made us all white black and red and no doubt had his own wise intentions in coloring us differently still he made us in the main much the same in feelins though ill not deny that he gave each race its gifts a white mans gifts are christianized while a redskins are more for the wilderness thus it would be a great offence for a white man to scalp the dead whereas its a signal vartue in an indian then agin a white man cannot amboosh women and children in war while a redskin may tis cruel work ill allow but for them its lawful work while for us it would be grievous work  that depends on your inimy as for scalping or even skinning a savage i look upon them pretty much the same as cutting off the ears of wolves for the bounty or stripping a bear of its hide and then youre out significantly as to taking the poll of a redskin in hand seeing that the very colony has offered a bounty for the job all the same as it pays for wolves ears and crows heads  ay and a bad business it is hurry even the indians themselves cry shame on it seeing its agin a white mans gifts i do not pretend that all that white men do is properly christianized and according to the lights given them for then they would be what they ought to be which we know they are not but i will maintain that tradition and use and color and laws make such a difference in races as to amount to gifts i do not deny that there are tribes among the indians that are natrally pervarse and wicked as there are nations among the whites now i account the mingos as belonging to the first and the frenchers in the canadas to the last in a state of lawful warfare such as we have lately got into it is a duty to keep down all compassionate feelins so far as life goes agin either but when it comes to scalps its a very different matter  just hearken to reason if you please deerslayer and tell me if the colony can make an onlawful law isnt an onlawful law more agin natur than scalpin a savage a law can no more be onlawful than truth can be a lie  that sounds reasonable but it has a most onreasonable bearing hurry laws dont all come from the same quarter god has given us hisn and some come from the colony and others come from the king and parliament when the colonys laws or even the kings laws run agin the laws of god they get to be onlawful and ought not to be obeyed i hold to a white mans respecting white laws so long as they do not cross the track of a law comin from a higher authority and for a red man to obey his own redskin usages under the same privilege but t is useless talking as each man will think fir himself and have his say agreeable to his thoughts let us keep a good lookout for your friend floating tom lest we pass him as he lies hidden under this bushy shore  deerslayer had not named the borders of the lake amiss along their whole length the smaller trees overhung the water with their branches often dipping in the transparent element the banks were steep even from the narrow strand and as vegetation invariably struggles towards the light the effect was precisely that at which the lover of the picturesque would have aimed had the ordering of this glorious setting of forest been submitted to his control the points and bays too were sufficiently numerous to render the outline broken and diversified as the canoe kept close along the western side of the lake with a view as hurry had explained to his companion of reconnoitering for enemies before he trusted himself too openly in sight the expectations of the two adventurers were kept constantly on the stretch as neither could foretell what the next turning of a point might reveal their progress was swift the gigantic strength of hurry enabling him to play with the light bark as if it had been a feather while the skill of his companion almost equalized their usefulness notwithstanding the disparity in natural means  each time the canoe passed a point hurry turned a look behind him expecting to see the ark anchored or beached in the bay he was fated to be disappointed however and they had got within a mile of the southern end of the lake or a distance of quite two leagues from the castle which was now hidden from view by half a dozen intervening projections of the land when he suddenly ceased paddling as if uncertain in what direction next to steer  it is possible that the old chap has dropped into the river said hurry after looking carefully along the whole of the eastern shore which was about a mile distant and open to his scrutiny for more than half its length for he has taken to trapping considerable of late and barring floodwood he might drop down it a mile or so though he would have a most scratching time in getting back again  where is this outlet asked deerslayer i see no opening in the banks or the trees that looks as if it would let a river like the susquehannah run through it  ay deerslayer rivers are like human mortals having small beginnings and ending with broad shoulders and wide mouths you dont see the outlet because it passes atween high steep banks and the pines and hemlocks and basswoods hang over it as a roof hangs over a house if old tom is not in the rats cove he must have burrowed in the river well look for him first in the cove and then well cross to the outlet  as they proceeded hurry explained that there was a shallow bay formed by a long low point that had got the name of the rats cove from the circumstance of its being a favorite haunt of the muskrat and which offered so complete a cover for the ark that its owner was fond of lying in it whenever he found it convenient  as a man never knows who may be his visitors in this part of the country continued hurry its a great advantage to get a good look at em afore they come too near now its war such caution is more than commonly useful since a canada man or a mingo might get into his hut afore he invited em but hutter is a firstrate lookouter and can pretty much scent danger as a hound scents the deer  i should think the castle so open that it would be sartain to draw inimies if any happened to find the lake a thing onlikely enough i will allow as its off the trail of the forts and settlements  why deerslayer ive got to believe that a man meets with inimies easier than he meets with frinds its skearful to think for how many causes one gets to be your inimy and for how few your frind some take up the hatchet because you dont think just as they think other some because you run ahead of em in the same idees and i once knowd a vagabond that quarrelled with a frind because he didnt think him handsome now youre no monument in the way of beauty yourself deerslayer and yet you wouldnt be so onreasonable as to become my inimy for just saying so  im as the lord made me and i wish to be accounted no better nor any worse good looks i may not have that is to say to a degree that the lightminded and vain crave but i hope im not altogether without some ricommend in the way of good conduct theres few nobler looking men to be seen than yourself hurry and i know that i am not to expect any to turn their eyes on me when such a one as you can be gazed on but i do not know that a hunter is less expart with the rifle or less to be relied on for food because he doesnt wish to stop at every shining spring he may meet to study his own countenance in the water  here hurry burst into a fit of loud laughter for while he was too reckless to care much about his own manifest physical superiority he was well aware of it and like most men who derive an advantage from the accidents of birth or nature he was apt to think complacently on the subject whenever it happened to cross his mind  no no deerslayer youre no beauty as you will own yourself if youll look over the side of the canoe he cried jude will say that to your face if you start her for a parter tongue isnt to be found in any gals head in or out of the settlements if you provoke her to use it my advice to you is never to aggravate judith though you may tell anything to hetty and shell take it as meek as a lamb no jude will be just as like as not to tell you her opinion consarning your looks  and if she does hurry she will tell me no more than you have said already  youre not thickning up about a small remark i hope deerslayer when no harm is meant you are not a beauty as you must know and why shouldnt frinds tell each other these little trifles if you was handsome or ever like to be id be one of the first to tell you of it and that ought to content you now if jude was to tell me that im as ugly as a sinner id take it as a sort of obligation and try not to believe her  its easy for them that natur has favored to jest about such matters hurry though it is sometimes hard for others ill not deny but ive had my cravings towards good looks yes i have but then ive always been able to get them down by considering how many ive known with fair outsides who have had nothing to boast of inwardly ill not deny hurry that i often wish id been created more comely to the eye and more like such a one as yourself in them particulars but then i get the feelin under by remembering how much better off i am in a great many respects than some fellowmortals i might have been born lame and onfit even for a squirrelhunt or blind which would have made me a burden on myself as well as on my frinds or without hearing which would have totally onqualified me for ever campaigning or scouting which i look forward to as part of a mans duty in troublesome times yes yes its not pleasant i will allow to see them thats more comely and more sought ater and honored than yourself but it may all be borne if a man looks the evil in the face and dont mistake his gifts and his obligations  hurry in the main was a goodhearted as well as goodnatured fellow and the selfabasement of his companion completely got the better of the passing feeling of personal vanity he regretted the allusion he had made to the others appearance and endeavored to express as much though it was done in the uncouth manner that belonged to the habits and opinions of the frontier  i meant no harm deerslayer he answered in a deprecating manner and hope youll forget what ive said if youre not downright handsome youve a sartain look that says plainer than any words that alls right within then you set no value by looks and will the sooner forgive any little slight to your appearance i will not say that jude will greatly admire you for that might raise hopes that would only breed disappintment but theres hetty now would be just as likely to find satisfaction in looking at you as in looking at any other man then youre altogether too grave and consideratelike to care much about judith for though the gal is oncommon she is so general in her admiration that a man need not be exalted because she happens to smile i sometimes think the hussy loves herself better than she does anything else breathin  if she did hurry shed do no more im afeard than most queens on their thrones and ladies in the towns answered deerslayer smiling and turning back towards his companion with every trace of feeling banished from his honestlooking and frank countenance i never yet knowd even a delaware of whom you might not say that much but here is the end of the long pint you mentioned and the rats cove cant be far off  this point instead of thrusting itself forward like all the others ran in a line with the main shore of the lake which here swept within it in a deep and retired bay circling round south again at the distance of a quarter of a mile and crossed the valley forming the southern termination of the water in this bay hurry felt almost certain of finding the ark since anchored behind the trees that covered the narrow strip of the point it might have lain concealed from prying eyes an entire summer so complete indeed was the cover in this spot that a boat hauled close to the beach within the point and near the bottom of the bay could by any possibility be seen from only one direction and that was from a densely wooded shore within the sweep of the water where strangers would be little apt to go  we shall soon see the ark said hurry as the canoe glided round the extremity of the point where the water was so deep as actually to appear black he loves to burrow up among the rushes and we shall be in his nest in five minutes although the old fellow may be off among the traps himself  march proved a false prophet the canoe completely doubled the point so as to enable the two travellers to command a view of the whole cove or bay for it was more properly the last and no object but those that nature had placed there became visible the placid water swept round in a graceful curve the rushes bent gently towards its surface and the trees overhung it as usual but all lay in the soothing and sublime solitude of a wilderness the scene was such as a poet or an artist would have delighted in but it had no charm for hurry harry who was burning with impatience to get a sight of his lightminded beauty  the motion of the canoe had been attended with little or no noise the frontiermen habitually getting accustomed to caution in most of their movements and it now lay on the glassy water appearing to float in air partaking of the breathing stillness that seemed to pervade the entire scene at this instant a dry stick was heard cracking on the narrow strip of land that concealed the bay from the open lake both the adventurers started and each extended a hand towards his rifle the weapon never being out of reach of the arm  twas too heavy for any light creatur whispered hurry and it sounded like the tread of a man  not sonot so returned deerslayer t was as you say too heavy for one but it was too light for the other put your paddle in the water and send the canoe in to that log ill land and cut off the creaturs retreat up the pint be it a mingo or be it a muskrat  as hurry complied deerslayer was soon on the shore advancing into the thicket with a moccasined foot and a caution that prevented the least noise in a minute he was in the centre of the narrow strip of land and moving slowly down towards its end the bushes rendering extreme watchfulness necessary just as he reached the centre of the thicket the dried twigs cracked again and the noise was repeated at short intervals as if some creature having life walked slowly towards the point hurry heard these sounds also and pushing the canoe off into the bay he seized his rifle to watch the result a breathless minute succeeded after which a noble buck walked out of the thicket proceeded with a stately step to the sandy extremity of the point and began to slake his thirst from the water of the lake hurry hesitated an instant then raising his rifle hastily to his shoulder he took sight and fired the effect of this sudden interruption of the solemn stillness of such a scene was not its least striking peculiarity the report of the weapon had the usual sharp short sound of the rifle but when a few moments of silence had succeeded the sudden crack during which the noise was floating in air across the water it reached the rocks of the opposite mountain where the vibrations accumulated and were rolled from cavity to cavity for miles along the hills seeming to awaken the sleeping thunders of the woods the buck merely shook his head at the report of the rifle and the whistling of the bullet for never before had he come in contact with man but the echoes of the hills awakened his distrust and leaping forward with his four legs drawn under his body he fell at once into deep water and began to swim towards the foot of the lake hurry shouted and dashed forward in chase and for one or two minutes the water foamed around the pursuer and the pursued the former was dashing past the point when deerslayer appeared on the sand and signed to him to return  twas inconsiderate to pull a trigger afore we had reconnitred the shore and made sartain that no inimies harbored near it said the latter as his companion slowly and reluctantly complied this much i have larned from the delawares in the way of schooling and traditions even though ive never yet been on a warpath and moreover venison can hardly be called in season now and we do not want for food they call me deerslayer ill own and perhaps i desarve the name in the way of understanding the creaturs habits as well as for some sartainty in the aim but they cant accuse me of killing an animal when there is no occasion for the meat or the skin i may be a slayer its true but im no slaughterer  twas an awful mistake to miss that buck exclaimed hurry doffing his cap and running his fingers through his handsome but matted curls as if he would loosen his tangled ideas by the process ive not done so onhandy a thing since i was fifteen  never lament it as the creaturs death could have done neither of us any good and might have done us harm them echoes are more awful in my ears than your mistake hurry for they sound like the voice of natur calling out agin a wasteful and onthinking action  youll hear plenty of such calls if you tarry long in this quarter of the world lad returned the other laughing the echoes repeat pretty much all that is said or done on the glimmerglass in this calm summer weather if a paddle falls you hear of it sometimes agin and agin as if the hills were mocking your clumsiness and a laugh or a whistle comes out of them pines when theyre in the humour to speak in a way to make you believe they can rally convarse  so much the more reason for being prudent and silent i do not think the inimy can have found their way into these hills yet for i dont know what they are to gain by it but all the delawares tell me that as courage is a warriors first vartue so is prudence his second one such call from the mountains is enough to let a whole tribe into the secret of our arrival  if it does no other good it will warn old tom to put the pot over and let him know visiters are at hand come lad get into the canoe and we will hunt the ark up while there is yet day  deerslayer complied and the canoe left the spot its head was turned diagonally across the lake pointing towards the southeastern curvature of the sheet in that direction the distance to the shore or to the termination of the lake on the course the two were now steering was not quite a mile and their progress being always swift it was fast lessening under the skilful but easy sweeps of the paddles when about half way across a slight noise drew the eyes of the men towards the nearest land and they saw that the buck was just emerging from the lake and wading towards the beach in a minute the noble animal shook the water from his flanks gazed up ward at the covering of trees and bounding against the bank plunged into the forest  that creatur goes off with gratitude in his heart said deerslayer for natur tells him he has escaped a great danger you ought to have some of the same feelins hurry to think your eye wasnt true or that your hand was onsteady when no good could come of a shot that was intended onmeaningly rather than in reason  i deny the eye and the hand cried march with some heat youve got a little character down among the delawares there for quickness and sartainty at a deer but i should like to see you behind one of them pines and a full painted mingo behind another each with a cockd rifle and a striving for the chance thems the situations nathaniel to try the sight and the hand for they begin with trying the narves i never look upon killing a creatur as an explite but killing a savage is the time will come to try your hand now weve got to blows agin and we shall soon know what a venson reputation can do in the field i deny that either hand or eye was onsteady it was all a miscalculation of the buck which stood still when he ought to have kept in motion and so i shot ahead of him  have it your own way hurry all i contend for is that its lucky i dare say i shall not pull upon a human mortal as steadily or with as light a heart as i pull upon a deer  whos talking of mortals or of human beings at all deerslayer i put the matter to you on the supposition of an injin i dare say any man would have his feelins when it got to be life or death agin another human mortal but there would be no such scruples in regard to an injin nothing but the chance of his hitting you or the chance of your hitting him  i look upon the redmen to be quite as human as we are ourselves hurry they have their gifts and their religion its true but that makes no difference in the end when each will be judged according to his deeds and not according to his skin  thats downright missionary and will find little favor up in this part of the country where the moravians dont congregate now skin makes the man this is reason else how are people to judge of each other the skin is put on over all in order when a creatur or a mortal is fairly seen you may know at once what to make of him you know a bear from a hog by his skin and a gray squirrel from a black  true hurry said the other looking back and smiling nevertheless they are both squirrels  who denies it but youll not say that a red man and a white man are both injins  but i do say they are both men men of different races and colors and having different gifts and traditions but in the main with the same natur both have souls and both will be held accountable for their deeds in this life  hurry was one of those theorists who believed in the inferiority of all the human race who were not white his notions on the subject were not very clear nor were his definitions at all well settled but his opinions were none the less dogmatical or fierce his conscience accused him of sundry lawless acts against the indians and he had found it an exceedingly easy mode of quieting it by putting the whole family of redmen incontinently without the category of human rights nothing angered him sooner than to deny his proposition more especially if the denial were accompanied by a show of plausible argument and he did not listen to his companions remarks with much composure of either manner or feeling  youre a boy deerslayer misled and misconsaited by delaware arts and missionary ignorance he exclaimed with his usual indifference to the forms of speech when excited you may account yourself as a redskins brother but i holdem all to be animals with nothing human about em but cunning that they have ill allow but so has a fox or even a bear im older than you and have lived longer in the woodsor for that matter have lived always there and am not to be told what an injin is or what he is not if you wish to be considered a savage youve only to say so and ill name you as such to judith and the old man and then well see how youll like your welcome  here hurrys imagination did his temper some service since by conjuring up the reception his semiaquatic acquaintance would be likely to bestow on one thus introduced he burst into a hearty fit of laughter deerslayer too well knew the uselessness of attempting to convince such a being of anything against his prejudices to feel a desire to undertake the task and he was not sorry that the approach of the canoe to the southeastern curve of the lake gave a new direction to his ideas they were now indeed quite near the place that march had pointed out for the position of the outlet and both began to look for it with a curiosity that was increased by the expectation of the ark  it may strike the reader as a little singular that the place where a stream of any size passed through banks that had an elevation of some twenty feet should be a matter of doubt with men who could not now have been more than two hundred yards distant from the precise spot it will be recollected however that the trees and bushes here as elsewhere fairly overhung the water making such a fringe to the lake as to conceal any little variations from its general outline  ive not been down at this end of the lake these two summers said hurry standing up in the canoe the better to look about him ay theres the rock showing its chin above the water and i know that the river begins in its neighborhood  the men now plied the paddles again and they were presently within a few yards of the rock floating towards it though their efforts were suspended this rock was not large being merely some five or six feet high only half of which elevation rose above the lake the incessant washing of the water for centuries had so rounded its summit that it resembled a large beehive in shape its form being more than usually regular and even hurry remarked as they floated slowly past that this rock was well known to all the indians in that part of the country and that they were in the practice of using it as a mark to designate the place of meeting when separated by their hunts and marches  and here is the river deerslayer he continued though so shut in by trees and bushes as to look more like an andbush than the outlet of such a sheet as the glimmerglass  hurry had not badly described the place which did truly seem to be a stream lying in ambush the high banks might have been a hundred feet asunder but on the western side a small bit of low land extended so far forward as to diminish the breadth of the stream to half that width  as the bushes hung in the water beneath and pines that had the stature of churchsteeples rose in tall columns above all inclining towards the light until their branches intermingled the eye at a little distance could not easily detect any opening in the shore to mark the egress of the water in the forest above no traces of this outlet were to be seen from the lake the whole presenting the same connected and seemingly interminable carpet of leaves as the canoe slowly advanced sucked in by the current it entered beneath an arch of trees through which the light from the heavens struggled by casual openings faintly relieving the gloom beneath  this is a natral andbush half whispered hurry as if he felt that the place was devoted to secrecy and watchfulness depend on it old tom has burrowed with the ark somewhere in this quarter we will drop down with the current a short distance and ferret him out  this seems no place for a vessel of any size returned the other it appears to me that we shall have hardly room enough for the canoe  hurry laughed at the suggestion and as it soon appeared with reason for the fringe of bushes immediately on the shore of the lake was no sooner passed than the adventurers found themselves in a narrow stream of a sufficient depth of limpid water with a strong current and a canopy of leaves upheld by arches composed of the limbs of hoary trees bushes lined the shores as usual but they left sufficient space between them to admit the passage of anything that did not exceed twenty feet in width and to allow of a perspective ahead of eight or ten times that distance  neither of our two adventurers used his paddle except to keep the light bark in the centre of the current but both watched each turning of the stream of which there were two or three within the first hundred yards with jealous vigilance turn after turn however was passed and the canoe had dropped down with the current some little distance when hurry caught a bush and arrested its movement so suddenly and silently as to denote some unusual motive for the act deerslayer laid his hand on the stock of his rifle as soon as he noted this proceeding but it was quite as much with a hunters habit as from any feeling of alarm  there the old fellow is whispered hurry pointing with a finger and laughing heartily though he carefully avoided making a noise ratting it away just as i supposed up to his knees in the mud and water looking to the traps and the bait but for the life of me i can see nothing of the ark though ill bet every skin i take this season jude isnt trusting her pretty little feet in the neighborhood of that black mud the gals more likely to be braiding her hair by the side of some spring where she can see her own good looks and collect scornful feelings agin us men  you overjudge young womenyes you do hurrywho as often bethink them of their failings as they do of their perfections i dare to say this judith now is no such admirer of herself and no such scorner of our sex as you seem to think and that she is quite as likely to be sarving her father in the house wherever that may be as he is to be sarving her among the traps  its a pleasure to hear truth from a mans tongue if it be only once in a girls life cried a pleasant rich and yet soft female voice so near the canoe as to make both the listeners start as for you master hurry fair words are so apt to choke you that i no longer expect to hear them from your mouth the last you uttered sticking in your throat and coming near to death but im glad to see you keep better society than formerly and that they who know how to esteem and treat women are not ashamed to journey in your company  as this was said a singularly handsome and youthful female face was thrust through an opening in the leaves within reach of deerslayers paddle its owner smiled graciously on the young man and the frown that she cast on hurry though simulated and pettish had the effect to render her beauty more striking by exhibiting the play of an expressive but capricious countenance one that seemed to change from the soft to the severe the mirthful to the reproving with facility and indifference  a second look explained the nature of the surprise unwittingly the men had dropped alongside of the ark which had been purposely concealed in bushes cut and arranged for the purpose and judith hutter had merely pushed aside the leaves that lay before a window in order to show her face and speak to them    chapter iv       and that timid fawn starts not with fear     when i steal to her secret bower     and that young may violet to me is dear     and i visit the silent streamlet near     to look on the lovely flower      bryant an indian story ii1115  the ark as the floating habitation of the hutters was generally called was a very simple contrivance a large flat or scow composed the buoyant part of the vessel and in its centre occupying the whole of its breadth and about two thirds of its length stood a low fabric resembling the castle in construction though made of materials so light as barely to be bulletproof as the sides of the scow were a little higher than usual and the interior of the cabin had no more elevation than was necessary for comfort this unusual addition had neither a very clumsy nor a very obtrusive appearance it was in short little more than a modern canalboat though more rudely constructed of greater breadth than common and bearing about it the signs of the wilderness in its barkcovered posts and roof the scow however had been put together with some skill being comparatively light for its strength and sufficiently manageable the cabin was divided into two apartments one of which served for a parlor and the sleepingroom of the father and the other was appropriated to the uses of the daughters a very simple arrangement sufficed for the kitchen which was in one end of the scow and removed from the cabin standing in the open air the ark being altogether a summer habitation  the andbush as hurry in his ignorance of english termed it is quite as easily explained in many parts of the lake and river where the banks were steep and high the smaller trees and larger bushes as has been already mentioned fairly overhung the stream their branches not unfrequently dipping into the water in some instances they grew out in nearly horizontal lines for thirty or forty feet the water being uniformly deepest near the shores where the banks were highest and the nearest to a perpendicular hutter had found no difficulty in letting the ark drop under one of these covers where it had been anchored with a view to conceal its position security requiring some such precautions in his view of the case once beneath the trees and bushes a few stones fastened to the ends of the branches had caused them to bend sufficiently to dip into the river and a few severed bushes properly disposed did the rest the reader has seen that this cover was so complete as to deceive two men accustomed to the woods and who were actually in search of those it concealed a circumstance that will be easily understood by those who are familiar with the matted and wild luxuriance of a virgin american forest more especially in a rich soil the discovery of the ark produced very different effects on our two adventurers  as soon as the canoe could be got round to the proper opening hurry leaped on board and in a minute was closely engaged in a gay and a sort of recriminating discourse with judith apparently forgetful of the existence of all the rest of the world not so with deerslayer he entered the ark with a slow cautious step examining every arrangement of the cover with curious and scrutinizing eyes it is true he cast one admiring glance at judith which was extorted by her brilliant and singular beauty but even this could detain him but a single instant from the indulgence of his interest in hutters contrivances step by step did he look into the construction of the singular abode investigate its fastenings and strength ascertain its means of defence and make every inquiry that would be likely to occur to one whose thoughts dwelt principally on such expedients nor was the cover neglected of this he examined the whole minutely his commendation escaping him more than once in audible comments frontier usages admitting of this familiarity he passed through the rooms as he had previously done at the castle and opening a door issued into the end of the scow opposite to that where he had left hurry and judith here he found the other sister employed at some coarse needlework seated beneath the leafy canopy of the cover  as deerslayers examination was by this time ended he dropped the butt of his rifle and leaning on the barrel with both hands he turned towards the girl with an interest the singular beauty of her sister had not awakened he had gathered from hurrys remarks that hetty was considered to have less intellect than ordinarily falls to the share of human beings and his education among indians had taught him to treat those who were thus afflicted by providence with more than common tenderness nor was there any thing in hetty hutters appearance as so often happens to weaken the interest her situation excited an idiot she could not properly be termed her mind being just enough enfeebled to lose most of those traits that are connected with the more artful qualities and to retain its ingenuousness and love of truth it had often been remarked of this girl by the few who had seen her and who possessed sufficient knowledge to discriminate that her perception of the right seemed almost intuitive while her aversion to the wrong formed so distinctive a feature of her mind as to surround her with an atmosphere of pure morality peculiarities that are not infrequent with persons who are termed feebleminded as if god had forbidden the evil spirits to invade a precinct so defenceless with the benign purpose of extending a direct protection to those who had been left without the usual aids of humanity her person too was agreeable having a strong resemblance to that of her sisters of which it was a subdued and humble copy if it had none of the brilliancy of judiths the calm quiet almost holy expression of her meek countenance seldom failed to win on the observer and few noted it long that did not begin to feel a deep and lasting interest in the girl she had no colour in common nor was her simple mind apt to present images that caused her cheek to brighten though she retained a modesty so innate that it almost raised her to the unsuspecting purity of a being superior to human infirmities guileless innocent and without distrust equally by nature and from her mode of life providence had nevertheless shielded her from harm by a halo of moral light as it is said to temper the wind to the shorn lamb  you are hetty hutter said deerslayer in the way one puts a question unconsciously to himself assuming a kindness of tone and manner that were singularly adapted to win the confidence of her he addressed hurry harry has told me of you and i know you must be the child  yes im hetty hutter returned the girl in a low sweet voice which nature aided by some education had preserved from vulgarity of tone and utteranceim hetty judith hutters sister and thomas hutters youngest daughter  i know your history then for hurry harry talks considerable and he is free of speech when he can find other peoples consarns to dwell on you pass most of your life on the lake hetty  certainly mother is dead father is gone atrapping and judith and i stay at home whats your name  thats a question more easily asked than it is answered young woman seeing that im so young and yet have borne more names than some of the greatest chiefs in all america  but youve got a nameyou dont throw away one name before you come honestly by another  i hope not gali hope not my names have come natrally and i suppose the one i bear now will be of no great lasting since the delawares seldom settle on a mans raal title until such time as he has an opportunity of showing his true natur in the council or on the warpath which has never behappened me seeing firstly because im not born a redskin and have no right to sit in their councillings and am much too humble to be called on for opinions from the great of my own colour and secondly because this is the first war that has befallen in my time and no inimy has yet inroaded far enough into the colony to be reached by an arm even longer than mine  tell me your names added hetty looking up at him artlessly and maybe ill tell you your character  there is some truth in that ill not deny though it often fails men are deceived in other mens characters and frequently give em names they by no means desarve you can see the truth of this in the mingo names which in their own tongue signify the same things as the delaware namesat least so they tell me for i know little of that tribe unless it be by reportand no one can say they are as honest or as upright a nation i put no great dependence therefore on names  tell me all your names repeated the girl earnestly for her mind was too simple to separate things from professions and she did attach importance to a name i want to know what to think of you  well sartain ive no objection and you shall hear them all in the first place then im christian and whiteborn like yourself and my parents had a name that came down from father to son as is a part of their gifts my father was called bumppo and i was named after him of course the given name being nathaniel or natty as most people saw fit to tarm it  yes yesnattyand hetty interrupted the girl quickly and looking up from her work again with a smile you are natty and im hettythough you are bumppo and im hutter bumppo isnt as pretty as hutter is it  why thats as people fancy bumppo has no lofty sound i admit and yet men have bumped through the world with it i did not go by this name howsoever very long for the delawares soon found out or thought they found out that i was not given to lying and they called me firstly straighttongue  thats a good name interrupted hetty earnestly and in a positive manner dont tell me theres no virtue in names  i do not say that for perhaps i desarved to be so called lies being no favorites with me as they are with some after a while they found out i was quick of foot and then they called me the pigeon which you know has a swift wing and flies in a straight line  that was a pretty name exclaimed hetty pigeons are pretty birds  most things that god created are pretty in their way my good gal though they get to be deformed by mankind so as to change their naturs as well as their appearance from carrying messages and striking blind trails i got at last to following the hunters when it was thought i was quicker and surer at finding the game than most lads and then they called me the lapear as they said i partook of the sagacity of the hound  thats not so pretty answered hetty i hope you didnt keep that name long  not after i was rich enough to buy a rifle returned the other betraying a little pride through his usually quiet and subdued manner then it was seen i could keep a wigwam in venson and in time i got the name of deerslayer which is that i now bear homely as some will think it who set more value on the scalp of a fellowmortal than on the horns of a buck  well deerslayer im not one of them answered hetty simply judith likes soldiers and flary coats and fine feathers but theyre all naught to me she says the officers are great and gay and of soft speech but they make me shudder for their business is to kill their fellowcreatures i like your calling better and your last name is a very good onebetter than natty bumppo  this is natral in one of your turn of mind hetty and much as i should have expected they tell me your sister is handsomeoncommon for a mortal and beauty is apt to seek admiration  did you never see judith demanded the girl with quick earnestness if you never have go at once and look at her even hurry harry isnt more pleasant to look at though she is a woman and he is a man  deerslayer regarded the girl for a moment with concern her paleface had flushed a little and her eye usually so mild and serene brightened as she spoke in the way to betray the inward impulses  ay hurry harry he muttered to himself as he walked through the cabin towards the other end of the boat this comes of good looks if a light tongue has had no consarn in it its easy to see which way that poor creaturs feelins are leanin whatever may be the case with your judes  but an interruption was put to the gallantry of hurry the coquetry of his intros the thoughts of deerslayer and the gentle feelings of hetty by the sudden appearance of the canoe of the arks owner in the narrow opening among the bushes that served as a sort of moat to his position it would seem that hutter or floating tom as he was familiarly called by all the hunters who knew his habits recognized the canoe of hurry for he expressed no surprise at finding him in the scow on the contrary his reception was such as to denote not only gratification but a pleasure mingled with a little disappointment at his not having made his appearance some days sooner  i looked for you last week he said in a halfgrumbling halfwelcoming manner and was disappointed uncommonly that you didnt arrive there came a runner through to warn all the trappers and hunters that the colony and the canadas were again in trouble and i felt lonesome up in these mountains with three scalps to see to and only one pair of hands to protect them  thats reasonable returned march and t was feeling like a parent no doubt if i had two such darters as judith and hetty my experence would tell the same story though in ginral i am just as well satisfied with having the nearest neighbor fifty miles off as when he is within call  notwithstanding you didnt choose to come into the wilderness alone now you knew that the canada savages are likely to be stirring returned hutter giving a sort of distrustful and at the same time inquiring glance at deerslayer  why should i they say a bad companion on a journey helps to shorten the path and this young man i account to be a reasonably good one this is deerslayer old tom a noted hunter among the delawares and christianborn and christianedicated too like you and me the lad is not parfect perhaps but theres worse men in the country that he came from and its likely hell find some thats no better in this part of the world should we have occasion to defend our traps and the territory hell be useful in feeding us all for hes a reglar dealer in venson  young man you are welcome growled tom thrusting a hard bony hand towards the youth as a pledge of his sincerity in such times a white face is a friends and i count on you as a support children sometimes make a stout heart feeble and these two daughters of mine give me more concern than all my traps and skins and rights in the country  thats natral cried hurry yes deerslayer you and i dont know it yet by experience but on the whole i consider that as natral if we had darters its more than probable we should have some such feelins and i honor the man that owns em as for judith old man i enlist at once as her soldier and here is deerslayer to help you to take care of hetty  many thanks to you master march returned the beauty in a full rich voice and with an accuracy of intonation and utterance that she shared in common with her sister and which showed that she had been better taught than her fathers life and appearance would give reason to expect many thanks to you but judith hutter has the spirit and the experience that will make her depend more on herself than on goodlooking rovers like you should there be need to face the savages do you land with my father instead of burrowing in the huts under the show of defending us females and  girlgirl interrupted the father quiet that glib tongue of thine and hear the truth there are savages on the lake shore already and no man can say how near to us they may be at this very moment or when we may hear more from them  if this be true master hutter said hurry whose change of countenance denoted how serious he deemed the information though it did not denote any unmanly alarm if this be true your ark is in a most misfortunate position for though the cover did deceive deerslayer and myself it would hardly be overlooked by a fullblooded injin who was out seriously in sarch of scalps  i think as you do hurry and wish with all my heart we lay anywhere else at this moment than in this narrow crooked stream which has many advantages to hide in but which is almost fatal to them that are discovered the savages are near us moreover and the difficulty is to get out of the river without being shot down like deer standing at a lick  are you sartain master hutter that the redskins you dread are raal canadas asked deerslayer in a modest but earnest manner have you seen any and can you describe their paint  i have fallen in with the signs of their being in the neighborhood but have seen none of em i was down stream a mile or so looking to my traps when i struck a fresh trail crossing the corner of a swamp and moving northward the man had not passed an hour and i knowd it for an indian footstep by the size of the foot and the intoe even before i found a worn moccasin which its owner had dropped as useless for that matter i found the spot where he halted to make a new one which was only a few yards from the place where he had dropped the old one  that doesnt look much like a redskin on the war path returned the other shaking his head an experenced warrior at least would have burned or buried or sunk in the river such signs of his passage and your trail is quite likely a peaceable trail but the moccasin may greatly relieve my mind if you bethought you of bringing it off ive come here to meet a young chief myself and his course would be much in the direction youve mentioned the trail may have been hisn  hurry harry youre well acquainted with this young man i hope who has meetings with savages in a part of the country where he has never been before demanded hutter in a tone and in a manner that sufficiently indicated the motive of the question these rude beings seldom hesitating on the score of delicacy to betray their feelings treachery is an indian virtue and the whites that live much in their tribes soon catch their ways and practices  truetrue as the gospel old tom but not personable to deerslayer whos a young man of truth if he has no other ricommend ill answer for his honesty whatever i may do for his valor in battle  i should like to know his errand in this strange quarter of the country  that is soon told master hutter said the young man with the composure of one who kept a clean conscience i think moreover youve a right to ask it the father of two such darters who occupies a lake after your fashion has just the same right to inquire into a strangers business in his neighborhood as the colony would have to demand the reason why the frenchers put more rijiments than common along the lines no no ill not deny your right to know why a stranger comes into your habitation or country in times as serious as these  if such is your way of thinking friend let me hear your story without more words  t is soon told as i said afore and shall be honestly told im a young man and as yet have never been on a warpath but no sooner did the news come among the delawares that wampum and a hatchet were about to be sent in to the tribe than they wished me to go out among the people of my own color and get the exact state of things for em this i did and after delivering my talk to the chiefs on my return i met an officer of the crown on the schoharie who had messages to send to some of the frindly tribes that live farther west this was thought a good occasion for chingachgook a young chief who has never struck a foe and myself to go on our first war path in company and an appintment was made for us by an old delaware to meet at the rock near the foot of this lake ill not deny that chingachgook has another object in view but it has no consarn with any here and is his secret and not mine therefore ill say no more about it  tis something about a young woman interrupted judith hastily then laughing at her own impetuosity and even having the grace to colour a little at the manner in which she had betrayed her readiness to impute such a motive if tis neither war nor a hunt it must be love  ay it comes easy for the young and handsome who hear so much of them feelins to suppose that they lie at the bottom of most proceedins but on that head i say nothin chingachgook is to meet me at the rock an hour afore sunset tomorrow evening after which we shall go our way together molesting none but the kings inimies who are lawfully our own knowing hurry of old who once trapped in our hunting grounds and falling in with him on the schoharie just as he was on the pint of starting for his summer hants we agreed to journey in company not so much from fear of the mingos as from good fellowship and as he says to shorten a long road  and you think the trail i saw may have been that of your friend ahead of his time said hutter  thats my idee which may be wrong but which may be right if i saw the moccasin howsever i could tell in a minute whether it is made in the delaware fashion or not  here it is then said the quickwitted judith who had already gone to the canoe in quest of it tell us what it says friend or enemy you look honest and i believe all you say whatever father may think  thats the way with you jude forever finding out friends where i distrust foes grumbled tom but speak out young man and tell us what you think of the moccasin  thats not delaware made returned deerslayer examining the worn and rejected covering for the foot with a cautious eye im too young on a warpath to be positive but i should say that moccasin has a northern look and comes from beyond the great lakes  if such is the case we ought not to lie here a minute longer than is necessary said hutter glancing through the leaves of his cover as if he already distrusted the presence of an enemy on the opposite shore of the narrow and sinuous stream it wants but an hour or so of night and to move in the dark will be impossible without making a noise that would betray us did you hear the echo of a piece in the mountains halfanhour since  yes old man and heard the piece itself answered hurry who now felt the indiscretion of which he had been guilty for the last was fired from my own shoulder  i feared it came from the french indians still it may put them on the lookout and be a means of discovering us you did wrong to fire in wartime unless there was good occasion  so i begin to think myself uncle tom and yet if a man cant trust himself to let off his rifle in a wilderness that is a thousand miles square lest some inimy should hear it wheres the use in carrying one  hutter now held a long consultation with his two guests in which the parties came to a true understanding of their situation he explained the difficulty that would exist in attempting to get the ark out of so swift and narrow a stream in the dark without making a noise that could not fail to attract indian ears any strollers in their vicinity would keep near the river or the lake but the former had swampy shores in many places and was both so crooked and so fringed with bushes that it was quite possible to move by daylight without incurring much danger of being seen more was to be apprehended perhaps from the ear than from the eye especially as long as they were in the short straitened and canopied reaches of the stream  i never drop down into this cover which is handy to my traps and safer than the lake from curious eyes without providing the means of getting out agin continued this singular being and that is easier done by a pull than a push my anchor is now lying above the suction in the open lake and here is a line you see to haul us up to it without some such help a single pair of bands would make heavy work in forcing a scow like this up stream i have a sort of a crab too that lightens the pull on occasion jude can use the oar astern as well as myself and when we fear no enemy to get out of the river gives us but little trouble  what should we gain master hutter by changing the position asked deerslayer with a good deal of earnestness this is a safe cover and a stout defence might be made from the inside of this cabin ive never fout unless in the way of tradition but it seems to me we might beat off twenty mingos with palisades like them afore us  ay ay you ve never fought except in traditions thats plain enough young man did you ever see as broad a sheet of water as this above us before you came in upon it with hurry  i cant say that i ever did deerslayer answered modestly youth is the time to larn and im far from wishing to raise my voice in counsel afore it is justified by experence  well then ill teach you the disadvantage of fighting in this position and the advantage of taking to the open lake here you may see the savages will know where to aim every shot and it would be too much to hope that some would not find their way through the crevices of the logs now on the other hand we should have nothing but a forest to aim at then we are not safe from fire here the bark of this roof being little better than so much kindlingwood the castle too might be entered and ransacked in my absence and all my possessions overrun and destroyed once in the lake we can be attacked only in boats or on raftsshall have a fair chance with the enemyand can protect the castle with the ark do you understand this reasoning youngster  it sounds wellyes it has a rational sound and ill not gainsay it  well old tom cried hurry if we are to move the sooner we make a beginning the sooner we shall know whether we are to have our scalps for nightcaps or not  as this proposition was selfevident no one denied its justice the three men after a short preliminary explanation now set about their preparations to move the ark in earnest the slight fastenings were quickly loosened and by hauling on the line the heavy craft slowly emerged from the cover it was no sooner free from the incumbrance of the branches than it swung into the stream sheering quite close to the western shore by the force of the current not a soul on board heard the rustling of the branches as the cabin came against the bushes and trees of the western bank without a feeling of uneasiness for no one knew at what moment or in what place a secret and murderous enemy might unmask himself perhaps the gloomy light that still struggled through the impending canopy of leaves or found its way through the narrow ribbonlike opening which seemed to mark in the air above the course of the river that flowed beneath aided in augmenting the appearance of the danger for it was little more than sufficient to render objects visible without giving up all their outlines at a glance although the sun had not absolutely set it had withdrawn its direct rays from the valley and the hues of evening were beginning to gather around objects that stood uncovered rendering those within the shadows of the woods still more sombre and gloomy  no interruption followed the movement however and as the men continued to haul on the line the ark passed steadily ahead the great breadth of the scow preventing its sinking into the water and from offering much resistance to the progress of the swift element beneath its bottom hutter too had adopted a precaution suggested by experience which might have done credit to a seaman and which completely prevented any of the annoyances and obstacles which otherwise would have attended the short turns of the river as the ark descended heavy stones attached to the line were dropped in the centre of the stream forming local anchors each of which was kept from dragging by the assistance of those above it until the uppermost of all was reached which got its backing from the anchor or grapnel that lay well out in the lake in consequence of this expedient the ark floated clear of the incumbrances of the shore against which it would otherwise have been unavoidably hauled at every turn producing embarrassments that hutter singlehanded would have found it very difficult to overcome favored by this foresight and stimulated by the apprehension of discovery floating tom and his two athletic companions hauled the ark ahead with quite as much rapidity as comported with the strength of the line at every turn in the stream a stone was raised from the bottom when the direction of the scow changed to one that pointed towards the stone that lay above in this manner with the channel buoyed out for him as a sailor might term it did hutter move forward occasionally urging his friends in a low and guarded voice to increase their exertions and then as occasions offered warning them against efforts that might at particular moments endanger all by too much zeal in spite of their long familiarity with the woods the gloomy character of the shaded river added to the uneasiness that each felt and when the ark reached the first bend in the susquehannah and the eye caught a glimpse of the broader expanse of the lake all felt a relief that perhaps none would have been willing to confess here the last stone was raised from the bottom and the line led directly towards the grapnel which as hutter had explained was dropped above the suction of the current  thank god ejaculated hurry there is daylight and we shall soon have a chance of seeing our inimies if we are to feel em  that is more than you or any man can say growled hutter there is no spot so likely to harbor a party as the shore around the outlet and the moment we clear these trees and get into open water will be the most trying time since it will leave the enemy a cover while it puts us out of one judith girl do you and hetty leave the oar to take care of itself and go within the cabin and be mindful not to show your faces at a window for they who will look at them wont stop to praise their beauty and now hurry well step into this outer room ourselves and haul through the door where we shall all be safe from a surprise at least friend deerslayer as the current is lighter and the line has all the strain on it that is prudent do you keep moving from window to window taking care not to let your head be seen if you set any value on life no one knows when or where we shall hear from our neighbors  deerslayer complied with a sensation that had nothing in common with fear but which had all the interest of a perfectly novel and a most exciting situation for the first time in his life he was in the vicinity of enemies or had good reason to think so and that too under all the thrilling circumstances of indian surprises and indian artifices as he took his stand at the window the ark was just passing through the narrowest part of the stream a point where the water first entered what was properly termed the river and where the trees fairly interlocked overhead causing the current to rush into an arch of verdure a feature as appropriate and peculiar to the country perhaps as that of switzerland where the rivers come rushing literally from chambers of ice  the ark was in the act of passing the last curve of this leafy entrance as deerslayer having examined all that could be seen of the eastern bank of the river crossed the room to look from the opposite window at the western his arrival at this aperture was most opportune for he had no sooner placed his eye at a crack than a sight met his gaze that might well have alarmed a sentinel so young and inexperienced a sapling overhung the water in nearly half a circle having first grown towards the light and then been pressed down into this form by the weight of the snows a circumstance of common occurrence in the american woods on this no less than six indians had already appeared others standing ready to follow them as they left room each evidently bent on running out on the trunk and dropping on the roof of the ark as it passed beneath this would have been an exploit of no great difficulty the inclination of the tree admitting of an easy passage the adjoining branches offering ample support for the hands and the fall being too trifling to be apprehended when deerslayer first saw this party it was just unmasking itself by ascending the part of the tree nearest to the earth or that which was much the most difficult to overcome and his knowledge of indian habits told him at once that they were all in their warpaint and belonged to a hostile tribe  pull hurry he cried pull for your life and as you love judith hutter pull man pull  this call was made to one that the young man knew had the strength of a giant it was so earnest and solemn that both hutter and march felt it was not idly given and they applied all their force to the line simultaneously and at a most critical moment the scow redoubled its motion and seemed to glide from under the tree as if conscious of the danger that was impending overhead perceiving that they were discovered the indians uttered the fearful warwhoop and running forward on the tree leaped desperately towards their fancied prize there were six on the tree and each made the effort all but their leader fell into the river more or less distant from the ark as they came sooner or later to the leaping place the chief who had taken the dangerous post in advance having an earlier opportunity than the others struck the scow just within the stern the fall proving so much greater than he had anticipated he was slightly stunned and for a moment he remained half bent and unconscious of his situation at this instant judith rushed from the cabin her beauty heightened by the excitement that produced the bold act which flushed her cheek to crimson and throwing all her strength into the effort she pushed the intruder over the edge of the scow headlong into the river this decided feat was no sooner accomplished than the woman resumed her sway judith looked over the stern to ascertain what had become of the man and the expression of her eyes softened to concern next her cheek crimsoned between shame and surprise at her own temerity and then she laughed in her own merry and sweet manner all this occupied less than a minute when the arm of deerslayer was thrown around her waist and she was dragged swiftly within the protection of the cabin this retreat was not effected too soon scarcely were the two in safety when the forest was filled with yells and bullets began to patter against the logs  the ark being in swift motion all this while it was beyond the danger of pursuit by the time these little events had occurred and the savages as soon as the first burst of their anger had subsided ceased firing with the consciousness that they were expending their ammunition in vain when the scow came up over her grapnel hutter tripped the latter in a way not to impede the motion and being now beyond the influence of the current the vessel continued to drift ahead until fairly in the open lake though still near enough to the land to render exposure to a riflebullet dangerous hutter and march got out two small sweeps and covered by the cabin they soon urged the ark far enough from the shore to leave no inducement to their enemies to make any further attempt to injure them   chapter v       why let the strucken deer go weep     the hart ungalled play     for some must watch while some must sleep     thus runs the world away      hamlet iiiii27174  another consultation took place in the forward part of the scow at which both judith and hetty were present as no danger could now approach unseen immediate uneasiness had given place to the concern which attended the conviction that enemies were in considerable force on the shores of the lake and that they might be sure no practicable means of accomplishing their own destruction would be neglected as a matter of course hutter felt these truths the deepest his daughters having an habitual reliance on his resources and knowing too little to appreciate fully all the risks they ran while his male companions were at liberty to quit him at any moment they saw fit his first remark showed that he had an eye to the latter circumstance and might have betrayed to a keen observer the apprehension that was just then uppermost  weve a great advantage over the iroquois or the enemy whoever they are in being afloat he said  theres not a canoe on the lake that i dont know where its hid and now yours is here hurry there are but three more on the land and theyre so snug in hollow logs that i dont believe the indians could find them let them try ever so long  theres no telling thatno one can say that put in deerslayer a hound is not more sartain on the scent than a redskin when he expects to get anything by it let this party see scalps afore em or plunder or honor accordin to their idees of what honor is and t will be a tight log that hides a canoe from their eyes  youre right deerslayer cried harry march youre downright gospel in this matter and i rejice that my bunch of bark is safe enough here within reach of my arm i calcilate theyll be at all the rest of the canoes afore tomorrow night if they are in raal arnest to smoke you out old tom and we may as well overhaul our paddles for a pull  hutter made no immediate reply he looked about him in silence for quite a minute examining the sky the lake and the belt of forest which inclosed it as it might be hermetically like one consulting their signs nor did he find any alarming symptoms the boundless woods were sleeping in the deep repose of nature the heavens were placid but still luminous with the light of the retreating sun while the lake looked more lovely and calm than it had before done that day it was a scene altogether soothing and of a character to lull the passions into a species of holy calm how far this effect was produced however on the party in the ark must appear in the progress of our narrative  judith called out the father when he had taken this close but short survey of the omens night is at hand find our friends food a long march gives a sharp appetite  were not starving master hutter march observed for we filled up just as we reached the lake and for one i prefer the company of jude even to her supper this quiet evening is very agreeable to sit by her side  natur is natur objected hutter and must be fed judith see to the meal and take your sister to help you ive a little discourse to hold with you friends he continued as soon as his daughters were out of hearing and wish the girls away you see my situation and i should like to hear your opinions concerning what is best to be done three times have i been burnt out already but that was on the shore and ive considered myself as pretty safe ever since i got the castle built and the ark afloat my other accidents however happened in peaceable times being nothing more than such flurries as a man must meet with in the woods but this matter looks serious and your ideas would greatly relieve my mind  its my notion old tom that you and your huts and your traps and your whole possessions hereaway are in desperate jippardy returned the matteroffact hurry who saw no use in concealment accordin to my idees of valie theyre altogether not worth half as much today as they was yesterday nor would i give more for em taking the pay in skins  then ive children continued the father making the allusion in a way that it might have puzzled even an indifferent observer to say was intended as a bait or as an exclamation of paternal concern daughters as you know hurry and good girls too i may say though i am their father  a man may say anything master hutter particularly when pressed by time and circumstances youve darters as you say and one of them hasnt her equal on the frontiers for good looks whatever she may have for good behavior as for poor hetty shes hetty hutter and thats as much as one can say about the poor thing give me jude if her conduct was only equal to her looks  i see harry march i can only count on you as a fairweather friend and i suppose that your companion will be of the same way of thinking returned the other with a slight show of pride that was not altogether without dignity well i must depend on providence which will not turn a deaf ear perhaps to a fathers prayers  if youve understood hurry here to mean that he intends to desart you said deerslayer with an earnest simplicity that gave double assurance of its truth i think you do him injustice as i know you do me in supposing i would follow him was he so ontruehearted as to leave a family of his own color in such a strait as this ive come on this at take master hutter to rendevous a frind and i only wish he was here himself as i make no doubt he will be at sunset tomorrow when youd have another rifle to aid you an inexperenced one ill allow like my own but one that has proved true so often agin the game big and little that ill answer for its sarvice agin mortals  may i depend on you to stand by me and my daughters then deerslayer demanded the old man with a fathers anxiety in his countenance  that may you floating tom if thats your name and as a brother would stand by a sister a husband his wife or a suitor his sweetheart in this strait you may count on me through all advarsities and i think hurry does discredit to his natur and wishes if you cant count on him  not he cried judith thrusting her handsome face out of the door his nature is hurry as well as his name and hell hurry off as soon as he thinks his fine figure in danger neither old tom nor his gals will depend much on master march now they know him but you they will rely on deerslayer for your honest face and honest heart tell us that what you promise you will perform  this was said as much perhaps in affected scorn for hurry as in sincerity still it was not said without feeling the fine face of judith sufficiently proved the latter circumstance and if the conscious march fancied that he had never seen in it a stronger display of contempta feeling in which the beauty was apt to indulgethan while she was looking at him it certainly seldom exhibited more of a womanly softness and sensibility than when her speaking blue eyes were turned on his travelling companion  leave us judith hutter ordered sternly before either of the young men could reply leave us and do not return until you come with the venison and fish the girl has been spoilt by the flattery of the officers who sometimes find their way up here master march and youll not think any harm of her silly words  you never said truer syllable old tom retorted hurry who smarted under judiths observations the deviltongued youngsters of the garrison have proved her undoing i scarce know jude any longer and shall soon take to admiring her sister who is getting to be much more to my fancy  im glad to hear this harry and look upon it as a sign that youre coming to your right senses hetty would make a much safer and more rational companion than jude and would be much the most likely to listen to your suit as the officers have i greatly fear unsettled her sisters mind  no man needs a safer wife than hetty said hurry laughing though ill not answer for her being of the most rational but no matter deerslayer has not misconceived me when he told you i should be found at my post ill not quit you uncle tom just now whatever may be my feelins and intentions respecting your eldest darter  hurry had a respectable reputation for prowess among his associates and hutter heard this pledge with a satisfaction that was not concealed even the great personal strength of such an aid became of moment in moving the ark as well as in the species of handtohand conflicts that were not unfrequent in the woods and no commander who was hard pressed could feel more joy at hearing of the arrival of reinforcements than the borderer experienced at being told this important auxiliary was not about to quit him a minute before hutter would have been well content to compromise his danger by entering into a compact to act only on the defensive but no sooner did he feel some security on this point than the restlessness of man induced him to think of the means of carrying the war into the enemys country  high prices are offered for scalps on both sides he observed with a grim smile as if he felt the force of the inducement at the very time he wished to affect a superiority to earning money by means that the ordinary feelings of those who aspire to be civilized men repudiated even while they were adopted it isnt right perhaps to take gold for human blood and yet when mankind is busy in killing one another there can be no great harm in adding a little bit of skin to the plunder whats your sentiments hurry touching these pints  that youve made a vast mistake old man in calling savage blood human blood at all i think no more of a redskins scalp than i do of a pair of wolfs ears and would just as lief finger money for the one as for the other with white people t is different for theyve a natral avarsion to being scalped whereas your indian shaves his head in readiness for the knife and leaves a lock of hair by way of braggadocio that one can lay hold of in the bargain  thats manly however and i felt from the first that we had only to get you on our side to have your heart and hand returned tom losing all his reserve as he gained a renewed confidence in the disposition of his companions something more may turn up from this inroad of the redskins than they bargained for deerslayer i conclude youre of hurrys way of thinking and look upon money arned in this way as being as likely to pass as money arned in trapping or hunting  ive no such feelin nor any wish to harbor it not i returned the other my gifts are not scalpers gifts but such as belong to my religion and color ill stand by you old man in the ark or in the castle the canoe or the woods but ill not unhumanize my natur by falling into ways that god intended for another race if you and hurry have got any thoughts that lean towards the colonys gold go by yourselves in sarch of it and leave the females to my care much as i must differ from you both on all gifts that do not properly belong to a white man we shall agree that it is the duty of the strong to take care of the weak especially when the last belong to them that natur intended man to protect and console by his gentleness and strength  hurry harry that is a lesson you might learn and practise on to some advantage said the sweet but spirited voice of judith from the cabin a proof that she had overheard all that had hitherto been said  no more of this jude called out the father angrily move farther off we are about to talk of matters unfit for a woman to listen to  hutter did not take any steps however to ascertain whether he was obeyed or not but dropping his voice a little he pursued the discourse  the young man is right hurry he said and we can leave the children in his care now my idea is just this and i think youll agree that it is rational and correct theres a large party of these savages on shore and though i didnt tell it before the girls for theyre womanish and apt to be troublesome when anything like real work is to be done theres women among em this i know from moccasin prints and t is likely they are hunters after all who have been out so long that they know nothing of the war or of the bounties  in which case old tom why was their first salute an attempt to cut our throats  we dont know that their design was so bloody its natural and easy for an indian to fall into ambushes and surprises and no doubt they wished to get on board the ark first and to make their conditions afterwards that a disappinted savage should fire at us is in rule and i think nothing of that besides how often they burned me out and robbed my trapsay and pulled trigger on me in the most peaceful times  the blackguards will do such things i must allow and we pay em off pretty much in their own cine women would not be on the warpath sartainly and so far theres reason in your idee  nor would a hunter be in his warpaint returned deerslayer i saw the mingos and know that they are out on the trail of mortal men and not for beaver or deer  there you have it agin old fellow said hurry in the way of an eye now id as soon trust this young man as trust the oldest settler in the colony if he says paint why paint it was  then a huntingparty and a warparty have met for women must have been with em its only a few days since the runner went through with the tidings of the troubles and it may be that warriors have come out to call in their women and children to get an early blow  that would stand the courts and is just the truth cried hurry youve got it now old tom and i should like to hear what you mean to make out of it  the bounty returned the other looking up at his attentive companion in a cool sullen manner in which however heartless cupidity and indifference to the means were far more conspicuous than any feelings of animosity or revenge  if theres women theres children and big and little have scalps the colony pays for all alike  more shame to it that it should do so interrupted deerslayer more shame to it that it dont understand its gifts and pay greater attention to the will of god  hearken to reason lad and dont cry out afore you understand a case returned the unmoved hurry the savages scalp your frinds the delawares or mohicans whichever they may be among the rest and why shouldnt we scalp i will own it would be agin right for you and me now to go into the settlements and bring out scalps but its a very different matter as concerns indians a man shouldnt take scalps if he isnt ready to be scalped himself on fitting occasions one good turn desarves another the world over thats reason and i believe it to be good religion  ay master hurry again interrupted the rich voice of judith is it religion to say that one bad turn deserves another  ill never reason agin you judy for you beat me with beauty if you cant with sense heres the canadas paying their injins for scalps and why not we pay  our indians exclaimed the girl laughing with a sort of melancholy merriment father father think no more of this and listen to the advice of deerslayer who has a conscience which is more than i can say or think of harry march  hutter now rose and entering the cabin he compelled his daughters to go into the adjoining room when he secured both the doors and returned then he and hurry pursued the subject but as the purport of all that was material in this discourse will appear in the narrative it need not be related here in detail the reader however can have no difficulty in comprehending the morality that presided over their conference it was in truth that which in some form or other rules most of the acts of men and in which the controlling principle is that one wrong will justify another their enemies paid for scalps and this was sufficient to justify the colony for retaliating it is true the french used the same argument a circumstance as hurry took occasion to observe in answer to one of deerslayers objections that proved its truth as mortal enemies would not be likely to have recourse to the same reason unless it were a good one but neither hutter nor hurry was a man likely to stick at trifles in matters connected with the right of the aborigines since it is one of the consequences of aggression that it hardens the conscience as the only means of quieting it in the most peaceable state of the country a species of warfare was carried on between the indians especially those of the canadas and men of their caste and the moment an actual and recognized warfare existed it was regarded as the means of lawfully revenging a thousand wrongs real and imaginary then again there was some truth and a good deal of expediency in the principle of retaliation of which they both availed themselves in particular to answer the objections of their justerminded and more scrupulous companion  you must fight a man with his own wepons deerslayer cried hurry in his uncouth dialect and in his dogmatical manner of disposing of all oral propositions if hes ferce you must be fercer if hes stout of heart you must be stouter this is the way to get the better of christian or savage by keeping up to this trail youll get soonest to the ind of your journey  thats not moravian doctrine which teaches that all are to be judged according to their talents or larning the injin like an injin and the white man like a white man some of their teachers say that if youre struck on the cheek its a duty to turn the other side of the face and take another blow instead of seeking revenge whereby i understand  thats enough shouted hurry thats all i want to prove a mans doctrine how long would it take to kick a man through the colonyin at one ind and out at the other on that principle  dont mistake me march returned the young hunter with dignity i dont understand by this any more than that its best to do this if possible revenge is an injin gift and forgiveness a white mans thats all overlook all you can is whats meant and not revenge all you can as for kicking master hurry and deerslayers sunburnt cheek flushed as he continued into the colony or out of the colony thats neither here nor there seeing no one proposes it and no one would be likely to put up with it what i wish to say is that a redskins scalping dont justify a palefaces scalping  do as youre done by deerslayer thats ever the christian parsons doctrine  no hurry ive asked the moravians consarning that and its altogether different do as you would be done by they tell me is the true saying while men practyse the false they think all the colonies wrong that offer bounties for scalps and believe no blessing will follow the measures above all things they forbid revenge  that for your moravians cried march snapping his fingers theyre the next thing to quakers and if youd believe all they tell you not even a rat would be skinned out of marcy who ever heard of marcy on a muskrat  the disdainful manner of hurry prevented a reply and he and the old man resumed the discussion of their plans in a more quiet and confidential manner this confidence lasted until judith appeared bearing the simple but savory supper march observed with a little surprise that she placed the choicest bits before deerslayer and that in the little nameless attentions it was in her power to bestow she quite obviously manifested a desire to let it be seen that she deemed him the honored guest accustomed however to the waywardness and coquetry of the beauty this discovery gave him little concern and he ate with an appetite that was in no degree disturbed by any moral causes the easilydigested food of the forests offering the fewest possible obstacles to the gratification of this great animal indulgence deerslayer notwithstanding the hearty meal both had taken in the woods was in no manner behind his companion in doing justice to the viands  an hour later the scene had greatly changed the lake was still placid and glassy but the gloom of the hour had succeeded to the soft twilight of a summer evening and all within the dark setting of the woods lay in the quiet repose of night the forests gave up no song or cry or even murmur but looked down from the hills on the lovely basin they encircled in solemn stillness and the only sound that was audible was the regular dip of the sweeps at which hurry and deerslayer lazily pushed impelling the ark towards the castle hutter had withdrawn to the stern of the scow in order to steer but finding that the young men kept even strokes and held the desired course by their own skill he permitted the oar to drag in the water took a seat on the end of the vessel and lighted his pipe he had not been thus placed many minutes ere hetty came stealthily out of the cabin or house as they usually termed that part of the ark and placed herself at his feet on a little bench that she brought with her as this movement was by no means unusual in his feebleminded child the old man paid no other attention to it than to lay his hand kindly on her head in an affectionate and approving manner an act of grace that the girl received in meek silence  after a pause of several minutes hetty began to sing her voice was low and tremulous but it was earnest and solemn the words and the tune were of the simplest form the first being a hymn that she had been taught by her mother and the last one of those natural melodies that find favor with all classes in every age coming from and being addressed to the feelings hutter never listened to this simple strain without finding his heart and manner softened facts that his daughter well knew and by which she had often profited through the sort of holy instinct that enlightens the weak of mind more especially in their aims toward good  hettys low sweet tones had not been raised many moments when the dip of the oars ceased and the holy strain arose singly on the breathing silence of the wilderness as if she gathered courage with the theme her powers appeared to increase as she proceeded and though nothing vulgar or noisy mingled in her melody its strength and melancholy tenderness grew on the ear until the air was filled with this simple homage of a soul that seemed almost spotless that the men forward were not indifferent to this touching interruption was proved by their inaction nor did their oars again dip until the last of the sweet sounds had actually died among the remarkable shores which at that witching hour would waft even the lowest modulations of the human voice more than a mile hutter was much affected for rude as he was by early habits and even ruthless as he had got to be by long exposure to the practices of the wilderness his nature was of that fearful mixture of good and evil that so generally enters into the moral composition of man  you are sad tonight child said the father whose manner and language usually assumed some of the gentleness and elevation of the civilized life he had led in youth when he thus communed with this particular child we have just escaped from enemies and ought rather to rejoice  you can never do it father said hetty in a low remonstrating manner taking his hard knotty hand into both her own you have talked long with harry march but neither of you have the heart to do it  this is going beyond your means foolish child you must have been naughty enough to have listened or you could know nothing of our talk  why should you and hurry kill peopleespecially women and children  peace girl peace we are at war and must do to our enemies as our enemies would do to us  thats not it father i heard deerslayer say how it was you must do to your enemies as you wish your enemies would do to you no man wishes his enemies to kill him  we kill our enemies in war girl lest they should kill us one side or the other must begin and them that begin first are most apt to get the victory you know nothing about these things poor hetty and had best say nothing  judith says it is wrong father and judith has sense though i have none  jude understands better than to talk to me of these matters for she has sense as you say and knows ill not bear it which would you prefer hetty to have your own scalp taken and sold to the french or that we should kill our enemies and keep them from harming us  thats not it father dont kill them nor let them kill us sell your skins and get more if you can but dont sell human blood  come come child let us talk of matters you understand are you glad to see our old friend march back again you like hurry and must know that one day he may be your brotherif not something nearer  that cant be father returned the girl after a considerable pause hurry has had one father and one mother and people never have two  so much for your weak mind hetty when jude marries her husbands father will be her father and her husbands sister her sister if she should marry hurry then he will be your brother  judith will never have hurry returned the girl mildly but positively judith dont like hurry  thats more than you can know hetty harry march is the handsomest and the strongest and the boldest young man that ever visits the lake and as jude is the greatest beauty i dont see why they shouldnt come together he has as much as promised that he will enter into this job with me on condition that ill consent  hetty began to move her body back and forth and otherwise to express mental agitation but she made no answer for more than a minute her father accustomed to her manner and suspecting no immediate cause of concern continued to smoke with the apparent phlegm which would seem to belong to that particular species of enjoyment  hurry is handsome father said hetty with a simple emphasis that she might have hesitated about using had her mind been more alive to the inferences of others  i told you so child muttered old hutter without removing the pipe from between his teeth hes the likeliest youth in these parts and jude is the likeliest young woman ive met with since her poor mother was in her best days  is it wicked to be ugly father  one might be guilty of worse thingsbut youre by no means ugly though not so comely as jude  is judith any happier for being so handsome  she may be child and she may not be but talk of other matters now for you hardly understand these poor hetty how do you like our new acquaintance deerslayer  he isnt handsome father hurry is far handsomer than deerslayer  thats true but they say he is a noted hunter his fame had reached me before i ever saw him and i did hope he would prove to be as stout a warrior as he is dexterous with the deer all men are not alike howsever child and it takes time as i know by experience to give a man a true wilderness heart  have i got a wilderness heart fatherand hurry is his heart true wilderness  you sometimes ask queer questions hetty your heart is good child and fitter for the settlements than for the woods while your reason is fitter for the woods than for the settlements  why has judith more reason than i father  heaven help thee child this is more than i can answer god gives sense and appearance and all these things and he grants them as he seeth fit dost thou wish for more sense  not i the little i have troubles me for when i think the hardest then i feel the unhappiest i dont believe thinking is good for me though i do wish i was as handsome as judith  why so poor child thy sisters beauty may cause her trouble as it caused her mother before her its no advantage hetty to be so marked for anything as to become an object of envy or to be sought after more than others  mother was good if she was handsome returned the girl the tears starting to her eyes as usually happened when she adverted to her deceased parent  old hutter if not equally affected was moody and silent at this allusion to his wife he continued smoking without appearing disposed to make any answer until his simpleminded daughter repeated her remark in a way to show that she felt uneasiness lest he might be inclined to deny her assertion then he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and laying his hand in a sort of rough kindness on the girls head he made a reply  thy mother was too good for this world he said though others might not think so her good looks did not befriend her and you have no occasion to mourn that you are not as much like her as your sister think less of beauty child and more of your duty and youll be as happy on this lake as you could be in the kings palace  i know it father but hurry says beauty is everything in a young woman  hutter made an ejaculation expressive of dissatisfaction and went forward passing through the house in order to do so hettys simple betrayal of her weakness in behalf of march gave him uneasiness on a subject concerning which he had never felt before and he determined to come to an explanation at once with his visitor for directness of speech and decision in conduct were two of the best qualities of this rude being in whom the seeds of a better education seemed to be constantly struggling upwards to be choked by the fruits of a life in which his hard struggles for subsistence and security had steeled his feelings and indurated his nature when he reached the forward end of the scow he manifested an intention to relieve deerslayer at the oar directing the latter to take his own place aft by these changes the old man and hurry were again left alone while the young hunter was transferred to the other end of the ark  hetty had disappeared when deerslayer reached his new post and for some little time he directed the course of the slowmoving craft by himself it was not long however before judith came out of the cabin as if disposed to do the honors of the place to a stranger engaged in the service of her family the starlight was sufficient to permit objects to be plainly distinguished when near at hand and the bright eyes of the girl had an expression of kindness in them when they met those of the youth that the latter was easily enabled to discover her rich hair shaded her spirited and yet soft countenance even at that hour rendering it the more beautifulas the rose is loveliest when reposing amid the shadows and contrasts of its native foliage little ceremony is used in the intercourse of the woods and judith had acquired a readiness of address by the admiration that she so generally excited which if it did not amount to forwardness certainly in no degree lent to her charms the aid of that retiring modesty on which poets love to dwell  i thought i should have killed myself with laughing deerslayer the beauty abruptly but coquettishly commenced when i saw that indian dive into the river he was a goodlooking savage too the girl always dwelt on personal beauty as a sort of merit and yet one couldnt stop to consider whether his paint would stand water  and i thought they would have killed you with their wepons judith returned deerslayer it was an awful risk for a female to run in the face of a dozen mingos  did that make you come out of the cabin in spite of their rifles too asked the girl with more real interest than she would have cared to betray though with an indifference of manner that was the result of a good deal of practice united to native readiness  men arnt apt to see females in danger and not come to their assistance even a mingo knows that  this sentiment was uttered with as much simplicity of manner as of feeling and judith rewarded it with a smile so sweet that even deerslayer who had imbibed a prejudice against the girl in consequence of hurrys suspicions of her levity felt its charm notwithstanding half its winning influence was lost in the feeble light it at once created a sort of confidence between them and the discourse was continued on the part of the hunter without the lively consciousness of the character of this coquette of the wilderness with which it had certainly commenced  you are a man of deeds and not of words i see plainly deerslayer continued the beauty taking her seat near the spot where the other stood and i foresee we shall be very good friends hurry harry has a tongue and giant as he is he talks more than he performs  march is your frind judith and frinds should be tender of each other when apart  we all know what hurrys friendship comes to let him have his own way in everything and hes the best fellow in the colony but head him off as you say of the deer and he is master of everything near him but himself hurry is no favorite of mine deerslayer and i dare say if the truth was known and his conversation about me repeated it would be found that he thinks no better of me than i own i do of him  the latter part of this speech was not uttered without uneasiness had the girls companion been more sophisticated he might have observed the averted face the manner in which the pretty little foot was agitated and other signs that for some unexplained reason the opinions of march were not quite as much a matter of indifference to her as she thought fit to pretend whether this was no more than the ordinary working of female vanity feeling keenly even when it affected not to feel at all or whether it proceeded from that deeplyseated consciousness of right and wrong which god himself has implanted in our breasts that we may know good from evil will be made more apparent to the reader as we proceed in the tale deerslayer felt embarrassed he well remembered the cruel imputations left by marchs distrust and while he did not wish to injure his associates suit by exciting resentment against him his tongue was one that literally knew no guile to answer without saying more or less than he wished was consequently a delicate duty  march has his say of all things in natur whether of frind or foe slowly and cautiously rejoined the hunter hes one of them that speak as they feel while the tongues agoing and thats sometimes different from what theyd speak if they took time to consider give me a delaware judith for one that reflects and ruminates on his idees inmity has made him thoughtful and a loose tongue is no ricommend at their council fires  i dare say marchs tongue goes free enough when it gets on the subject of judith hutter and her sister said the girl rousing herself as if in careless disdain young womens good names are a pleasant matter of discourse with some that wouldnt dare be so openmouthed if there was a brother in the way master march may find it pleasant to traduce us but sooner or later hell repent  nay judith this is taking the matter up too much in arnest hurry has never whispered a syllable agin the good name of hetty to begin with  i see how it isi see how it is impetuously interrupted judith i am the one he sees fit to scorch with his withering tongue hetty indeed poor hetty she continued her voice sinking into low husky tones that seemed nearly to stifle her in the utterance she is beyond and above his slanderous malice poor hetty if god has created her feebleminded the weakness lies altogether on the side of errors of which she seems to know nothing the earth never held a purer being than hetty hutter deerslayer  i can believe ityes i can believe that judith and i hope arnestly that the same can be said of her handsome sister  there was a soothing sincerity in the voice of deerslayer which touched the girls feelings nor did the allusion to her beauty lessen the effect with one who only knew too well the power of her personal charms nevertheless the still small voice of conscience was not hushed and it prompted the answer which she made after giving herself time to reflect  i dare say hurry had some of his vile hints about the people of the garrisons she added he knows they are gentlemen and can never forgive any one for being what he feels he can never become himself  not in the sense of a kings officer judith sartainly for march has no turn thataway but in the sense of reality why may not a beaverhunter be as respectable as a governor since you speak of it yourself ill not deny that he did complain of one as humble as you being so much in the company of scarlet coats and silken sashes but t was jealousy that brought it out of him and i do think he mourned over his own thoughts as a mother would have mourned over her child  perhaps deerslayer was not aware of the full meaning that his earnest language conveyed it is certain that he did not see the color that crimsoned the whole of judiths fine face nor detect the uncontrollable distress that immediately after changed its hue to deadly paleness a minute or two elapsed in profound stillness the splash of the water seeming to occupy all the avenues of sound and then judith arose and grasped the hand of the hunter almost convulsively with one of her own  deerslayer she said hurriedly im glad the ice is broke between us they say that sudden friendships lead to long enmities but i do not believe it will turn out so with us i know not how it isbut you are the first man i ever met who did not seem to wish to flatterto wish my ruinto be an enemy in disguisenever mind say nothing to hurry and another time well talk together again  as the girl released her grasp she vanished in the house leaving the astonished young man standing at the steeringoar as motionless as one of the pines on the hills so abstracted indeed had his thoughts become that he was hailed by hutter to keep the scows head in the right direction before he remembered his actual situation    chapter vi       so spake the apostate angel though in pain     vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair      paradise lost i  12526  shortly after the disappearance of judith a light southerly air arose and hutter set a large square sail that had once been the flying topsail of an albany sloop but which having become threadbare in catching the breezes of tappan had been condemned and sold he had a light tough spar of tamarack that he could raise on occasion and with a little contrivance his duck was spread to the wind in a sufficiently professional manner the effect on the ark was such as to supersede the necessity of rowing and in about two hours the castle was seen in the darkness rising out of the water at the distance of a hundred yards the sail was then lowered and by slow degrees the scow drifted up to the building and was secured  no one had visited the house since hurry and his companion left it the place was found in the quiet of midnight a sort of type of the solitude of a wilderness as an enemy was known to be near hutter directed his daughters to abstain from the use of lights luxuries in which they seldom indulged during the warm months lest they might prove beacons to direct their foes where they might be found  in open daylight i shouldnt fear a host of savages behind these stout logs and they without any cover to skulk into added hutter when he had explained to his guests the reasons why he forbade the use of light for ive three or four trusty weapons always loaded and killdeer in particular is a piece that never misses but its a different thing at night a canoe might get upon us unseen in the dark and the savages have so many cunning ways of attacking that i look upon it as bad enough to deal with em under a bright sun i built this dwelling in order to have em at arms length in case we should ever get to blows again some people think its too open and exposed but im for anchoring out here clear of underbrush and thickets as the surest means of making a safe berth  you was once a sailor they tell me old tom said hurry in his abrupt manner struck by one or two expressions that the other had just used and some people believe you could give us strange accounts of inimies and shipwrecks if youd a mind to come out with all you know  there are people in this world hurry returned the other evasively who live on other mens thoughts and some such often find their way into the woods what ive been or what ive seen in youth is of less matter now than what the savages are its of more account to find out what will happen in the next twentyfour hours than to talk over what happened twentyfour years since  thats judgment deerslayer yes thats sound judgment heres judith and hetty to take care of to say nothing of our own topknots and for my part i can sleep as well in the dark as i could under a noonday sun to me its no great matter whether there is light or not to see to shut my eyes by  as deerslayer seldom thought it necessary to answer his companions peculiar vein of humor and hutter was evidently indisposed to dwell longer on the subject its discussion ceased with this remark the latter had something more on his mind however than recollections his daughters had no sooner left them with an expressed intention of going to bed than he invited his two companions to follow him again into the scow here the old man opened his project keeping back the portion that he had reserved for execution by hurry and himself  the great object for people posted like ourselves is to command the water he commenced so long as there is no other craft on the lake a bark canoe is as good as a manofwar since the castle will not be easily taken by swimming now there are but five canoes remaining in these parts two of which are mine and one is hurrys these three we have with us here one being fastened in the canoedock beneath the house and the other two being alongside the scow the other canoes are housed on the shore in hollow logs and the savages who are such venomous enemies will leave no likely place unexamined in the morning if they re serious in sarch of bounties  now friend hutter interrupted hurry the indian dont live that can find a canoe that is suitably wintered ive done something at this business before now and deerslayer here knows that i am one that can hide a craft in such a way that i cant find it myself  very true hurry put in the person to whom the appeal had been made but you overlook the sarcumstance that if you couldnt see the trail of the man who did the job i could im of master hutters mind that its far wiser to mistrust a savages ingenuity than to build any great expectations on his want of eyesight if these two canoes can be got off to the castle therefore the sooner its done the better  will you be of the party thats to do it demanded hutter in a way to show that the proposal both surprised and pleased him  sartain im ready to enlist in any enterprise thats not agin a white mans lawful gifts natur orders us to defend our lives and the lives of others too when theres occasion and opportunity ill follow you floating tom into the mingo camp on such an arrnd and will strive to do my duty should we come to blows though never having been tried in battle i dont like to promise more than i may be able to perform we all know our wishes but none know their might till put to the proof  thats modest and suitable lad exclaimed hurry youve never yet heard the crack of an angry rifle and let me tell you tis as different from the persuasion of one of your venison speeches as the laugh of judith hutter in her best humor is from the scolding of a dutch house keeper on the mohawk i dont expect youll prove much of a warrior deerslayer though your equal with the bucks and the does dont exist in all these parts as for the raal sarvice however youll turn out rather rearward according to my consait  well see hurry well see returned the other meekly so far as human eye could discover not at all disturbed by these expressed doubts concerning his conduct on a point on which men are sensitive precisely in the degree that they feel the consciousness of demerit having never been tried ill wait to know before i form any opinion of myself and then therell be sartainty instead of bragging ive heard of them that was valiant afore the fight who did little in it and of them that waited to know their own tempers and found that they werent as bad as some expected when put to the proof  at any rate we know you can use a paddle young man said hutter and thats all we shall ask of you tonight let us waste no more time but get into the canoe and do in place of talking  as hutter led the way in the execution of his project the boat was soon ready with hurry and deerslayer at the paddles before the old man embarked himself however he held a conference of several minutes with judith entering the house for that purpose then returning he took his place in the canoe which left the side of the ark at the next instant  had there been a temple reared to god in that solitary wilderness its clock would have told the hour of midnight as the party set forth on their expedition the darkness had increased though the night was still clear and the light of the stars sufficed for all the purposes of the adventurers hutter alone knew the places where the canoes were hid and he directed the course while his two athletic companions raised and dipped their paddles with proper caution lest the sound should be carried to the ears of their enemies across that sheet of placid water in the stillness of deep night but the bark was too light to require any extraordinary efforts and skill supplying the place of strength in about half an hour they were approaching the shore at a point near a league from the castle  lay on your paddles men said hutter in a low voice and let us look about us for a moment we must now be all eyes and ears for these vermin have noses like bloodhounds  the shores of the lake were examined closely in order to discover any glimmering of light that might have been left in a camp and the men strained their eyes in the obscurity to see if some thread of smoke was not still stealing along the mountainside as it arose from the dying embers of a fire nothing unusual could be traced and as the position was at some distance from the outlet or the spot where the savages had been met it was thought safe to land the paddles were plied again and the bows of the canoe ground upon the gravelly beach with a gentle motion and a sound barely audible hutter and hurry immediately landed the former carrying his own and his friends rifle leaving deerslayer in charge of the canoe the hollow log lay a little distance up the side of the mountain and the old man led the way towards it using so much caution as to stop at every third or fourth step to listen if any tread betrayed the presence of a foe the same deathlike stillness however reigned on the midnight scene and the desired place was reached without an occurrence to induce alarm  this is it whispered hutter laying a foot on the trunk of a fallen linden hand me the paddles first and draw the boat out with care for the wretches may have left it for a bait after all  keep my rifle handy butt towards me old fellow answered march if they attack me loaded i shall want to unload the piece at em at least and feel if the pan is full  alls right muttered the other move slow when you get your load and let me lead the way  the canoe was drawn out of the log with the utmost care raised by hurry to his shoulder and the two began to return to the shore moving but a step at a time lest they should tumble down the steep declivity the distance was not great but the descent was extremely difficult and towards the end of their little journey deerslayer was obliged to land and meet them in order to aid in lifting the canoe through the bushes with his assistance the task was successfully accomplished and the light craft soon floated by the side of the other canoe this was no sooner done than all three turned anxiously towards the forest and the mountain expecting an enemy to break out of the one or to come rushing down the other still the silence was unbroken and they all embarked with the caution that had been used in coming ashore  hutter now steered broad off towards the centre of the lake having got a sufficient distance from the shore he cast his prize loose knowing that it would drift slowly up the lake before the light southerly air and intending to find it on his return thus relieved of his tow the old man held his way down the lake steering towards the very point where hurry had made his fruitless attempt on the life of the deer as the distance from this point to the outlet was less than a mile it was like entering an enemys country and redoubled caution became necessary they reached the extremity of the point however and landed in safety on the little gravelly beach already mentioned unlike the last place at which they had gone ashore here was no acclivity to ascend the mountains looming up in the darkness quite a quarter of a mile farther west leaving a margin of level ground between them and the strand the point itself though long and covered with tall trees was nearly flat and for some distance only a few yards in width hutter and hurry landed as before leaving their companion in charge of the boat  in this instance the dead tree that contained the canoe of which they had come in quest lay about halfway between the extremity of the narrow slip of land and the place where it joined the main shore and knowing that there was water so near him on his left the old man led the way along the eastern side of the belt with some confidence walking boldly though still with caution he had landed at the point expressly to get a glimpse into the bay and to make certain that the coast was clear otherwise he would have come ashore directly abreast of the hollow tree there was no difficulty in finding the latter from which the canoe was drawn as before and instead of carrying it down to the place where deerslayer lay it was launched at the nearest favorable spot as soon as it was in the water hurry entered it and paddled round to the point whither hutter also proceeded following the beach as the three men had now in their possession all the boats on the lake their confidence was greatly increased and there was no longer the same feverish desire to quit the shore or the same necessity for extreme caution their position on the extremity of the long narrow bit of land added to the feeling of security as it permitted an enemy to approach in only one direction that in their front and under circumstances that would render discovery with their habitual vigilance almost certain the three now landed together and stood grouped in consultation on the gravelly point  weve fairly treed the scamps said hurry chuckling at their success if they wish to visit the castle let em wade or swim old tom that idee of yourn in burrowing out in the lake was high proof and carries a fine bead there be men who would think the land safer than the water but after all reason shows it isnt the beaver and rats and other larned creaturs taking to the last when hard pressed i call our position now entrenched and set the canadas at defiance  let us paddle along this south shore said hutter and see if theres no sign of an encampment but first let me have a better look into the bay for no one has been far enough round the inner shore of the point to make suit of that quarter yet  as hutter ceased speaking all three moved in the direction he had named scarce had they fairly opened the bottom of the bay when a general start proved that their eyes had lighted on a common object at the same instant it was no more than a dying brand giving out its flickering and failing light but at that hour and in that place it was at once as conspicuous as a good deed in a naughty world there was not a shadow of doubt that this fire had been kindled at an encampment of the indians the situation sheltered from observation on all sides but one and even on that except for a very short distance proved that more care had been taken to conceal the spot than would be used for ordinary purposes and hutter who knew that a spring was near at hand as well as one of the best fishingstations on the lake immediately inferred that this encampment contained the women and children of the party  thats not a warriors encampment he growled to hurry and theres bounty enough sleeping round that fire to make a heavy division of headmoney send the lad to the canoes for therell come no good of him in such an onset and let us take the matter in hand at once like men  theres judgment in your notion old tom and i like it to the backbone deerslayer do you get into the canoe lad and paddle off into the lake with the spare one and set it adrift as we did with the other after which you can float along shore as near as you can get to the head of the bay keeping outside the point howsever and outside the rushes too you can hear us when we want you and if theres any delay ill call like a loonyes thatll do itthe call of a loon shall be the signal if you hear rifles and feel like sogering why you may close in and see if you can make the same hand with the savages that you do with the deer  if my wishes could be followed this matter would not be undertaken hurry  quite truenobody denies it boy but your wishes cant be followed and that inds the matter so just canoe yourself off into the middle of the lake and by the time you get back therell be movements in that camp  the young man set about complying with great reluctance and a heavy heart he knew the prejudices of the frontiermen too well however to attempt a remonstrance the latter indeed under the circumstances might prove dangerous as it would certainly prove useless he paddled the canoe therefore silently and with the former caution to a spot near the centre of the placid sheet of water and set the boat just recovered adrift to float towards the castle before the light southerly air this expedient had been adopted in both cases under the certainty that the drift could not carry the light barks more than a league or two before the return of light when they might easily be overtaken in order to prevent any wandering savage from using them by swimming off and getting possession a possible but scarcely a probable event all the paddles were retained  no sooner had he set the recovered canoe adrift than deerslayer turned the bows of his own towards the point on the shore that had been indicated by hurry so light was the movement of the little craft and so steady the sweep of its masters arm that ten minutes had not elapsed ere it was again approaching the land having in that brief time passed over fully half a mile of distance as soon as deerslayers eye caught a glimpse of the rushes of which there were many growing in the water a hundred feet from the shore he arrested the motion of the canoe and anchored his boat by holding fast to the delicate but tenacious stem of one of the drooping plants here he remained awaiting with an intensity of suspense that can be easily imagined the result of the hazardous enterprise  it would be difficult to convey to the minds of those who have never witnessed it the sublimity that characterizes the silence of a solitude as deep as that which now reigned over the glimmerglass in the present instance this sublimity was increased by the gloom of night which threw its shadowy and fantastic forms around the lake the forest and the hills it is not easy indeed to conceive of any place more favorable to heighten these natural impressions than that deerslayer now occupied the size of the lake brought all within the reach of human senses while it displayed so much of the imposing scene at a single view giving up as it might be at a glance a sufficiency to produce the deepest impressions as has been said this was the first lake deerslayer had ever seen hitherto his experience had been limited to the courses of rivers and smaller streams and never before had he seen so much of that wilderness which he so well loved spread before his gaze accustomed to the forest however his mind was capable of portraying all its hidden mysteries as he looked upon its leafy surface this was also the first time he had been on a trail where human lives depended on the issue his ears had often drunk in the traditions of frontier warfare but he had never yet been confronted with an enemy  the reader will readily understand therefore how intense must have been the expectation of the young man as he sat in his solitary canoe endeavoring to catch the smallest sound that might denote the course of things on shore his training had been perfect so far as theory could go and his selfpossession notwithstanding the high excitement that was the fruit of novelty would have done credit to a veteran the visible evidences of the existence of the camp or of the fire could not be detected from the spot where the canoe lay and he was compelled to depend on the sense of hearing alone he did not feel impatient for the lessons he had heard taught him the virtue of patience and most of all inculcated the necessity of wariness in conducting any covert assault on the indians once he thought he heard the cracking of a dried twig but expectation was so intense it might mislead him in this manner minute after minute passed until the whole time since he left his companions was extended to quite an hour deerslayer knew not whether to rejoice in or to mourn over this cautious delay for if it augured security to his associates it foretold destruction to the feeble and innocent  it might have been an hour and a half after his companions and he had parted when deerslayer was aroused by a sound that filled him equally with concern and surprise the quavering call of a loon arose from the opposite side of the lake evidently at no great distance from its outlet there was no mistaking the note of this bird which is so familiar to all who know the sounds of the american lakes shrill tremulous loud and sufficiently prolonged it seems the very cry of warning it is often raised also at night an exception to the habits of most of the other feathered inmates of the wilderness a circumstance which had induced hurry to select it as his own signal there had been sufficient time certainly for the two adventurers to make their way by land from the point where they had been left to that whence the call had come but it was not probable that they would adopt such a course had the camp been deserted they would have summoned deerslayer to the shore and did it prove to be peopled there could be no sufficient motive for circling it in order to reembark at so great a distance should he obey the signal and be drawn away from the landing the lives of those who depended on him might be the forfeitand should he neglect the call on the supposition that it had been really made the consequences might be equally disastrous though from a different cause in this indecision he waited trusting that the call whether feigned or natural would be speedily renewed nor was he mistaken a very few minutes elapsed before the same shrill warning cry was repeated and from the same part of the lake this time being on the alert his senses were not deceived although he had often heard admirable imitations of this bird and was no mean adept himself in raising its notes he felt satisfied that hurry to whose efforts in that way he had attended could never so completely and closely follow nature he determined therefore to disregard that cry and to wait for one less perfect and nearer at hand  deerslayer had hardly come to this determination when the profound stillness of night and solitude was broken by a cry so startling as to drive all recollection of the more melancholy call of the loon from the listeners mind it was a shriek of agony that came either from one of the female sex or from a boy so young as not yet to have attained a manly voice this appeal could not be mistaken heart rending terrorif not writhing agonywas in the sounds and the anguish that had awakened them was as sudden as it was fearful the young man released his hold of the rush and dashed his paddle into the water to do he knew not whatto steer he knew not whither a very few moments however removed his indecision the breaking of branches the cracking of dried sticks and the fall of feet were distinctly audible the sounds appearing to approach the water though in a direction that led diagonally towards the shore and a little farther north than the spot that deerslayer had been ordered to keep near following this clue the young man urged the canoe ahead paying but little attention to the manner in which he might betray its presence he had reached a part of the shore where its immediate bank was tolerably high and quite steep men were evidently threshing through the bushes and trees on the summit of this bank following the line of the shore as if those who fled sought a favorable place for descending just at this instant five or six rifles flashed and the opposite hills gave back as usual the sharp reports in prolonged rolling echoes one or two shrieks like those which escape the bravest when suddenly overcome by unexpected anguish and alarm followed and then the threshing among the bushes was renewed in a way to show that man was grappling with man  slippery devil shouted hurry with the fury of disappointmenthis skins greased i shant grapple take that for your cunning  the words were followed by the fall of some heavy object among the smaller trees that fringed the bank appearing to deerslayer as if his gigantic associate had hurled an enemy from him in this unceremonious manner again the flight and pursuit were renewed and then the young man saw a human form break down the hill and rush several yards into the water at this critical moment the canoe was just near enough to the spot to allow this movement which was accompanied by no little noise to be seen and feeling that there he must take in his companion if anywhere deerslayer urged the canoe forward to the rescue his paddle had not been raised twice when the voice of hurry was heard filling the air with imprecations and he rolled on the narrow beach literally loaded down with enemies while prostrate and almost smothered with his foes the athletic frontierman gave his looncall in a manner that would have excited laughter under circumstances less terrific the figure in the water seemed suddenly to repent his own flight and rushed to the shore to aid his companion but was met and immediately overpowered by half a dozen fresh pursuers who just then came leaping down the bank  let up you painted riptyleslet up cried hurry too hard pressed to be particular about the terms he used isnt it enough that i am withed like a sawlog that ye must choke too  this speech satisfied deerslayer that his friends were prisoners and that to land would be to share their fate he was already within a hundred feet of the shore when a few timely strokes of the paddle not only arrested his advance but forced him off to six or eight times that distance from his enemies luckily for him all of the indians had dropped their rifles in the pursuit or this retreat might not have been effected with impunity though no one had noted the canoe in the first confusion of the melee  keep off the land lad called out hutter the girls depend only on you now you will want all your caution to escape these savages keep off and god prosper you as you aid my children  there was little sympathy in general between hutter and the young man but the bodily and mental anguish with which this appeal was made served at the moment to conceal from the latter the formers faults he saw only the father in his sufferings and resolved at once to give a pledge of fidelity to its interests and to be faithful to his word  put your heart at ease master hutter he called out the gals shall be looked to as well as the castle the inimy has got the shore tis no use to deny but he hasnt got the water providence has the charge of all and no one can say what will come of it but if goodwill can sarve you and yourn depend on that much my experence is small but my will is good  ay ay deerslayer returned hurry in this stentorian voice which was losing some of its heartiness notwithstandingay ay deerslayer you mean well enough but what can you do youre no great matter in the best of times and such a person is not likely to turn out a miracle in the worst if theres one savage on this lake shore theres forty and thats an army you arnt the man to overcome the best way in my judgment will be to make a straight course to the castle get the gals into the canoe with a few eatables then strike off for the corner of the lake where we came in and take the best trail for the mohawk these devils wont know where to look for you for some hours and if they did and went off hot in the pursuit they must turn either the foot or the head of the lake to get at you thats my judgment in the matter and if old tom here wishes to make his last will and testament in a manner favorable to his darters hell say the same  twill never do young man rejoined hutter the enemy has scouts out at this moment looking for canoes and youll be seen and taken trust to the castle and above all things keep clear of the land hold out a week and parties from the garrisons will drive the savages off  twont be fourandtwenty hours old fellow afore these foxes will be rafting off to storm your castle interrupted hurry with more of the heat of argument than might be expected from a man who was bound and a captive and about whom nothing could be called free but his opinions and his tongue your advice has a stout sound but it will have a fatal tarmination if you or i was in the house we might hold out a few days but remember that this lad has never seen an inimy afore tonight and is what you yourself called settlementconscienced though for my part i think the consciences in the settlements pretty much the same as they are out here in the woods these savages are making signs deerslayer for me to encourage you to come ashore with the canoe but that ill never do as its agin reason and natur as for old tom and myself whether theyll scalp us tonight keep us for the torture by fire or carry us to canada is more than any one knows but the devil that advises them how to act ive such a big and bushy head that its quite likely theyll indivor to get two scalps off it for the bounty is a tempting thing or old tom and i wouldnt be in this scrape aythere they go with their signs agin but if i advise you to land may they eat me as well as roast me no no deerslayerdo you keep off where you are and after daylight on no account come within two hundred yards  this injunction of hurrys was stopped by a hand being rudely slapped against his mouth the certain sign that some one in the party sufficiently understood english to have at length detected the drift of his discourse immediately after the whole group entered the forest hutter and hurry apparently making no resistance to the movement just as the sounds of the cracking bushes were ceasing however the voice of the father was again heard  as youre true to my children god prosper you young man were the words that reached deerslayers ears after which he found himself left to follow the dictates of his own discretion  several minutes elapsed in deathlike stillness when the party on the shore had disappeared in the woods owing to the distancerather more than two hundred yardsand the obscurity deerslayer had been able barely to distinguish the group and to see it retiring but even this dim connection with human forms gave an animation to the scene that was strongly in contrast to the absolute solitude that remained although the young man leaned forward to listen holding his breath and condensing every faculty in the single sense of hearing not another sound reached his ears to denote the vicinity of human beings it seemed as if a silence that had never been broken reigned on the spot again and for an instant even that piercing shriek which had so lately broken the stillness of the forest or the execrations of march would have been a relief to the feeling of desertion to which it gave rise  this paralysis of mind and body however could not last long in one constituted mentally and physically like deerslayer dropping his paddle into the water he turned the head of the canoe and proceeded slowly as one walks who thinks intently towards the centre of the lake when he believed himself to have reached a point in a line with that where he had set the last canoe adrift he changed his direction northward keeping the light air as nearly on his back as possible after paddling a quarter of a mile in this direction a dark object became visible on the lake a little to the right and turning on one side for the purpose he had soon secured his lost prize to his own boat deerslayer now examined the heavens the course of the air and the position of the two canoes finding nothing in either to induce a change of plan he lay down and prepared to catch a few hours sleep that the morrow might find him equal to its exigencies  although the hardy and the tired sleep profoundly even in scenes of danger it was some time before deerslayer lost his recollection his mind dwelt on what had passed and his halfconscious faculties kept figuring the events of the night in a sort of waking dream suddenly he was up and alert for he fancied he heard the preconcerted signal of hurry summoning him to the shore but all was still as the grave again the canoes were slowly drifting northward the thoughtful stars were glimmering in their mild glory over his head and the forestbound sheet of water lay embedded between its mountains as calm and melancholy as if never troubled by the winds or brightened by a noonday sun once more the loon raised his tremulous cry near the foot of the lake and the mystery of the alarm was explained deerslayer adjusted his hard pillow stretched his form in the bottom of the canoe and slept    chapter vii       clear placid leman i thy contrasted lake     with the wild world i dwelt in is a thing     which warns me with its stillness to forsake     earths troubled waters for a purer spring     this quiet sail is as a noiseless wing     to waft me from distraction once i loved     torn oceans roar but thy soft murmuring     sounds sweet as if a sisters voice reproved     that i with stern delights should eer have been so moved      byron  day had fairly dawned before the young man whom we have left in the situation described in the last chapter again opened his eyes this was no sooner done than he started up and looked about him with the eagerness of one who suddenly felt the importance of accurately ascertaining his precise position his rest had been deep and undisturbed and when he awoke it was with a clearness of intellect and a readiness of resources that were very much needed at that particular moment the sun had not risen it is true but the vault of heaven was rich with the winning softness that brings and shuts the day while the whole air was filled with the carols of birds the hymns of the feathered tribe these sounds first told deerslayer the risks he ran the air for wind it could scarce be called was still light it is true but it had increased a little in the course of the night and as the canoes were feathers on the water they had drifted twice the expected distance and what was still more dangerous had approached so near the base of the mountain that here rose precipitously from the eastern shore as to render the carols of the birds plainly audible this was not the worst the third canoe had taken the same direction and was slowly drifting towards a point where it must inevitably touch unless turned aside by a shift of wind or human hands in other respects nothing presented itself to attract attention or to awaken alarm the castle stood on its shoal nearly abreast of the canoes for the drift had amounted to miles in the course of the night and the ark lay fastened to its piles as both had been left so many hours before  as a matter of course deerslayers attention was first given to the canoe ahead it was already quite near the point and a very few strokes of the paddle sufficed to tell him that it must touch before he could possibly overtake it just at this moment too the wind inopportunely freshened rendering the drift of the light craft much more rapid than certain feeling the impossibility of preventing a contact with the land the young man wisely determined not to heat himself with unnecessary exertions but first looking to the priming of his piece he proceeded slowly and warily towards the point taking care to make a little circuit that he might be exposed on only one side as he approached  the canoe adrift being directed by no such intelligence pursued its proper way and grounded on a small sunken rock at the distance of three or four yards from the shore just at that moment deerslayer had got abreast of the point and turned the bows of his own boat to the land first casting loose his tow that his movements might be unencumbered the canoe hung an instant to the rock then it rose a hairs breadth on an almost imperceptible swell of the water swung round floated clear and reached the strand all this the young man noted but it neither quickened his pulses nor hastened his hand if any one had been lying in wait for the arrival of the waif he must be seen and the utmost caution in approaching the shore became indispensable if no one was in ambush hurry was unnecessary the point being nearly diagonally opposite to the indian encampment he hoped the last though the former was not only possible but probable for the savages were prompt in adopting all the expedients of their particular modes of warfare and quite likely had many scouts searching the shores for craft to carry them off to the castle as a glance at the lake from any height or projection would expose the smallest object on its surface there was little hope that either of the canoes would pass unseen and indian sagacity needed no instruction to tell which way a boat or a log would drift when the direction of the wind was known as deerslayer drew nearer and nearer to the land the stroke of his paddle grew slower his eye became more watchful and his ears and nostrils almost dilated with the effort to detect any lurking danger it was a trying moment for a novice nor was there the encouragement which even the timid sometimes feel when conscious of being observed and commended he was entirely alone thrown on his own resources and was cheered by no friendly eye emboldened by no encouraging voice notwithstanding all these circumstances the most experienced veteran in forest warfare could not have behaved better equally free from recklessness and hesitation his advance was marked by a sort of philosophical prudence that appeared to render him superior to all motives but those which were best calculated to effect his purpose such was the commencement of a career in forest exploits that afterwards rendered this man in his way and under the limits of his habits and opportunities as renowned as many a hero whose name has adorned the pages of works more celebrated than legends simple as ours can ever become  when about a hundred yards from the shore deerslayer rose in the canoe gave three or four vigorous strokes with the paddle sufficient of themselves to impel the bark to land and then quickly laying aside the instrument of labor he seized that of war he was in the very act of raising the rifle when a sharp report was followed by the buzz of a bullet that passed so near his body as to cause him involuntarily to start the next instant deerslayer staggered and fell his whole length in the bottom of the canoe a yellit came from a single voicefollowed and an indian leaped from the bushes upon the open area of the point bounding towards the canoe this was the moment the young man desired he rose on the instant and levelled his own rifle at his uncovered foe but his finger hesitated about pulling the trigger on one whom he held at such a disadvantage this little delay probably saved the life of the indian who bounded back into the cover as swiftly as he had broken out of it in the meantime deerslayer had been swiftly approaching the land and his own canoe reached the point just as his enemy disappeared as its movements had not been directed it touched the shore a few yards from the other boat and though the rifle of his foe had to be loaded there was not time to secure his prize and carry it beyond danger before he would be exposed to another shot under the circumstances therefore he did not pause an instant but dashed into the woods and sought a cover  on the immediate point there was a small open area partly in native grass and partly beach but a dense fringe of bushes lined its upper side this narrow belt of dwarf vegetation passed one issued immediately into the high and gloomy vaults of the forest the land was tolerably level for a few hundred feet and then it rose precipitously in a mountainside the trees were tall large and so free from underbrush that they resembled vast columns irregularly scattered upholding a dome of leaves although they stood tolerably close together for their ages and size the eye could penetrate to considerable distances and bodies of men even might have engaged beneath their cover with concert and intelligence  deerslayer knew that his adversary must be employed in reloading unless he had fled the former proved to be the case for the young man had no sooner placed himself behind a tree than he caught a glimpse of the arm of the indian his body being concealed by an oak in the very act of forcing the leathered bullet home nothing would have been easier than to spring forward and decide the affair by a close assault on his unprepared foe but every feeling of deerslayer revolted at such a step although his own life had just been attempted from a cover he was yet unpracticed in the ruthless expedients of savage warfare of which he knew nothing except by tradition and theory and it struck him as unfair advantage to assail an unarmed foe his color had heightened his eye frowned his lips were compressed and all his energies were collected and ready but instead of advancing to fire he dropped his rifle to the usual position of a sportsman in readiness to catch his aim and muttered to himself unconscious that he was speaking  no nothat may be redskin warfare but its not a christians gifts let the miscreant charge and then well take it out like men for the canoe he must not and shall not have no no let him have time to load and god will take care of the right  all this time the indian had been so intent on his own movements that he was even ignorant that his enemy was in the woods his only apprehension was that the canoe would be recovered and carried away before he might be in readiness to prevent it he had sought the cover from habit but was within a few feet of the fringe of bushes and could be at the margin of the forest in readiness to fire in a moment the distance between him and his enemy was about fifty yards and the trees were so arranged by nature that the line of sight was not interrupted except by the particular trees behind which each party stood  his rifle was no sooner loaded than the savage glanced around him and advanced incautiously as regarded the real but stealthily as respected the fancied position of his enemy until he was fairly exposed then deerslayer stepped from behind its own cover and hailed him  thisaway redskin thisaway if youre looking for me he called out im young in war but not so young as to stand on an open beach to be shot down like an owl by daylight it rests on yourself whether its peace or war atween us for my gifts are white gifts and im not one of them that thinks it valiant to slay human mortals singly in the woods  the savage was a good deal startled by this sudden discovery of the danger he ran he had a little knowledge of english however and caught the drift of the others meaning he was also too well schooled to betray alarm but dropping the butt of his rifle to the earth with an air of confidence he made a gesture of lofty courtesy all this was done with the ease and selfpossession of one accustomed to consider no man his superior in the midst of this consummate acting however the volcano that raged within caused his eyes to glare and his nostrils to dilate like those of some wild beast that is suddenly prevented from taking the fatal leap  two canoes he said in the deep guttural tones of his race holding up the number of fingers he mentioned by way of preventing mistakes one for youone for me  no no mingo that will never do you own neither and neither shall you have as long as i can prevent it i know its war atween your people and mine but thats no reason why human mortals should slay each other like savage creaturs that meet in the woods go your way then and leave me to go mine the world is large enough for us both and when we meet fairly in battle why the lord will order the fate of each of us  good exclaimed the indian my brother missionarygreat talk all about manitou  not sonot so warrior im not good enough for the moravians and am too good for most of the other vagabonds that preach about in the woods no no im only a hunter as yet though afore the peace is made tis like enough therell be occasion to strike a blow at some of your people still i wish it to be done in fair fight and not in a quarrel about the ownership of a miserable canoe  good my brother very youngbut he is very wise little warriorgreat talker chief sometimes in council  i dont know this nor do i say it injin returned deerslayer coloring a little at the illconcealed sarcasm of the others manner i look forward to a life in the woods and i only hope it may be a peaceable one all young men must go on the warpath when theres occasion but war isnt needfully massacre ive seen enough of the last this very night to know that providence frowns on it and i now invite you to go your own way while i go mine and hope that we may part frinds  good my brother has two scalpgray hair under other old wisdomyoung tongue  here the savage advanced with confidence his hand extended his face smiling and his whole bearing denoting amity and respect deerslayer met his offered friendship in a proper spirit and they shook hands cordially each endeavoring to assure the other of his sincerity and desire to be at peace  all have his own said the indian my canoe mine your canoe yourn go look if yourn you keep if mine i keep  thats just redskin thought you must be wrong in thinking the canoe your property howsever seein is believin and well go down to the shore where you may look with your own eyes for its likely youll object to trustin altogether to mine  the indian uttered his favorite exclamation of good and then they walked side by side towards the shore there was no apparent distrust in the manner of either the indian moving in advance as if he wished to show his companion that he did not fear turning his back to him as they reached the open ground the former pointed towards deerslayers boat and said emphaticallyno minepaleface canoe this red mans no want other mans canoewant his own  youre wrong redskin youre altogether wrong this canoe was left in old hutters keeping and is hisn according to law red or white till its owner comes to claim it heres the seats and the stitching of the bark to speak for themselves no man ever knowd an injin to turn off such work  good my brother little oldbig wisdom injin no make him white mans work  im glad you think so for holding out to the contrary might have made ill blood atween us every one having a right to take possession of his own ill just shove the canoe out of reach of dispute at once as the quickest way of settling difficulties  while deerslayer was speaking he put a foot against the end of the light boat and giving a vigorous shove he sent it out into the lake a hundred feet or more where taking the true current it would necessarily float past the point and be in no further danger of coming ashore the savage started at this ready and decided expedient and his companion saw that he cast a hurried and fierce glance at his own canoe or that which contained the paddles the change of manner however was but momentary and then the iroquois resumed his air of friendliness and a smile of satisfaction  good he repeated with stronger emphasis than ever young head old mind know how to settle quarrel farewell brother he go to house in watermuskrat houseinjin go to camp tell chiefs no find canoe  deerslayer was not sorry to hear this proposal for he felt anxious to join the females and he took the offered hand of the indian very willingly the parting words were friendly and while the red man walked calmly towards the wood with the rifle in the hollow of his arm without once looking back in uneasiness or distrust the white man moved towards the remaining canoe carrying his piece in the same pacific manner it is true but keeping his eye fastened on the movements of the other this distrust however seemed to be altogether uncalled for and as if ashamed to have entertained it the young man averted his look and stepped carelessly up to his boat here he began to push the canoe from the shore and to make his other preparations for departing he might have been thus employed a minute when happening to turn his face towards the land his quick and certain eye told him at a glance the imminent jeopardy in which his life was placed the black ferocious eyes of the savage were glancing on him like those of the crouching tiger through a small opening in the bushes and the muzzle of his rifle seemed already to be opening in a line with his own body  then indeed the long practice of deerslayer as a hunter did him good service accustomed to fire with the deer on the bound and often when the precise position of the animals body had in a manner to be guessed at he used the same expedients here to cock and poise his rifle were the acts of a single moment and a single motion then aiming almost without sighting he fired into the bushes where he knew a body ought to be in order to sustain the appalling countenance which alone was visible there was not time to raise the piece any higher or to take a more deliberate aim so rapid were his movements that both parties discharged their pieces at the same instant the concussions mingling in one report the mountains indeed gave back but a single echo deerslayer dropped his piece and stood with head erect steady as one of the pines in the calm of a june morning watching the result while the savage gave the yell that has become historical for its appalling influence leaped through the bushes and came bounding across the open ground flourishing a tomahawk still deerslayer moved not but stood with his unloaded rifle fallen against his shoulders while with a hunters habits his hands were mechanically feeling for the powderhorn and charger when about forty feet from his enemy the savage hurled his keen weapon but it was with an eye so vacant and a hand so unsteady and feeble that the young man caught it by the handle as it was flying past him at that instant the indian staggered and fell his whole length on the ground  i knowd iti knowd it exclaimed deerslayer who was already preparing to force a fresh bullet into his rifle i knowd it must come to this as soon as i had got the range from the creaturs eyes a man sights suddenly and fires quick when his own lifes in danger yes i knowd it would come to this i was about the hundredth part of a second too quick for him or it might have been bad for me the riptyles bullet has just grazed my sidebut say what you will for or agin em a redskin is by no means as sartain with powder and ball as a white man their gifts dont seem to lie that a way even chingachgook great as he is in other matters isnt downright deadly with the rifle  by this time the piece was reloaded and deerslayer after tossing the tomahawk into the canoe advanced to his victim and stood over him leaning on his rifle in melancholy attention it was the first instance in which he had seen a man fall in battleit was the first fellowcreature against whom he had ever seriously raised his own hand the sensations were novel and regret with the freshness of our better feelings mingled with his triumph the indian was not dead though shot directly through the body he lay on his back motionless but his eyes now full of consciousness watched each action of his victoras the fallen bird regards the fowlerjealous of every movement the man probably expected the fatal blow which was to precede the loss of his scalp or perhaps he anticipated that this latter act of cruelty would precede his death deerslayer read his thoughts and he found a melancholy satisfaction in relieving the apprehensions of the helpless savage  no no redskin he said youve nothing more to fear from me i am of a christian stock and scalping is not of my gifts ill just make sartain of your rifle and then come back and do you what sarvice i can though here i cant stay much longer as the crack of three rifles will be apt to bring some of your devils down upon me  the close of this was said in a sort of a soliloquy as the young man went in quest of the fallen rifle the piece was found where its owner had dropped it and was immediately put into the canoe laying his own rifle at its side deerslayer then returned and stood over the indian again  all inmity atween you and mes at an ind redskin he said and you may set your heart at rest on the score of the scalp or any further injury my gifts are white as ive told you and i hope my conduct will be white also  could looks have conveyed all they meant it is probable deerslayers innocent vanity on the subject of color would have been rebuked a little but he comprehended the gratitude that was expressed in the eyes of the dying savage without in the least detecting the bitter sarcasm that struggled with the better feeling  water ejaculated the thirsty and unfortunate creature give poor injin water  ay water you shall have if you drink the lake dry ill just carry you down to it that you may take your fill this is the way they tell me with all wounded peoplewater is their greatest comfort and delight  so saying deerslayer raised the indian in his arms and carried him to the lake here he first helped him to take an attitude in which he could appease his burning thirst after which he seated himself on a stone and took the head of his wounded adversary in his own lap and endeavored to soothe his anguish in the best manner he could  it would be sinful in me to tell you your time hadnt come warrior he commenced and therefore ill not say it youve passed the middle age already and considerin the sort of lives ye lead your days have been pretty well filled the principal thing now is to look forward to what comes next neither redskin nor paleface on the whole calculates much on sleepin forever but both expect to live in another world each has his gifts and will be judged by em and i suppose youve thought these matters over enough not to stand in need of sarmons when the trial comes youll find your happy huntinggrounds if youve been a just injin if an onjust youll meet your desarts in another way ive my own idees about these things but youre too old and experenced to need any explanations from one as young as i  good ejaculated the indian whose voice retained its depth even as life ebbed away young headold wisdom  its sometimes a consolation when the ind comes to know that them weve harmed or tried to harm forgive us i suppose natur seeks this relief by way of getting a pardon on arth as we never can know whether he pardons who is all in all till judgment itself comes its soothing to know that any pardon at such times and that i conclude is the secret now as for myself i overlook altogether your designs agin my life first because no harm came of em next because its your gifts and natur and trainin and i ought not to have trusted you at all and finally and chiefly because i can bear no illwill to a dying man whether heathen or christian so put your heart at ease so far as im consarned you know best what other matters ought to trouble you or what ought to give you satisfaction in so trying a moment  it is probable that the indian had some of the fearful glimpses of the unknown state of being which god in mercy seems at times to afford to all the human race but they were necessarily in conformity with his habits and prejudices like most of his people and like too many of our own he thought more of dying in a way to gain applause among those he left than to secure a better state of existence hereafter while deerslayer was speaking his mind was a little bewildered though he felt that the intention was good and when he had done a regret passed over his spirit that none of his own tribe were present to witness his stoicism under extreme bodily suffering and the firmness with which he met his end with the high innate courtesy that so often distinguishes the indian warrior before he becomes corrupted by too much intercourse with the worst class of the white men he endeavored to express his thankfulness for the others good intentions and to let him understand that they were appreciated  good he repeated for this was an english word much used by the savages good young head young heart too old heart tough no shed tear hear indian when he die and no want to liewhat he call him  deerslayer is the name i bear now though the delawares have said that when i get back from this warpath i shall have a more manly title provided i can arn one  that good name for boypoor name for warrior he get better quick no fear therethe savage had strength sufficient under the strong excitement he felt to raise a hand and tap the young man on his breasteye sartainfinger lightningaim deathgreat warrior soon no deerslayerhawkeyehawkeyehawkeye shake hand  deerslayeror hawkeye as the youth was then first named for in after years he bore the appellation throughout all that regiondeerslayer took the hand of the savage whose last breath was drawn in that attitude gazing in admiration at the countenance of a stranger who had shown so much readiness skill and firmness in a scene that was equally trying and novel when the reader remembers it is the highest gratification an indian can receive to see his enemy betray weakness he will be better able to appreciate the conduct which had extorted so great a concession at such a moment  his spirit has fled said deerslayer in a suppressed melancholy voice ahs me well to this we must all come sooner or later and he is happiest let his skin be what color it may who is best fitted to meet it here lies the body of no doubt a brave warrior and the soul is already flying towards its heaven or hell whether that be a happy hunting ground a place scant of game regions of glory according to moravian doctrine or flames of fire so it happens too as regards other matters here have old hutter and hurry harry got themselves into difficulty if they havent got themselves into torment and death and all for a bounty that luck offers to me in what many would think a lawful and suitable manner but not a farthing of such money shall cross my hand white i was born and white will i die clinging to color to the last even though the kings majesty his governors and all his councils both at home and in the colonies forget from what they come and where they hope to go and all for a little advantage in warfare no no warrior hand of mine shall never molest your scalp and so your soul may rest in peace on the pint of making a decent appearance when the body comes to join it in your own land of spirits  deerslayer arose as soon as he had spoken then he placed the body of the dead man in a sitting posture with its back against the little rock taking the necessary care to prevent it from falling or in any way settling into an attitude that might be thought unseemly by the sensitive though wild notions of a savage when this duty was performed the young man stood gazing at the grim countenance of his fallen foe in a sort of melancholy abstraction as was his practice however a habit gained by living so much alone in the forest he then began again to give utterance to his thoughts and feelings aloud  i didnt wish your life redskin he said but you left me no choice atween killing or being killed each party acted according to his gifts i suppose and blame can light on neither you were treacherous according to your natur in war and i was a little oversightful as im apt to be in trusting others well this is my first battle with a human mortal though its not likely to be the last i have fout most of the creaturs of the forest such as bears wolves painters and catamounts but this is the beginning with the redskins if i was injin born now i might tell of this or carry in the scalp and boast of the explite afore the whole tribe or if my inimy had only been even a bear twould have been natral and proper to let everybody know what had happened but i dont well see how im to let even chingachgook into this secret so long as it can be done only by boasting with a white tongue and why should i wish to boast of it ater all its slaying a human although he was a savage and how do i know that he was a just injin and that he has not been taken away suddenly to anything but happy huntinggrounds when its onsartain whether good or evil has been done the wisest way is not to be boastfulstill i should like chingachgook to know that i havent discredited the delawares or my training  part of this was uttered aloud while part was merely muttered between the speakers teeth his more confident opinions enjoying the first advantage while his doubts were expressed in the latter mode soliloquy and reflection received a startling interruption however by the sudden appearance of a second indian on the lake shore a few hundred yards from the point this man evidently another scout who had probably been drawn to the place by the reports of the rifles broke out of the forest with so little caution that deerslayer caught a view of his person before he was himself discovered when the latter event did occur as was the case a moment later the savage gave a loud yell which was answered by a dozen voices from different parts of the mountainside there was no longer any time for delay in another minute the boat was quitting the shore under long and steady sweeps of the paddle  as soon as deerslayer believed himself to be at a safe distance he ceased his efforts permitting the little bark to drift while he leisurely took a survey of the state of things the canoe first sent adrift was floating before the air quite a quarter of a mile above him and a little nearer to the shore than he wished now that he knew more of the savages were so near at hand the canoe shoved from the point was within a few yards of him he having directed his own course towards it on quitting the land the dead indian lay in grim quiet where he had left him the warrior who had shown himself from the forest had already vanished and the woods themselves were as silent and seemingly deserted as the day they came fresh from the hands of their great creator this profound stillness however lasted but a moment when time had been given to the scouts of the enemy to reconnoitre they burst out of the thicket upon the naked point filling the air with yells of fury at discovering the death of their companion these cries were immediately succeeded by shouts of delight when they reached the body and clustered eagerly around it deerslayer was a sufficient adept in the usages of the natives to understand the reason of the change the yell was the customary lamentation at the loss of a warrior the shout a sign of rejoicing that the conqueror had not been able to secure the scalp the trophy without which a victory is never considered complete the distance at which the canoes lay probably prevented any attempts to injure the conqueror the american indian like the panther of his own woods seldom making any effort against his foe unless tolerably certain it is under circumstances that may be expected to prove effective  as the young man had no longer any motive to remain near the point he prepared to collect his canoes in order to tow them off to the castle that nearest was soon in tow when he proceeded in quest of the other which was all this time floating up the lake the eye of deerslayer was no sooner fastened on this last boat than it struck him that it was nearer to the shore than it would have been had it merely followed the course of the gentle current of air he began to suspect the influence of some unseen current in the water and he quickened his exertions in order to regain possession of it before it could drift into a dangerous proximity to the woods on getting nearer he thought that the canoe had a perceptible motion through the water and as it lay broadside to the air that this motion was taking it towards the land a few vigorous strokes of the paddle carried him still nearer when the mystery was explained something was evidently in motion on the off side of the canoe or that which was farthest from himself and closer scrutiny showed that it was a naked human arm an indian was lying in the bottom of the canoe and was propelling it slowly but certainly to the shore using his hand as a paddle deerslayer understood the whole artifice at a glance a savage had swum off to the boat while he was occupied with his enemy on the point got possession and was using these means to urge it to the shore  satisfied that the man in the canoe could have no arms deerslayer did not hesitate to dash close alongside of the retiring boat without deeming it necessary to raise his own rifle as soon as the wash of the water which he made in approaching became audible to the prostrate savage the latter sprang to his feet and uttered an exclamation that proved how completely he was taken by surprise  if youve enjyed yourself enough in that canoe redskin deerslayer coolly observed stopping his own career in sufficient time to prevent an absolute collision between the two boatsif youve enjyed yourself enough in that canoe youll do a prudent act by taking to the lake agin im reasonable in these matters and dont crave your blood though theres them about that would look upon you more as a duebill for the bounty than a human mortal take to the lake this minute afore we get to hot words  the savage was one of those who did not understand a word of english and he was indebted to the gestures of deerslayer and to the expression of an eye that did not often deceive for an imperfect comprehension of his meaning perhaps too the sight of the rifle that lay so near the hand of the white man quickened his decision at all events he crouched like a tiger about to take his leap uttered a yell and the next instant his naked body disappeared in the water when he rose to take breath it was at the distance of several yards from the canoe and the hasty glance he threw behind him denoted how much he feared the arrival of a fatal messenger from the rifle of his foe but the young man made no indication of any hostile intention deliberately securing the canoe to the others he began to paddle from the shore and by the time the indian reached the land and had shaken himself like a spaniel on quitting the water his dreaded enemy was already beyond rifleshot on his way to the castle as was so much his practice deerslayer did not fail to soliloquize on what had just occurred while steadily pursuing his course towards the point of destination  well wellhe commencedtwould have been wrong to kill a human mortal without an object scalps are of no account with me and life is sweet and ought not to be taken marcilessly by them that have white gifts the savage was a mingo its true and i make no doubt he is and will be as long as he lives a raal riptyle and vagabond but thats no reason i should forget my gifts and color no nolet him go if ever we meet agin rifle in hand why then twill be seen which has the stoutest heart and the quickest eye hawkeye thats not a bad name for a warrior sounding much more manful and valiant than deerslayer twouldnt be a bad title to begin with and it has been fairly arned if t was chingachgook now he might go home and boast of his deeds and the chiefs would name him hawkeye in a minute but it dont become white blood to brag and t isnt easy to see how the matter can be known unless i do well welleverything is in the hands of providence this affair as well as another ill trust to that for getting my desarts in all things  having thus betrayed what might be termed his weak spot the young man continued to paddle in silence making his way diligently and as fast as his tows would allow him towards the castle by this time the sun had not only risen but it had appeared over the eastern mountains and was shedding a flood of glorious light on this as yet unchristened sheet of water the whole scene was radiant with beauty and no one unaccustomed to the ordinary history of the woods would fancy it had so lately witnessed incidents so ruthless and barbarous as he approached the building of old hutter deerslayer thought or rather felt that its appearance was in singular harmony with all the rest of the scene although nothing had been consulted but strength and security the rude massive logs covered with their rough bark the projecting roof and the form would contribute to render the building picturesque in almost any situation while its actual position added novelty and piquancy to its other points of interest  when deerslayer drew nearer to the castle however objects of interest presented themselves that at once eclipsed any beauties that might have distinguished the scenery of the lake and the site of the singular edifice judith and hetty stood on the platform before the door hurrys dooryard awaiting his approach with manifest anxiety the former from time to time taking a survey of his person and of the canoes through the old ships spyglass that has been already mentioned never probably did this girl seem more brilliantly beautiful than at that moment the flush of anxiety and alarm increasing her color to its richest tints while the softness of her eyes a charm that even poor hetty shared with her was deepened by intense concern such at least without pausing or pretending to analyze motives or to draw any other very nice distinction between cause and effect were the opinions of the young man as his canoes reached the side of the ark where he carefully fastened all three before he put his foot on the platform    chapter viii       his words are bonds his oaths are oracles     his love sincere his thoughts immaculate     his tears pure messengers sent from his heart     his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth      two gentlemen of verona iivii7578  neither of the girls spoke as deerslayer stood before them alone his countenance betraying all the apprehension he felt on account of two absent members of their party  father judith at length exclaimed succeeding in uttering the word as it might be by a desperate effort  hes met with misfortune and theres no use in concealing it answered deerslayer in his direct and simple minded manner he and hurry are in mingo hands and heaven only knows whats to be the tarmination ive got the canoes safe and thats a consolation since the vagabonds will have to swim for it or raft off to come near this place at sunset well be reinforced by chingachgook if i can manage to get him into a canoe and then i think we two can answer for the ark and the castle till some of the officers in the garrisons hear of this warpath which sooner or later must be the case when we may look for succor from that quarter if from no other  the officers exclaimed judith impatiently her color deepening and her eye expressing a lively but passing emotion who thinks or speaks of the heartless gallants now we are sufficient of ourselves to defend the castle but what of my father and of poor hurry harry  t is natural you should feel this consarn for your own parent judith and i suppose its equally so that you should feel it for hurry harry too  deerslayer then commenced a succinct but clear narrative of all that occurred during the night in no manner concealing what had befallen his two companions or his own opinion of what might prove to be the consequences the girls listened with profound attention but neither betrayed that feminine apprehension and concern which would have followed such a communication when made to those who were less accustomed to the hazards and accidents of a frontier life to the surprise of deerslayer judith seemed the most distressed hetty listening eagerly but appearing to brood over the facts in melancholy silence rather than betraying any outward signs of feeling the formers agitation the young man did not fail to attribute to the interest she felt in hurry quite as much as to her filial love while hettys apparent indifference was ascribed to that mental darkness which in a measure obscured her intellect and which possibly prevented her from foreseeing all the consequences little was said however by either judith and her sister busying themselves in making the preparations for the morning meal as they who habitually attend to such matters toil on mechanically even in the midst of suffering and sorrow the plain but nutritious breakfast was taken by all three in sombre silence the girls ate little but deerslayer gave proof of possessing one material requisite of a good soldier that of preserving his appetite in the midst of the most alarming and embarrassing circumstances the meal was nearly ended before a syllable was uttered then however judith spoke in the convulsive and hurried manner in which feeling breaks through restraint after the latter has become more painful than even the betrayal of emotion  father would have relished this fish she exclaimed he says the salmon of the lakes is almost as good as the salmon of the sea  your father has been acquainted with the sea they tell me judith returned the young man who could not forbear throwing a glance of inquiry at the girl for in common with all who knew hutter he had some curiosity on the subject of his early history hurry harry tells me he was once a sailor  judith first looked perplexed then influenced by feelings that were novel to her in more ways than one she became suddenly communicative and seemingly much interested in the discourse  if hurry knows anything of fathers history i would he had told it to me she cried sometimes i think too he was once a sailor and then again i think he was not if that chest were open or if it could speak it might let us into his whole history but its fastenings are too strong to be broken like pack thread  deerslayer turned to the chest in question and for the first time examined it closely although discolored and bearing proofs of having received much illtreatment he saw that it was of materials and workmanship altogether superior to anything of the same sort he had ever before beheld the wood was dark rich and had once been highly polished though the treatment it had received left little gloss on its surface and various scratches and indentations proved the rough collisions that it had encountered with substances still harder than itself the corners were firmly bound with steel elaborately and richly wrought while the locks of which it had no less than three and the hinges were of a fashion and workmanship that would have attracted attention even in a warehouse of curious furniture this chest was quite large and when deerslayer arose and endeavored to raise an end by its massive handle he found that the weight fully corresponded with the external appearance  did you never see that chest opened judith the young man demanded with frontier freedom for delicacy on such subjects was little felt among the people on the verge of civilization in that age even if it be today  never father has never opened it in my presence if he ever opens it at all no one here has ever seen its lid raised unless it be father nor do i even know that he has ever seen it  now youre wrong judith hetty quietly answered father has raised the lid and ive seen him do it  a feeling of manliness kept the mouth of deerslayer shut for while he would not have hesitated about going far beyond what would be thought the bounds of propriety in questioning the older sister he had just scruples about taking what might be thought an advantage of the feeble intellect of the younger judith being under no such restraint however turned quickly to the last speaker and continued the discourse  when and where did you ever see that chest opened hetty  here and again and again father often opens it when you are away though he dont in the least mind my being by and seeing all he does as well as hearing all he says  and what is it that he does and what does he say  that i cannot tell you judith returned the other in a low but resolute voice fathers secrets are not my secrets  secrets this is stranger still deerslayer that father should tell them to hetty and not tell them to me  theres a good reason for that judith though youre not to know it fathers not here to answer for himself and ill say no more about it  judith and deerslayer looked surprised and for a minute the first seemed pained but suddenly recollecting herself she turned away from her sister as if in pity for her weakness and addressed the young man  youve told but half your story she said breaking off at the place where you went to sleep in the canoeor rather where you rose to listen to the cry of the loon we heard the call of the loons too and thought their cries might bring a storm though we are little used to tempests on this lake at this season of the year  the winds blow and the tempests howl as god pleases sometimes at one season and sometimes at another answered deerslayer and the loons speak accordin to their natur better would it be if men were as honest and frank after i rose to listen to the birds finding it could not be hurrys signal i lay down and slept when the day dawned i was up and stirring as usual and then i went in chase of the two canoes lest the mingos should lay hands on em  you have not told us all deerslayer said judith earnestly we heard rifles under the eastern mountain the echoes were full and long and came so soon after the reports that the pieces must have been fired on or quite near to the shore our ears are used to these signs and are not to be deceived  theyve done their duty gal this time yes theyve done their duty rifles have been sighted this morning ay and triggers pulled too though not as often as they might have been one warrior has gone to his happy huntinggrounds and thats the whole of it a man of white blood and white gifts is not to be expected to boast of his explites and to flourish scalps  judith listened almost breathlessly and when deerslayer in his quiet modest manner seemed disposed to quit the subject she rose and crossing the room took a seat by his side the manner of the girl had nothing forward about it though it betrayed the quick instinct of a females affection and the sympathizing kindness of a womans heart she even took the hard hand of the hunter and pressed it in both her own unconsciously to herself perhaps while she looked earnestly and even reproachfully into his sun burnt face  you have been fighting the savages deerslayer singly and by yourself she said in your wish to take care of usof hettyof me perhaps youve fought the enemy bravely with no eye to encourage your deeds or to witness your fall had it pleased providence to suffer so great a calamity  ive fout judith yes i have fout the inimy and that too for the first time in my life these things must be and they bring with em a mixed feelin of sorrow and triumph human natur is a fightin natur i suppose as all nations kill in battle and we must be true to our rights and gifts what has yet been done is no great matter but should chingachgook come to the rock this evening as is agreed atween us and i get him off it onbeknown to the savages or if known to them agin their wishes and designs then may we all look to something like warfare afore the mingos shall get possession of either the castle or the ark or yourselves  who is this chingachgook from what place does he come and why does he come here  the questions are natral and right i suppose though the youth has a great name already in his own part of the country chingachgook is a mohican by blood consorting with the delawares by usage as is the case with most of his tribe which has long been broken up by the increase of our color he is of the family of the great chiefs uncas his father having been the considerablest warrior and counsellor of his people even old tamenund honors chingachgook though he is thought to be yet too young to lead in war and then the nation is so disparsed and diminished that chieftainship among em has got to be little more than a name  well this war having commenced in arnest the delaware and i rendezvousd an appintment to meet this evening at sunset on the rendezvousrock at the foot of this very lake intending to come out on our first hostile expedition agin the mingos why we come exactly this a way is our own secret but thoughtful young men on the warpath as you may suppose do nothing without a calculation and a design  a delaware can have no unfriendly intentions towards us said judith after a moments hesitation and we know you to be friendly  treachery is the last crime i hope to be accused of returned deerslayer hurt at the gleam of distrust that had shot through judiths mind and least of all treachery to my own color  no one suspects you deerslayer the girl impetuously cried nonoyour honest countenance would be sufficient surety for the truth of a thousand hearts if all men had as honest tongues and no more promised what they did not mean to perform there would be less wrong done in the world and fine feathers and scarlet cloaks would not be excuses for baseness and deception  the girl spoke with strong nay even with convulsed feeling and her fine eyes usually so soft and alluring flashed fire as she concluded deerslayer could not but observe this extraordinary emotion but with the tact of a courtier he avoided not only any allusion to the circumstance but succeeded in concealing the effect of his discovery on himself judith gradually grew calm again and as she was obviously anxious to appear to advantage in the eyes of the young man she was soon able to renew the conversation as composedly as if nothing had occurred to disturb her  i have no right to look into your secrets or the secrets of your friend deerslayer she continued and am ready to take all you say on trust if we can really get another male ally to join us at this trying moment it will aid us much and i am not without hope that when the savages find that we are able to keep the lake they will offer to give up their prisoners in exchange for skins or at least for the keg of powder that we have in the house  the young man had the words scalps and bounty on his lips but a reluctance to alarm the feelings of the daughters prevented him from making the allusion he had intended to the probable fate of their father still so little was he practised in the arts of deception that his expressive countenance was of itself understood by the quickwitted judith whose intelligence had been sharpened by the risks and habits of her life  i understand what you mean she continued hurriedly and what you would say but for the fear of hurting meus i mean for hetty loves her father quite as well as i do but this is not as we think of indians they never scalp an unhurt prisoner but would rather take him away alive unless indeed the fierce wish for torturing should get the mastery of them i fear nothing for my fathers scalp and little for his life could they steal on us in the night we should all probably suffer in this way but men taken in open strife are seldom injured not at least until the time of torture comes  thats tradition ill allow and its accordin to practicebut judith do you know the arrnd on which your father and hurry went agin the savages  i do and a cruel errand it was but what will you have men will be men and some even that flaunt in their gold and silver and carry the kings commission in their pockets are not guiltless of equal cruelty judiths eye again flashed but by a desperate struggle she resumed her composure i get warm when i think of all the wrong that men do she added affecting to smile an effort in which she only succeeded indifferently well all this is silly what is done is done and it cannot be mended by complaints but the indians think so little of the shedding of blood and value men so much for the boldness of their undertakings that did they know the business on which their prisoners came they would be more likely to honor than to injure them for it  for a time judith yes i allow that for a time but when that feelin dies away then will come the love of revenge we must indivorchingachgook and iwe must indivor to see what we can do to get hurry and your father free for the mingos will no doubt hover about this lake some days in order to make the most of their success  you think this delaware can be depended on deerslayer demanded the girl thoughtfully  as much as i can myself you say you do not suspect me judith  you taking his hand again and pressing it between her own with a warmth that might have awakened the vanity of one less simpleminded and more disposed to dwell on his own good qualities i would as soon suspect a brother i have known you but a day deerslayer but it has awakened the confidence of a year your name however is not unknown to me for the gallants of the garrisons frequently speak of the lessons you have given them in hunting and all proclaim your honesty  do they ever talk of the shooting gal inquired the other eagerly after however laughing in a silent but heartfelt manner do they ever talk of the shooting i want to hear nothing about my own for if that isnt sartified to by this time in all these parts theres little use in being skilful and sure but what do the officers say of their ownyes what do they say of their own arms as they call it is their trade and yet theres some among em that know very little how to use em  such i hope will not be the case with your friend chingachgook as you call himwhat is the english of his indian name  big sarpentso called for his wisdom and cunning uncas is his raal nameall his family being called uncas until they get a title that has been arned by deeds  if he has all this wisdom we may expect a useful friend in him unless his own business in this part of the country should prevent him from serving us  i see no great harm in telling you his arrnd ater all and as you may find means to help us i will let you and hetty into the whole matter trusting that youll keep the secret as if it was your own you must know that chingachgook is a comely injin and is much looked upon and admired by the young women of his tribe both on account of his family and on account of himself now there is a chief that has a daughter called wahtawah which is intarpreted into histohhist in the english tongue the rarest gal among the delawares and the one most sought ater and craved for a wife by all the young warriors of the nation well chingachgook among others took a fancy to wahtawah and wahtawah took a fancy to him here deerslayer paused an instant for as he got thus far in his tale hetty hutter arose approached and stood attentive at his knee as a child draws near to listen to the legends of its mother yes he fancied her and she fancied him resumed deerslayer casting a friendly and approving glance at the innocent and interested girl and when that is the case and all the elders are agreed it does not often happen that the young couple keep apart chingachgook couldnt well carry off such a prize without making inimies among them that wanted her as much as he did himself a sartain briarthorn as we call him in english or yocommon as he is tarmed in injin took it most to heart and we mistrust him of having a hand in all that followed  wahtawah went with her father and mother two moons ago to fish for salmon on the western streams where it is agreed by all in these parts that fish most abounds and while thus emplyed the gal vanished for several weeks we could get no tidings of her but here ten days since a runner that came through the delaware country brought us a message by which we learn that wahtawah was stolen from her people we think but do not know it by briarthorns sarcumventionsand that she was now with the inimy who had adopted her and wanted her to marry a young mingo the message said that the party intended to hunt and forage through this region for a month or two afore it went back into the canadas and that if we could contrive to get on a scent in this quarter something might turn up that would lead to our getting the maiden off  and how does that concern you deerslayer demanded judith a little anxiously  it consarns me as all things that touches a frind consarns a frind im here as chingachgooks aid and helper and if we can get the young maiden he likes back agin it will give me almost as much pleasure as if i had got back my own sweetheart  and where then is your sweetheart deerslayer  shes in the forest judithhanging from the boughs of the trees in a soft rainin the dew on the open grassthe clouds that float about in the blue heavensthe birds that sing in the woodsthe sweet springs where i slake my thirstand in all the other glorious gifts that come from gods providence  you mean that as yet youve never loved one of my sex but love best your haunts and your own manner of life  thats itthats just it i am whitehave a white heart and cant in reason love a redskinned maiden who must have a redskin heart and feelins no no im sound enough in them particlars and hope to remain so at least till this war is over i find my time too much taken up with chingachgooks affair to wish to have one of my own on my hands afore that is settled   the girl that finally wins you deerslayer will at least win an honest heartone without treachery or guile and that will be a victory that most of her sex ought to envy  as judith uttered this her beautiful face had a resentful frown on it while a bitter smile lingered around a mouth that no derangement of the muscles could render anything but handsome her companion observed the change and though little skilled in the workings of the female heart he had sufficient native delicacy to understand that it might be well to drop the subject  as the hour when chingachgook was expected still remained distant deerslayer had time enough to examine into the state of the defences and to make such additional arrangements as were in his power and the exigency of the moment seemed to require the experience and foresight of hutter had left little to be done in these particulars still several precautions suggested themselves to the young man who may be said to have studied the art of frontier warfare through the traditions and legends of the people among whom he had so long lived the distance between the castle and the nearest point on the shore prevented any apprehension on the subject of riflebullets thrown from the land the house was within musketshot in one sense it was true but aim was entirely out of the question and even judith professed a perfect disregard of any danger from that source so long then as the party remained in possession of the fortress they were safe unless their assailants could find the means to come off and carry it by fire or storm or by some of the devices of indian cunning and indian treachery  against the first source of danger hutter had made ample provision and the building itself the bark roof excepted was not very combustible the floor was scuttled in several places and buckets provided with ropes were in daily use in readiness for any such emergency one of the girls could easily extinguish any fire that might be lighted provided it had not time to make much headway judith who appeared to understand all her fathers schemes of defence and who had the spirit to take no unimportant share in the execution of them explained all these details to the young man who was thus saved much time and labor in making his investigations  little was to be apprehended during the day in possession of the canoes and of the ark no other vessel was to be found on the lake nevertheless deerslayer well knew that a raft was soon made and as dead trees were to be found in abundance near the water did the savages seriously contemplate the risks of an assault it would not be a very difficult matter to find the necessary means the celebrated american axe a tool that is quite unrivalled in its way was then not very extensively known and the savages were far from expert in the use of its hatchetlike substitute still they had sufficient practice in crossing streams by this mode to render it certain they would construct a raft should they deem it expedient to expose themselves to the risks of an assault the death of their warrior might prove a sufficient incentive or it might act as a caution but deerslayer thought it more than possible that the succeeding night would bring matters to a crisis and in this precise way this impression caused him to wish ardently for the presence and succor of his mohican friend and to look forward to the approach of sunset with an increasing anxiety  as the day advanced the party in the castle matured their plans and made their preparations judith was active and seemed to find a pleasure in consulting and advising with her new acquaintance whose indifference to danger manly devotion to herself and sister guilelessness of manner and truth of feeling had won rapidly on both her imagination and her affections although the hours appeared long in some respects to deerslayer judith did not find them so and when the sun began to descend towards the pineclad summits of the western hills she felt and expressed her surprise that the day should so soon be drawing to a close on the other hand hetty was moody and silent she was never loquacious or if she occasionally became communicative it was under the influence of some temporary excitement that served to arouse her unsophisticated mind but for hours at a time in the course of this allimportant day she seemed to have absolutely lost the use of her tongue nor did apprehension on account of her father materially affect the manner of either sister neither appeared seriously to dread any evil greater than captivity and once or twice when hetty did speak she intimated the expectation that hutter would find the means to liberate himself although judith was less sanguine on this head she too betrayed the hope that propositions for a ransom would come when the indians discovered that the castle set their expedients and artifices at defiance deerslayer however treated these passing suggestions as the illdigested fancies of girls making his own arrangements as steadily and brooding over the future as seriously as if they had never fallen from their lips  at length the hour arrived when it became necessary to proceed to the place of rendezvous appointed with the mohican or delaware as chingachgook was more commonly called as the plan had been matured by deerslayer and fully communicated to his companions all three set about its execution in concert and intelligently hetty passed into the ark and fastening two of the canoes together she entered one and paddled up to a sort of gateway in the palisadoes that surrounded the building through which she carried both securing them beneath the house by chains that were fastened within the building these palisadoes were trunks of trees driven firmly into the mud and served the double purpose of a small inclosure that was intended to be used in this very manner and to keep any enemy that might approach in boats at arms length canoes thus docked were in a measure hid from sight and as the gate was properly barred and fastened it would not be an easy task to remove them even in the event of their being seen previously however to closing the gate judith also entered within the inclosure with the third canoe leaving deerslayer busy in securing the door and windows inside the building over her head as everything was massive and strong and small saplings were used as bars it would have been the work of an hour or two to break into the building when deerslayer had ended his task even allowing the assailants the use of any tools but the axe and to be unresisted this attention to security arose from hutters having been robbed once or twice by the lawless whites of the frontiers during some of his many absences from home  as soon as all was fast in the inside of the dwelling deerslayer appeared at a trap from which he descended into the canoe of judith when this was done he fastened the door with a massive staple and stout padlock hetty was then received in the canoe which was shoved outside of the palisadoes the next precaution was to fasten the gate and the keys were carried into the ark the three were now fastened out of the dwelling which could only be entered by violence or by following the course taken by the young man in quitting it the glass had been brought outside as a preliminary step and deerslayer next took a careful survey of the entire shore of the lake as far as his own position would allow not a living thing was visible a few birds excepted and even the last fluttered about in the shades of the trees as if unwilling to encounter the heat of a sultry afternoon all the nearest points in particular were subjected to severe scrutiny in order to make certain that no raft was in preparation the result everywhere giving the same picture of calm solitude a few words will explain the greatest embarrassment belonging to the situation of our party exposed themselves to the observation of any watchful eyes the movements of their enemies were concealed by the drapery of a dense forest while the imagination would be very apt to people the latter with more warriors than it really contained their own weakness must be too apparent to all who might chance to cast a glance in their direction  nothing is stirring howsever exclaimed deerslayer as he finally lowered the glass and prepared to enter the ark if the vagabonds do harbor mischief in their minds they are too cunning to let it be seen its true a raft may be in preparation in the woods but it has not yet been brought down to the lake they cant guess that we are about to quit the castle and if they did theyve no means of knowing where we intend to go  this is so true deerslayer returned judith that now all is ready we may proceed at once boldly and without the fear of being followed else we shall be behind our time  no no the matter needs management for though the savages are in the dark as to chingachgook and the rock theyve eyes and legs and will see in what direction we steer and will be sartain to follow us i shall strive to baffle em howsever by heading the scow in all manner of ways first in one quarter and then in another until they get to be alegweary and tired of tramping ater us  so far as it was in his power deerslayer was as good as his word in less than five minutes after this speech was made the whole party was in the ark and in motion there was a gentle breeze from the north and boldly hoisting the sail the young man laid the head of the unwieldy craft in such a direction as after making a liberal but necessary allowance for leeway would have brought it ashore a couple of miles down the lake and on its eastern side the sailing of the ark was never very swift though floating as it did on the surface it was not difficult to get it in motion or to urge it along over the water at the rate of some three or four miles in the hour the distance between the castle and the rock was a little more than two leagues knowing the punctuality of an indian deerslayer had made his calculations closely and had given himself a little more time than was necessary to reach the place of rendezvous with a view to delay or to press his arrival as might prove most expedient when he hoisted the sail the sun lay above the western hills at an elevation that promised rather more than two hours of day and a few minutes satisfied him that the progress of the scow was such as to equal his expectations  it was a glorious june afternoon and never did that solitary sheet of water seem less like an arena of strife and bloodshed the light air scarce descended as low as the bed of the lake hovering over it as if unwilling to disturb its deep tranquillity or to ruffle its mirrorlike surface even the forests appeared to be slumbering in the sun and a few piles of fleecy clouds had lain for hours along the northern horizon like fixtures in the atmosphere placed there purely to embellish the scene a few aquatic fowls occasionally skimmed along the water and a single raven was visible sailing high above the trees and keeping a watchful eye on the forest beneath him in order to detect anything having life that the mysterious woods might offer as prey  the reader will probably have observed that amidst the frankness and abruptness of manner which marked the frontier habits of judith her language was superior to that used by her male companions her own father included this difference extended as well to pronunciation as to the choice of words and phrases perhaps nothing so soon betrays the education and association as the modes of speech and few accomplishments so much aid the charm of female beauty as a graceful and even utterance while nothing so soon produces the disenchantment that necessarily follows a discrepancy between appearance and manner as a mean intonation of voice or a vulgar use of words judith and her sister were marked exceptions to all the girls of their class along that whole frontier the officers of the nearest garrison having often flattered the former with the belief that few ladies of the towns acquitted themselves better than herself in this important particular this was far from being literally true but it was sufficiently near the fact to give birth to the compliment the girls were indebted to their mother for this proficiency having acquired from her in childhood an advantage that no subsequent study or labor can give without a drawback if neglected beyond the earlier periods of life who that mother was or rather had been no one but hutter knew she had now been dead two summers and as was stated by hurry she had been buried in the lake whether in indulgence of a prejudice or from a reluctance to take the trouble to dig her grave had frequently been a matter of discussion between the rude beings of that region judith had never visited the spot but hetty was present at the interment and she often paddled a canoe about sunset or by the light of the moon to the place and gazed down into the limpid water in the hope of being able to catch a glimpse of the form that she had so tenderly loved from infancy to the sad hour of their parting  must we reach the rock exactly at the moment the sun sets judith demanded of the young man as they stood near each other deerslayer holding the steeringoar and she working with a needle at some ornament of dress that much exceeded her station in life and was altogether a novelty in the woods will a few minutes sooner or later alter the matter it will be very hazardous to remain long as near the shore as that rock  thats it judith thats the very difficulty the rocks within pint blank for a shotgun and twill never do to hover about it too close and too long when you have to deal with an injin you must calculate and manage for a red natur dearly likes sarcumvention now you see judith that i do not steer towards the rock at all but here to the eastward of it whereby the savages will be tramping off in that direction and get their legs awearied and all for no advantage  you think then they see us and watch our movements deerslayer i was in hopes they might have fallen back into the woods and left us to ourselves for a few hours  thats altogether a womans consait theres no letup in an injins watchfulness when hes on a warpath and eyes are on us at this minute though the lake presarves us we must draw near the rock on a calculation and indivor to get the miscreants on a false scent the mingos have good noses they tell me but a white mans reason ought always to equalize their instinct  judith now entered into a desultory discourse with deerslayer in which the girl betrayed her growing interest in the young man an interest that his simplicity of mind and her decision of character sustained as it was by the consciousness awakened by the consideration her personal charms so universally produced rendered her less anxious to conceal than might otherwise have been the case she was scarcely forward in her manner though there was sometimes a freedom in her glances that it required all the aid of her exceeding beauty to prevent from awakening suspicions unfavorable to her discretion if not to her morals with deerslayer however these glances were rendered less obnoxious to so unpleasant a construction for she seldom looked at him without discovering much of the sincerity and nature that accompany the purest emotions of woman it was a little remarkable that as his captivity lengthened neither of the girls manifested any great concern for her father but as has been said already their habits gave them confidence and they looked forward to his liberation by means of a ransom with a confidence that might in a great degree account for their apparent indifference once before hutter had been in the hands of the iroquois and a few skins had readily effected his release this event however unknown to the sisters had occurred in a time of peace between england and france and when the savages were restrained instead of being encouraged to commit their excesses by the policy of the different colonial governments  while judith was loquacious and caressing in her manner hetty remained thoughtful and silent once indeed she drew near to deerslayer and questioned him a little closely as to his intentions as well as concerning the mode of effecting his purpose but her wish to converse went no further as soon as her simple queries were answeredand answered they all were in the fullest and kindest mannershe withdrew to her seat and continued to work on a coarse garment that she was making for her father sometimes humming a low melancholy air and frequently sighing  in this manner the time passed away and when the sun was beginning to glow behind the fringe of the pines that bounded the western hill or about twenty minutes before it actually set the ark was nearly as low as the point where hutter and hurry had been made prisoners by sheering first to one side of the lake and then to the other deerslayer managed to create an uncertainty as to his object and doubtless the savages who were unquestionably watching his movements were led to believe that his aim was to communicate with them at or near this spot and would hasten in that direction in order to be in readiness to profit by circumstances this artifice was well managed since the sweep of the bay the curvature of the lake and the low marshy land that intervened would probably allow the ark to reach the rock before its pursuers if really collected near this point could have time to make the circuit that would be required to get there by land with a view to aid this deception deerslayer stood as near the western shore as was at all prudent and then causing judith and hetty to enter the house or cabin and crouching himself so as to conceal his person by the frame of the scow he suddenly threw the head of the latter round and began to make the best of his way towards the outlet favored by an increase in the wind the progress of the ark was such as to promise the complete success of this plan though the crablike movement of the craft compelled the helmsman to keep its head looking in a direction very different from that in which it was actually moving    chapter ix       yet art thou prodigal of smiles     smiles sweeter than thy frowns are stern     earth sends from all her thousand isles     a shout at thy return     the glory that comes down from thee     bathes in deep joy the land and sea      bryant the firmament 111924  it may assist the reader in understanding the events we are about to record if he has a rapidly sketched picture of the scene placed before his eyes at a single view it will be remembered that the lake was an irregularly shaped basin of an outline that in the main was oval but with bays and points to relieve its formality and ornament its shores the surface of this beautiful sheet of water was now glittering like a gem in the last rays of the evening sun and the setting of the whole hills clothed in the richest forest verdure was lighted up with a sort of radiant smile that is best described in the beautiful lines we have placed at the head of this chapter as the banks with few exceptions rose abruptly from the water even where the mountain did not immediately bound the view there was a nearly unbroken fringe of leaves overhanging the placid lake the trees starting out of the acclivities inclining to the light until in many instances they extended their long limbs and straight trunks some forty or fifty feet beyond the line of the perpendicular in these cases we allude only to the giants of the forest pines of a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet in height for of the smaller growth very many inclined so far as to steep their lower branches in the water in the position in which the ark had now got the castle was concealed from view by the projection of a point as indeed was the northern extremity of the lake itself a respectable mountain forest clad and rounded like all the rest limited the view in that direction stretching immediately across the whole of the fair scene with the exception of a deep bay that passed the western end lengthening the basin for more than a mile  the manner in which the water flowed out of the lake beneath the leafy arches of the trees that lined the sides of the stream has already been mentioned and it has also been said that the rock which was a favorite place of rendezvous throughout all that region and where deerslayer now expected to meet his friend stood near this outlet and at no great distance from the shore it was a large isolated stone that rested on the bottom of the lake apparently left there when the waters tore away the earth from around it in forcing for themselves a passage down the river and which had obtained its shape from the action of the elements during the slow progress of centuries the height of this rock could scarcely equal six feet and as has been said its shape was not unlike that which is usually given to beehives or to a haycock the latter indeed gives the best idea not only of its form but of its dimensions it stood and still stands for we are writing of real scenes within fifty feet of the bank and in water that was only two feet in depth though there were seasons in which its rounded apex if such a term can properly be used was covered by the lake many of the trees stretched so far forward as almost to blend the rock with the shore when seen from a little distance and one tall pine in particular overhung it in a way to form a noble and appropriate canopy to a seat that had held many a forest chieftain during the long succession of unknown ages in which america and all it contained had existed apart in mysterious solitude a world by itself equally without a familiar history and without an origin that the annals of man can reach  when distant some two or three hundred feet from the shore deerslayer took in his sail he dropped his grapnel as soon as he found the ark had drifted in a line that was directly to windward of the rock the motion of the scow was then checked when it was brought head to wind by the action of the breeze as soon as this was done deerslayer paid out line and suffered the vessel to set down upon the rock as fast as the light air could force it to leeward floating entirely on the surface this was soon effected and the young man checked the drift when he was told that the stern of the scow was within fifteen or eighteen feet of the desired spot  in executing this maneuver deerslayer had proceeded promptly for while he did not in the least doubt that he was both watched and followed by the foe he believed he distracted their movements by the apparent uncertainty of his own and he knew they could have no means of ascertaining that the rock was his aim unless indeed one of their prisoners had betrayed him a chance so improbable in itself as to give him no concern notwithstanding the celerity and decision his movements he did not however venture so near the shore without taking due precautions to effect a retreat in the event of its becoming necessary he held the line in his hand and judith was stationed at a loop on the side of the cabin next the shore where she could watch the beach and the rock and give timely notice of the approach of either friend or foe hetty was also placed on watch but it was to keep the trees overhead in view lest some enemy might ascend one and by completely commanding the interior of the scow render the defence of the hut or cabin useless  the sun had disappeared from the lake and valley when deerslayer checked the ark in the manner mentioned still it wanted a few minutes to the true sunset and he knew indian punctuality too well to anticipate any unmanly haste in his friend the great question was whether surrounded by enemies as he was known to be he had escaped their toils the occurrences of the last twentyfour hours must be a secret to him and like himself chingachgook was yet young on a path it was true he came prepared to encounter the party that withheld his promised bride but he had no means ascertaining the extent of the danger he ran or the precise positions occupied by either friends or foes in a word the trained sagacity and untiring caution of an indian were all he had to rely on amid the critical risks he unavoidably ran  is the rock empty judith inquired deerslayer as soon as he had checked the drift of the ark deeming it imprudent to venture unnecessarily near the shore is any thing to be seen of the delaware chief  nothing deerslayer neither rock shore trees nor lake seems to have ever held a human form  keep close judithkeep close hettya rifle has a prying eye a nimble foot and a desperate fatal tongue keep close then but keep up actyve looks and be on the alart twould grieve me to the heart did any harm befall either of you  and you deerslayer exclaimed judith turning her handsome face from the loop to bestow a gracious and grateful look on the young mando you keep close and have a proper care that the savages do not catch a glimpse of you a bullet might be as fatal to you as to one of us and the blow that you felt would be felt by us all  no fear of me judithno fear of me my good gal do not look thisaway although you look so pleasant and comely but keep your eyes on the rock and the shore and the  deerslayer was interrupted by a slight exclamation from the girl who in obedience to his hurried gestures as much as in obedience to his words had immediately bent her looks again in the opposite direction  what istwhat ist judith he hastily demandedis any thing to be seen  there is a man on the rockan indian warrior in his paintand armed  where does he wear his hawks feather eagerly added deerslayer relaxing his hold of the line in readiness to drift nearer to the place of rendezvous is it fast to the warlock or does he carry it above the left ear  tis as you say above the left ear he smiles too and mutters the word mohican  god be praised tis the sarpent at last exclaimed the young man suffering the line to slip through his hands until hearing a light bound in the other end of the craft he instantly checked the rope and began to haul it in again under the assurance that his object was effected at that moment the door of the cabin was opened hastily and a warrior darting through the little room stood at deerslayers side simply uttering the exclamation hugh at the next instant judith and hetty shrieked and the air was filled with the yell of twenty savages who came leaping through the branches down the bank some actually falling headlong into the water in their haste  pull deerslayer cried judith hastily barring the door in order to prevent an inroad by the passage through which the delaware had just entered pull for life and deaththe lake is full of savages wading after us  the young menfor chingachgook immediately came to his friends assistanceneeded no second bidding but they applied themselves to their task in a way that showed how urgent they deemed the occasion the great difficulty was in suddenly overcoming the inertia of so large a mass for once in motion it was easy to cause the scow to skim the water with all the necessary speed  pull deerslayer for heavens sake cried judith again at the loop these wretches rush into the water like hounds following their prey ahthe scow moves and now the water deepens to the armpits of the foremost but they reach forward and will seize the ark  a slight scream and then a joyous laugh followed from the girl the first produced by a desperate effort of their pursuers and the last by its failure the scow which had now got fairly in motion gliding ahead into deep water with a velocity that set the designs of their enemies at nought as the two men were prevented by the position of the cabin from seeing what passed astern they were compelled to inquire of the girls into the state of the chase  what now judithwhat nextdo the mingos still follow or are we quit of em for the present demanded deerslayer when he felt the rope yielding as if the scow was going fast ahead and heard the scream and the laugh of the girl almost in the same breath  they have vanishedonethe lastis just burying himself in the bushes of the bankthere he has disappeared in the shadows of the trees you have got your friend and we are all safe  the two men now made another great effort pulled the ark up swiftly to the grapnel tripped it and when the scow had shot some distance and lost its way they let the anchor drop again then for the first time since their meeting they ceased their efforts as the floating house now lay several hundred feet from the shore and offered a complete protection against bullets there was no longer any danger or any motive for immediate exertion  the manner in which the two friends now recognized each other was highly characteristic chingachgook a noble tall handsome and athletic young indian warrior first examined his rifle with care opening the pan to make sure that the priming was not wet and assured of this important fact he next cast furtive but observant glances around him at the strange habitation and at the two girls still he spoke not and most of all did he avoid the betrayal of a womanish curiosity by asking questions  judith and hetty said deerslayer with an untaught natural courtesythis is the mohican chief of whom youve heard me speak chingachgook as he is called which signifies big sarpent so named for his wisdom and prudence and cunning and my arliest and latest frind i knowd it must be he by the hawks feather over the left ear most other warriors wearing em on the warlock  as deerslayer ceased speaking he laughed heartily excited more perhaps by the delight of having got his friend safe at his side under circumstances so trying than by any conceit that happened to cross his fancy and exhibiting this outbreaking of feeling in a manner that was a little remarkable since his merriment was not accompanied by any noise although chingachgook both understood and spoke english he was unwilling to communicate his thoughts in it like most indians and when he had met judiths cordial shake of the hand and hettys milder salute in the courteous manner that became a chief he turned away apparently to await the moment when it might suit his friend to enter into an explanation of his future intentions and to give a narrative of what had passed since their separation the other understood his meaning and discovered his own mode of reasoning in the matter by addressing the girls  this wind will soon die away altogether now the sun is down he said and there is no need for rowing agin it in half an hour or so it will either be a flat calm or the air will come off from the south shore when we will begin our journey back agin to the castle in the meanwhile the delaware and i will talk over matters and get correct idees of each others notions consarning the course we ought to take  no one opposed this proposition and the girls withdrew into the cabin to prepare the evening meal while the two young men took their seats on the head of the scow and began to converse the dialogue was in the language of the delawares as that dialect however is but little understood even by the learned we shall not only on this but on all subsequent occasions render such parts as it may be necessary to give closely into liberal english preserving as far as possible the idiom and peculiarities of the respective speakers by way of presenting the pictures in the most graphic forms to the minds of the readers  it is unnecessary to enter into the details first related by deerslayer who gave a brief narrative of the facts that are already familiar to those who have read our pages in relating these events however it may be well to say that the speaker touched only on the outlines more particularly abstaining from saying anything about his encounter with and victory over the iroquois as well as to his own exertions in behalf of the two deserted young women when deerslayer ended the delaware took up the narrative in turn speaking sententiously and with grave dignity his account was both clear and short nor was it embellished by any incidents that did not directly concern the history of his departure from the villages of his people and his arrival in the valley of the susquehannah on reaching the latter which was at a point only half a mile south of the outlet he had soon struck a trail which gave him notice of the probable vicinity of enemies being prepared for such an occurrence the object of the expedition calling him directly into the neighborhood of the party of iroquois that was known to be out he considered the discovery as fortunate rather than the reverse and took the usual precautions to turn it to account first following the river to its source and ascertaining the position of the rock he met another trail and had actually been hovering for hours on the flanks of his enemies watching equally for an opportunity to meet his mistress and to take a scalp and it may be questioned which he most ardently desired he kept near the lake and occasionally he ventured to some spot where he could get a view of what was passing on its surface the ark had been seen and watched from the moment it hove in sight though the young chief was necessarily ignorant that it was to be the instrument of his effecting the desired junction with his friend the uncertainty of its movements and the fact that it was unquestionably managed by white men soon led him to conjecture the truth however and he held himself in readiness to get on board whenever a suitable occasion might offer as the sun drew near the horizon he repaired to the rock where on emerging from the forest he was gratified in finding the ark lying apparently in readiness to receive him the manner of his appearance and of his entrance into the craft is known  although chingachgook had been closely watching his enemies for hours their sudden and close pursuit as he reached the scow was as much a matter of surprise to himself as it had been to his friend he could only account for it by the fact of their being more numerous than he had at first supposed and by their having out parties of the existence of which he was ignorant their regular and permanent encampment if the word permanent can be applied to the residence of a party that intended to remain out in all probability but a few weeks was not far from the spot where hutter and hurry had fallen into their hands and as a matter of course near a spring  well sarpent asked deerslayer when the other had ended his brief but spirited narrative speaking always in the delaware tongue which for the readers convenience only we render into the peculiar vernacular of the speakerwell sarpent as youve been scouting around these mingos have you anything to tell us of their captyves the father of these young women and of another who i somewhat conclude is the lovyer of one of em  chingachgook has seen them an old man and a young warriorthe falling hemlock and the tall pine  youre not so much out delaware youre not so much out old hutter is decaying of a sartainty though many solid blocks might be hewn out of his trunk yet and as for hurry harry so far as height and strength and comeliness go he may be called the pride of the human forest were the men bound or in any manner suffering torture i ask on account of the young women who i dare to say would be glad to know  it is not so deerslayer the mingos are too many to cage their game some watch some sleep some scout some hunt the palefaces are treated like brothers today tomorrow they will lose their scalps  yes thats red natur and must be submitted to judith and hetty heres comforting tidings for you the delaware telling me that neither your father nor hurry harry is in suffering but bating the loss of liberty as well off as we are ourselves of course they are kept in the camp otherwise they do much as they please  i rejoice to hear this deerslayer returned judith and now we are joined by your friend i make no manner of question that we shall find an opportunity to ransom the prisoners if there are any women in the camp i have articles of dress that will catch their eyes and should the worst come to the worst we can open the great chest which i think will be found to hold things that may tempt the chiefs  judith said the young man looking up at her with a smile and an expression of earnest curiosity that in spite of the growing obscurity did not escape the watchful looks of the girl can you find it in your heart to part with your own finery to release prisoners even though one be your own father and the other is your sworn suitor and lovyer  the flush on the face of the girl arose in part from resentment but more perhaps from a gentler and a novel feeling that with the capricious waywardness of taste had been rapidly rendering her more sensitive to the good opinion of the youth who questioned her than to that of any other person suppressing the angry sensation with instinctive quickness she answered with a readiness and truth that caused her sister to draw near to listen though the obtuse intellect of the latter was far from comprehending the workings of a heart as treacherous as uncertain and as impetuous in its feelings as that of the spoiled and flattered beauty  deerslayer answered judith after a moments pause i shall be honest with you i confess that the time has been when what you call finery was to me the dearest thing on earth but i begin to feel differently though hurry harry is nought to me nor ever can be i would give all i own to set him free if i would do this for blustering bullying talking hurry who has nothing but good looks to recommend him you may judge what i would do for my own father  this sounds well and is according to womans gifts ahs me the same feelins is to be found among the young women of the delawares ive known em often and often sacrifice their vanity to their hearts tis as it should betis as it should be i suppose in both colours woman was created for the feelins and is pretty much ruled by feelin  would the savages let father go if judith and i give them all our best things demanded hetty in her innocent mild manner  their women might interfere good hetty yes their women might interfere with such an ind in view but tell me sarpent how is it as to squaws among the knaves have they many of their own women in the camp  the delaware heard and understood all that passed though with indian gravity and finesse he had sat with averted face seemingly inattentive to a discourse in which he had no direct concern thus appealed to however he answered his friend in his ordinary sententious manner  six he said holding up all the fingers of one hand and the thumb of the other besides this the last number denoted his betrothed whom with the poetry and truth of nature he described by laying his hand on his own heart  did you see her chiefdid you get a glimpse of her pleasant countenance or come close enough to her ear to sing in it the song she loves to hear  no deerslayerthe trees were too many and leaves covered their boughs like clouds hiding the heavens in a storm butand the young warrior turned his dark face towards his friend with a smile on it that illuminated its fiercelooking paint and naturally stern lineaments with a bright gleam of human feeling chingachgook heard the laugh of wahtawah and knew it from the laugh of the women of the iroquois it sounded in his ears like the chirp of the wren  ay trust a lovyers ear for that and a delawares ear for all sounds that are ever heard in the woods i know not why it is so judith but when young menand i dares to say it may be all the same with young women toobut when they get to have kind feelins towards each other its wonderful how pleasant the laugh or the speech becomes to the other person ive seen grim warriors listening to the chattering and the laughing of young gals as if it was church music such as is heard in the old dutch church that stands in the great street of albany where ive been more than once with peltry and game  and you deerslayer said judith quickly and with more sensibility than marked her usually light and thoughtless mannerhave you never felt how pleasant it is to listen to the laugh of the girl you love  lord bless you galwhy ive never lived enough among my own colour to drop into them sort of feelinsno never i dares to say they are natral and right but to me theres no music so sweet as the sighing of the wind in the tree tops and the rippling of a stream from a full sparkling natyve fountain of pure forest waterunless indeed he continued dropping his head for an instant in a thoughtful mannerunless indeed it be the open mouth of a sartain hound when im on the track of a fat buck as for unsartain dogs i care little for their cries seein they are as likely to speak when the deer is not in sight as when it is  judith walked slowly and pensively away nor was there any of her ordinary calculating coquetry in the light tremulous sigh that unconsciously to herself arose to her lips on the other hand hetty listened with guileless attention though it struck her simple mind as singular that the young man should prefer the melody of the woods to the songs of girls or even to the laugh of innocence and joy accustomed however to defer in most things to her sister she soon followed judith into the cabin where she took a seat and remained pondering intensely over some occurrence or resolution or opinionwhich was a secret to all but herself left alone deerslayer and his friend resumed their discourse  has the young paleface hunter been long on this lake demanded the delaware after courteously waiting for the other to speak first  only since yesterday noon sarpent though that has been long enough to see and do much the gaze that the indian fastened on his companion was so keen that it seemed to mock the gathering darkness of the night as the other furtively returned his look he saw the two black eyes glistening on him like the balls of the panther or those of the penned wolf he understood the meaning of this glowing gaze and answered evasively as he fancied would best become the modesty of a white mans gifts  tis as you suspect sarpent yes tis somewhat thataway i have fell in with the inimy and i suppose it may be said ive fout them too  an exclamation of delight and exultation escaped the indian and then laying his hand eagerly on the arm of his friend he asked if there were any scalps taken  that i will maintain in the face of all the delaware tribe old tamenund and your own father the great uncas as well as the rest is agin white gifts my scalp is on my head as you can see sarpent and that was the only scalp that was in danger when one side was altogether christian and white  did no warrior falldeerslayer did not get his name by being slow of sight or clumsy with the rifle  in that particular chief youre nearer reason and therefore nearer being right i may say one mingo fell  a chief demanded the other with startling vehemence  nay thats more than i know or can say he was artful and treacherous and stouthearted and may well have gained popularity enough with his people to be named to that rank the man fout well though his eye wasnt quick enough for one who had had his schooling in your company delaware  my brother and friend struck the body  that was uncalled for seeing that the mingo died in my arms the truth may as well be said at once he fout like a man of red gifts and i fout like a man with gifts of my own colour god gave me the victory i coulnt fly in the face of his providence by forgetting my birth and natur white he made me and white i shall live and die  good deerslayer is a paleface and has paleface hands a delaware will look for the scalp and hang it on a pole and sing a song in his honour when we go back to our people the glory belongs to the tribe it must not be lost  this is easy talking but twill not be as easy doing the mingos body is in the hands of his frinds and no doubt is hid in some hole where delaware cunning will never be able to get at the scalp  the young man then gave his friend a succinct but clear account of the event of the morning concealing nothing of any moment and yet touching on every thing modestly and with a careful attention to avoid the indian habit of boasting chingachgook again expressed his satisfaction at the honour won by his friend and then both arose the hour having arrived when it became prudent to move the ark further from the land  it was now quite dark the heavens having become clouded and the stars hid the north wind had ceasedas was usual with the setting of the sun and a light air arose from the south this change favoring the design of deerslayer he lifted his grapnel and the scow immediately and quite perceptibly began to drift more into the lake the sail was set when the motion of the craft increased to a rate not much less than two miles in the hour as this superseded the necessity of rowing an occupation that an indian would not be likely to desire deerslayer chingachgook and judith seated themselves in the stern of the scow where they first governed its movements by holding the oar here they discoursed on their future movements and on the means that ought to be used in order to effect the liberation of their friends  in this dialogue judith held a material part the delaware readily understanding all she said while his own replies and remarks both of which were few and pithy were occasionally rendered into english by his friend judith rose greatly in the estimation of her companions in the half hour that followed prompt of resolution and firm of purpose her suggestions and expedients partook of her spirit and sagacity both of which were of a character to find favor with men of the frontier the events that had occurred since their meeting as well as her isolated and dependant situation induced the girl to feel towards deerslayer like the friend of a year instead of an acquaintance of a day and so completely had she been won by his guileless truth of character and of feeling pure novelties in our sex as respected her own experience that his peculiarities excited her curiosity and created a confidence that had never been awakened by any other man hitherto she had been compelled to stand on the defensive in her intercourse with men with what success was best known to herself but here had she been suddenly thrown into the society and under the protection of a youth who evidently as little contemplated evil towards herself as if he had been her brother the freshness of his integrity the poetry and truth of his feelings and even the quaintness of his forms of speech all had their influence and aided in awakening an interest that she found as pure as it was sudden and deep hurrys fine face and manly form had never compensated for his boisterous and vulgar tone and her intercourse with the officers had prepared her to make comparisons under which even his great natural advantages suffered but this very intercourse with the officers who occasionally came upon the lake to fish and hunt had an effect in producing her present sentiments towards the young stranger with them while her vanity had been gratified and her selflove strongly awakened she had many causes deeply to regret the acquaintanceif not to mourn over it in secret sorrowfor it was impossible for one of her quick intellect not to perceive how hollow was the association between superior and inferior and that she was regarded as the play thing of an idle hour rather than as an equal and a friend by even the best intentioned and least designing of her scarletclad admirers deerslayer on the other hand had a window in his breast through which the light of his honesty was ever shining and even his indifference to charms that so rarely failed to produce a sensation piqued the pride of the girl and gave him an interest that another seemingly more favored by nature might have failed to excite  in this manner half an hour passed during which time the ark had been slowly stealing over the water the darkness thickening around it though it was easy to see that the gloom of the forest at the southern end of the lake was getting to be distant while the mountains that lined the sides of the beautiful basin were overshadowing it nearly from side to side there was indeed a narrow stripe of water in the centre of the lake where the dim light that was still shed from the heavens fell upon its surface in a line extending north and south and along this faint track a sort of inverted milky way in which the obscurity was not quite as dense as in other places the scow held her course he who steered well knowing that it led in the direction he wished to go the reader is not to suppose however that any difficulty could exist as to the course this would have been determined by that of the air had it not been possible to distinguish the mountains as well as by the dim opening to the south which marked the position of the valley in that quarter above the plain of tall trees by a sort of lessened obscurity the difference between the darkness of the forest and that of the night as seen only in the air the peculiarities at length caught the attention of judith and the deerslayer and the conversation ceased to allow each to gaze at the solemn stillness and deep repose of nature  tis a gloomy night observed the girl after a pause of several minutesi hope we may be able to find the castle  little fear of our missing that if we keep this path in the middle of the lake returned the young man natur has made us a road here and dim as it is therell be little difficulty following it  do you hear nothing deerslayerit seemed as if the water was stirring quite near us  sartainly something did move the water oncommon like must have been a fish them creaturs prey upon each other like men and animals on the land one has leaped into the air and fallen hard back into his own element tis of little use judith for any to strive to get out of their elements since its natur to stay in em and natur will have its way ha that sounds like a paddle used with more than common caution  at this moment the delaware bent forward and pointed significantly into the boundary of gloom as if some object had suddenly caught his eye both deerslayer and judith followed the direction of his gesture and each got a view of a canoe at the same instant the glimpse of this startling neighbor was dim and to eyes less practised it might have been uncertain though to those in the ark the object was evidently a canoe with a single individual in it the latter standing erect and paddling how many lay concealed in its bottom of course could not be known flight by means of oars from a bark canoe impelled by vigorous and skilful hands was utterly impracticable and each of the men seized his rifle in expectation of a conflict  i can easily bring down the paddler whispered deerslayer but well first hail him and ask his arrnd then raising his voice he continued in a solemn mannerhold if ye come nearer i must fire though contrary to my wishes and then sartain death will follow stop paddling and answer  fire and slay a poor defenseless girl returned a soft tremulous female voice and god will never forgive you go your way deerslayer and let me go mine  hetty exclaimed the young man and judith in a breath and the former sprang instantly to the spot where he had left the canoe they had been towing it was gone and he understood the whole affair as for the fugitive frightened at the menace she ceased paddling and remained dimly visible resembling a spectral outline of a human form standing on the water at the next moment the sail was lowered to prevent the ark from passing the spot where the canoe lay this last expedient however was not taken in time for the momentum of so heavy a craft and the impulsion of the air soon set her by bringing hetty directly to windward though still visible as the change in the positions of the two boats now placed her in that species of milky way which has been mentioned  what can this mean judith demanded deerslayerwhy has your sister taken the canoe and left us  you know she is feebleminded poor girland she has her own ideas of what ought to be done she loves her father more than most children love their parentsandthen  then what gal this is a trying moment one in which truth must be spoken  judith felt a generous and womanly regret at betraying her sister and she hesitated ere she spoke again but once more urged by deerslayer and conscious herself of all the risks the whole party was running by the indiscretion of hetty she could refrain no longer  then i fear poor weakminded hetty has not been altogether able to see all the vanity and rudeness and folly that lie hid behind the handsome face and fine form of hurry harry she talks of him in her sleep and sometimes betrays the inclination in her waking moments  you think judith that your sister is now bent on some mad scheme to serve her father and hurry which will in all likelihood give them riptyles the mingos the mastership of a canoe  such i fear will turn out to be the fact deerslayer poor hetty has hardly sufficient cunning to outwit a savage  all this while the canoe with the form of hetty erect in one end of it was dimly perceptible though the greater drift of the ark rendered it at each instant less and less distinct it was evident no time was to be lost lest it should altogether disappear the rifles were now laid aside as useless the two men seizing the oars and sweeping the head of the scow round in the direction of the canoe judith accustomed to the office flew to the other end of the ark and placed herself at what might be called the helm hetty took the alarm at these preparations which could not be made without noise and started off like a bird that had been suddenly put up by the approach of unexpected danger  as deerslayer and his companion rowed with the energy of those who felt the necessity of straining every nerve and hettys strength was impaired by a nervous desire to escape the chase would have quickly terminated in the capture of the fugitive had not the girl made several short and unlookedfor deviations in her course these turnings gave her time and they had also the effect of gradually bringing both canoe and ark within the deeper gloom cast by the shadows from the hills they also gradually increased the distance between the fugitive and her pursuers until judith called out to her companions to cease rowing for she had completely lost sight of the canoe  when this mortifying announcement was made hetty was actually so near as to understand every syllable her sister uttered though the latter had used the precaution of speaking as low as circumstances would allow her to do and to make herself heard hetty stopped paddling at the same moment and waited the result with an impatience that was breathless equally from her late exertions and her desire to land a dead silence immediately fell on the lake during which the three in the ark were using their senses differently in order to detect the position of the canoe judith bent forward to listen in the hope of catching some sound that might betray the direction in which her sister was stealing away while her two companions brought their eyes as near as possible to a level with the water in order to detect any object that might be floating on its surface all was vain however for neither sound nor sight rewarded their efforts all this time hetty who had not the cunning to sink into the canoe stood erect a finger pressed on her lips gazing in the direction in which the voices had last been heard resembling a statue of profound and timid attention her ingenuity had barely sufficed to enable her to seize the canoe and to quit the ark in the noiseless manner related and then it appeared to be momentarily exhausted even the doublings of the canoe had been as much the consequence of an uncertain hand and of nervous agitation as of any craftiness or calculation  the pause continued several minutes during which deerslayer and the delaware conferred together in the language of the latter then the oars dipped again and the ark moved away rowing with as little noise as possible it steered westward a little southerly or in the direction of the encampment of the enemy having reached a point at no great distance from the shore and where the obscurity was intense on account of the proximity of the land it lay there near an hour in waiting for the expected approach of hetty who it was thought would make the best of her way to that spot as soon as she believed herself released from the danger of pursuit no success rewarded this little blockade however neither appearance nor sound denoting the passage of the canoe disappointed at this failure and conscious of the importance of getting possession of the fortress before it could be seized by the enemy deerslayer now took his way towards the castle with the apprehension that all his foresight in securing the canoes would be defeated by this unguarded and alarming movement on the part of the feebleminded hetty    chapter x       but who in this wild wood     may credit give to either eye or ear     from rocky precipice or hollow cave     midst the confused sound of rustling leaves     and creaking boughs and cries of nightly birds     returning seeming answer      joanna baihie rayner a tragedy iil34 6g  fear as much as calculation had induced hetty to cease paddling when she found that her pursuers did not know in which direction to proceed she remained stationary until the ark had pulled in near the encampment as has been related in the preceding chapter when she resumed the paddle and with cautious strokes made the best of her way towards the western shore in order to avoid her pursuers however who she rightly suspected would soon be rowing along that shore themselves the head of the canoe was pointed so far north as to bring her to land on a point that thrust itself into the lake at the distance of near a league from the outlet nor was this altogether the result of a desire to escape for feeble minded as she was hetty hutter had a good deal of that instinctive caution which so often keeps those whom god has thus visited from harm she was perfectly aware of the importance of keeping the canoes from falling into the hands of the iroquois and long familiarity with the lake had suggested one of the simplest expedients by which this great object could be rendered compatible with her own purpose  the point in question was the first projection that offered on that side of the lake where a canoe if set adrift with a southerly air would float clear of the land and where it would be no great violation of probabilities to suppose it might even hit the castle the latter lying above it almost in a direct line with the wind such then was hettys intention and she landed on the extremity of the gravelly point beneath an overhanging oak with the express intention of shoving the canoe off from the shore in order that it might drift up towards her fathers insulated abode she knew too from the logs that occasionally floated about the lake that did it miss the castle and its appendages the wind would be likely to change before the canoe could reach the northern extremity of the lake and that deerslayer might have an opportunity of regaining it in the morning when no doubt he would be earnestly sweeping the surface of the water and the whole of its wooded shores with glass in all this too hetty was less governed by any chain of reasoning than by her habits the latter often supplying the place of mind in human beings as they perform the same for animals of the inferior classes  the girl was quite an hour finding her way to the point the distance and the obscurity equally detaining her but she was no sooner on the gravelly beach than she prepared to set the canoe adrift in the manner mentioned while in the act of pushing it from her she heard low voices that seemed to come among the trees behind her startled at this unexpected danger hetty was on the point of springing into the canoe in order to seek safety in flight when she thought she recognized the tones of judiths melodious voice bending forward so as to catch the sounds more directly they evidently came from the water and then she understood that the ark was approaching from the south and so close in with the western shore as necessarily to cause it to pass the point within twenty yards of the spot where she stood here then was all she could desire the canoe was shoved off into the lake leaving its late occupant alone on the narrow strand  when this act of selfdevotion was performed hetty did not retire the foliage of the overhanging trees and bushes would have almost concealed her person had there been light but in that obscurity it was utterly impossible to discover any object thus shaded at the distance of a few feet flight too was perfectly easy as twenty steps would effectually bury her in the forest she remained therefore watching with intense anxiety the result of her expedient intending to call the attention of the others to the canoe with her voice should they appear to pass without observing it the ark approached under its sail again deerslayer standing in its bow with judith near him and the delaware at the helm it would seem that in the bay below it had got too close to the shore in the lingering hope of intercepting hetty for as it came nearer the latter distinctly heard the directions that the young man forward gave to his companion aft in order to clear the point  lay her head more off the shore delaware said deerslayer for the third time speaking in english that his fair companion might understand his wordslay her head well off shore we have got embayed here and needs keep the mast clear of the trees judith theres a canoe  the last words were uttered with great earnestness and deerslayers hand was on his rifle ere they were fairly out of his mouth but the truth flashed on the mind of the quickwitted girl and she instantly told her companion that the boat must be that in which her sister had fled  keep the scow straight delaware steer as straight as your bullet flies when sent agin a buck therei have it  the canoe was seized and immediately secured again to the side of the ark at the next moment the sail was lowered and the motion of the ark arrested by means of the oars  hetty called out judith concern even affection betraying itself in her tones are you within hearing sisterfor gods sake answer and let me hear the sound of your voice again hettydear hetty  im here judithhere on the shore where it will be useless to follow me as i will hide in the woods  oh hetty what ist you do remember tis drawing near midnight and that the woods are filled with savages and wild beasts  neither will harm a poor halfwitted girl judith god is as much with me here as he would be in the ark or in the hut i am going to help my father and poor hurry harry who will be tortured and slain unless some one cares for them  we all care for them and intend tomorrow to send them a flag of truce to buy their ransom come back then sister trust to us who have better heads than you and who will do all we can for father  i know your head is better than mine judith for mine is very weak to be sure but i must go to father and poor hurry do you and deerslayer keep the castle sister leave me in the hands of god   god is with us all hettyin the castle or on the shorefather as well as ourselves and it is sinful not to trust to his goodness you can do nothing in the dark will lose your way in the forest and perish for want of food  god will not let that happen to a poor child that goes to serve her father sister i must try and find the savages  come back for this night only in the morning we will put you ashore and leave you to do as you may think right  you say so judith and you think so but you would not your heart would soften and youd see tomahawks and scalping knives in the air besides ive got a thing to tell the indian chief that will answer all our wishes and im afraid i may forget it if i dont tell it to him at once youll see that he will let father go as soon as he hears it  poor hetty what can you say to a ferocious savage that will be likely to change his bloody purpose  that which will frighten him and make him let father go returned the simpleminded girl positively youll see sister youll see how soon it will bring him to like a gentle child  will you tell me hetty what you intend to say asked deerslayer i know the savages well and can form some idee how far fair words will be likely or not to work on their bloody naturs if its not suited to the gifts of a redskin twill be of no use for reason goes by gifts as well as conduct  well then answered hetty dropping her voice to a low confidential tone for the stillness of the night and the nearness of the ark permitted her to do this and still to be heardwell then deerslayer as you seem a good and honest young man i will tell you i mean not to say a word to any of the savages until i get face to face with their head chief let them plague me with as many questions as they please ill answer none of them unless it be to tell them to lead me to their wisest manthen deerslayer ill tell him that god will not forgive murder and thefts and that if father and hurry did go after the scalps of the iroquois he must return good for evil for so the bible commands else he will go into everlasting punishment when he hears this and feels it to be true as feel it he must how long will it be before he sends father and hurry and me to the shore opposite the castle telling us all three to go our way in peace  the last question was put in a triumphant manner and then the simpleminded girl laughed at the impression she never doubted that her project had made on her auditors deerslayer was dumbfounded at this proof of guileless feebleness of mind but judith had suddenly bethought her of a means of counteracting this wild project by acting on the very feelings that had given it birth without adverting to the closing question or the laugh therefore she hurriedly called to her sister by name as one suddenly impressed with the importance of what she had to say but no answer was given to the call  by the snapping of twigs and the rustling of leaves hetty had evidently quitted the shore and was already burying herself in the forest to follow would have been fruitless since the darkness as well as the dense cover that the woods everywhere offered would have rendered her capture next to impossible and there was also the never ceasing danger of falling into the hands of their enemies after a short and melancholy discussion therefore the sail was again set and the ark pursued its course towards its habitual moorings deerslayer silently felicitating himself on the recovery of the canoe and brooding over his plans for the morrow the wind rose as the party quitted the point and in less than an hour they reached the castle here all was found as it had been left and the reverse of the ceremonies had to be taken in entering the building that had been used on quitting it judith occupied a solitary bed that night bedewing the pillow with her tears as she thought of the innocent and hitherto neglected creature who had been her companion from childhood and bitter regrets came over her mind from more causes than one as the weary hours passed away making it nearly morning before she lost her recollection in sleep deerslayer and the delaware took their rest in the ark where we shall leave them enjoying the deep sleep of the honest the healthful and fearless to return to the girl we have last seen in the midst of the forest  when hetty left the shore she took her way unhesitatingly into the woods with a nervous apprehension of being followed luckily this course was the best she could have hit on to effect her own purpose since it was the only one that led her from the point the night was so intensely dark beneath the branches of the trees that her progress was very slow and the direction she went altogether a matter of chance after the first few yards the formation of the ground however did not permit her to deviate far from the line in which she desired to proceed on one hand it was soon bounded by the acclivity of the hill while the lake on the other served as a guide for two hours did this singlehearted and simpleminded girl toil through the mazes of the forest sometimes finding herself on the brow of the bank that bounded the water and at others struggling up an ascent that warned her to go no farther in that direction since it necessarily ran at right angles to the course on which she wished to proceed her feet often slid from beneath her and she got many falls though none to do her injury but by the end of the period mentioned she had become so weary as to want strength to go any farther rest was indispensable and she set about preparing a bed with the readiness and coolness of one to whom the wilderness presented no unnecessary terrors she knew that wild beasts roamed through all the adjacent forest but animals that preyed on the human species were rare and of dangerous serpents there were literally none these facts had been taught her by her father and whatever her feeble mind received at all it received so confidingly as to leave her no uneasiness from any doubts or scepticism to her the sublimity of the solitude in which she was placed was soothing rather than appalling and she gathered a bed of leaves with as much indifference to the circumstances that would have driven the thoughts of sleep entirely from the minds of most of her sex as if she had been preparing her place of nightly rest beneath the paternal roof as soon as hetty had collected a sufficient number of the dried leaves to protect her person from the damps of the ground she kneeled beside the humble pile clasped her raised hands in an attitude of deep devotion and in a soft low but audible voice repeated the lords prayer this was followed by those simple and devout verses so familiar to children in which she recommended her soul to god should it be called away to another state of existence ere the return of morning this duty done she lay down and disposed herself to sleep the attire of the girl though suited to the season was sufficiently warm for all ordinary purposes but the forest is ever cool and the nights of that elevated region of country have always a freshness about them that renders clothing more necessary than is commonly the case in the summers of a low latitude this had been foreseen by hetty who had brought with her a coarse heavy mantle which when laid over her body answered all the useful purposes of a blanket thus protected she dropped asleep in a few minutes as tranquilly as if watched over by the guardian care of that mother who had so recently been taken from her forever affording in this particular a most striking contrast between her own humble couch and the sleepless pillow of her sister  hour passed after hour in a tranquility as undisturbed and a rest as sweet as if angels expressly commissioned for that object watched around the bed of hetty hutter not once did her soft eyes open until the grey of the dawn came struggling through the tops of the trees falling on their lids and united to the freshness of a summers morning giving the usual summons to awake ordinarily hetty was up ere the rays of the sun tipped the summits of the mountains but on this occasion her fatigue had been so great and her rest was so profound that the customary warnings failed of their effect the girl murmured in her sleep threw an arm forward smiled as gently as an infant in its cradle but still slumbered in making this unconscious gesture her hand fell on some object that was warm and in the half unconscious state in which she lay she connected the circumstance with her habits at the next moment a rude attack was made on her side as if a rooting animal were thrusting its snout beneath with a desire to force her position and then uttering the name of judith she awoke as the startled girl arose to a sitting attitude she perceived that some dark object sprang from her scattering the leaves and snapping the fallen twigs in its haste opening her eyes and recovering from the first confusion and astonishment of her situation hetty perceived a cub of the common american brown bear balancing itself on its hinder legs and still looking towards her as if doubtful whether it would be safe to trust itself near her person again the first impulse of hetty who had been mistress of several of these cubs was to run and seize the little creature as a prize but a loud growl warned her of the danger of such a procedure recoiling a few steps the girl looked hurriedly round and perceived the dam watching her movements with fiery eyes at no great distance a hollow tree that once been the home of bees having recently fallen the mother with two more cubs was feasting on the dainty food that this accident had placed within her reach while the first kept a jealous eye on the situation of its truant and reckless young  it would exceed all the means of human knowledge to presume to analyze the influences that govern the acts of the lower animals on this occasion the dam though proverbially fierce when its young is thought to be in danger manifested no intention to attack the girl it quitted the honey and advanced to a place within twenty feet of her where it raised itself on its hind legs and balanced its body in a sort of angry growling discontent but approached no nearer happily hetty did not fly on the contrary though not without terror she knelt with her face towards the animal and with clasped hands and uplifted eyes repeated the prayer of the previous night this act of devotion was not the result of alarm but it was a duty she never neglected to perform ere she slept and when the return of consciousness awoke her to the business of the day as the girl arose from her knees the bear dropped on its feet again and collecting its cubs around her permitted them to draw their natural sustenance hetty was delighted with this proof of tenderness in an animal that has but a very indifferent reputation for the gentler feelings and as a cub would quit its mother to frisk and leap about in wantonness she felt a strong desire again to catch it up in her arms and play with it but admonished by the growl she had selfcommand sufficient not to put this dangerous project in execution and recollecting her errand among the hills she tore herself away from the group and proceeded on her course along the margin of the lake of which she now caught glimpses again through the trees to her surprise though not to her alarm the family of bears arose and followed her steps keeping a short distance behind her apparently watching every movement as if they had a near interest in all she did  in this manner escorted by the dam and cubs the girl proceeded nearly a mile thrice the distance she had been able to achieve in the darkness during the same period of time she then reached a brook that had dug a channel for itself into the earth and went brawling into the lake between steep and high banks covered with trees here hetty performed her ablutions then drinking of the pure mountain water she went her way refreshed and lighter of heart still attended by her singular companions her course now lay along a broad and nearly level terrace which stretched from the top of the bank that bounded the water to a low acclivity that rose to a second and irregular platform above this was at a part of the valley where the mountains ran obliquely forming the commencement of a plain that spread between the hills southward of the sheet of water hetty knew by this circumstance that she was getting near to the encampment and had she not the bears would have given her warning of the vicinity of human beings snuffing the air the dam refused to follow any further though the girl looked back and invited her to come by childish signs and even by direct appeals made in her own sweet voice it was while making her way slowly through some bushes in this manner with averted face and eyes riveted on the immovable animals that the girl suddenly found her steps arrested by a human hand that was laid lightly on her shoulder  where go said a soft female voice speaking hurriedly and in concernindianred man savagewicked warriorthataway  this unexpected salutation alarmed the girl no more than the presence of the fierce inhabitants of the woods it took her a little by surprise it is true but she was in a measure prepared for some such meeting and the creature who stopped her was as little likely to excite terror as any who ever appeared in the guise of an indian it was a girl not much older than herself whose smile was sunny as judiths in her brightest moments whose voice was melody itself and whose accents and manner had all the rebuked gentleness that characterizes the sex among a people who habitually treat their women as the attendants and servitors of the warriors beauty among the women of the aboriginal americans before they have become exposed to the hardships of wives and mothers is by no means uncommon in this particular the original owners of the country were not unlike their more civilized successors nature appearing to have bestowed that delicacy of mien and outline that forms so great a charm in the youthful female but of which they are so early deprived and that too as much by the habits of domestic life as from any other cause  the girl who had so suddenly arrested the steps of hetty was dressed in a calico mantle that effectually protected all the upper part of her person while a short petticoat of blue cloth edged with gold lace that fell no lower than her knees leggings of the same and moccasins of deerskin completed her attire her hair fell in long dark braids down her shoulders and back and was parted above a low smooth forehead in a way to soften the expression of eyes that were full of archness and natural feeling her face was oval with delicate features the teeth were even and white while the mouth expressed a melancholy tenderness as if it wore this peculiar meaning in intuitive perception of the fate of a being who was doomed from birth to endure a womans sufferings relieved by a womans affections her voice as has been already intimated was soft as the sighing of the night air a characteristic of the females of her race but which was so conspicuous in herself as to have produced for her the name of wahtawah which rendered into english means histohhist  in a word this was the betrothed of chingachgook whohaving succeeded in lulling their suspicions was permitted to wander around the encampment of her captors this indulgence was in accordance with the general policy of the red man who well knew moreover that her trail could have been easily followed in the event of flight it will also be remembered that the iroquois or hurons as it would be better to call them were entirely ignorant of the proximity of her lover a fact indeed that she did not know herself  it is not easy to say which manifested the most selfpossession at this unexpected meeting the paleface or the red girl but though a little surprised wahtawah was the most willing to speak and far the readier in foreseeing consequences as well as in devising means to avert them her father during her childhood had been much employed as a warrior by the authorities of the colony and dwelling for several years near the forts she had caught a knowledge of the english tongue which she spoke in the usual abbreviated manner of an indian but fluently and without any of the ordinary reluctance of her people  where go repeated wahtawah returning the smile of hetty in her own gentle winning mannerwicked warrior thatawaygood warrior far off  whats your name asked hetty with the simplicity of a child  wahtawah i no mingogood delawareyengeese friend mingo cruel and love scalp for blooddelaware love him for honor come here where no eyes  wahtawah now led her companion towards the lake descending the bank so as to place its overhanging trees and bushes between them and any probable observers nor did she stop until they were both seated side by side on a fallen log one end of which actually lay buried in the water  why you come for the young indian eagerly inquiredwhere you come for hetty told her tale in her own simple and truthloving manner she explained the situation of her father and stated her desire to serve him and if possible to procure his release  why your father come to mingo camp in night asked the indian girl with a directness which if not borrowed from the other partook largely of its sincerity he know it wartime and he no boyhe no want beardno want to be told iroquois carry tomahawk and knife and rifle why he come night time seize me by hair and try to scalp delaware girl  you said hetty almost sickening with horrordid he seize youdid he try to scalp you  why no delaware scalp sell for much as mingo scalp governor no tell difference wicked ting for paleface to scalp no his gifts as the good deerslayer always tell me  and do you know the deerslayer said hetty coloring with delight and surprise forgetting her regrets at the moment in the influence of this new feeling i know him too he is now in the ark with judith and a delaware who is called the big serpent a bold and handsome warrior is this serpent too  spite of the rich deep colour that nature had bestowed on the indian beauty the telltale blood deepened on her cheeks until the blush gave new animation and intelligence to her jetblack eyes raising a finger in an attitude of warning she dropped her voice already so soft and sweet nearly to a whisper as she continued the discourse  chingachgook returned the delaware girl sighing out the harsh name in sounds so softly guttural as to cause it to reach the ear in melodyhis father uncasgreat chief of the mahicanninext to old tamenundmore as warrior not so much gray hair and less at council fire you know serpent  he joined us last evening and was in the ark with me for two or three hours before i left it im afraid hist hetty could not pronounce the indian name of her new friend but having heard deerslayer give her this familiar appellation she used it without any of the ceremony of civilized lifeim afraid hist he has come after scalps as well as my poor father and hurry harry  why he shouldntha chingachgook red warriorvery redscalp make his honorbe sure he take him  then said hetty earnestly he will be as wicked as any other god will not pardon in a red man what he will not pardon in a white man  no true returned the delaware girl with a warmth that nearly amounted to passion no true i tell you the manitou smile and pleased when he see young warrior come back from the war path with two ten hundred scalp on a pole chingachgook father take scalpgrandfather take scalpall old chief take scalp and chingachgook take as many scalp as he can carry himself  then hist his sleep of nights must be terrible to think of no one can be cruel and hope to be forgiven  no cruelplenty forgiven returned wahtawah stamping her little foot on the stony strand and shaking her head in a way to show how completely feminine feeling in one of its aspects had gotten the better of feminine feeling in another i tell you serpent brave he go home this time with fouryestwo scalp  and is that his errand heredid he really come all this distance across mountain and valley rivers and lakes to torment his fellow creatures and do so wicked a thing  this question at once appeased the growing ire of the halfoffended indian beauty it completely got the better of the prejudices of education and turned all her thoughts to a gentler and more feminine channel at first she looked around her suspiciously as if distrusting eavesdroppers then she gazed wistfully into the face of her attentive companion after which this exhibition of girlish coquetry and womanly feeling terminated by her covering her face with both her hands and laughing in a strain that might well be termed the melody of the woods dread of discovery however soon put a stop to this naive exhibition of feeling and removing her hands this creature of impulses gazed again wistfully into the face of her companion as if inquiring how far she might trust a stranger with her secret although hetty had no claims to her sisters extraordinary beauty many thought her countenance the most winning of the two it expressed all the undisguised sincerity of her character and it was totally free from any of the unpleasant physical accompaniments that so frequently attend mental imbecility it is true that one accustomed to closer observations than common might have detected the proofs of her feebleness of intellect in the language of her sometimes vacant eyes but they were signs that attracted sympathy by their total want of guile rather than by any other feeling the effect on hist to use the english and more familiar translation of the name was favorable and yielding to an impulse of tenderness she threw her arms around hetty and embraced her with an outpouring emotion so natural that it was only equaled by its warmth  you good whispered the young indianyou good i know it so long since wahtawah have a frienda sisterany body to speak her heart to you hist friend dont i say trut  i never had a friend answered hetty returning the warm embrace with unfeigned earnestness ive a sister but no friend judith loves me and i love judith but thats natural and as we are taught in the biblebut i should like to have a friend ill be your friend with all my heart for i like your voice and your smile and your way of thinking in every thing except about the scalps  no tink more of himno say more of scalp interrupted hist soothinglyyou paleface i redskin we

warrior some time that great shame my name wahtawah that say hist in your tongue you call him histi call him hetty  these preliminaries settled to their mutual satisfaction the two girls began to discourse of their several hopes and projects hetty made her new friend more fully acquainted with her intentions in behalf of her father and to one in the least addicted to prying into the affairs hist would have betrayed her own feelings and expectations in connection with the young warrior of her own tribe enough was revealed on both sides however to let each party get a tolerable insight into the views of the other though enough still remained in mental reservation to give rise to the following questions and answers with which the interview in effect closed as the quickest witted hist was the first with her interrogatories folding an arm about the waist of hetty she bent her head so as to look up playfully into the face of the other and laughing as if her meaning were to be extracted from her looks she spoke more plainly  hetty got broder as well as fader she saidwhy no talk of broder as well as fader  i have no brother hist i had one once they say but he is dead many a year and lies buried in the lake by the side of my mother  no got brodergot a young warriorlove him almost as much as fader eh very handsome and bravelooking fit to be chief if he good as he seem to be  its wicked to love any man as well as i love my father and so i strive not to do it hist returned the conscientious hetty who knew not how to conceal an emotion by an approach to an untruth as venial as an evasion though powerfully tempted by female shame to err though i sometimes think wickedness will get the better of me if hurry comes so often to the lake i must tell you the truth dear hist because you ask me but i should fall down and die in the woods if he knew it  why he no ask you himselfbrave lookingwhy not bold speaking young warrior ought to ask young girl no make young girl speak first mingo girls too shame for that  this was said indignantly and with the generous warmth a young female of spirit would be apt to feel at what she deemed an invasion of her sexs most valued privilege it had little influence on the simpleminded but also justminded hetty who though inherently feminine in all her impulses was much more alive to the workings of her own heart than to any of the usages with which convention has protected the sensitiveness of her sex  ask me what the startled girl demanded with a suddenness that proved how completely her fears had been aroused ask me if i like him as well as i do my own father oh i hope he will never put such a question to me for i should have to answer and that would kill me  nonono kill quitealmost returned the other laughing in spite of herself make blush comemake shame come too but he no stay great while then feel happier than ever young warrior must tell young girl he want to make wife else never can live in his wigwam  hurry dont want to marry menobody will ever want to marry me hist  how you can know praps every body want to marry you and byandbye tongue say what heart feel why nobody want to marry you  i am not full witted they say father often tells me this and so does judith sometimes when she is vexed but i shouldnt so much mind them as i did mother she said so once and then she cried as if her heart would break and so i know im not full witted  hist gazed at the gentle simple girl for quite a minute without speaking and then the truth appeared to flash all at once on the mind of the young indian maid pity reverence and tenderness seemed struggling together in her breast and then rising suddenly she indicated a wish to her companion that she would accompany her to the camp which was situated at no great distance this unexpected change from the precautions that hist had previously manifested a desire to use in order to prevent being seen to an open exposure of the person of her friend arose from the perfect conviction that no indian would harm a being whom the great spirit had disarmed by depriving it of its strongest defence reason in this respect nearly all unsophisticated nations resemble each other appearing to offer spontaneously by a feeling creditable to human nature that protection by their own forbearance which has been withheld by the inscrutable wisdom of providence wahtawah indeed knew that in many tribes the mentally imbecile and the mad were held in a species of religious reverence receiving from these untutored inhabitants of the forest respect and honors instead of the contumely and neglect that it is their fortune to meet with among the more pretending and sophisticated  hetty accompanied her new friend without apprehension or reluctance it was her wish to reach the camp and sustained by her motives she felt no more concern for the consequences than did her companion herself now the latter was apprised of the character of the protection that the paleface maiden carried with her still as they proceeded slowly along a shore that was tangled with overhanging bushes hetty continued the discourse assuming the office of interrogating which the other had instantly dropped as soon as she ascertained the character of the mind to which her questions had been addressed  but you are not halfwitted said hetty and theres no reason why the serpent should not marry you  hist prisoner and mingo got big ear no speak of chingachgook when they by promise hist that good hetty  i knowi know returned hetty halfwhispering in her eagerness to let the other see she understood the necessity of caution i knowdeerslayer and the serpent mean to get you away from the iroquois and you wish me not to tell the secret  how you know said hist hastily vexed at the moment that the other was not even more feeble minded than was actually the case how you know better not talk of any but fader and hurrymingo understand dat he no understand tudder promise you no talk about what you no understand  but i do understand this hist and so i must talk about it deerslayer as good as told father all about it in my presence and as nobody told me not to listen i overheard it all as i did hurry and fathers discourse about the scalps  very bad for palefaces to talk about scalps and very bad for young woman to hear now you love hist i know hetty and so among injins when love hardest never talk most  thats not the way among white people who talk most about them they love best i suppose its because im only halfwitted that i dont see the reason why it should be so different among red people  that what deerslayer call gift one gift to talk tudder gift to hold tongue hold tongue your gift among mingos if sarpent want to see hist so hetty want to see hurry good girl never tell secret of friend  hetty understood this appeal and she promised the delaware girl not to make any allusion to the presence of chingachgook or to the motive of his visit to the lake  maybe he get off hurry and fader as well as hist if let him have his way whispered wahtawah to her companion in a confiding flattering way just as they got near enough to the encampment to hear the voices of several of their own sex who were apparently occupied in the usual toils of women of their class tink of dat hetty and put two twenty finger on mouth no get friend free without sarpent do it  a better expedient could not have been adopted to secure the silence and discretion of hetty than that which was now presented to her mind as the liberation of her father and the young frontier man was the great object of her adventure she felt the connection between it and the services of the delaware and with an innocent laugh she nodded her head and in the same suppressed manner promised a due attention to the wishes of her friend thus assured hist tarried no longer but immediately and openly led the way into the encampment of her captors    chapter xi       the great king of kings     hath in the table of his law commanded     that thou shalt do no murder     take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand     to hurl upon their heads that break his law      richard iii iivi9597 199200  that the party to which hist compulsorily belonged was not one that was regularly on the war path was evident by the presence of females it was a small fragment of a tribe that had been hunting and fishing within the english limits where it was found by the commencement of hostilities and after passing the winter and spring by living on what was strictly the property of its enemies it chose to strike a hostile blow before it finally retired there was also deep indian sagacity in the manoeuvre which had led them so far into the territory of their foes when the runner arrived who announced the breaking out of hostilities between the english and frencha struggle that was certain to carry with it all the tribes that dwelt within the influence of the respective belligerentsthis particular party of the iroquois were posted on the shores of the oneida a lake that lies some fifty miles nearer to their own frontier than that which is the scene of our tale  to have fled in a direct line for the canadas would have exposed them to the dangers of a direct pursuit and the chiefs had determined to adopt the expedient of penetrating deeper into a region that had now become dangerous in the hope of being able to retire in the rear of their pursuers instead of having them on their trail the presence of the women had induced the attempt at this ruse the strength of these feebler members of the party being unequal to the effort of escaping from the pursuit of warriors when the reader remembers the vast extent of the american wilderness at that early day he will perceive that it was possible for even a tribe to remain months undiscovered in particular portions of it nor was the danger of encountering a foe the usual precautions being observed as great in the woods as it is on the high seas in a time of active warfare  the encampment being temporary it offered to the eye no more than the rude protection of a bivouac relieved in some slight degree by the ingenious expedients which suggested themselves to the readiness of those who passed their lives amid similar scenes one fire that had been kindled against the roots of a living oak sufficed for the whole party the weather being too mild to require it for any purpose but cooking scattered around this centre of attraction were some fifteen or twenty low huts or perhaps kennels would be a better word into which their different owners crept at night and which were also intended to meet the exigencies of a storm  these little huts were made of the branches of trees put together with some ingenuity and they were uniformly topped with bark that had been stripped from fallen trees of which every virgin forest possesses hundreds in all stages of decay of furniture they had next to none cooking utensils of the simplest sort were lying near the fire a few articles of clothing were to be seen in or around the huts rifles horns and pouches leaned against the trees or were suspended from the lower branches and the carcasses of two or three deer were stretched to view on the same natural shambles  as the encampment was in the midst of a dense wood the eye could not take in its tout ensemble at a glance but hut after hut started out of the gloomy picture as one gazed about him in quest of objects there was no centre unless the fire might be so considered no open area where the possessors of this rude village might congregate but all was dark covert and cunning like its owners a few children strayed from hut to hut giving the spot a little of the air of domestic life and the suppressed laugh and low voices of the women occasionally broke in upon the deep stillness of the sombre forest as for the men they either ate slept or examined their arms they conversed but little and then usually apart or in groups withdrawn from the females whilst an air of untiring innate watchfulness and apprehension of danger seemed to be blended even with their slumbers  as the two girls came near the encampment hetty uttered a slight exclamation on catching a view of the person of her father he was seated on the ground with his back to a tree and hurry stood near him indolently whittling a twig apparently they were as much at liberty as any others in or about the camp and one unaccustomed to indian usages would have mistaken them for visitors instead of supposing them to be captives wahtawah led her new friend quite near them and then modestly withdrew that her own presence might be no restraint on her feelings but hetty was not sufficiently familiar with caresses or outward demonstrations of fondness to indulge in any outbreaking of feeling she merely approached and stood at her fathers side without speaking resembling a silent statue of filial affection the old man expressed neither alarm nor surprise at her sudden appearance in these particulars he had caught the stoicism of the indians well knowing that there was no more certain mode of securing their respect than by imitating their selfcommand nor did the savages themselves betray the least sign of surprise at this sudden appearance of a stranger among them in a word this arrival produced much less visible sensation though occurring under circumstances so peculiar than would be seen in a village of higher pretensions to civilization did an ordinary traveler drive up to the door of its principal inn  still a few warriors collected and it was evident by the manner in which they glanced at hetty as they conversed together that she was the subject of their discourse and probable that the reasons of her unlookedfor appearance were matters of discussion this phlegm of manner is characteristic of the north american indiansome say of his white successor alsobut in this case much should be attributed to the peculiar situation in which the party was placed the force in the ark the presence of chingachgook excepted was well known no tribe or body of troops was believed to be near and vigilant eyes were posted round the entire lake watching day and night the slightest movement of those whom it would not be exaggerated now to term the besieged  hutter was inwardly much moved by the conduct of hetty though he affected so much indifference of manner he recollected her gentle appeal to him before he left the ark and misfortune rendered that of weight which might have been forgotten amid the triumph of success then he knew the simple singlehearted fidelity of his child and understood why she had come and the total disregard of self that reigned in all her acts  this is not well hetty he said deprecating the consequences to the girl herself more than any other evil these are fierce iroquois and are as little apt to forget an injury as a favor  tell me father returned the girl looking furtively about her as if fearful of being overheard did god let you do the cruel errand on which you came i want much to know this that i may speak to the indians plainly if he did not  you should not have come hither hetty these brutes will not understand your nature or your intentions  how was it father neither you nor hurry seems to have any thing that looks like scalps  if that will set your mind at peace child i can answer you no i had caught the young creatur who came here with you but her screeches soon brought down upon me a troop of the wild cats that was too much for any single christian to withstand if that will do you any good we are as innocent of having taken a scalp this time as i make no doubt we shall also be innocent of receiving the bounty  thank god for that father now i can speak boldly to the iroquois and with an easy conscience i hope hurry too has not been able to harm any of the indians  why as to that matter hetty returned the individual in question youve put it pretty much in the natyve character of the religious truth hurry has not been able and that is the long and short of it ive seen many squalls old fellow both on land and on the water but never did i feel one as lively and as snappish as that which come down upon us night afore last in the shape of an indian hurrahboys why hetty youre no great matter at a reason or an idee that lies a little deeper than common but youre human and have some human notionsnow ill just ask you to look at them circumstances here was old tom your father and myself bent on a legal operation as is to be seen in the words of the law and the proclamation thinking no harm when we were set upon by critturs that were more like a pack of hungry wolves than mortal savages even and there they had us tethered like two sheep in less time than it has taken me to tell you the story  you are free now hurry returned hetty glancing timidly at the fine unfettered limbs of the young giantyou have no cords or withes to pain your arms or legs now  not i hetty natur is natur and freedom is natur too my limbs have a free look but thats pretty much the amount of it sin i cant use them in the way i should like even these trees have eyes ay and tongues too for was the old man here or i to start one single rod beyond our gaol limits sarvice would be put on the bail afore we could gird up our loins for a race and like as not four or five rifle bullets would be travelling arter us carrying so many invitations to curb our impatience there isnt a gaol in the colony as tight as this we are now in for ive tried the vartues of two or three on em and i know the materals they are made of as well as the men that made em takin down being the next step in schoolin to puttin up in all such fabrications  lest the reader should get an exaggerated opinion of hurrys demerits from this boastful and indiscreet revelation it may be well to say that his offences were confined to assaults and batteries for several of which he had been imprisoned when as he has just said he often escaped by demonstrating the flimsiness of the constructions in which he was confined by opening for himself doors in spots where the architects had neglected to place them but hetty had no knowledge of gaols and little of the nature of crimes beyond what her unadulterated and almost instinctive perceptions of right and wrong taught her and this sally of the rude being who had spoken was lost upon her she understood his general meaning however and answered in reference to that alone  its so best hurry she said it is best father and you should be quiet and peaceable till i have spoken to the iroquois when all will be well and happy i dont wish either of you to follow but leave me to myself as soon as all is settled and you are at liberty to go back to the castle i will come and let you know it  hetty spoke with so much simple earnestness seemed so confident of success and wore so high an air of moral feeling and truth that both the listeners felt more disposed to attach an importance to her mediation than might otherwise have happened when she manifested an intention to quit them therefore they offered no obstacle though they saw she was about to join the group of chiefs who were consulting apart seemingly on the manner and motive of her own sudden appearance  when histfor so we love best to call herquitted her companion she strayed near one or two of the elder warriors who had shown her most kindness in her captivity the principal man of whom had even offered to adopt her as his child if she would consent to become a huron in taking this direction the shrewd girl did so to invite inquiry she was too well trained in the habits of her people to obtrude the opinions of one of her sex and years on men and warriors but nature had furnished a tact and ingenuity that enabled her to attract the attention she desired without wounding the pride of those to whom it was her duty to defer and respect even her affected indifference stimulated curiosity and hetty had hardly reached the side of her father before the delaware girl was brought within the circle of the warriors by a secret but significant gesture here she was questioned as to the person of her companion and the motives that had brought her to the camp this was all that hist desired she explained the manner in which she had detected the weakness of hettys reason rather exaggerating than lessening the deficiency in her intellect and then she related in general terms the object of the girl in venturing among her enemies the effect was all that the speaker expected her account investing the person and character of their visitor with a sacredness and respect that she well knew would prove her protection as soon as her own purpose was attained hist withdrew to a distance where with female consideration and a sisterly tenderness she set about the preparation of a meal to be offered to her new friend as soon as the latter might be at liberty to partake of it while thus occupied however the ready girl in no degree relaxed in her watchfulness noting every change of countenance among the chiefs every movement of hettys and the smallest occurrence that could be likely to affect her own interests or that of her new friend  as hetty approached the chiefs they opened their little circle with an ease and deference of manner that would have done credit to men of more courtly origin a fallen tree lay near and the oldest of the warriors made a quiet sign for the girl to be seated on it taking his place at her side with the gentleness of a father the others arranged themselves around the two with grave dignity and then the girl who had sufficient observation to perceive that such a course was expected of her began to reveal the object of her visit the moment she opened her mouth to speak however the old chief gave a gentle sign for her to forbear said a few words to one of his juniors and then waited in silent patience until the latter had summoned hist to the party this interruption proceeded from the chiefs having discovered that there existed a necessity for an interpreter few of the hurons present understanding the english language and they but imperfectly  wahtawah was not sorry to be called upon to be present at the interview and least of all in the character in which she was now wanted she was aware of the hazards she ran in attempting to deceive one or two of the party but was none the less resolved to use every means that offered and to practice every artifice that an indian education could supply to conceal the facts of the vicinity of her betrothed and of the errand on which he had come one unpracticed in the expedients and opinions of savage life would not have suspected the readiness of invention the wariness of action the high resolution the noble impulses the deep selfdevotion and the feminine disregard of self when the affections were concerned that lay concealed beneath the demure looks the mild eyes and the sunny smiles of this young indian beauty as she approached them the grim old warriors regarded her with pleasure for they had a secret pride in the hope of engrafting so rare a scion on the stock of their own nation adoption being as regularly practised and as distinctly recognized among the tribes of america as it ever had been among those nations that submit to the sway of the civil law  as soon as hist was seated by the side of hetty the old chief desired her to ask the fair young paleface what had brought her among the iroquois and what they could do to serve her  tell them hist who i amthomas hutters youngest daughter thomas hutter the oldest of their two prisoners he who owns the castle and the ark and who has the best right to be thought the owner of these hills and that lake since he has dwelt so long and trapped so long and fished so long among themtheyll know whom you mean by thomas hutter if you tell them that and then tell them that ive come here to convince them they ought not to harm father and hurry but let them go in peace and to treat them as brethren rather than as enemies now tell them all this plainly hist and fear nothing for yourself or me god will protect us  wahtawah did as the other desired taking care to render the words of her friend as literally as possible into the iroquois tongue a language she used with a readiness almost equal to that with which she spoke her own the chiefs heard this opening explanation with grave decorum the two who had a little knowledge of english intimating their satisfaction with the interpreter by furtive but significant glances of the eyes  and now hist continued hetty as soon as it was intimated to her that she might proceed and now hist i wish you to tell these red men word for word what i am about to say tell them first that father and hurry came here with an intention to take as many scalps as they could for the wicked governor and the province have offered money for scalps whether of warriors or women men or children and the love of gold was too strong for their hearts to withstand it tell them this dear hist just as you have heard it from me word for word  wahtawah hesitated about rendering this speech as literally as had been desired but detecting the intelligence of those who understood english and apprehending even a greater knowledge than they actually possessed she found herself compelled to comply contrary to what a civilized man would have expected the admission of the motives and of the errands of their prisoners produced no visible effect on either the countenances or the feelings of the listeners they probably considered the act meritorious and that which neither of them would have hesitated to perform in his own person he would not be apt to censure in another  and now hist resumed hetty as soon as she perceived that her first speeches were understood by the chiefs you can tell them more they know that father and hurry did not succeed and therefore they can bear them no grudge for any harm that has been done if they had slain their children and wives it would not alter the matter and im not certain that what i am about to tell them would not have more weight had there been mischief done but ask them first hist if they know there is a god who reigns over the whole earth and is ruler and chief of all who live let them be red or white or what color they may  wahtawah looked a little surprised at this question for the idea of the great spirit is seldom long absent from the mind of an indian girl she put the question as literally as possible however and received a grave answer in the affirmative  this is right continued hetty and my duty will now be light this great spirit as you call our god has caused a book to be written that we call a bible and in this book have been set down all his commandments and his holy will and pleasure and the rules by which all men are to live and directions how to govern the thoughts even and the wishes and the will here this is one of these holy books and you must tell the chiefs what i am about to read to them from its sacred pages  as hetty concluded she reverently unrolled a small english bible from its envelope of coarse calico treating the volume with the sort of external respect that a romanist would be apt to show to a religious relic as she slowly proceeded in her task the grim warriors watched each movement with riveted eyes and when they saw the little volume appear a slight expression of surprise escaped one or two of them but hetty held it out towards them in triumph as if she expected the sight would produce a visible miracle and then without betraying either surprise or mortification at the stoicism of the indian she turned eagerly to her new friend in order to renew the discourse  this is the sacred volume hist she saidand these words and lines and verses and chapters all came from god  why great spirit no send book to injin too demanded hist with the directness of a mind that was totally unsophisticated  why answered hetty a little bewildered by a question so unexpected whyah you know the indians dont know how to read  if hist was not satisfied with this explanation she did not deem the point of sufficient importance to be pressed simply bending her body in a gentle admission of the truth of what she heard she sat patiently awaiting the further arguments of the paleface enthusiast  you can tell these chiefs that throughout this book men are ordered to forgive their enemies to treat them as they would brethren and never to injure their fellow creatures more especially on account of revenge or any evil passions do you think you can tell them this so that they will understand it hist  tell him well enough but he no very easy to understand hist then conveyed the ideas of hetty in the best manner she could to the attentive indians who heard her words with some such surprise as an american of our own times would be apt to betray at a suggestion that the great modern but vacillating ruler of things human public opinion might be wrong one or two of their number however having met with missionaries said a few words in explanation and then the group gave all its attention to the communications that were to follow before hetty resumed she inquired earnestly of hist if the chiefs had understood her and receiving an evasive answer was fain to be satisfied  i will now read to the warriors some of the verses that it is good for them to know continued the girl whose manner grew more solemn and earnest as she proceededand they will remember that they are the very words of the great spirit first then ye are commanded to love thy neighbor as thyself tell them that dear hist  neighbor for injin no mean paleface answered the delaware girl with more decision than she had hitherto thought it necessary to use neighbor mean iroquois for iroquois mohican for mohican paleface for pale face no need tell chief any thing else  you forget hist these are the words of the great spirit and the chiefs must obey them as well as others here is another commandmentwhosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also  what that mean demanded hist with the quickness of lightning  hetty explained that it was an order not to resent injuries but rather to submit to receive fresh wrongs from the offender  and hear this too hist she added love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you  by this time hetty had become excited her eye gleamed with the earnestness of her feelings her cheeks flushed and her voice usually so low and modulated became stronger and more impressive with the bible she had been early made familiar by her mother and she now turned from passage to passage with surprising rapidity taking care to cull such verses as taught the sublime lessons of christian charity and christian forgiveness to translate half she said in her pious earnestness wahtawah would have found impracticable had she made the effort but wonder held her tongue tied equally with the chiefs and the young simpleminded enthusiast had fairly become exhausted with her own efforts before the other opened her mouth again to utter a syllable then indeed the delaware girl gave a brief translation of the substance of what had been both read and said confining herself to one or two of the more striking of the verses those that had struck her own imagination as the most paradoxical and which certainly would have been the most applicable to the case could the uninstructed minds of the listeners embrace the great moral truths they conveyed  it will be scarcely necessary to tell the reader the effect that such novel duties would be likely to produce among a group of indian warriors with whom it was a species of religious principle never to forget a benefit or to forgive an injury fortunately the previous explanations of hist had prepared the minds of the hurons for something extravagant and most of that which to them seemed inconsistent and paradoxical was accounted for by the fact that the speaker possessed a mind that was constituted differently from those of most of the human race still there were one or two old men who had heard similar doctrines from the missionaries and these felt a desire to occupy an idle moment by pursuing a subject that they found so curious  this is the good book of the palefaces observed one of these chiefs taking the volume from the unresisting hands of hetty who gazed anxiously at his face while he turned the leaves as if she expected to witness some visible results from the circumstance this is the law by which my white brethren professes to live  hist to whom this question was addressed if it might be considered as addressed to any one in particular answered simply in the affirmative adding that both the french of the canadas and the yengeese of the british provinces equally admitted its authority and affected to revere its principles  tell my young sister said the huron looking directly at hist that i will open my mouth and say a few words  the iroquois chief go to speakmy paleface friend listen said hist  i rejoice to hear it exclaimed hetty god has touched his heart and he will now let father and hurry go  this is the paleface law resumed the chief it tells him to do good to them that hurt him and when his brother asks him for his rifle to give him the powder horn too such is the paleface law  not sonot so answered hetty earnestly when these words had been interpretedthere is not a word about rifles in the whole book and powder and bullets give offence to the great spirit  why then does the paleface use them if he is ordered to give double to him that asks only for one thing why does he take double from the poor indian who ask for no thing he comes from beyond the rising sun with this book in his hand and he teaches the red man to read it but why does he forget himself all it says when the indian gives he is never satisfied and now he offers gold for the scalps of our women and children though he calls us beasts if we take the scalp of a warrior killed in open war my name is rivenoak  when hetty had got this formidable question fairly presented to her mind in the translation and hist did her duty with more than usual readiness on this occasion it scarcely need be said that she was sorely perplexed abler heads than that of this poor girl have frequently been puzzled by questions of a similar drift and it is not surprising that with all her own earnestness and sincerity she did not know what answer to make  what shall i tell them hist she asked imploringlyi know that all i have read from the book is true and yet it wouldnt seem so would it by the conduct of those to whom the book was given  give em paleface reason returned hist ironicallythat always good for one side though he bad for tother  nonohist there cant be two sides to truthand yet it does seem strange im certain i have read the verses right and no one would be so wicked as to print the word of god wrong that can never be hist  well to poor injin girl it seem every thing can be to palefaces returned the other coolly one time ey say white and one time ey say black why never can be  hetty was more and more embarrassed until overcome with the apprehension that she had failed in her object and that the lives of her father and hurry would be the forfeit of some blunder of her own she burst into tears from that moment the manner of hist lost all its irony and cool indifference and she became the fond caressing friend again throwing her arms around the afflicted girl she attempted to soothe her sorrows by the scarcely ever failing remedy of female sympathy  stop cryno cry she said wiping the tears from the face of hetty as she would have performed the same office for a child and stopping to press her occasionally to her own warm bosom with the affection of a sister why you so trouble you no make he book if he be wrong and you no make he paleface if he wicked there wicked red man and wicked white manno colour all goodno colour all wicked chiefs know that well enough  hetty soon recovered from this sudden burst of grief and then her mind reverted to the purpose of her visit with all its singlehearted earnestness perceiving that the grim looking chiefs were still standing around her in grave attention she hoped that another effort to convince them of the right might be successful listen hist she said struggling to suppress her sobs and to speak distinctlytell the chiefs that it matters not what the wicked doright is rightthe words of the great spirit are the words of the great spiritand no one can go harmless for doing an evil act because another has done it before him render good for evil says this book and that is the law for the red man as well as for the white man  never hear such law among delaware or among iroquois answered hist soothingly no good to tell chiefs any such laws as dat tell em someting they believe  hist was about to proceed notwithstanding when a tap on the shoulder from the finger of the oldest chief caused her to look up she then perceived that one of the warriors had left the group and was already returning to it with hutter and hurry understanding that the two last were to become parties in the inquiry she became mute with the unhesitating obedience of an indian woman in a few seconds the prisoners stood face to face with the principal men of the captors  daughter said the senior chief to the young delaware ask this grey beard why he came into our camp  the question was put by hist in her own imperfect english but in a way that was easy to be understood hutter was too stern and obdurate by nature to shrink from the consequences of any of his acts and he was also too familiar with the opinions of the savages not to understand that nothing was to be gained by equivocation or an unmanly dread of their anger without hesitating therefore he avowed the purpose with which he had landed merely justifying it by the fact that the government of the province had bid high for scalps this frank avowal was received by the iroquois with evident satisfaction not so much however on account of the advantage it gave them in a moral point of view as by its proving that they had captured a man worthy of occupying their thoughts and of becoming a subject of their revenge hurry when interrogated confessed the truth though he would have been more disposed to concealment than his sterner companion did the circumstances very well admit of its adoption but he had tact enough to discover that equivocation would be useless at that moment and he made a merit of necessity by imitating a frankness which in the case of hutter was the offspring of habits of indifference acting on a disposition that was always ruthless and reckless of personal consequences  as soon as the chiefs had received the answers to their questions they walked away in silence like men who deemed the matter disposed of all hettys dogmas being thrown away on beings trained in violence from infancy to manhood hetty and hist were now left alone with hutter and hurry no visible restraint being placed on the movements of either though all four in fact were vigilantly and unceasingly watched as respects the men care was had to prevent them from getting possession of any of the rifles that lay scattered about their own included and there all open manifestations of watchfulness ceased but they who were so experienced in indian practices knew too well how great was the distance between appearances and reality to become the dupes of this seeming carelessness although both thought incessantly of the means of escape and this without concert each was aware of the uselessness of attempting any project of the sort that was not deeply laid and promptly executed they had been long enough in the encampment and were sufficiently observant to have ascertained that hist also was a sort of captive and presuming on the circumstance hutter spoke in her presence more openly than he might otherwise have thought it prudent to do inducing hurry to be equally unguarded by his example  ill not blame you hetty for coming on this errand which was well meant if not very wisely planned commenced the father seating himself by the side of his daughter and taking her hand a sign of affection that this rude being was accustomed to manifest to this particular child but preaching and the bible are not the means to turn an indian from his ways has deerslayer sent any message or has he any scheme by which he thinks to get us free  ay thats the substance of it put in hurry if you can help us gal to half a mile of freedom or even a good start of a short quarter ill answer for the rest perhaps the old man may want a little more but for one of my height and years that will meet all objections  hetty looked distressed turning her eyes from one to the other but she had no answer to give to the question of the reckless hurry  father she said neither deerslayer nor judith knew of my coming until i had left the ark they are afraid the iroquois will make a raft and try to get off to the hut and think more of defending that than of coming to aid you  nonono said hist hurriedly though in a low voice and with her face bent towards the earth in order to conceal from those whom she knew to be watching them the fact of her speaking at all nononodeerslayer different man he no tink of defending self with friend in danger help one another and all get to hut  this sounds well old tom said hurry winking and laughing though he too used the precaution to speak lowgive me a ready witted squaw for a frind and though ill not downright defy an iroquois i think i would defy the devil  no talk loud said hist some iroquois got yengeese tongue and all got yengeese ear  have we a friend in you young woman enquired hutter with an increasing interest in the conference if so you may calculate on a solid reward and nothing will be easier than to send you to your own tribe if we can once fairly get you off with us to the castle give us the ark and the canoes and we can command the lake spite of all the savages in the canadas nothing but artillery could drive us out of the castle if we can get back to it  spose ey come ashore to take scalp retorted hist with cool irony at which the girl appeared to be more expert than is common for her sex  ayaythat was a mistake but there is little use in lamentations and less still young woman in flings  father said hetty judith thinks of breaking open the big chest in hopes of finding something in that which may buy your freedom of the savages  a dark look came over hutter at the announcement of this fact and he muttered his dissatisfaction in a way to render it intelligible enough  what for no break open chest put in hist life sweeter than old chestscalp sweeter than old chest if no tell darter to break him open wahtawah no help him to run away  ye know not what ye askye are but silly girls and the wisest way for ye both is to speak of what ye understand and to speak of nothing else i little like this cold neglect of the savages hurry its a proof that they think of something serious and if we are to do any thing we must do it soon can we count on this young woman think you  listen said hist quickly and with an earnestness that proved how much her feelings were concernedwahtawah no iroquoisall over delawaregot delaware heartdelaware feeling she prisoner too one prisoner help tudder prisoner no good to talk more now darter stay with faderwahtawah come and see friendall look rightthen tell what he do  this was said in a low voice but distinctly and in a manner to make an impression as soon as it was uttered the girl arose and left the group walking composedly towards the hut she occupied as if she had no further interest in what might pass between the palefaces    chapter xii       she speaks much of her father says she hears     theres tricks i the world and hems and beats her breast     spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt     that carry but half sense her speech is nothing     yet the unshaped use of it doth move     the hearers to collection      hamlet ivv49  we left the occupants of the castle and the ark buried in sleep once or twice in the course of the night it is true deerslayer or the delaware arose and looked out upon the tranquil lake when finding all safe each returned to his pallet and slept like a man who was not easily deprived of his natural rest at the first signs of the dawn the former arose however and made his personal arrangements for the day though his companion whose nights had not been tranquil or without disturbances of late continued on his blanket until the sun had fairly risen judith too was later than common that morning for the earlier hours of the night had brought her little of either refreshment or sleep but ere the sun had shown himself over the eastern hills these too were up and afoot even the tardy in that region seldom remaining on their pallets after the appearance of the great luminary chingachgook was in the act of arranging his forest toilet when deerslayer entered the cabin of the ark and threw him a few coarse but light summer vestments that belonged to hutter  judith hath given me them for your use chief said the latter as he cast the jacket and trousers at the feet of the indian for its agin all prudence and caution to be seen in your war dress and paint wash off all them fiery streaks from your cheeks put on these garments and here is a hat such as it is that will give you an awful oncivilized sort of civilization as the missionaries call it remember that hist is at hand and what we do for the maiden must be done while we are doing for others i know its agin your gifts and your natur to wear clothes unless they are cut and carried in a red mans fashion but make a vartue of necessity and put these on at once even if they do rise a little in your throat  chingachgook or the serpent eyed the vestments with strong disgust but he saw the usefulness of the disguise if not its absolute necessity should the iroquois discover a red man in or about the castle it might indeed place them more on their guard and give their suspicions a direction towards their female captive any thing was better than a failure as it regarded his betrothed and after turning the different garments round and round examining them with a species of grave irony affecting to draw them on in a way that defeated itself and otherwise manifesting the reluctance of a young savage to confine his limbs in the usual appliances of civilized life the chief submitted to the directions of his companion and finally stood forth so far as the eye could detect a red man in colour alone little was to be apprehended from this last peculiarity however the distance from the shore and the want of glasses preventing any very close scrutiny and deerslayer himself though of a brighter and fresher tint had a countenance that was burnt by the sun to a hue scarcely less red than that of his mohican companion the awkwardness of the delaware in his new attire caused his friend to smile more than once that day but he carefully abstained from the use of any of those jokes which would have been bandied among white men on such an occasion the habits of a chief the dignity of a warrior on his first path and the gravity of the circumstances in which they were placed uniting to render so much levity out of season  the meeting at the morning meal of the three islanders if we may use the term was silent grave and thoughtful judith showed by her looks that she had passed an unquiet night while the two men had the future before them with its unseen and unknown events a few words of courtesy passed between deerslayer and the girl in the course of the breakfast but no allusion was made to their situation at length judith whose heart was full and whose novel feelings disposed her to entertain sentiments more gentle and tender than common introduced the subject and this in a way to show how much of her thoughts it had occupied in the course of the last sleepless night  it would be dreadful deerslayer the girl abruptly exclaimed should anything serious befall my father and hetty we cannot remain quietly here and leave them in the hands of the iroquois without bethinking us of some means of serving them  im ready judith to sarve them and all others who are in trouble could the way to do it be pinted out its no trifling matter to fall into redskin hands when men set out on an arnd like that which took hutter and hurry ashore that i know as well as another and i wouldnt wish my worst inimy in such a strait much less them with whom ive journeyed and eat and slept have you any scheme that you would like to have the sarpent and me indivour to carry out  i know of no other means to release the prisoners than by bribing the iroquois they are not proof against presents and we might offer enough perhaps to make them think it better to carry away what to them will be rich gifts than to carry away poor prisoners if indeed they should carry them away at all  this is well enough judith yes its well enough if the inimy is to be bought and we can find articles to make the purchase with your father has a convenient lodge and it is most cunningly placed though it doesnt seem overstockd with riches that will be likely to buy his ransom theres the piece he calls killdeer might count for something and i understand theres a keg of powder about which might be a makeweight sartain and yet two able bodied men are not to be bought off for a triflebesides  besides what demanded judith impatiently observing that the other hesitated to proceed probably from a reluctance to distress her  why judith the frenchers offer bounties as well as our own side and the price of two scalps would purchase a keg of powder and a rifle though ill not say one of the latter altogether as good as killdeer there which your father vants as uncommon and unequalled like but fair powder and a pretty sartain rifle then the red men are not the expartest in fire arms and dont always know the difference atwixt that which is raal and that which is seeming  this is horrible muttered the girl struck by the homely manner in which her companion was accustomed to state his facts but you overlook my own clothes deerslayer and they i think might go far with the women of the iroquois  no doubt they would no doubt they would judith returned the other looking at her keenly as if he would ascertain whether she were really capable of making such a sacrifice but are you sartain gal you could find it in your heart to part with your own finery for such a purpose many is the man who has thought he was valiant till danger stared him in the face ive known them too that consaited they were kind and ready to give away all they had to the poor when theyve been listening to other peoples hard heartedness but whose fists have clenchd as tight as the riven hickory when it came to downright offerings of their own besides judith youre handsomeuncommon in that way one might observe and do no harm to the truthand they that have beauty like to have that which will adorn it are you sartain you could find it in your heart to part with your own finery  the soothing allusion to the personal charms of the girl was well timed to counteract the effect produced by the distrust that the young man expressed of judiths devotion to her filial duties had another said as much as deerslayer the compliment would most probably have been overlooked in the indignation awakened by the doubts but even the unpolished sincerity that so often made this simple minded hunter bare his thoughts had a charm for the girl and while she colored and for an instant her eyes flashed fire she could not find it in her heart to be really angry with one whose very soul seemed truth and manly kindness look her reproaches she did but conquering the desire to retort she succeeded in answering in a mild and friendly manner  you must keep all your favorable opinions for the delaware girls deerslayer if you seriously think thus of those of your own colour she said affecting to laugh but try me if you find that i regret either ribbon or feather silk or muslin then may you think what you please of my heart and say what you think  thats justice the rarest thing to find on arth is a truly just man so says tamenund the wisest prophet of the delawares and so all must think that have occasion to see and talk and act among mankind i love a just man sarpent his eyes are never covered with darkness towards his inimies while they are all sunshine and brightness towards his frinds he uses the reason that god has given him and he uses it with a feelin of his being ordered to look at and to consider things as they are and not as he wants them to be its easy enough to find men who call themselves just but its wonderful oncommon to find them that are the very thing in fact how often have i seen indians gal who believed they were lookin into a matter agreeable to the will of the great spirit when in truth they were only striving to act up to their own will and pleasure and this half the time with a temptation to go wrong that could no more be seen by themselves than the stream that runs in the next valley can be seen by us through yonder mountain though any looker on might have discovered it as plainly as we can discover the parch that are swimming around this hut  very true deerslayer rejoined judith losing every trace of displeasure in a bright smilevery true and i hope to see you act on this love of justice in all matters in which i am concerned above all i hope you will judge for yourself and not believe every evil story that a prating idler like hurry harry may have to tell that goes to touch the good name of any young woman who may not happen to have the same opinion of his face and person that the blustering gallant has of himself  hurry harrys idees do not pass for gospel with me judith but even worse than he may have eyes and ears returned the other gravely  enough of this exclaimed judith with flashing eye and a flush that mounted to her temples and more of my father and his ransom tis as you say deerslayer the indians will not be likely to give up their prisoners without a heavier bribe than my clothes can offer and fathers rifle and powder there is the chest  ay there is the chest as you say judith and when the question gets to be between a secret and a scalp i should think most men would prefer keeping the last did your father ever give you any downright commands consarning that chist   never he has always appeared to think its locks and its steel bands and its strength its best protection  tis a rare chest and altogether of curious build returned deerslayer rising and approaching the thing in question on which he seated himself with a view to examine it with greater ease chingachgook this is no wood that comes of any forest that you or i have ever trailed through tisnt the black walnut and yet its quite as comely if not more so did the smoke and the treatment give it fair play  the delaware drew near felt of the wood examined its grain endeavored to indent the surface with a nail and passed his hand curiously over the steel bands the heavy padlocks and the other novel peculiarities of the massive box  nonothing like this grows in these regions resumed deerslayer ive seen all the oaks both the maples the elms the bass woods all the walnuts the butternuts and every tree that has a substance and colour wrought into some form or other but never have i before seen such a wood as this judith the chest itself would buy your fathers freedom or iroquois curosity isnt as strong as redskin curosity in general especially in the matter of woods  the purchase might be cheaper made perhaps deerslayer the chest is full and it would be better to part with half than to part with the whole besides fatheri know not whybut father values that chest highly  he would seem to prize what it holds more than the chest itself judging by the manner in which he treats the outside and secures the inside here are three locks judith is there no key  ive never seen one and yet key there must be since hetty told us she had often seen the chest opened  keys no more lie in the air or float on the water than humans gal if there is a key there must be a place in which it is kept  that is true and it might not be difficult to find it did we dare to search  this is for you judith it is altogether for you the chist is yourn or your fathers and hutter is your father not mine curosity is a womans and not a mans failing and there you have got all the reasons before you if the chist has articles for ransom it seems to me they would be wisely used in redeeming their owners life or even in saving his scalp but that is a matter for your judgment and not for ourn when the lawful owner of a trap or a buck or a canoe isnt present his next of kin becomes his riprisentyve by all the laws of the woods we therefore leave you to say whether the chist shall or shall not be opened  i hope you do not believe i can hesitate when my fathers lifes in danger deerslayer  why its pretty much putting a scolding agin tears and mourning its not onreasonable to foretell that old tom may find fault with what youve done when he sees himself once more in his hut here but theres nothing unusual in mens falling out with what has been done for their own good i dare to say that even the moon would seem a different thing from what it now does could we look at it from the other side  deerslayer if we can find the key i will authorize you to open the chest and to take such things from it as you may think will buy fathers ransom  first find the key gal well talk of the rest aterwards sarpent youve eyes like a fly and a judgment thats seldom out can you help us in calculating where floating tom would be apt to keep the key of a chist that he holds to be as private as this  the delaware had taken no part in the discourse until he was thus directly appealed to when he quitted the chest which had continued to attract his attention and cast about him for the place in which a key would be likely to be concealed under such circumstances as judith and deerslayer were not idle the while the whole three were soon engaged in an anxious and spirited search as it was certain that the desired key was not to be found in any of the common drawers or closets of which there were several in the building none looked there but all turned their inquiries to those places that struck them as ingenious hiding places and more likely to be used for such a purpose in this manner the outer room was thoroughly but fruitlessly examined when they entered the sleeping apartment of hutter this part of the rude building was better furnished than the rest of the structure containing several articles that had been especially devoted to the service of the deceased wife of its owner but as judith had all the rest of the keys it was soon rummaged without bringing to light the particular key desired  they now entered the bed room of the daughters chingachgook was immediately struck with the contrast between the articles and the arrangement of that side of the room that might be called judiths and that which more properly belonged to hetty a slight exclamation escaped him and pointing in each direction he alluded to the fact in a low voice speaking to his friend in the delaware tongue  tis as you think sarpent answered deerslayer whose remarks we always translate into english preserving as much as possible of the peculiar phraseology and manner of the man tis just so as any one may see and tis all founded in natur one sister loves finery some say overmuch while tother is as meek and lowly as god ever created goodness and truth yet after all i dare say that judith has her vartues and hetty has her failins  and the feeblemind has seen the chist opened inquired chingachgook with curiosity in his glance  sartain that much ive heard from her own lips and for that matter so have you it seems her father doesnt misgive her discretion though he does that of his eldest darter  then the key is hid only from the wild rose for so chingachgook had begun gallantly to term judith in his private discourse with his friend  thats it thats just it one he trusts and the other he doesnt theres red and white in that sarpent all tribes and nations agreeing in trusting some and refusing to trust other some it depends on character and judgment  where could a key be put so little likely to be found by the wild rose as among coarse clothes  deerslayer started and turning to his friend with admiration expressed in every lineament of his face he fairly laughed in his silent but hearty manner at the ingenuity and readiness of the conjecture  your names well bestowed sarpentyes tis well bestowed sure enough where would a lover of finery be so little likely to sarch as among garments as coarse and onseemly as these of poor hettys i dares to say judiths delicate fingers havent touched a bit of cloth as rough and oncomely as that petticoat now since she first made acquaintance with the officers yet who knows the key may be as likely to be on the same peg as in any other place take down the garment delaware and let us see if you are raally a prophet chingachgook did as desired but no key was found a coarse pocket apparently empty hung on the adjoining peg and this was next examined by this time the attention of judith was called in that direction and she spoke hurriedly and like one who wished to save unnecessary trouble  those are only the clothes of poor hetty dear simple girl she said nothing we seek would be likely to be there  the words were hardly out of the handsome mouth of the speaker when chingachgook drew the desired key from the pocket judith was too quick of apprehension not to understand the reason a hiding place so simple and exposed had been used the blood rushed to her face as much with resentment perhaps as with shame and she bit her lip though she continued silent deerslayer and his friend now discovered the delicacy of men of native refinement neither smiling or even by a glance betraying how completely he understood the motives and ingenuity of this clever artifice the former who had taken the key from the indian led the way into the adjoining room and applying it to a lock ascertained that the right instrument had actually been found there were three padlocks each of which however was easily opened by this single key deerslayer removed them all loosened the hasps raised the lid a little to make certain it was loose and then he drew back from the chest several feet signing to his friend to follow  this is a family chist judith he said and tis like to hold family secrets the sarpent and i will go into the ark and look to the canoes and paddles and oars while you can examine it by yourself and find out whether any thing that will be a makeweight in a ransom is or is not among the articles when youve got through give us a call and well all sit in council together touching the valie of the articles  stop deerslayer exclaimed the girl as he was about to withdraw not a single thing will i touchi will not even raise the lidunless you are present father and hetty have seen fit to keep the inside of this chest a secret from me and i am much too proud to pry into their hidden treasures unless it were for their own good but on no account will i open the chest alone stay with me then i want witnesses of what i do  i rather think sarpent that the gal is right confidence and reliance beget security but suspicion is like to make us all wary judith has a right to ask us to be present and should the chist hold any of master hutters secrets they will fall into the keeping of two as close mouthed young men as are to be found we will stay with you judithbut first let us take a look at the lake and the shore for this chist will not be emptied in a minute  the two men now went out on the platform and deerslayer swept the shore with the glass while the indian gravely turned his eye on the water and the woods in quest of any sign that might betray the machinations of their enemies nothing was visible and assured of their temporary security the three collected around the chest again with the avowed object of opening it  judith had held this chest and its unknown contents in a species of reverence as long as she could remember neither her father nor her mother ever mentioned it in her presence and there appeared to be a silent convention that in naming the different objects that occasionally stood near it or even lay on its lid care should be had to avoid any allusion to the chest itself habit had rendered this so easy and so much a matter of course that it was only quite recently the girl had began even to muse on the singularity of the circumstance but there had never been sufficient intimacy between hutter and his eldest daughter to invite confidence at times he was kind but in general with her more especially he was stern and morose least of all had his authority been exercised in a way to embolden his child to venture on the liberty she was about to take without many misgivings of the consequences although the liberty proceeded from a desire to serve himself then judith was not altogether free from a little superstition on the subject of this chest which had stood a sort of tabooed relic before her eyes from childhood to the present hour nevertheless the time had come when it would seem that this mystery was to be explained and that under circumstances too which left her very little choice in the matter  finding that both her companions were watching her movements in grave silence judith placed a hand on the lid and endeavored to raise it her strength however was insufficient and it appeared to the girl who was fully aware that all the fastenings were removed that she was resisted in an unhallowed attempt by some supernatural power  i cannot raise the lid deerslayer she saidhad we not better give up the attempt and find some other means of releasing the prisoners  not sojudith not so gal no means are as sartain and easy as a good bribe answered the other as for the lid tis held by nothing but its own weight which is prodigious for so small a piece of wood loaded with iron as it is  as deerslayer spoke he applied his own strength to the effort and succeeded in raising the lid against the timbers of the house where he took care to secure it by a sufficient prop judith fairly trembled as she cast her first glance at the interior and she felt a temporary relief in discovering that a piece of canvas that was carefully tucked in around the edges effectually concealed all beneath it the chest was apparently well stored however the canvas lying within an inch of the lid  heres a full cargo said deerslayer eyeing the arrangement and we had needs go to work leisurely and at our ease sarpent bring some stools while i spread this blanket on the floor and then well begin work orderly and in comfort  the delaware complied deerslayer civilly placed a stool for judith took one himself and commenced the removal of the canvas covering this was done deliberately and in as cautious a manner as if it were believed that fabrics of a delicate construction lay hidden beneath when the canvass was removed the first articles that came in view were some of the habiliments of the male sex they were of fine materials and according to the fashions of the age were gay in colours and rich in ornaments one coat in particular was of scarlet and had button holes worked in gold thread still it was not military but was part of the attire of a civilian of condition at a period when social rank was rigidly respected in dress chingachgook could not refrain from an exclamation of pleasure as soon as deerslayer opened this coat and held it up to view for notwithstanding all his trained selfcommand the splendor of the vestment was too much for the philosophy of an indian deerslayer turned quickly and he regarded his friend with momentary displeasure as this burst of weakness escaped him and then he soliloquized as was his practice whenever any strong feeling suddenly got the ascendancy  tis his giftyes tis the gift of a redskin to love finery and he is not to be blamed this is an extrornary garment too and extrornary things get up extrornary feelins i think this will do judith for the indian heart is hardly to be found in all america that can withstand colours like these and glitter like that if this coat was ever made for your father youve come honestly by the taste for finery you have  that coat was never made for father answered the girl quicklyit is much too long while father is short and square  cloth was plenty if it was and glitter cheap answered deerslayer with his silent joyous laugh sarpent this garment was made for a man of your size and i should like to see it on your shoulders  chingachgook nothing loath submitted to the trial throwing aside the coarse and thread bare jacket of hutter to deck his person in a coat that was originally intended for a gentleman the transformation was ludicrous but as men are seldom struck with incongruities in their own appearance any more than in their own conduct the delaware studied this change in a common glass by which hutter was in the habit of shaving with grave interest at that moment he thought of hist and we owe it to truth to say though it may militate a little against the stern character of a warrior to avow it that he wished he could be seen by her in his present improved aspect  off with it sarpentoff with it resumed the inflexible deerslayer such garments as little become you as they would become me your gifts are for paint and hawks feathers and blankets and wampum and mine are for doublets of skins tough leggings and sarviceable moccasins i say moccasins judith for though white living as i do in the woods its necessary to take to some of the practyces of the woods for comforts sake and cheapness  i see no reason deerslayer why one man may not wear a scarlet coat as well as another returned the girl i wish i could see you in this handsome garment  see me in a coat fit for a lordwell judith if you wait till that day youll wait until you see me beyond reason and memory nonogal my gifts are my gifts and ill live and die in em though i never bring down another deer or spear another salmon what have i done that you should wish to see me in such a flaunting coat judith  because i think deerslayer that the falsetongued and falsehearted young gallants of the garrisons ought not alone to appear in fine feathers but that truth and honesty have their claims to be honored and exalted  and what exaltificationthe reader will have remarked that deerslayer had not very critically studied his dictionaryand what exaltification would it be to me judith to be bedizened and bescarleted like a mingo chief that has just got his presents up from quebec nonoim well as i am and if not i can be no better lay the coat down on the blanket sarpent and let us look farther into the chist  the tempting garment one surely that was never intended for hutter was laid aside and the examination proceeded the male attire all of which corresponded with the coat in quality was soon exhausted and then succeeded female a beautiful dress of brocade a little the worse from negligent treatment followed and this time open exclamations of delight escaped the lips of judith much as the girl had been addicted to dress and favorable as had been her opportunities of seeing some little pretension in that way among the wives of the different commandants and other ladies of the forts never before had she beheld a tissue or tints to equal those that were now so unexpectedly placed before her eyes her rapture was almost childish nor would she allow the inquiry to proceed until she had attired her person in a robe so unsuited to her habits and her abode with this end she withdrew into her own room where with hands practised in such offices she soon got rid of her own neat gown of linen and stood forth in the gay tints of the brocade the dress happened to fit the fine full person of judith and certainly it had never adorned a being better qualified by natural gifts to do credit to its really rich hues and fine texture when she returned both deerslayer and chingachgook who had passed the brief time of her absence in taking a second look at the male garments arose in surprise each permitting exclamations of wonder and pleasure to escape him in a way so unequivocal as to add new lustre to the eyes of judith by flushing her cheeks with a glow of triumph affecting however not to notice the impression she had made the girl seated herself with the stateliness of a queen desiring that the chest might be looked into further  i dont know a better way to treat with the mingos gal cried deerslayer than to send you ashore as you be and to tell em that a queen has arrived among em theyll give up old hutter and hurry and hetty too at such a spectacle  i thought your tongue too honest to flatter deerslayer returned the girl gratified at this admiration more than she would have cared to own one of the chief reasons of my respect for you was your love for truth  and tis truth and solemn truth judith and nothing else never did eyes of mine gaze on as glorious a lookin creatur as you be yourself at this very moment ive seen beauties in my time too both white and red and them that was renowned and talkd of far and near but never have i beheld one that could hold any comparison with what you are at this blessed instant judith never  the glance of delight which the girl bestowed on the frankspeaking hunter in no degree lessened the effect of her charms and as the humid eyes blended with it a look of sensibility perhaps judith never appeared more truly lovely than at what the young man had called that blessed instant he shook his head held it suspended a moment over the open chest like one in doubt and then proceeded with the examination  several of the minor articles of female dress came next all of a quality to correspond with the gown these were laid at judiths feet in silence as if she had a natural claim to their possession one or two such as gloves and lace the girl caught up and appended to her already rich attire in affected playfulness but with the real design of decorating her person as far as circumstances would allow when these two remarkable suits male and female they might be termed were removed another canvas covering separated the remainder of the articles from the part of the chest which they had occupied as soon as deerslayer perceived this arrangement he paused doubtful of the propriety of proceeding any further  every man has his secrets i suppose he said and all men have a right to their enjyment weve got low enough in this chist in my judgment to answer our wants and it seems to me we should do well by going no farther and by letting master hutter have to himself and his own feelins all thats beneath this cover  do you mean deerslayer to offer these clothes to the iroquois as ransom demanded judith quickly  sartain what are we prying into another mans chist for but to sarve its owner in the best way we can this coat alone would be very apt to gain over the head chief of the riptyles and if his wife or darter should happen to be out with him that there gownd would soften the heart of any woman that is to be found atween albany and montreal i do not see that we want a larger stock in trade than them two articles  to you it may seem so deerslayer returned the disappointed girl but of what use could a dress like this be to any indian woman she could not wear it among the branches of the trees the dirt and smoke of the wigwam would soon soil it and how would a pair of red arms appear thrust through these short laced sleeves  all very true gal and you might go on and say it is altogether out of time and place and season in this region at all what is it to us how the finery is treated so long as it answers our wishes i do not see that your father can make any use of such clothes and its lucky he has things that are of no valie to himself that will bear a high price with others we can make no better trade for him than to offer these duds for his liberty well throw in the light frivolties and get hurry off in the bargain  then you think deerslayer that thomas hutter has no one in his familyno childno daughter to whom this dress may be thought becoming and whom you could wish to see in it once and awhile even though it should be at long intervals and only in playfulness  i understand you judithyes i now understand your meaning and i think i can say your wishes that you are as glorious in that dress as the sun when it rises or sets in a soft october day im ready to allow and that you greatly become it is a good deal more sartain than that it becomes you theres gifts in clothes as well as in other things now i do not think that a warrior on his first path ought to lay on the same awful paints as a chief that has had his virtue tried and knows from experence he will not disgrace his pretensions so it is with all of us red or white you are thomas hutters darter and that gownd was made for the child of some governor or a lady of high station and it was intended to be worn among fine furniture and in rich company in my eyes judith a modest maiden never looks more becoming than when becomingly clad and nothing is suitable that is out of character besides gal if theres a creatur in the colony that can afford to do without finery and to trust to her own good looks and sweet countenance its yourself  ill take off the rubbish this instant deerslayer cried the girl springing up to leave the room and never do i wish to see it on any human being again  so it is with em all sarpent said the other turning to his friend and laughing as soon as the beauty had disappeared they like finery but they like their natyve charms most of all im glad the gal has consented to lay aside her furbelows howsever for its agin reason for one of her class to wear em and then she is handsome enough as i call it to go alone hist would show oncommon likely too in such a gownd delaware  wahtawah is a redskin girl deerslayer returned the indian like the young of the pigeon she is to be known by her own feathers i should pass by without knowing her were she dressed in such a skin its wisest always to be so clad that our friends need not ask us for our names the wild rose is very pleasant but she is no sweeter for so many colours  thats itthats natur and the true foundation for love and protection when a man stoops to pick a wild strawberry he does not expect to find a melon and when he wishes to gather a melon hes disappinted if it proves to be a squash though squashes be often brighter to the eye than melons thats it and it means stick to your gifts and your gifts will stick to you  the two men had now a little discussion together touching the propriety of penetrating any farther into the chest of hutter when judith reappeared divested of her robes and in her own simple linen frock again  thank you judith said deerslayer taking her kindly by the handfor i know it went a little agin the natral cravings of woman to lay aside so much finery as it might be in a lump but youre more pleasing to the eye as you stand you be than if you had a crown on your head and jewels dangling from your hair the question now is whether to lift this covering to see what will be raally the best bargain we can make for master hutter for we must do as we think he would be willing to do did he stand here in our places  judith looked very happy accustomed as she was to adulation the homely homage of deerslayer had given her more true satisfaction than she had ever yet received from the tongue of man it was not the terms in which this admiration had been expressed for they were simple enough that produced so strong an impression nor yet their novelty or their warmth of manner nor any of those peculiarities that usually give value to praise but the unflinching truth of the speaker that carried his words so directly to the heart of the listener this is one of the great advantages of plain dealing and frankness the habitual and wily flatterer may succeed until his practices recoil on himself and like other sweets his aliment cloys by its excess but he who deals honestly though he often necessarily offends possesses a power of praising that no quality but sincerity can bestow since his words go directly to the heart finding their support in the understanding thus it was with deerslayer and judith so soon and so deeply did this simple hunter impress those who knew him with a conviction of his unbending honesty that all he uttered in commendation was as certain to please as all he uttered in the way of rebuke was as certain to rankle and excite enmity where his character had not awakened a respect and affection that in another sense rendered it painful in after life when the career of this untutored being brought him in contact with officers of rank and others entrusted with the care of the interests of the state this same influence was exerted on a wider field even generals listening to his commendations with a glow of pleasure that it was not always in the power of their official superiors to awaken perhaps judith was the first individual of his own colour who fairly submitted to this natural consequence of truth and fairdealing on the part of deerslayer she had actually pined for his praise and she had now received it and that in the form which was most agreeable to her weaknesses and habits of thought the result will appear in the course of the narrative  if we knew all that chest holds deerslayer returned the girl when she had a little recovered from the immediate effect produced by his commendations of her personal appearance we could better determine on the course we ought to take  thats not onreasonable gal though its more a paleface than a redskin gift to be prying into other peoples secrets  curiosity is natural and it is expected that all human beings should have human failings whenever ive been at the garrisons ive found that most in and about them had a longing to learn their neighbors secrets  yes and sometimes to fancy them when they couldnt find em out thats the difference atween an indian gentleman and a white gentleman the sarpent here would turn his head aside if he found himself onknowingly lookin into another chiefs wigwam whereas in the settlements while all pretend to be great people most prove theyve got betters by the manner in which they talk of their consarns ill be bound judith you wouldnt get the sarpent there to confess there was another in the tribe so much greater than himself as to become the subject of his idees and to emply his tongue in conversations about his movements and ways and food and all the other little matters that occupy a man when hes not emplyd in his greater duties he who does this is but little better than a blackguard in the grain and them that encourages him is pretty much of the same kidney let them wear coats as fine as they may or of what dye they please  but this is not another mans wigwam it belongs to my father these are his things and they are wanted in his service  thats true gal thats true and it carries weight with it well when all is before us we may indeed best judge which to offer for the ransom and which to withhold  judith was not altogether as disinterested in her feelings as she affected to be she remembered that the curiosity of hetty had been indulged in connection with this chest while her own had been disregarded and she was not sorry to possess an opportunity of being placed on a level with her less gifted sister in this one particular it appearing to be admitted all round that the enquiry into the contents of the chest ought to be renewed deerslayer proceeded to remove the second covering of canvass  the articles that lay uppermost when the curtain was again raised on the secrets of the chest were a pair of pistols curiously inlaid with silver their value would have been considerable in one of the towns though as weapons in the woods they were a species of arms seldom employed never indeed unless it might be by some officer from europe who visited the colonies as many were then wont to do so much impressed with the superiority of the usages of london as to fancy they were not to be laid aside on the frontiers of america what occurred on the discovery of these weapons will appear in the succeeding chapter    chapter xiii       an oaken broken elbowchair     a caudlecup without an ear     a battered shattered ash bedstead     a box of deal without a lid     a pair of tongs but out of joint     a backsword poker without point     a dish which might good meat afford once     an ovid and an old     concordance      thomas sheridan a true and faithful inventory of the goods     belonging to dr swift ii i6 1314  no sooner did deerslayer raise the pistols than he turned to the delaware and held them up for his admiration  child gun said the serpent smiling while he handled one of the instruments as if it had been a toy  not it sarpent not ittwas made for a man and would satisfy a giant if rightly used but stop white men are remarkable for their carelessness in putting away fire arms in chists and corners let me look if care has been given to these  as deerslayer spoke he took the weapon from the hand of his friend and opened the pan the last was filled with priming caked like a bit of cinder by time moisture and compression an application of the ramrod showed that both the pistols were charged although judith could testify that they had probably lain for years in the chest it is not easy to portray the surprise of the indian at this discovery for he was in the practice of renewing his priming daily and of looking to the contents of his piece at other short intervals  this is white neglect said deerslayer shaking his head and scarce a season goes by that some one in the settlements doesnt suffer from it its extrornary too judithyes its downright extrornary that the owner shall fire his piece at a deer or some other game or perhaps at an inimy and twice out of three times hell miss but let him catch an accident with one of these forgotten charges and he makes it sartain death to a child or a brother or a frind well we shall do a good turn to the owner if we fire these pistols for him and as theyre novelties to you and me sarpent well try our hands at a mark freshen that priming and ill do the same with this and then well see who is the best man with a pistol as for the rifle thats long been settled atween us  deerslayer laughed heartily at his own conceit and in a minute or two they were both standing on the platform selecting some object in the ark for their target judith was led by curiosity to their side  stand back gal stand a little back these wepons have been long loaded said deerslayer and some accident may happen in the discharge then you shall not fire them give them both to the delaware or it would be better to unload them without firing  thats agin usageand some people say agin manhood though i hold to no such silly doctrine we must fire em judith yes we must fire em though i foresee that neither will have any great reason to boast of his skill  judith in the main was a girl of great personal spirit and her habits prevented her from feeling any of the terror that is apt to come over her sex at the report of fire arms she had discharged many a rifle and had even been known to kill a deer under circumstances that were favorable to the effort she submitted therefore falling a little back by the side of deerslayer giving the indian the front of the platform to himself chingachgook raised the weapon several times endeavored to steady it by using both hands changed his attitude from one that was awkward to another still more so and finally drew the trigger with a sort of desperate indifference without having in reality secured any aim at all the consequence was that instead of hitting the knot which had been selected for the mark he missed the ark altogether the bullet skipping along the water like a stone that was thrown by hand  well donesarpentwell done cried deerslayer laughing with his noiseless glee youve hit the lake and thats an explite for some men i knowd it and as much as said it here to judith for your short wepons dont belong to redskin gifts youve hit the lake and thats better than only hitting the air now stand back and let us see what white gifts can do with a white wepon a pistol isnt a rifle but colour is colour  the aim of deerslayer was both quick and steady and the report followed almost as soon as the weapon rose still the pistol hung fire as it is termed and fragments of it flew in a dozen directions some falling on the roof of the castle others in the ark and one in the water judith screamed and when the two men turned anxiously towards the girl she was as pale as death trembling in every limb  shes woundedyes the poor gals wounded sarpent though one couldnt foresee it standing where she did well lead her in to a seat and we must do the best for her that our knowledge and skill can afford  judith allowed herself to be supported to a seat swallowed a mouthful of the water that the delaware offered her in a gourd and after a violent fit of trembling that seemed ready to shake her fine frame to dissolution she burst into tears  the pain must be borne poor judithyes it must be borne said deerslayer soothingly though i am far from wishing you not to weep for weeping often lightens galish feelins where can she be hurt sarpent i see no signs of blood nor any rent of skin or garments  i am uninjured deerslayer stammered the girl through her tears its frightnothing more i do assure you and god be praised no one i find has been harmed by the accident  this is extrornary exclaimed the unsuspecting and simple minded hunteri thought judith youd been above settlement weaknesses and that you was a gal not to be frightened by the sound of a bursting weponnoi didnt think you so skeary hetty might well have been startled but youve too much judgment and reason to be frightened when the dangers all over theyre pleasant to the eye chief and changeful but very unsartain in their feelins  shame kept judith silent there had been no acting in her agitation but all had fairly proceeded from sudden and uncontrollable alarman alarm that she found almost as inexplicable to herself as it proved to be to her companions wiping away the traces of tears however she smiled again and was soon able to join in the laugh at her own folly  and you deerslayer she at length succeeded in sayingare you indeed altogether unhurt it seems almost miraculous that a pistol should have burst in your hand and you escape without the loss of a limb if not of life  such wonders arnt oncommon at all among worn out arms the first rifle they gave me playd the same trick and yet i livd through it though not as onharmless as ive got out of this affair thomas hutter is master of one pistol less than he was this morning but as it happened in trying to sarve him theres no ground of complaint now draw near and let us look farther into the inside of the chist  judith by this time had so far gotten the better of her agitation as to resume her seat and the examination went on the next article that offered was enveloped in cloth and on opening it it proved to be one of the mathematical instruments that were then in use among seamen possessing the usual ornaments and fastenings in brass deerslayer and chingachgook expressed their admiration and surprise at the appearance of the unknown instrument which was bright and glittering having apparently been well cared for  this goes beyond the surveyors judith deerslayer exclaimed after turning the instrument several times in his hands ive seen all their tools often and wicked and heartless enough are they for they never come into the forest but to lead the way to waste and destruction but none of them have as designing a look as this i fear me after all that thomas hutter has journeyed into the wilderness with no fair intentions towards its happiness did you ever see any of the cravings of a surveyor about your father gal  he is no surveyor deerslayer nor does he know the use of that instrument though he seems to own it do you suppose that thomas hutter ever wore that coat it is as much too large for him as this instrument is beyond his learning  thats itthat must be it sarpent and the old fellow by some onknown means has fallen heir to another mans goods they say he has been a mariner and no doubt this chist and all it holdsha what have we herethis far out does the brass and black wood of the tool  deerslayer had opened a small bag from which he was taking one by one the pieces of a set of chessmen they were of ivory much larger than common and exquisitely wrought each piece represented the character or thing after which it is named the knights being mounted the castles stood on elephants and even the pawns possessed the heads and busts of men the set was not complete and a few fractures betrayed bad usage but all that was left had been carefully put away and preserved even judith expressed wonder as these novel objects were placed before her eyes and chingachgook fairly forgot his indian dignity in admiration and delight the latter took up each piece and examined it with never tiring satisfaction pointing out to the girl the more ingenious and striking portions of the workmanship but the elephants gave him the greatest pleasure the hughs that he uttered as he passed his fingers over their trunks and ears and tails were very distinct nor did he fail to note the pawns which were armed as archers this exhibition lasted several minutes during which time judith and the indian had all the rapture to themselves deerslayer sat silent thoughtful and even gloomy though his eyes followed each movement of the two principal actors noting every new peculiarity about the pieces as they were held up to view not an exclamation of pleasure nor a word of condemnation passed his lips at length his companions observed his silence and then for the first time since the chessmen had been discovered did he speak  judith he asked earnestly but with a concern that amounted almost to tenderness of manner did your parents ever talk to you of religion  the girl coloured and the flashes of crimson that passed over her beautiful countenance were like the wayward tints of a neapolitan sky in november deerslayer had given her so strong a taste for truth however that she did not waver in her answer replying simply and with sincerity  my mother did often she said my father never i thought it made my mother sorrowful to speak of our prayers and duties but my father has never opened his mouth on such matters before or since her death  that i can believethat i can believe he has no godno such god as it becomes a man of white skin to worship or even a redskin them things are idols  judith started and for a moment she seemed seriously hurt then she reflected and in the end she laughed and you think deerslayer that these ivory toys are my fathers gods i have heard of idols and know what they are  them are idols repeated the other positively why should your father keep em if he doesnt worship em  would he keep his gods in a bag and locked up in a chest no no deerslayer my poor father carries his god with him wherever he goes and that is in his own cravings these things may really be idolsi think they are myself from what i have heard and read of idolatry but they have come from some distant country and like all the other articles have fallen into thomas hutters hands when he was a sailor  im glad of iti am downright glad to hear it judith for i do not think i could have mustered the resolution to strive to help a white idolater out of his difficulties the old man is of my colour and nation and i wish to sarve him but as one who denied all his gifts in the way of religion it would have come hard to do so that animal seems to give you great satisfaction sarpent though its an idolatrous beast at the best  it is an elephant interrupted judith ive often seen pictures of such animals at the garrisons and mother had a book in which there was a printed account of the creature father burnt that with all the other books for he said mother loved reading too well this was not long before mother died and ive sometimes thought that the loss hastened her end  this was said equally without levity and without any very deep feeling it was said without levity for judith was saddened by her recollections and yet she had been too much accustomed to live for self and for the indulgence of her own vanities to feel her mothers wrongs very keenly it required extraordinary circumstances to awaken a proper sense of her situation and to stimulate the better feelings of this beautiful but misguided girl and those circumstances had not yet occurred in her brief existence  elephant or no elephant tis an idol returned the hunter and not fit to remain in christian keeping  good for iroquois said chingachgook parting with one of the castles with reluctance as his friend took it from him to replace it in the bagelephon buy whole tribebuy delaware almost  ay that it would as any one who comprehends redskin natur must know answered deerslayer but the man that passes false money sarpent is as bad as he who makes it did you ever know a just injin that wouldnt scorn to sell a coon skin for the true marten or to pass off a mink for a beaver i know that a few of these idols perhaps one of them elephants would go far towards buying thomas hutters liberty but it goes agin conscience to pass such counterfeit money perhaps no injin tribe hereaway is downright idolators but theres some that come so near it that white gifts ought to be particular about encouraging them in their mistake  if idolatry is a gift deerslayer and gifts are what you seem to think them idolatry in such people can hardly be a sin said judith with more smartness than discrimination  god grants no such gifts to any of his creaturs judith returned the hunter seriously he must be adored under some name or other and not creaturs of brass or ivory it matters not whether the father of all is called god or manitou deity or great spirit he is none the less our common maker and master nor does it count for much whether the souls of the just go to paradise or happy hunting grounds since he may send each his own way as suits his own pleasure and wisdom but it curdles my blood when i find human mortals so bound up in darkness and consait as to fashion the arth or wood or bones things made by their own hands into motionless senseless effigies and then fall down afore them and worship em as a deity  after all deerslayer these pieces of ivory may not be idols at all i remember now to have seen one of the officers at the garrison with a set of fox and geese made in some such a design as these and here is something hard wrapped in cloth that may belong to your idols  deerslayer took the bundle the girl gave him and unrolling it he found the board within like the pieces it was large rich and inlaid with ebony and ivory putting the whole in conjunction the hunter though not without many misgivings slowly came over to judiths opinion and finally admitted that the fancied idols must be merely the curiously carved men of some unknown game judith had the tact to use her victory with great moderation nor did she once even in the most indirect manner allude to the ludicrous mistake of her companion  this discovery of the uses of the extraordinarylooking little images settled the affair of the proposed ransom it was agreed generally and all understood the weaknesses and tastes of indians that nothing could be more likely to tempt the cupidity of the iroquois than the elephants in particular luckily the whole of the castles were among the pieces and these four towerbearing animals it was finally determined should be the ransom offered the remainder of the men and indeed all the rest of the articles in the chest were to be kept out of view and to be resorted to only as a last appeal as soon as these preliminaries were settled everything but those intended for the bribe was carefully replaced in the chest all the covers were tucked in as they had been found and it was quite possible could hutter have been put in possession of the castle again that he might have passed the remainder of his days in it without even suspecting the invasion that had been made on the privacy of the chest the rent pistol would have been the most likely to reveal the secret but this was placed by the side of its fellow and all were pressed down as before some half a dozen packages in the bottom of the chest not having been opened at all when this was done the lid was lowered the padlocks replaced and the key turned the latter was then replaced in the pocket from which it had been taken  more than an hour was consumed in settling the course proper to be pursued and in returning everything to its place the pauses to converse were frequent and judith who experienced a lively pleasure in the open undisguised admiration with which deerslayers honest eyes gazed at her handsome face found the means to prolong the interview with a dexterity that seems to be innate in female coquetry deerslayer indeed appeared to be the first who was conscious of the time that had been thus wasted and to call the attention of his companions to the necessity of doing something towards putting the plan of ransoming into execution chingachgook had remained in hutters bed room where the elephants were laid to feast his eyes with the images of animals so wonderful and so novel perhaps an instinct told him that his presence would not be as acceptable to his companions as this holding himself aloof for judith had not much reserve in the manifestations of her preferences and the delaware had not got so far as one betrothed without acquiring some knowledge of the symptoms of the master passion  well judith said deerslayer rising after the interview had lasted much longer than even he himself suspected tis pleasant convarsing with you and settling all these matters but duty calls us another way all this time hurry and your father not to say hetty the word was cut short in the speakers mouth for at that critical moment a light step was heard on the platform or courtyard a human figure darkened the doorway and the person last mentioned stood before him the low exclamation that escaped deerslayer and the slight scream of judith were hardly uttered when an indian youth between the ages of fifteen and seventeen stood beside her these two entrances had been made with moccasined feet and consequently almost without noise but unexpected and stealthy as they were they had not the effect to disturb deerslayers self possession his first measure was to speak rapidly in delaware to his friend cautioning him to keep out of sight while he stood on his guard the second was to step to the door to ascertain the extent of the danger no one else however had come and a simple contrivance in the shape of a raft that lay floating at the side of the ark at once explained the means that had been used in bringing hetty off two dead and dry and consequently buoyant logs of pine were bound together with pins and withes and a little platform of riven chestnut had been rudely placed on their surfaces here hetty had been seated on a billet of wood while the young iroquois had rowed the primitive and slowmoving but perfectly safe craft from the shore  as soon as deerslayer had taken a close survey of this raft and satisfied himself nothing else was near he shook his head and muttered in his soliloquizing waythis comes of prying into another mans chist had we been watchful and keen eyed such a surprise could never have happened and getting this much from a boy teaches us what we may expect when the old warriors set themselves fairly about their sarcumventions it opens the way howsever to a treaty for the ransom and i will hear what hetty has to say  judith as soon as her surprise and alarm had a little abated discovered a proper share of affectionate joy at the return of her sister she folded her to her bosom and kissed her as had been her wont in the days of their childhood and innocence hetty herself was less affected for to her there was no surprise and her nerves were sustained by the purity and holiness of her purpose at her sisters request she took a seat and entered into an account of her adventures since they had parted her tale commenced just as deerslayer returned and he also became an attentive listener while the young iroquois stood near the door seemingly as indifferent to what was passing as one of its posts  the narrative of the girl was sufficiently clear until she reached the time where we left her in the camp after the interview with the chiefs and at the moment when hist quitted her in the abrupt manner already related the sequel of the story may be told in her own language  when i read the texts to the chiefs judith you could not have seen that they made any changes on their minds she said but if seed is planted it will grow god planted the seeds of all these trees  ay that did hethat did he muttered deerslayer and a goodly harvest has followed  god planted the seeds of all these trees continued hetty after a moments pause and you see to what a height and shade they have grown so it is with the bible you may read a verse this year and forget it and it will come back to you a year hence when you least expect to remember it  and did you find any thing of this among the savages poor hetty  yes judith and sooner and more fully than i had even hoped i did not stay long with father and hurry but went to get my breakfast with hist as soon as we had done the chiefs came to us and then we found the fruits of the seed that had been planted they said what i had read from the good book was rightit must be rightit sounded right like a sweet bird singing in their ears and they told me to come back and say as much to the great warrior who had slain one of their braves and to tell it to you and to say how happy they should be to come to church here in the castle or to come out in the sun and hear me read more of the sacred volumeand to tell you that they wish you would lend them some canoes that they can bring father and hurry and their women to the castle that we might all sit on the platform there and listen to the singing of the paleface manitou there judith did you ever know of any thing that so plainly shows the power of the bible as that  if it were true t would be a miracle indeed hetty but all this is no more than indian cunning and indian treachery striving to get the better of us by management when they find it is not to be done by force  do you doubt the bible sister that you judge the savages so harshly  i do not doubt the bible poor hetty but i much doubt an indian and an iroquois what do you say to this visit deerslayer  first let me talk a little with hetty returned the party appealed to was the raft made ater you had got your breakfast gal and did you walk from the camp to the shore opposite to us here  oh no deerslayer the raft was ready made and in the watercould that have been by a miracle judith  yesyesan indian miracle rejoined the huntertheyre expart enough in them sort of miracles and you found the raft ready made to your hands and in the water and in waiting like for its cargo  it was all as you say the raft was near the camp and the indians put me on it and had ropes of bark and they dragged me to the place opposite to the castle and then they told that young man to row me off here  and the woods are full of the vagabonds waiting to know what is to be the upshot of the miracle we comprehend this affair now judith but ill first get rid of this young canada blood sucker and then well settle our own course do you and hetty leave us together first bringing me the elephants which the sarpent is admiring for twill never do to let this loping deer be alone a minute or hell borrow a canoe without asking  judith did as desired first bringing the pieces and retiring with her sister into their own room deerslayer had acquired some knowledge of most of the indian dialects of that region and he knew enough of the iroquois to hold a dialogue in the language beckoning to the lad therefore he caused him to take a seat on the chest when he placed two of the castles suddenly before him up to that moment this youthful savage had not expressed a single intelligible emotion or fancy there were many things in and about the place that were novelties to him but he had maintained his selfcommand with philosophical composure it is true deerslayer had detected his dark eye scanning the defences and the arms but the scrutiny had been made with such an air of innocence in such a gaping indolent boyish manner that no one but a man who had himself been taught in a similar school would have even suspected his object the instant however the eyes of the savage fell upon the wrought ivory and the images of the wonderful unknown beasts surprise and admiration got the mastery of him the manner in which the natives of the south sea islands first beheld the toys of civilized life has been often described but the reader is not to confound it with the manner of an american indian under similar circumstances in this particular case the young iroquois or huron permitted an exclamation of rapture to escape him and then he checked himself like one who had been guilty of an indecorum after this his eyes ceased to wander but became riveted on the elephants one of which after a short hesitation he even presumed to handle deerslayer did not interrupt him for quite ten minutes knowing that the lad was taking such note of the curiosities as would enable him to give the most minute and accurate description of their appearance to his seniors on his return when he thought sufficient time had been allowed to produce the desired effect the hunter laid a finger on the naked knee of the youth and drew his attention to himself  listen he said i want to talk with my young friend from the canadas let him forget that wonder for a minute  where tother pale brother demanded the boy looking up and letting the idea that had been most prominent in his mind previously to the introduction of the chess men escape him involuntarily  he sleeps or if he isnt fairly asleep he is in the room where the men do sleep returned deerslayer how did my young friend know there was another  see him from the shore iroquois have got long eyessee beyond the cloudssee the bottom of the great spring  well the iroquois are welcome two palefaces are prisoners in the camp of your fathers boy  the lad nodded treating the circumstance with great apparent indifference though a moment after he laughed as if exulting in the superior address of his own tribe  can you tell me boy what your chiefs intend to do with these captyves or havent they yet made up their minds  the lad looked a moment at the hunter with a little surprise then he coolly put the end of his fore finger on his own head just above the left ear and passed it round his crown with an accuracy and readiness that showed how well he had been drilled in the peculiar art of his race  when demanded deerslayer whose gorge rose at this cool demonstration of indifference to human life and why not take them to your wigwams  road too long and full of palefaces wigwam full and scalps sell high small scalp much gold  well that explains ityes that does explain it theres no need of being any plainer now you know lad that the oldest of your prisoners is the father of these two young women and the other is the suitor of one of them the gals natrally wish to save the scalps of such frinds and they will give them two ivory creaturs as ransom one for each scalp go back and tell this to your chiefs and bring me the answer before the sun sets  the boy entered zealously into this project and with a sincerity that left no doubt of his executing his commission with intelligence and promptitude for a moment he forgot his love of honor and all his clannish hostility to the british and their indians in his wish to have such a treasure in his tribe and deerslayer was satisfied with the impression he had made it is true the lad proposed to carry one of the elephants with him as a specimen of the other but to this his brother negotiator was too sagacious to consent well knowing that it might never reach its destination if confided to such hands this little difficulty was soon arranged and the boy prepared to depart as he stood on the platform ready to step aboard of the raft he hesitated and turned short with a proposal to borrow a canoe as the means most likely to shorten the negotiations deerslayer quietly refused the request and after lingering a little longer the boy rowed slowly away from the castle taking the direction of a thicket on the shore that lay less than half a mile distant deerslayer seated himself on a stool and watched the progress of the ambassador sometimes closely scanning the whole line of shore as far as eye could reach and then placing an elbow on a knee he remained a long time with his chin resting on the hand  during the interview between deerslayer and the lad a different scene took place in the adjoining room hetty had inquired for the delaware and being told why and where he remained concealed she joined him the reception which chingachgook gave his visitor was respectful and gentle he understood her character and no doubt his disposition to be kind to such a being was increased by the hope of learning some tidings of his betrothed as soon as the girl entered she took a seat and invited the indian to place himself near her then she continued silent as if she thought it decorous for him to question her before she consented to speak on the subject she had on her mind but as chingachgook did not understand this feeling he remained respectfully attentive to any thing she might be pleased to tell him  you are chingachgook the great serpent of the delawares arnt you the girl at length commenced in her own simple way losing her selfcommand in the desire to proceed but anxious first to make sure of the individual chingachgook returned the delaware with grave dignity that say great sarpent in deerslayer tongue  well that is my tongue deerslayer and father and judith and i and poor hurry harrydo you know henry march great serpent i know you dont however or he would have spoken of you too  did any tongue name chingachgook droopinglily for so the chief had named poor hetty was his name sung by a little bird among iroquois  hetty did not answer at first but with that indescribable feeling that awakens sympathy and intelligence among the youthful and unpracticed of her sex she hung her head and the blood suffused her cheek ere she found her tongue it would have exceeded her stock of intelligence to explain this embarrassment but though poor hetty could not reason on every emergency she could always feel the colour slowly receded from her cheeks and the girl looked up archly at the indian smiling with the innocence of a child mingled with the interest of a woman  my sister the drooping lily hear such bird chingachgook added and this with a gentleness of tone and manner that would have astonished those who sometimes heard the discordant cries that often came from the same throat these transitions from the harsh and guttural to the soft and melodious not being infrequent in ordinary indian dialogues my sisters ears were openhas she lost her tongue  you are chingachgookyou must be for there is no other red man here and she thought chingachgook would come  chingachgook pronouncing the name slowly and dwelling on each syllablegreat sarpent yengeese tongue  it is singular there should be any question concerning the origin of the wellknown sobriquet of yankees nearly all the old writers who speak of the indians first known to the colonists make them pronounce the word english as yengeese even at this day it is a provincialism of new england to say anglish instead of inglish and there is a close conformity of sound between anglish and yengeese more especially if the latter word as was probably the case be pronounced short the transition from yengeese thus pronounced to yankees is quite easy if the former is pronounced yangis it is almost identical with yankees and indian words have seldom been spelt as they are pronounced thus the scene of this tale is spelt otsego and is properly pronounced otsago the liquids of the indians would easily convert en into yen  chingachgook repeated hetty in the same deliberate manner yes so hist called it and you must be the chief  wahtawah added the delaware  wahtawah or histohhist i think hist prettier than wah and so i call her hist  wah very sweet in delaware ears  you make it sound differently from me but never mind i did hear the bird you speak of sing great serpent  will my sister say words of song what she sing mosthow she lookoften she laugh  she sang chingachgook oftener than any thing else and she laughed heartily when i told how the iroquois waded into the water after us and couldnt catch us i hope these logs havent ears serpent  no fear logs fear sister next room no fear iroquois deerslayer stuff his eyes and ears with strange beast  i understand you serpent and i understood hist sometimes i think im not half as feeble minded as they say i am now do you look up at the roof and ill tell you all but you frighten me you look so eager when i speak of hist  the indian controlled his looks and affected to comply with the simple request of the girl  hist told me to say in a very low voice that you mustnt trust the iroquois in anything they are more artful than any indians she knows then she says that there is a large bright star that comes over the hill about an hour after darkhist had pointed out the planet jupiter without knowing itand just as that star comes in sight she will be on the point where i landed last night and that you must come for her in a canoe  goodchingachgook understand well enough now but he understand better if my sister sing him agin  hetty repeated her words more fully explaining what star was meant and mentioning the part of the point where he was to venture ashore she now proceeded in her own unsophisticated way to relate her intercourse with the indian maid and to repeat several of her expressions and opinions that gave great delight to the heart of her betrothed she particularly renewed her injunctions to be on their guard against treachery a warning that was scarcely needed however as addressed to men as wary as those to whom it was sent she also explained with sufficient clearness for on all such subjects the mind of the girl seldom failed her the present state of the enemy and the movements they had made since morning hist had been on the raft with her until it quitted the shore and was now somewhere in the woods opposite to the castle and did not intend to return to the camp until night approached when she hoped to be able to slip away from her companions as they followed the shore on their way home and conceal herself on the point no one appeared to suspect the presence of chingachgook though it was necessarily known that an indian had entered the ark the previous night and it was suspected that he had since appeared in and about the castle in the dress of a paleface still some little doubt existed on the latter point for as this was the season when white men might be expected to arrive there was some fear that the garrison of the castle was increasing by these ordinary means all this had hist communicated to hetty while the indians were dragging them along shore the distance which exceeded six miles affording abundance of time  hist dont know herself whether they suspect her or not or whether they suspect you but she hopes neither is the case and now serpent since i have told you so much from your betrothed continued hetty unconsciously taking one of the indians hands and playing with the fingers as a child is often seen to play with those of a parent you must let me tell you something from myself when you marry hist you must be kind to her and smile on her as you do now on me and not look cross as some of the chiefs do at their squaws will you promise this  alway good to wahtoo tender to twist hard else she break  yes and smile too you dont know how much a girl craves smiles from them she loves father scarce smiled on me once while i was with himand hurryyeshurry talked loud and laughed but i dont think he smiled once either you know the difference between a smile and a laugh  laugh best hear wah laugh think bird sing  i know that her laugh is pleasant but you must smile and then serpent you mustnt make her carry burthens and hoe corn as so many indians do but treat her more as the palefaces treat their wives  wahtawah no palefacegot redskin red heart red feelins all red no paleface must carry papoose  every woman is willing to carry her child said hetty smiling and there is no harm in that but you must love hist and be gentle and good to her for she is gentle and good herself  chingachgook gravely bowed and then he seemed to think this part of the subject might be dismissed before there was time for hetty to resume her communications the voice of deerslayer was heard calling on his friend in the outer room at this summons the serpent arose to obey and hetty joined her sister    chapter xiv       a stranger animal cries one     sure never livd beneath the sun     a lizards body lean and long     a fishs head a serpents tongue     its foot with triple claw disjoined     and what a length of tail behind      james merrick the chameleon 112126  the first act of the delaware on rejoining his friend was to proceed gravely to disencumber himself of his civilized attire and to stand forth an indian warrior again the protest of deerslayer was met by his communicating the fact that the presence of an indian in the hut was known to the iroquois and that maintaining the disguise would be more likely to direct suspicions to his real object than if he came out openly as a member of a hostile tribe when the latter understood the truth and was told that he had been deceived in supposing the chief had succeeded in entering the ark undiscovered he cheerfully consented to the change since further attempt at concealment was useless a gentler feeling than the one avowed however lay at the bottom of the indians desire to appear as a son of the forest he had been told that hist was on the opposite shore and nature so far triumphed over all distinctions of habit and tribes and people as to reduce this young savage warrior to the level of a feeling which would have been found in the most refined inhabitant of a town under similar circumstances there was a mild satisfaction in believing that she he loved could see him and as he walked out on the platform in his scanty native attire an apollo of the wilderness a hundred of the tender fancies that fleet through lovers brains beset his imagination and softened his heart all this was lost on deerslayer who was no great adept in the mysteries of cupid but whose mind was far more occupied with the concerns that forced themselves on his attention than with any of the truant fancies of love he soon recalled his companion therefore to a sense of their actual condition by summoning him to a sort of council of war in which they were to settle their future course in the dialogue that followed the parties mutually made each other acquainted with what had passed in their several interviews chingachgook was told the history of the treaty about the ransom and deerslayer heard the whole of hettys communications the latter listened with generous interest to his friends hopes and promised cheerfully all the assistance he could lend  tis our main arnd sarpent as you know this battling for the castle and old hutters darters coming in as a sort of accident yesyesill be actyve in helping little hist whos not only one of the best and handsomest maidens of the tribe but the very best and handsomest ive always encouraged you chief in that liking and its proper too that a great and ancient race like yourn shouldnt come to an end if a woman of red skin and red gifts could get to be near enough to me to wish her for a wife id sarch for just such another but that can never be no that can never be im glad hetty has met with hist howsever for though the first is a little short of wit and understanding the last has enough for both yes sarpent laughing heartilyput em together and two smarter gals isnt to be found in all york colony  i will go to the iroquois camp returned the delaware gravely no one knows chingachgook but wah and a treaty for lives and scalps should be made by a chief give me the strange beasts and let me take a canoe  deerslayer dropped his head and played with the end of a fishpole in the water as he sat dangling his legs over the edge of the platform like a man who was lost in thought by the sudden occurrence of a novel idea instead of directly answering the proposal of his friend he began to soliloquize a circumstance however that in no manner rendered his words more true as he was remarkable for saying what he thought whether the remarks were addressed to himself or to any one else  yesyes he saidthis must be what they call love ive heard say that it sometimes upsets reason altogether leaving a young man as helpless as to calculation and caution as a brute beast to think that the sarpent should be so lost to reason and cunning and wisdom we must sartainly manage to get hist off and have em married as soon as we get back to the tribe or this war will be of no more use to the chief than a hunt a little oncommon extrornary yesyeshell never be the man he was till this matter is off his mind and he comes to his senses like all the rest of mankind sarpent you cant be in airnest and therefore i shall say but little to your offer but youre a chief and will soon be sent out on the war path at head of the parties and ill just ask if youd think of putting your forces into the inimys hands afore the battle is fout  wah ejaculated the indian  aywahi know well enough its wah and altogether wahraally sarpent im consarned and mortified about you i never heard so weak an idee come from a chief and he too one thats already got a name for being wise young and inexperenced as he is canoe you shant have so long as the vice of frindship and warning can count for any thing  my paleface friend is right a cloud came over the face of chingachgook and weakness got into his mind while his eyes were dim my brother has a good memory for good deeds and a weak memory for bad he will forget  yes thats easy enough say no more about it chief but if another of them clouds blow near you do your endivours to get out of its way clouds are bad enough in the weather but when they come to the reason it gets to be serious now sit down by me here and let us calculate our movements a little for we shall soon either have a truce and a peace or we shall come to an actyve and bloody war you see the vagabonds can make logs sarve their turn as well as the best raftsmen on the rivers and it would be no great explite for them to invade us in a body ive been thinking of the wisdom of putting all old toms stores into the ark of barring and locking up the castle and of taking to the ark altogether that is moveable and by keeping the sail up and shifting places we might worry through a great many nights without them canada wolves finding a way into our sheep fold  chingachgook listened to this plan with approbation did the negotiation fail there was now little hope that the night would pass without an assault and the enemy had sagacity enough to understand that in carrying the castle they would probably become masters of all it contained the offered ransom included and still retain the advantages they had hitherto gained some precaution of the sort appeared to be absolutely necessary for now the numbers of the iroquois were known a night attack could scarcely be successfully met it would be impossible to prevent the enemy from getting possession of the canoes and the ark and the latter itself would be a hold in which the assailants would be as effectually protected against bullets as were those in the building for a few minutes both the men thought of sinking the ark in the shallow water of bringing the canoes into the house and of depending altogether on the castle for protection but reflection satisfied them that in the end this expedient would fail it was so easy to collect logs on the shore and to construct a raft of almost any size that it was certain the iroquois now they had turned their attention to such means would resort to them seriously so long as there was the certainty of success by perseverance after deliberating maturely and placing all the considerations fairly before them the two young beginners in the art of forest warfare settled down into the opinion that the ark offered the only available means of security this decision was no sooner come to than it was communicated to judith the girl had no serious objection to make and all four set about the measures necessary to carrying the plan into execution  the reader will readily understand that floating toms worldly goods were of no great amount a couple of beds some wearing apparel the arms and ammunition a few cooking utensils with the mysterious and but half examined chest formed the principal items these were all soon removed the ark having been hauled on the eastern side of the building so that the transfer could be made without being seen from the shore it was thought unnecessary to disturb the heavier and coarser articles of furniture as they were not required in the ark and were of but little value in themselves as great caution was necessary in removing the different objects most of which were passed out of a window with a view to conceal what was going on it required two or three hours before all could be effected by the expiration of that time the raft made its appearance moving from the shore deerslayer immediately had recourse to the glass by the aid of which he perceived that two warriors were on it though they appeared to be unarmed the progress of the raft was slow a circumstance that formed one of the great advantages that would be possessed by the scow in any future collision between them the movements of the latter being comparatively swift and light as there was time to make the dispositions for the reception of the two dangerous visitors everything was prepared for them long before they had got near enough to be hailed the serpent and the girls retired into the building where the former stood near the door well provided with rifles while judith watched the proceedings without through a loop as for deerslayer he had brought a stool to the edge of the platform at the point towards which the raft was advancing and taken his seat with his rifle leaning carelessly between his legs  as the raft drew nearer every means possessed by the party in the castle was resorted to in order to ascertain if their visitors had any firearms neither deerslayer nor chingachgook could discover any but judith unwilling to trust to simple eyesight thrust the glass through the loop and directed it towards the hemlock boughs that lay between the two logs of the raft forming a sort of flooring as well as a seat for the use of the rowers when the heavy moving craft was within fifty feet of him deerslayer hailed the hurons directing them to cease rowing it not being his intention to permit them to land compliance of course was necessary and the two grimlooking warriors instantly quitted their seats though the raft continued slowly to approach until it had driven in much nearer to the platform  are ye chiefs demanded deerslayer with dignityare ye chiefsor have the mingos sent me warriors without names on such an arnd if so the sooner ye go back the sooner them will be likely to come that a warrior can talk with  hugh exclaimed the elder of the two on the raft rolling his glowing eyes over the different objects that were visible in and about the castle with a keenness that showed how little escaped him my brother is very proud but rivenoak we use the literal translation of the term writing as we do in english is a name to make a delaware turn pale  thats true or its a lie rivenoak as it may be but i am not likely to turn pale seeing that i was born pale whats your arnd and why do you come among light bark canoes on logs that are not even dug out  the iroquois are not ducks to walk on water let the palefaces give them a canoe and theyll come in a canoe  thats more rational than likely to come to pass we have but four canoes and being four persons thats only one for each of us we thank you for the offer howsever though we ask leave not to accept it you are welcome iroquois on your logs  thanksmy young paleface warriorhe has got a namehow do the chiefs call him  deerslayer hesitated a moment and a gleam of pride and human weakness came over him he smiled muttered between his teeth and then looking up proudly he saidmingo like all who are young and actyve ive been known by different names at different times one of your warriors whose spirit started for the happy grounds of your people as lately as yesterday morning thought i desarved to be known by the name of hawkeye and this because my sight happened to be quicker than his own when it got to be life or death atween us  chingachgook who was attentively listening to all that passed heard and understood this proof of passing weakness in his friend and on a future occasion he questioned him more closely concerning the transaction on the point where deerslayer had first taken human life when he had got the whole truth he did not fail to communicate it to the tribe from which time the young hunter was universally known among the delawares by an appellation so honorably earned as this however was a period posterior to all the incidents of this tale we shall continue to call the young hunter by the name under which he has been first introduced to the reader nor was the iroquois less struck with the vaunt of the white man he knew of the death of his comrade and had no difficulty in understanding the allusion the intercourse between the conqueror and his victim on that occasion having been seen by several savages on the shore of the lake who had been stationed at different points just within the margin of bushes to watch the drifting canoes and who had not time to reach the scene of action ere the victor had retired the effect on this rude being of the forest was an exclamation of surprise then such a smile of courtesy and wave of the hand succeeded as would have done credit to asiatic diplomacy the two iroquois spoke to each other in low tones and both drew near the end of the raft that was closest to the platform  my brother hawkeye has sent a message to the hurons resumed rivenoak and it has made their hearts very glad they hear he has images of beasts with two tails will he show them to his friends  inimies would be truer returned deerslayer but sound isnt sense and does little harm here is one of the images i toss it to you under faith of treaties if its not returned the rifle will settle the pint atween us  the iroquois seemed to acquiesce in the conditions and deerslayer arose and prepared to toss one of the elephants to the raft both parties using all the precaution that was necessary to prevent its loss as practice renders men expert in such things the little piece of ivory was soon successfully transferred from one hand to the other and then followed another scene on the raft in which astonishment and delight got the mastery of indian stoicism these two grim old warriors manifested even more feeling as they examined the curiously wrought chessman than had been betrayed by the boy for in the case of the latter recent schooling had interposed its influence while the men like all who are sustained by well established characters were not ashamed to let some of their emotions be discovered for a few minutes they apparently lost the consciousness of their situation in the intense scrutiny they bestowed on a material so fine work so highly wrought and an animal so extraordinary the lip of the moose is perhaps the nearest approach to the trunk of the elephant that is to be found in the american forest but this resemblance was far from being sufficiently striking to bring the new creature within the range of their habits and ideas and the more they studied the image the greater was their astonishment nor did these children of the forest mistake the structure on the back of the elephant for a part of the animal they were familiar with horses and oxen and had seen towers in the canadas and found nothing surprising in creatures of burthen still by a very natural association they supposed the carving meant to represent that the animal they saw was of a strength sufficient to carry a fort on its back a circumstance that in no degree lessened their wonder  has my paleface brother any more such beasts at last the senior of the iroquois asked in a sort of petitioning manner  theres more where them came from mingo was the answer one is enough howsever to buy off fifty scalps  one of my prisoners is a great warriortall as a pinestrong as the mooseactive as a deerfierce as the panther some day hell be a great chief and lead the army of king george  tuttut mingo hurry harry is hurry harry and youll never make more than a corporal of him if you do that hes tall enough of a sartainty but thats of no use as he only hits his head agin the branches as he goes through the forest hes strong too but a strong body isnt a strong head and the kings generals are not chosen for their sinews hes swift if you will but a rifle bullet is swifter and as for ferceness its no great ricommend to a soldier they that think they feel the stoutest often givin out at the pinch no no youll niver make hurrys scalp pass for more than a good head of curly hair and a rattle pate beneath it  my old prisoner very wiseking of the lakegreat warrior wise counsellor  well theres them that might gainsay all this too mingo a very wise man wouldnt be apt to be taken in so foolish a manner as befell master hutter and if he gives good counsel he must have listened to very bad in that affair theres only one king of this lake and hes a long way off and isnt likely ever to see it floating tom is some such king of this region as the wolf that prowls through the woods is king of the forest a beast with two tails is well worth two such scalps  but my brother has another beasthe will give twoholding up as many fingers for old father  floating tom is no father of mine but hell fare none the worse for that as for giving two beasts for his scalp and each beast with two tails it is quite beyond reason think yourself well off mingo if you make a much worse trade  by this time the selfcommand of rivenoak had got the better of his wonder and he began to fall back on his usual habits of cunning in order to drive the best bargain he could it would be useless to relate more than the substance of the desultory dialogue that followed in which the indian manifested no little management in endeavoring to recover the ground lost under the influence of surprise he even affected to doubt whether any original for the image of the beast existed and asserted that the oldest indian had never heard a tradition of any such animal little did either of them imagine at the time that long ere a century elapsed the progress of civilization would bring even much more extraordinary and rare animals into that region as curiosities to be gazed at by the curious and that the particular beast about which the disputants contended would be seen laving its sides and swimming in the very sheet of water on which they had met  the otsego is a favorite place for the caravan keepers to let their elephants bathe the writer has seen two at a time since the publication of this book swimming about in company  as is not uncommon on such occasions one of the parties got a little warm in the course of the discussion for deerslayer met all the arguments and prevarication of his subtle opponent with his own cool directness of manner and unmoved love of truth what an elephant was he knew little better than the savage but he perfectly understood that the carved pieces of ivory must have some such value in the eyes of an iroquois as a bag of gold or a package of beaver skins would in those of a trader under the circumstances therefore he felt it to be prudent not to concede too much at first since there existed a nearly unconquerable obstacle to making the transfers even after the contracting parties had actually agreed upon the terms keeping this difficulty in view he held the extra chessmen in reserve as a means of smoothing any difficulty in the moment of need  at length the savage pretended that further negotiation was useless since he could not be so unjust to his tribe as to part with the honor and emoluments of two excellent full grown male scalps for a consideration so trifling as a toy like that he had seen and he prepared to take his departure both parties now felt as men are wont to feel when a bargain that each is anxious to conclude is on the eve of being broken off in consequence of too much pertinacity in the way of management the effect of the disappointment was very different however on the respective individuals deerslayer was mortified and filled with regret for he not only felt for the prisoners but he also felt deeply for the two girls the conclusion of the treaty therefore left him melancholy and full of regret with the savage his defeat produced the desire of revenge in a moment of excitement he had loudly announced his intention to say no more and he felt equally enraged with himself and with his cool opponent that he had permitted a pale face to manifest more indifference and selfcommand than an indian chief when he began to urge his raft away from the platform his countenance lowered and his eye glowed even while he affected a smile of amity and a gesture of courtesy at parting  it took some little time to overcome the inertia of the logs and while this was being done by the silent indian rivenoak stalked over the hemlock boughs that lay between the logs in sullen ferocity eyeing keenly the while the hut the platform and the person of his late disputant once he spoke in low quick tones to his companion and he stirred the boughs with his feet like an animal that is restive at that moment the watchfulness of deerslayer had a little abated for he sat musing on the means of renewing the negotiation without giving too much advantage to the other side it was perhaps fortunate for him that the keen and bright eyes of judith were as vigilant as ever at the instant when the young man was least on his guard and his enemy was the most on the alert she called out in a warning voice to the former most opportunely giving the alarm  be on your guard deerslayer the girl criedi see rifles with the glass beneath the hemlock brush and the iroquois is loosening them with his feet  it would seem that the enemy had carried their artifices so far as to employ an agent who understood english the previous dialogue had taken place in his own language but it was evident by the sudden manner in which his feet ceased their treacherous occupation and in which the countenance of rivenoak changed from sullen ferocity to a smile of courtesy that the call of the girl was understood signing to his companion to cease his efforts to set the logs in motion he advanced to the end of the raft which was nearest to the platform and spoke  why should rivenoak and his brother leave any cloud between them he said they are both wise both brave and both generous they ought to part friends one beast shall be the price of one prisoner  and mingo answered the other delighted to renew the negotiations on almost any terms and determined to clinch the bargain if possible by a little extra liberality youll see that a paleface knows how to pay a full price when he trades with an open heart and an open hand keep the beast that you had forgotten to give back to me as you was about to start and which i forgot to ask for on account of consarn at parting in anger show it to your chiefs when you bring us our frinds two more shall be added to it and hesitating a moment in distrust of the expediency of so great a concession then deciding in its favorand if we see them afore the sun sets we may find a fourth to make up an even number  this settled the matter every gleam of discontent vanished from the dark countenance of the iroquois and he smiled as graciously if not as sweetly as judith hutter herself the piece already in his possession was again examined and an ejaculation of pleasure showed how much he was pleased with this unexpected termination of the affair in point of fact both he and deerslayer had momentarily forgotten what had become of the subject of their discussion in the warmth of their feelings but such had not been the case with rivenoaks companion this man retained the piece and had fully made up his mind were it claimed under such circumstances as to render its return necessary to drop it in the lake trusting to his being able to find it again at some future day this desperate expedient however was no longer necessary and after repeating the terms of agreement and professing to understand them the two indians finally took their departure moving slowly towards the shore  can any faith be put in such wretches asked judith when she and hetty had come out on the platform and were standing at the side of deerslayer watching the dull movement of the logs will they not rather keep the toy they have and send us off some bloody proofs of their getting the better of us in cunning by way of boasting ive heard of acts as bad as this  no doubt judith no manner of doubt if it wasnt for indian natur but im no judge of a redskin if that two taild beast doesnt set the whole tribe in some such stir as a stick raises in a beehive now theres the sarpent a man with narves like flint and no more curosity in every day consarns than is befitting prudence why he was so overcome with the sight of the creatur carved as it is in bone that i felt ashamed for him thats just their gifts howsever and one cant well quarrel with a man for his gifts when they are lawful chingachgook will soon get over his weakness and remember that hes a chief and that he comes of a great stock and has a renowned name to support and uphold but as for yonder scamps therell be no peace among em until they think theyve got possession of every thing of the natur of that bit of carved bone thats to be found among thomas hutters stores  they only know of the elephants and can have no hopes about the other things  thats true judith still covetousness is a craving feelin theyll say if the palefaces have these curous beasts with two tails who knows but theyve got some with three or for that matter with four thats what the schoolmasters call natral arithmetic and twill be sartain to beset the feelins of savages theyll never be easy till the truth is known  do you think deerslayer inquired hetty in her simple and innocent manner that the iroquois wont let father and hurry go i read to them several of the very best verses in the whole bible and you see what they have done already  the hunter as he always did listened kindly and even affectionately to hettys remarks then he mused a moment in silence there was something like a flush on his cheek as he answered after quite a minute had passed  i dont know whether a white man ought to be ashamed or not to own he cant read but such is my case judith you are skilful i find in all such matters while i have only studied the hand of god as it is seen in the hills and the valleys the mountaintops the streams the forests and the springs much larning may be got in this way as well as out of books and yet i sometimes think it is a white mans gift to read when i hear from the mouths of the moravians the words of which hetty speaks they raise a longing in my mind and i then think i will know how to read em myself but the game in summer and the traditions and lessons in war and other matters have always kept me behind hand  shall i teach you deerslayer asked hetty earnestly im weakminded they say but i can read as well as judith it might save your life to know how to read the bible to the savages and it will certainly save your soul for mother told me that again and again  thankee hettyyes thankee with all my heart these are like to be too stirring times for much idleness but after its peace and i come to see you agin on this lake then ill give myself up to it as if twas pleasure and profit in a single business perhaps i ought to be ashamed judith that tis so but truth is truth as for these iroquois tisnt very likely theyll forget a beast with two tails on account of a varse or two from the bible i rather expect theyll give up the prisoners and trust to some sarcumvenion or other to get em back agin with us and all in the castle and the ark in the bargain howsever we must humour the vagabonds first to get your father and hurry out of their hands and next to keep the peace atween us until such time as the sarpent there can make out to get off his betrothed wife if theres any sudden outbreakin of anger and ferocity the indians will send off all their women and children to the camp at once whereas by keeping em calm and trustful we may manage to meet hist at the spot she has mentioned rather than have the bargain fall through now id throw in half a dozen of them effigy bowandarrow men such as weve in plenty in the chist  judith cheerfully assented for she would have resigned even the flowered brocade rather than not redeem her father and please deerslayer the prospects of success were now so encouraging as to raise the spirits of all in the castle though a due watchfulness of the movements of the enemy was maintained hour passed after hour notwithstanding and the sun had once more begun to fall towards the summits of the western hills and yet no signs were seen of the return of the raft by dint of sweeping the shore with the glass deerslayer at length discovered a place in the dense and dark woods where he entertained no doubt the iroquois were assembled in considerable numbers it was near the thicket whence the raft had issued and a little rill that trickled into the lake announced the vicinity of a spring here then the savages were probably holding their consultation and the decision was to be made that went to settle the question of life or death for the prisoners there was one ground for hope in spite of the delay however that deerslayer did not fail to place before his anxious companions it was far more probable that the indians had left their prisoners in the camp than that they had encumbered themselves by causing them to follow through the woods a party that was out on a merely temporary excursion if such was the fact it required considerable time to send a messenger the necessary distance and to bring the two white men to the spot where they were to embark encouraged by these reflections a new stock of patience was gathered and the declension of the sun was viewed with less alarm  the result justified deerslayers conjecture not long before the sun had finally disappeared the two logs were seen coming out of the thicket again and as it drew near judith announced that her father and hurry both of them pinioned lay on the bushes in the centre as before the two indians were rowing the latter seemed to be conscious that the lateness of the hour demanded unusual exertions and contrary to the habits of their people who are ever averse to toil they labored hard at the rude substitutes for oars in consequence of this diligence the raft occupied its old station in about half the time that had been taken in the previous visits  even after the conditions were so well understood and matters had proceeded so far the actual transfer of the prisoners was not a duty to be executed without difficulty the iroquois were compelled to place great reliance on the good faith of their foes though it was reluctantly given and was yielded to necessity rather than to confidence as soon as hutter and hurry should be released the party in the castle numbered two to one as opposed to those on the raft and escape by flight was out of the question as the former had three bark canoes to say nothing of the defences of the house and the ark all this was understood by both parties and it is probable the arrangement never could have been completed had not the honest countenance and manner of deerslayer wrought their usual effect on rivenoak  my brother knows i put faith in him said the latter as he advanced with hutter whose legs had been released to enable the old man to ascend to the platform one scalpone more beast  stop mingo interrupted the hunter keep your prisoner a moment i have to go and seek the means of payment  this excuse however though true in part was principally a fetch deerslayer left the platform and entering the house he directed judith to collect all the arms and to conceal them in her own room he then spoke earnestly to the delaware who stood on guard as before near the entrance of the building put the three remaining castles in his pocket and returned  you are welcome back to your old abode master hutter said deerslayer as he helped the other up on the platform slyly passing into the hand of rivenoak at the same time another of the castles youll find your darters right glad to see you and heres hetty come herself to say as much in her own behalf  here the hunter stopped speaking and broke out into a hearty fit of his silent and peculiar laughter hurrys legs were just released and he had been placed on his feet so tightly had the ligatures been drawn that the use of his limbs was not immediately recovered and the young giant presented in good sooth a very helpless and a somewhat ludicrous picture it was this unusual spectacle particularly the bewildered countenance that excited the merriment of deerslayer  you look like a girdled pine in a clearin hurry harry that is rocking in a gale said deerslayer checking his unseasonable mirth more from delicacy to the others than from any respect to the liberated captive im glad howsever to see that you havent had your hair dressed by any of the iroquois barbers in your late visit to their camp  harkee deerslayer returned the other a little fiercely it will be prudent for you to deal less in mirth and more in friendship on this occasion act like a christian for once and not like a laughing gal in a country school when the masters back is turned and just tell me whether theres any feet or not at the end of these legs of mine i think i can see them but as for feelin they might as well be down on the banks of the mohawk as be where they seem to be  youve come off whole hurry and thats not a little answered the other secretly passing to the indian the remainder of the stipulated ransom and making an earnest sign at the same moment for him to commence his retreat youve come off whole feet and all and are only a little numb from a tight fit of the withes naturll soon set the blood in motion and then you may begin to dance to celebrate what i call a most wonderful and onexpected deliverance from a den of wolves  deerslayer released the arms of his friends as each landed and the two were now stamping and limping about on the platform growling and uttering denunciations as they endeavored to help the returning circulation they had been tethered too long however to regain the use of their limbs in a moment and the indians being quite as diligent on their return as on their advance the raft was fully a hundred yards from the castle when hurry turning accidentally in that direction discovered how fast it was getting beyond the reach of his vengeance by this time he could move with tolerable facility though still numb and awkward without considering his own situation however he seized the rifle that leaned against the shoulder of deerslayer and attempted to cock and present it the young hunter was too quick for him seizing the piece he wrenched it from the hands of the giant not however until it had gone off in the struggle when pointed directly upward it is probable that deerslayer could have prevailed in such a contest on account of the condition of hurrys limbs but the instant the gun went off the latter yielded and stumped towards the house raising his legs at each step quite a foot from the ground from an uncertainty of the actual position of his feet but he had been anticipated by judith the whole stock of hutters arms which had been left in the building as a resource in the event of a sudden outbreaking of hostilities had been removed and were already secreted agreeably to deerslayers directions in consequence of this precaution no means offered by which march could put his designs in execution  disappointed in his vengeance hurry seated himself and like hutter for half an hour he was too much occupied in endeavoring to restore the circulation and in regaining the use of his limbs to indulge in any other reflections by the end of this time the raft had disappeared and night was beginning to throw her shadows once more over the whole sylvan scene before darkness had completely set in and while the girls were preparing the evening meal deerslayer related to hutter an outline of events that had taken place and gave him a history of the means he had adopted for the security of his children and property    chapter xv       as long as edwarde rules thys lande     ne quiet you wylle ye know     your sonnes and husbandes shall be slayne     and brookes with bloode shall flowe      you leave youre geode and lawfulle kynge     whenne ynne adversity     like me untoe the true cause stycke     and for the true cause dye      chatterton  the calm of evening was again in singular contrast while its gathering gloom was in as singular unison with the passions of men the sun was set and the rays of the retiring luminary had ceased to gild the edges of the few clouds that had sufficient openings to admit the passage of its fading light the canopy overhead was heavy and dense promising another night of darkness but the surface of the lake was scarcely disturbed by a ripple there was a little air though it scarce deserved to be termed wind still being damp and heavy it had a certain force the party in the castle were as gloomy and silent as the scene the two ransomed prisoners felt humbled and discoloured but their humility partook of the rancour of revenge they were far more disposed to remember the indignity with which they had been treated during the last few hours of their captivity than to feel grateful for the previous indulgence then that keensighted monitor conscience by reminding them of the retributive justice of all they had endured goaded them rather to turn the tables on their enemies than to accuse themselves as for the others they were thoughtful equally from regret and joy deerslayer and judith felt most of the former sensation though from very different causes while hetty for the moment was perfectly happy the delaware had also lively pictures of felicity in the prospect of so soon regaining his betrothed under such circumstances and in this mood all were taking the evening meal  old tom cried hurry bursting into a fit of boisterous laughter you lookd amazinly like a tethered bear as you was stretched on them hemlock boughs and i only wonder you didnt growl more well its over and syths and lamentations wont mend the matter theres the blackguard rivenoak he that brought us off has an oncommon scalp and id give as much for it myself as the colony yes i feel as rich as the governor in these matters now and will lay down with them doubloon for doubloon judith darling did you mourn for me much when i was in the hands of the philipsteins  the last were a family of german descent on the mohawk to whom hurry had a great antipathy and whom he had confounded with the enemies of judea  our tears have raised the lake hurry march as you might have seen by the shore returned judith with a feigned levity that she was far from feeling that hetty and i should have grieved for father was to be expected but we fairly rained tears for you  we were sorry for poor hurry as well as for father judith put in her innocent and unconscious sister  true girl true but we feel sorrow for everybody thats in trouble you know returned the other in a quick admonitory manner and a low tone nevertheless we are glad to see you master march and out of the hands of the philipsteins too  yes theyre a bad set and so is the other brood of em down on the river its a wonderment to me how you got us off deerslayer and i forgive you the interference that prevented my doin justice on that vagabond for this small service let us into the secret that we may do you the same good turn at need was it by lying or by coaxing  by neither hurry but by buying we paid a ransom for you both and that too at a price so high you had well be on your guard agin another captyvement lest our stock of goods shouldnt hold out  a ransom old tom has paid the fiddler then for nothing of mine would have bought off the hair much less the skin i didnt think men as keen set as them vagabonds would let a fellow up so easy when they had him fairly at a close hug and floored but money is money and somehow its unnatral hard to withstand indian or white man tis pretty much the same it must be owned judith theres a considerable of human natur in mankind ginirally arter all  hutter now rose and signing to deerslayer he led him to an inner room where in answer to his questions he first learned the price that had been paid for his release the old man expressed neither resentment nor surprise at the inroad that had been made on his chest though he did manifest some curiosity to know how far the investigation of its contents had been carried he also inquired where the key had been found the habitual frankness of deerslayer prevented any prevarication and the conference soon terminated by the return of the two to the outer room or that which served for the double purpose of parlour and kitchen  i wonder if its peace or war between us and the savages exclaimed hurry just as deerslayer who had paused for a single instant listened attentively and was passing through the outer door without stopping this givin up captives has a friendly look and when men have traded together on a fair and honourable footing they ought to part frinds for that occasion at least come back deerslayer and let us have your judgment for im beginnin to think more of you since your late behaviour than i used to do  theres an answer to your question hurry since youre in such haste to come agin to blows  as deerslayer spoke he threw on the table on which the other was reclining with one elbow a sort of miniature fagot composed of a dozen sticks bound tightly together with a deerskin thong march seized it eagerly and holding it close to a blazing knot of pine that lay on the hearth and which gave out all the light there was in the room ascertained that the ends of the several sticks had been dipped in blood  if this isnt plain english said the reckless frontier man its plain indian heres what they call a dicliration of war down at york judith how did you come by this defiance deerslayer  fairly enough it lay not a minut since in what you call floatin toms dooryard  how came it there  it never fell from the clouds judith as little toads sometimes do and then it dont rain  you must prove where it come from deerslayer or we shall suspect some design to skear them that would have lost their wits long ago if fear could drive em away  deerslayer had approached a window and cast a glance out of it on the dark aspect of the lake as if satisfied with what he beheld he drew near hurry and took the bundle of sticks into his own hand examining it attentively  yes this is an indian declaration of war sure enough he said and its a proof how little youre suited to be on the path it has travelled harry march that it has got here and you never the wiser as to the means the savages may have left the scalp on your head but they must have taken off the ears else youd have heard the stirring of the water made by the lad as he come off agin on his two logs his arnd was to throw these sticks at our door as much as to say weve struck the warpost since the trade and the next thing will be to strike you  the prowling wolves but hand me that rifle judith and ill send an answer back to the vagabonds through their messenger  not while i stand by master march coolly put in deerslayer motioning for the other to forbear faith is faith whether given to a redskin or to a christian the lad lighted a knot and came off fairly under its blaze to give us this warning and no man here should harm him while emplyed on such an arnd theres no use in words for the boy is too cunning to leave the knot burning now his business is done and the night is already too dark for a rifle to have any sartainty  that may be true enough as to a gun but theres virtue still in a canoe answered hurry passing towards the door with enormous strides carrying a rifle in his hands the being doesnt live that shall stop me from following and bringing back that riptyles scalp the more on em that you crush in the egg the fewer therell be to dart at you in the woods  judith trembled like the aspen she scarce knew why herself though there was the prospect of a scene of violence for if hurry was fierce and overbearing in the consciousness of his vast strength deerslayer had about him the calm determination that promises greater perseverance and a resolution more likely to effect its object it was the stern resolute eye of the latter rather than the noisy vehemence of the first that excited her apprehensions hurry soon reached the spot where the canoe was fastened but not before deerslayer had spoken in a quick earnest voice to the serpent in delaware the latter had been the first in truth to hear the sounds of the oars and he had gone upon the platform in jealous watchfulness the light satisfied him that a message was coming and when the boy cast his bundle of sticks at his feet it neither moved his anger nor induced surprise he merely stood at watch rifle in hand to make certain that no treachery lay behind the defiance as deerslayer now called to him he stepped into the canoe and quick as thought removed the paddles hurry was furious when he found that he was deprived of the means of proceeding he first approached the indian with loud menaces and even deerslayer stood aghast at the probable consequences march shook his sledgehammer fists and flourished his arms as he drew near the indian and all expected he would attempt to fell the delaware to the earth one of them at least was well aware that such an experiment would be followed by immediate bloodshed but even hurry was awed by the stern composure of the chief and he too knew that such a man was not to be outraged with impunity he therefore turned to vent his rage on deerslayer where he foresaw no consequences so terrible what might have been the result of this second demonstration if completed is unknown since it was never made  hurry said a gentle soothing voice at his elbow its wicked to be so angry and god will not overlook it the iroquois treated you well and they didnt take your scalp though you and father wanted to take theirs  the influence of mildness on passion is well known hetty too had earned a sort of consideration that had never before been enjoyed by her through the selfdevotion and decision of her recent conduct perhaps her established mental imbecility by removing all distrust of a wish to control aided her influence let the cause be as questionable as it might the effect we sufficiently certain instead of throttling his old fellowtraveler hurry turned to the girl and poured out a portion of his discontent if none of his anger in her attentive ears  tis too bad hetty he exclaimed as bad as a county gaol or a lack of beaver to get a creatur into your very trap then to see it get off as much as six first quality skins in valie has paddled off on them clumsy logs when twenty strokes of a wellturned paddle would overtake em i say in valie for as to the boy in the way of natur he is only a boy and is worth neither more nor less than one deerslayer youve been ontrue to your frinds in letting such a chance slip through my fingers well as your own  the answer was given quietly but with a voice as steady as a fearless nature and the consciousness of rectitude could make it i should have been untrue to the right had i done otherwise returned the deerslayer steadily and neither you nor any other man has authority to demand that much of me the lad came on a lawful business and the meanest redskin that roams the woods would be ashamed of not respecting his arnd but hes now far beyond your reach master march and theres little use in talking like a couple of women of what can no longer be helped  so saying deerslayer turned away like one resolved to waste no more words on the subject while hutter pulled harry by the sleeve and led him into the ark there they sat long in private conference in the mean time the indian and his friend had their secret consultation for though it wanted some three or four hours to the rising of the star the former could not abstain from canvassing his scheme and from opening his heart to the other judith too yielded to her softer feelings and listened to the whole of hettys artless narrative of what occurred after she landed the woods had few terrors for either of these girls educated as they had been and accustomed as they were to look out daily at their rich expanse or to wander beneath their dark shades but the elder sister felt that she would have hesitated about thus venturing alone into an iroquois camp concerning hist hetty was not very communicative she spoke of her kindness and gentleness and of the meeting in the forest but the secret of chingachgook was guarded with a shrewdness and fidelity that many a sharperwitted girl might have failed to display  at length the several conferences were broken up by the reappearance of hutter on the platform here he assembled the whole party and communicated as much of his intentions as he deemed expedient of the arrangement made by deerslayer to abandon the castle during the night and to take refuge in the ark he entirely approved it struck him as it had the others as the only effectual means of escaping destruction now that the savages had turned their attention to the construction of rafts no doubt could exist of their at least making an attempt to carry the building and the message of the bloody sticks sufficiently showed their confidence in their own success in short the old man viewed the night as critical and he called on all to get ready as soon as possible in order to abandon the dwellings temporarily at least if not forever  these communications made everything proceeded promptly and with intelligence the castle was secured in the manner already described the canoes were withdrawn from the dock and fastened to the ark by the side of the other the few necessaries that had been left in the house were transferred to the cabin the fire was extinguished and all embarked  the vicinity of the hills with their drapery of pines had the effect to render nights that were obscure darker than common on the lake as usual however a belt of comparative light was etched through the centre of the sheet while it was within the shadows of the mountains that the gloom rested most heavily on the water the island or castle stood in this belt of comparative light but still the night was so dark as to cover the aperture of the ark at the distance of an observer on the shore her movements could not be seen at all more particularly as a background of dark hillside filled up the perspective of every view that was taken diagonally or directly across the water the prevailing wind on the lakes of that region is west but owing to the avenues formed by the mountains it is frequently impossible to tell the true direction of the currents as they often vary within short distances and brief differences of time this is truer in light fluctuating puffs of air than in steady breezes though the squalls of even the latter are familiarly known to be uncertain and baffling in all mountainous regions and narrow waters on the present occasion hutter himself as he shoved the ark from her berth at the side of the platform was at a loss to pronounce which way the wind blew in common this difficulty was solved by the clouds which floating high above the hill tops as a matter of course obeyed the currents but now the whole vault of heaven seemed a mass of gloomy wall not an opening of any sort was visible and chingachgook was already trembling lest the nonappearance of the star might prevent his betrothed from being punctual to her appointment under these circumstances hutter hoisted his sail seemingly with the sole intention of getting away from the castle as it might be dangerous to remain much longer in its vicinity the air soon filled the cloth and when the scow was got under command and the sail was properly trimmed it was found that the direction was southerly inclining towards the eastern shore no better course offering for the purposes of the party the singular craft was suffered to skim the surface of the water in this direction for more than hour when a change in the currents of the air drove them over towards the camp  deerslayer watched all the movements of hutter and harry with jealous attention at first he did not know whether to ascribe the course they held to accident or to design but he now began to suspect the latter familiar as hutter was with the lake it was easy to deceive one who had little practice on the water and let his intentions be what they might it was evident ere two hours had elapsed that the ark had got sufficient space to be within a hundred rods of the shore directly abreast of the known position of the camp for a considerable time previously to reaching this point hurry who had some knowledge of the algonquin language had been in close conference with the indian and the result was now announced by the latter to deerslayer who had been a cold not to say distrusted lookeron of all that passed  my old father and my young brother the big pinefor so the delaware had named marchwant to see huron scalps at their belts said chingachgook to his friend there is room for some on the girdle of the sarpent and his people will look for them when he goes back to his village their eyes must not be left long in a fog but they must see what they look for i know that my brother has a white hand he will not strike even the dead he will wait for us when we come back he will not hide his face from shame for his friend the great serpent of the mohicans must be worthy to go on the warpath with hawkeye  ay ay sarpent i see how it is that names to stick and in time i shall get to be known by it instead of deerslayer well if such honours will come the humblest of us all must be willing to abide by em as for your looking for scalps it belongs to your gifts and i see no harm in it be marciful sarpent howsever be marciful i beseech of you it surely can do no harm to a redskins honour to show a little marcy as for the old man the father of two young women who might ripen better feelins in his heart and harry march here who pine as he is might better bear the fruit of a more christianized tree as for them two i leave them in the hands of the white mans god wasnt it for the bloody sticks no man should go agin the mingos this night seein that it would dishonor our faith and characters but them that crave blood cant complain if blood is shed at their call still sarpent you can be marciful dont begin your career with the wails of women and the cries of children bear yourself so that hist will smile and not weep when she meets you go then and the manitou presarve you  my brother will stay here with the scow wah will soon be standing on the shore waiting and chingachgook must hasten  the indian then joined his two coadventurers and first lowering the sail they all three entered the canoe and left the side of the ark neither hutter nor march spoke to deerslayer concerning their object or the probable length of their absence all this had been confided to the indian who had acquitted himself of the trust with characteristic brevity as soon as the canoe was out of sight and that occurred ere the paddles had given a dozen strokes deerslayer made the best dispositions he could to keep the ark as nearly stationary as possible and then he sat down in the end of the scow to chew the cud of his own bitter reflections it was not long however before he was joined by judith who sought every occasion to be near him managing her attack on his affections with the address that was suggested by native coquetry aided by no little practice but which received much of its most dangerous power from the touch of feeling that threw around her manner voice accents thoughts and acts the indescribable witchery of natural tenderness leaving the young hunter exposed to these dangerous assailants it has become our more immediate business to follow the party in the canoe to the shore  the controlling influence that led hutter and hurry to repeat their experiment against the camp was precisely that which had induced the first attempt a little heightened perhaps by the desire of revenge but neither of these two rude beings so ruthless in all things that touched the rights and interests of the red man thought possessing veins of human feeling on other matters was much actuated by any other desire than a heartless longing for profit hurry had felt angered at his sufferings when first liberated it is true but that emotion soon disappeared in the habitual love of gold which he sought with the reckless avidity of a needy spendthrift rather than with the ceaseless longings of a miser in short the motive that urged them both so soon to go against the hurons was an habitual contempt of their enemy acting on the unceasing cupidity of prodigality the additional chances of success however had their place in the formation of the second enterprise it was known that a large portion of the warriorsperhaps allwere encamped for the night abreast of the castle and it was hoped that the scalps of helpless victims would be the consequence to confess the truth hutter in particularhe who had just left two daughters behind himexpected to find few besides women and children in the camp the fact had been but slightly alluded to in his communications with hurry and with chingachgook it had been kept entirely out of view if the indian thought of it at all it was known only to himself  hutter steered the canoe hurry had manfully taken his post in the bows and chingachgook stood in the centre we say stood for all three were so skilled in the management of that species of frail bark as to be able to keep erect positions in the midst of the darkness the approach to the shore was made with great caution and the landing effected in safety the three now prepared their arms and began their tigerlike approach upon the camp the indian was on the lead his two companions treading in his footsteps with a stealthy cautiousness of manner that rendered their progress almost literally noiseless occasionally a dried twig snapped under the heavy weight of the gigantic hurry or the blundering clumsiness of the old man but had the indian walked on air his step could not have seemed lighter the great object was first to discover the position of the fire which was known to be the centre of the whole encampment at length the keen eye of chingachgook caught a glimpse of this important guide it was glimmering at a distance among the trunks of trees there was no blaze but merely a single smouldering brand as suited the hour the savages usually retiring and rising with the revolutions of the sun  as soon as a view was obtained of this beacon the progress of the adventurers became swifter and more certain in a few minutes they got to the edge of the circle of little huts here they stopped to survey their ground and to concert their movements the darkness was so deep as to render it difficult to distinguish anything but the glowing brand the trunks of the nearest trees and the endless canopy of leaves that veiled the clouded heaven it was ascertained however that a hut was quite near and chingachgook attempted to reconnnoitre its interior the manner in which the indian approached the place that was supposed to contain enemies resembled the wily advances of the cat on the bird as he drew near he stooped to his hands and knees for the entrance was so low as to require this attitude even as a convenience before trusting his head inside however he listened long to catch the breathing of sleepers no sound was audible and this human serpent thrust his head in at the door or opening as another serpent would have peered in on the nest nothing rewarded the hazardous experiment for after feeling cautiously with a hand the place was found to be empty  the delaware proceeded in the same guarded manner to one or two more of the huts finding all in the same situation he then returned to his companions and informed them that the hurons had deserted their camp a little further inquiry corroborated this fact and it only remained to return to the canoe the different manner in which the adventurers bore the disappointment is worthy of a passing remark the chief who had landed solely with the hope of acquiring renown stood stationary leaning against a tree waiting the pleasure of his companions he was mortified and a little surprised it is true but he bore all with dignity falling back for support on the sweeter expectations that still lay in reserve for that evening it was true he could not now hope to meet his mistress with the proofs of his daring and skill on his person but he might still hope to meet her and the warrior who was zealous in the search might always hope to be honored on the other hand hutter and hurry who had been chiefly instigated by the basest of all human motives the thirst of gain could scarce control their feelings they went prowling among the huts as if they expected to find some forgotten child or careless sleeper and again and again did they vent their spite on the insensible huts several of which were actually torn to pieces and scattered about the place nay they even quarrelled with each other and fierce reproaches passed between them it is possible some serious consequences might have occurred had not the delaware interfered to remind them of the danger of being so unguarded and of the necessity of returning to the ark this checked the dispute and in a few minutes they were paddling sullenly back to the spot where they hoped to find that vessel  it has been said that judith took her place at the side of deerslayer soon after the adventurers departed for a short time the girl was silent and the hunter was ignorant which of the sisters had approached him but he soon recognized the rich fullspirited voice of the elder as her feelings escaped in words  this is a terrible life for women deerslayer she exclaimed would to heaven i could see an end of it  the life is well enough judith was the answer being pretty much as it is used or abused what would you wish to see in its place  i should be a thousand times happier to live nearer to civilized beingswhere there are farms and churches and houses built as it might be by christian hands and where my sleep at night would be sweet and tranquil a dwelling near one of the forts would be far better than this dreary place where we live  nay judith i cant agree too lightly in the truth of all this if forts are good to keep off inimies they sometimes hold inimies of their own i dont think twould be for your good or the good of hetty to live near one and if i must say what i think im afeard you are a little too near as it is deerslayer went on in his own steady earnest manner for the darkness concealed the tints that colored the cheeks of the girl almost to the brightness of crimson while her own great efforts suppressed the sounds of the breathing that nearly choked her as for farms they have their uses and theres them that like to pass their lives on em but what comfort can a man look for in a clearin that he cant find in double quantities in the forest if air and room and light are a little craved the windrows and the streams will furnish em or here are the lakes for such as have bigger longings in that way but where are you to find your shades and laughing springs and leaping brooks and vinerable trees a thousand years old in a clearin you dont find them but you find their disabled trunks marking the arth like headstones in a graveyard it seems to me that the people who live in such places must be always thinkin of their own inds and of universal decay and that too not of the decay that is brought about by time and natur but the decay that follows waste and violence then as to churches they are good i suppose else wouldnt good men uphold em but they are not altogether necessary they call em the temples of the lord but judith the whole arth is a temple of the lord to such as have the right mind neither forts nor churches make people happier of themselves moreover all is contradiction in the settlements while all is concord in the woods forts and churches almost always go together and yet theyre downright contradictions churches being for peace and forts for war no nogive me the strong places of the wilderness which is the trees and the churches too which are arbors raised by the hand of natur  woman is not made for scenes like these deerslayer scenes of which we shall have no end as long as this war lasts  if you mean women of white colour i rather think youre not far from the truth gal but as for the females of the redmen such visitations are quite in character nothing would make hist now the bargained wife of yonder delaware happier than to know that he is at this moment prowling around his natral inimies striving after a scalp  surely surely deerslayer she cannot be a woman and not feel concern when she thinks the man she loves is in danger  she doesnt think of the danger judith but of the honor and when the heart is desperately set on such feelins why there is little room to crowd in fear hist is a kind gentle laughing pleasant creatur but she loves honor as well as any delaware gal i ever knowd shes to meet the sarpent an hour hence on the pint where hetty landed and no doubt she has her anxiety about it like any other woman but shed be all the happier did she know that her lover was at this moment waylaying a mingo for his scalp  if you really believe this deerslayer no wonder you lay so much stress on gifts certain am i that no white girl could feel anything but misery while she believed her betrothed in danger of his life nor do i suppose even you unmoved and calm as you ever seem to be could be at peace if you believed your hist in danger  thats a different mattertis altogether a different matter judith woman is too weak and gentle to be intended to run such risks and man must feel for her yes i rather think thats as much red natur as its white but i have no hist nor am i like to have for i hold it wrong to mix colours any way except in friendship and sarvices  in that you are and feel as a white man should as for hurry harry i do think it would be all the same to him whether his wife were a squaw or a governors daughter provided she was a little comely and could help to keep his craving stomach full  you do march injustice judith yes you do the poor fellow dotes on you and when a man has raally set his heart on such a creatur it isnt a mingo or even a delaware gal thatll be likely to unsettle his mind you may laugh at such men as hurry and i for were rough and unteached in the ways of books and other knowledge but weve our good pints as well as our bad ones an honest heart is not to be despised gal even though it be not varsed in all the niceties that please the female fancy  you deerslayer and do youcan you for an instant suppose i place you by the side of harry march no no i am not so far gone in dullness as that no oneman or womancould think of naming your honest heart manly nature and simple truth with the boisterous selfishness greedy avarice and overbearing ferocity of harry march the very best that can be said of him is to be found in his name of hurry skurry which if it means no great harm means no great good even my father following his feelings with the other as he is doing at this moment well knows the difference between you this i know for he said as much to me in plain language  judith was a girl of quick sensibilities and of impetuous feelings and being under few of the restraints that curtail the manifestations of maiden emotions among those who are educated in the habits of civilized life she sometimes betrayed the latter with a feeling that was so purely natural as to place it as far above the wiles of coquetry as it was superior to its heartlessness she had now even taken one of the hard hands of the hunter and pressed it between both her own with a warmth and earnestness that proved how sincere was her language it was perhaps fortunate that she was checked by the very excess of her feelings since the same power might have urged her on to avow all that her father had saidthe old man not having been satisfied with making a comparison favorable to deerslayer as between the hunter and hurry but having actually in his blunt rough way briefly advised his daughter to cast off the latter entirely and to think of the former as a husband judith would not willingly have said this to any other man but there was so much confidence awakened by the guileless simplicity of deerslayer that one of her nature found it a constant temptation to overstep the bounds of habit she went no further however immediately relinquishing the hand and falling back on a reserve that was more suited to her sex and indeed to her natural modesty  thankee judith thankee with all my heart returned the hunter whose humility prevented him from placing any flattering interpretation on either the conduct or the language of the girl thankee as much as if it was all true harrys sightlyyes hes as sightly as the tallest pine of the mountains and the sarpent has named him accordingly however some fancy good looks and some fancy good conduct only hurry has one advantage and it depends on himself whether hell have tother orhark thats your fathers voice gal and he speaks like a man whos riled at something  god save us from any more of these horrible scenes exclaimed judith bending her face to her knees and endeavoring to exclude the discordant sounds by applying her hands to her ears i sometimes wish i had no father  this was bitterly said and the repinings which extorted the words were bitterly felt it is impossible to say what might next have escaped her had not a gentle low voice spoken at her elbow  judith i ought to have read a chapter to father and hurry said the innocent but terrified speaker and that would have kept them from going again on such an errand do you call to them deerslayer and tell them i want them and that it will be good for them both if theyll return and hearken to my words  ahs me poor hetty you little know the cravins for gold and revenge if you believe they are so easily turned aside from their longins but this is an uncommon business in more ways than one judith i hear your father and hurry growling like bears and yet no noise comes from the mouth of the young chief theres an ind of secrecy and yet his whoop which ought to ring in the mountains accordin to rule in such sarcumstances is silent  justice may have alighted on him and his death have saved the lives of the innocent  not itnot itthe sarpent is not the one to suffer if thats to be the law sartainly there has been no onset and tis most likely that the camps deserted and the men are comin back disappinted that accounts for the growls of hurry and the silence of the sarpent  just at this instant a fall of a paddle was heard in the canoe for vexation made march reckless deerslayer felt convinced that his conjecture was true the sail being down the ark had not drifted far and ere many minutes he heard chingachgook in a low quiet tone directing hutter how to steer in order to reach it in less time than it takes to tell the fact the canoe touched the scow and the adventurers entered the latter neither hutter nor hurry spoke of what had occurred but the delaware in passing his friend merely uttered the words fires out which if not literally true sufficiently explained the truth to his listener  it was now a question as to the course to be steered a short surly conference was held when hutter decided that the wisest way would be to keep in motion as the means most likely to defeat any attempt at a surpriseannouncing his own and marchs intention to requite themselves for the loss of sleep during their captivity by lying down as the air still baffled and continued light it was finally determined to sail before it let it come in what direction it might so long as it did not blow the ark upon the strand this point settled the released prisoners helped to hoist the sail and they threw themselves upon two of the pallets leaving deerslayer and his friend to look after the movements of the craft as neither of the latter was disposed to sleep on account of the appointment with hist this arrangement was acceptable to all parties that judith and hetty remained up also in no manner impaired the agreeable features of this change  for some time the scow rather drifted than sailed along the western shore following a light southerly current of the air the progress was slownot exceeding a couple of miles in the hourbut the two men perceived that it was not only carrying them towards the point they desired to reach but at a rate that was quite as fast as the hour yet rendered necessary but little more was said the while even by the girls and that little had more reference to the rescue of hist than to any other subject the indian was calm to the eye but as minute after minute passed his feelings became more and more excited until they reached a state that might have satisfied the demands of even the most exacting mistress deerslayer kept the craft as much in the bays as was prudent for the double purpose of sailing within the shadows of the woods and of detecting any signs of an encampment they might pass on the shore in this manner they doubled one low point and were already in the bay that was terminated north by the goal at which they aimed the latter was still a quarter of a mile distant when chingachgook came silently to the side of his friend and pointed to a place directly ahead a small fire was glimmering just within the verge of the bushes that lined the shore on the southern side of the pointleaving no doubt that the indians had suddenly removed their camp to the very place or at least the very projection of land where hist had given them the rendezvous    chapter xvi       i hear thee babbling to the vale     of sunshine and of flowers     but unto me thou bringst a tale     of visionary hours      wordsworth  one discovery mentioned at the close of the preceding chapter was of great moment in the eyes of deerslayer and his friend in the first place there was the danger almost the certainty that hutter and hurry would make a fresh attempt on this camp should they awake and ascertain its position then there was the increased risk of landing to bring off hist and there were the general uncertainty and additional hazards that must follow from the circumstance that their enemies had begun to change their positions as the delaware was aware that the hour was near when he ought to repair to the rendezvous he no longer thought of trophies torn from his foes and one of the first things arranged between him and his associate was to permit the two others to sleep on lest they should disturb the execution of their plans by substituting some of their own the ark moved slowly and it would have taken fully a quarter of an hour to reach the point at the rate at which they were going thus affording time for a little forethought the indians in the wish to conceal their fire from those who were thought to be still in the castle had placed it so near the southern side of the point as to render it extremely difficult to shut it in by the bushes though deerslayer varied the direction of the scow both to the right and to the left in the hope of being able to effect that object  theres one advantage judith in finding that fire so near the water he said while executing these little manoeuvres since it shows the mingos believe we are in the hut and our coming on em from this quarter will be an unlooked for event but its lucky harry march and your father are asleep else we should have em prowling after scalps agin ha therethe bushes are beginning to shut in the fireand now it cant be seen at all  deerslayer waited a little to make certain that he had at last gained the desired position when he gave the signal agreed on and chingachgook let go the grapnel and lowered the sail  the situation in which the ark now lay had its advantages and its disadvantages the fire had been hid by sheering towards the shore and the latter was nearer perhaps than was desirable still the water was known to be very deep further off in the lake and anchoring in deep water under the circumstances in which the party was placed was to be avoided if possible it was also believed no raft could be within miles and though the trees in the darkness appeared almost to overhang the scow it would not be easy to get off to her without using a boat the intense darkness that prevailed so close in with the forest too served as an effectual screen and so long as care was had not to make a noise there was little or no danger of being detected all these things deerslayer pointed out to judith instructing her as to the course she was to follow in the event of an alarm for it was thought to the last degree inexpedient to arouse the sleepers unless it might be in the greatest emergency  and now judith as we understand one another it is time the sarpent and i had taken to the canoe the hunter concluded the star has not risen yet its true but it soon must though none of us are likely to be any the wiser for it tonight on account of the clouds howsever hist has a ready mind and shes one of them that doesnt always need to have a thing afore her to see it ill warrant you shell not be either two minutes or two feet out of the way unless them jealous vagabonds the mingos have taken the alarm and put her as a stoolpigeon to catch us or have hid her away in order to prepare her mind for a huron instead of a mohican husband  deerslayer interrupted the girl earnestly this is a most dangerous service why do you go on it at all  ananwhy you know gal we go to bring off hist the sarpents betrothedthe maid he means to marry as soon as we get back to the tribe  that is all right for the indianbut you do not mean to marry histyou are not betrothed and why should two risk their lives and liberties to do that which one can just as well perform  ahnow i understand you judithyes now i begin to take the idee you think as hist is the sarpents betrothed as they call it and not mine its altogether his affair and as one man can paddle a canoe he ought to be left to go after his gal alone but you forget this is our arnd here on the lake and it would not tell well to forget an arnd just as the pinch came then if love does count for so much with some people particularly with young women frindship counts for something too with other some i dares to say the delaware can paddle a canoe by himself and can bring off hist by himself and perhaps he would like that quite as well as to have me with him but he couldnt sarcumvent sarcumventions or stir up an ambushment or fight with the savages and get his sweetheart at the same time as well by himself as if he had a frind with him to depend on even if that frind is no better than myself nonojudith you wouldnt desert one that counted on you at such a moment and you cant in reason expect me to do it  i feari believe you are right deerslayer and yet i wish you were not to go promise me one thing at least and that is not to trust yourself among the savages or to do anything more than to save the girl that will be enough for once and with that you ought to be satisfied  lord bless you gal one would think it was hetty thats talking and not the quickwitted and wonderful judith hutter but fright makes the wise silly and the strong weak yes ive seen proofs of that time and agin well its kind and softhearted in you judith to feel this consarn for a fellow creatur and i shall always say that you are kind and of true feelings let them that envy your good looks tell as many idle stories of you as they may  deerslayer hastily said the girl interrupting him though nearly choked by her own emotions do you believe all you hear about a poor motherless girl is the foul tongue of hurry harry to blast my life  not it judithnot it ive told hurry it wasnt manful to backbite them he couldnt win by fair means and that even an indian is always tender touching a young womans good name  if i had a brother he wouldnt dare to do it exclaimed judith with eyes flashing fire but finding me without any protector but an old man whose ears are getting to be as dull as his feelings he has his way as he pleases  not exactly that judith no not exactly that neither no man brother or stranger would stand by and see as fair a gal as yourself hunted down without saying a word in her behalf hurrys in arnest in wanting to make you his wife and the little he does let out agin you comes more from jealousy like than from any thing else smile on him when he awakes and squeeze his hand only half as hard as you squeezed mine a bit ago and my life on it the poor fellow will forget every thing but your comeliness hot words dont always come from the heart but oftener from the stomach than anywhere else try him judith when he awakes and see the virtue of a smile  deerslayer laughed in his own manner as he concluded and then he intimated to the patientlooking but really impatient chingachgook his readiness to proceed as the young man entered the canoe the girl stood immovable as stone lost in the musings that the language and manner of the other were likely to produce the simplicity of the hunter had completely put her at fault for in her narrow sphere judith was an expert manager of the other sex though in the present instance she was far more actuated by impulses in all she had said and done than by calculation we shall not deny that some of judiths reflections were bitter though the sequel of the tale must be referred to in order to explain how merited or how keen were her sufferings  chingachgook and his paleface friend set forth on their hazardous and delicate enterprise with a coolness and method that would have done credit to men who were on their twentieth instead of being on their first warpath as suited his relation to the pretty fugitive in whose service they were engaged the indian took his place in the head of the canoe while deerslayer guided its movements in the stern by this arrangement the former would be the first to land and of course the first to meet his mistress the latter had taken his post without comment but in secret influenced by the reflection that one who had so much at stake as the indian might not possibly guide the canoe with the same steadiness and intelligence as another who had more command of his feelings from the instant they left the side of the ark the movements of the two adventurers were like the manoeuvres of highlydrilled soldiers who for the first time were called on to meet the enemy in the field as yet chingachgook had never fired a shot in anger and the debut of his companion in warfare is known to the reader it is true the indian had been hanging about his enemys camp for a few hours on his first arrival and he had even once entered it as related in the last chapter but no consequences had followed either experiment now it was certain that an important result was to be effected or a mortifying failure was to ensue the rescue or the continued captivity of hist depended on the enterprise in a word it was virtually the maiden expedition of these two ambitious young forest soldiers and while one of them set forth impelled by sentiments that usually carry men so far both had all their feelings of pride and manhood enlisted in their success  instead of steering in a direct line to the point then distant from the ark less than a quarter of a mile deerslayer laid the head of his canoe diagonally towards the centre of the lake with a view to obtain a position from which he might approach the shore having his enemies in his front only the spot where hetty had landed and where hist had promised to meet them moreover was on the upper side of the projection rather than on the lower and to reach it would have required the two adventurers to double nearly the whole point close in with the shore had not this preliminary step been taken so well was the necessity for this measure understood that chingachgook quietly paddled on although it was adopted without consulting him and apparently was taking him in a direction nearly opposite to that one might think he most wished to go a few minutes sufficed however to carry the canoe the necessary distance when both the young men ceased paddling as it were by instinctive consent and the boat became stationary the darkness increased rather than diminished but it was still possible from the place where the adventurers lay to distinguish the outlines of the mountains in vain did the delaware turn his head eastward to catch a glimpse of the promised star for notwithstanding the clouds broke a little near the horizon in that quarter of the heavens the curtain continued so far drawn as effectually to conceal all behind it in front as was known by the formation of land above and behind it lay the point at the distance of about a thousand feet no signs of the castle could be seen nor could any movement in that quarter of the lake reach the ear the latter circumstance might have been equally owing to the distance which was several miles or to the fact that nothing was in motion as for the ark though scarcely farther from the canoe than the point it lay so completely buried in the shadows of the shore that it would not have been visible even had there been many degrees more of light than actually existed  the adventurers now held a conference in low voices consulting together as to the probable time deerslayer thought it wanted yet some minutes to the rising of the star while the impatience of the chief caused him to fancy the night further advanced and to believe that his betrothed was already waiting his appearance on the shore as might have been expected the opinion of the latter prevailed and his friend disposed himself to steer for the place of rendezvous the utmost skill and precaution now became necessary in the management of the canoe the paddles were lifted and returned to the water in a noiseless manner and when within a hundred yards of the beach chingachgook took in his altogether laying his hand on his rifle in its stead as they got still more within the belt of darkness that girded the woods it was seen that they were steering too far north and the course was altered accordingly the canoe now seemed to move by instinct so cautious and deliberate were all its motions still it continued to advance until its bows grated on the gravel of the beach at the precise spot where hetty had landed and whence her voice had issued the previous night as the ark was passing there was as usual a narrow strand but bushes fringed the woods and in most places overhung the water  chingachgook stepped upon the beach and cautiously examined it for some distance on each side of the canoe in order to do this he was often obliged to wade to his knees in the lake but no hist rewarded his search when he returned he found his friend also on the shore they next conferred in whispers the indian apprehending that they must have mistaken the place of rendezvous but deerslayer thought it was probable they had mistaken the hour while he was yet speaking he grasped the arm of the delaware caused him to turn his head in the direction of the lake and pointed towards the summits of the eastern mountains the clouds had broken a little apparently behind rather than above the hills and the evening star was glittering among the branches of a pine this was every way a flattering omen and the young men leaned on their rifles listening intently for the sound of approaching footsteps voices they often heard and mingled with them were the suppressed cries of children and the low but sweet laugh of indian women as the native americans are habitually cautious and seldom break out in loud conversation the adventurers knew by these facts that they must be very near the encampment it was easy to perceive that there was a fire within the woods by the manner in which some of the upper branches of the trees were illuminated but it was not possible where they stood to ascertain exactly how near it was to themselves once or twice it seemed as if stragglers from around the fire were approaching the place of rendezvous but these sounds were either altogether illusion or those who had drawn near returned again without coming to the shore a quarter of an hour was passed in this state of intense expectation and anxiety when deerslayer proposed that they should circle the point in the canoe and by getting a position close in where the camp could be seen reconnoitre the indians and thus enable themselves to form some plausible conjectures for the nonappearance of hist the delaware however resolutely refused to quit the spot reasonably enough offering as a reason the disappointment of the girl should she arrive in his absence deerslayer felt for his friends concern and offered to make the circuit of the point by himself leaving the latter concealed in the bushes to await the occurrence of any fortunate event that might favour his views with this understanding then the parties separated  as soon as deerslayer was at his post again in the stern of the canoe he left the shore with the same precautions and in the same noiseless manner as he had approached it on this occasion he did not go far from the land the bushes affording a sufficient cover by keeping as close in as possible indeed it would not have been easy to devise any means more favourable to reconnoitering round an indian camp than those afforded by the actual state of things the formation of the point permitted the place to be circled on three of its sides and the progress of the boat was so noiseless as to remove any apprehensions from an alarm through sound the most practised and guarded foot might stir a bunch of leaves or snap a dried stick in the dark but a bark canoe could be made to float over the surface of smooth water almost with the instinctive readiness and certainly with the noiseless movements of an aquatic bird  deerslayer had got nearly in a line between the camp and the ark before he caught a glimpse of the fire this came upon him suddenly and a little unexpectedly at first causing an alarm lest he had incautiously ventured within the circle of light it cast but perceiving at a second glance that he was certainly safe from detection so long as the indians kept near the centre of the illumination he brought the canoe to a state of rest in the most favourable position he could find and commenced his observations  we have written much but in vain concerning this extraordinary being if the reader requires now to be told that untutored as he was in the learning of the world and simple as he ever showed himself to be in all matters touching the subtleties of conventional taste he was a man of strong native poetical feeling he loved the woods for their freshness their sublime solitudes their vastness and the impress that they everywhere bore of the divine hand of their creator he seldom moved through them without pausing to dwell on some peculiar beauty that gave him pleasure though seldom attempting to investigate the causes and never did a day pass without his communing in spirit and this too without the aid of forms or language with the infinite source of all he saw felt and beheld thus constituted in a moral sense and of a steadiness that no danger could appall or any crisis disturb it is not surprising that the hunter felt a pleasure at looking on the scene he now beheld that momentarily caused him to forget the object of his visit this will more fully appear when we describe it  the canoe lay in front of a natural vista not only through the bushes that lined the shore but of the trees also that afforded a clear view of the camp it was by means of this same opening that the light had been first seen from the ark in consequence of their recent change of ground the indians had not yet retired to their huts but had been delayed by their preparations which included lodging as well as food a large fire had been made as much to answer the purpose of torches as for the use of their simple cookery and at this precise moment it was blazing high and bright having recently received a large supply of dried brush the effect was to illuminate the arches of the forest and to render the whole area occupied by the camp as light as if hundreds of tapers were burning most of the toil had ceased and even the hungriest child had satisfied its appetite in a word the time was that moment of relaxation and general indolence which is apt to succeed a hearty meal and when the labours of the day have ended the hunters and the fishermen had been totally successful and food that one great requisite of savage life being abundant every other care appeared to have subsided in the sense of enjoyment dependent on this allimportant fact  deerslayer saw at a glance that many of the warriors were absent his acquaintance rivenoak however was present being seated in the foreground of a picture that salvator rosa would have delighted to draw his swarthy features illuminated as much by pleasure as by the torchlike flame while he showed another of the tribe one of the elephants that had caused so much sensation among his people a boy was looking over his shoulder in dull curiosity completing the group more in the background eight or ten warriors lay half recumbent on the ground or sat with their backs reclining against trees so many types of indolent repose their arms were near them all sometimes leaning against the same trees as themselves or were lying across their bodies in careless preparation but the group that most attracted the attention of deerslayer was that composed of the women and children all the females appeared to be collected together and almost as a matter of course their young were near them the former laughed and chatted in their rebuked and quiet manner though one who knew the habits of the people might have detected that everything was not going on in its usual train most of the young women seemed to be lighthearted enough but one old hag was seated apart with a watchful soured aspect which the hunter at once knew betokened that some duty of an unpleasant character had been assigned her by the chiefs what that duty was he had no means of knowing but he felt satisfied it must be in some measure connected with her own sex the aged among the women generally being chosen for such offices and no other  as a matter of course deerslayer looked eagerly and anxiously for the form of hist she was nowhere visible though the light penetrated to considerable distances in all directions around the fire once or twice he started as he thought he recognized her laugh but his ears were deceived by the soft melody that is so common to the indian female voice at length the old woman spoke loud and angrily and then he caught a glimpse of one or two dark figures in the background of trees which turned as if obedient to the rebuke and walked more within the circle of the light a young warriors form first came fairly into view then followed two youthful females one of whom proved to be the delaware girl deerslayer now comprehended it all hist was watched possibly by her young companion certainly by the old woman the youth was probably some suitor of either her or her companion but even his discretion was distrusted under the influence of his admiration the known vicinity of those who might be supposed to be her friends and the arrival of a strange red man on the lake had induced more than the usual care and the girl had not been able to slip away from those who watched her in order to keep her appointment deerslayer traced her uneasiness by her attempting once or twice to look up through the branches of the trees as if endeavouring to get glimpses of the star she had herself named as the sign for meeting all was vain however and after strolling about the camp a little longer in affected indifference the two girls quitted their male escort and took seats among their own sex as soon as this was done the old sentinel changed her place to one more agreeable to herself a certain proof that she had hitherto been exclusively on watch  deerslayer now felt greatly at a loss how to proceed he well knew that chingachgook could never be persuaded to return to the ark without making some desperate effort for the recovery of his mistress and his own generous feelings well disposed him to aid in such an undertaking he thought he saw the signs of an intention among the females to retire for the night and should he remain and the fire continue to give out its light he might discover the particular hut or arbour under which hist reposed a circumstance that would be of infinite use in their future proceedings should he remain however much longer where he was there was great danger that the impatience of his friend would drive him into some act of imprudence at each instant indeed he expected to see the swarthy form of the delaware appearing in the background like the tiger prowling around the fold taking all things into consideration therefore he came to the conclusion it would be better to rejoin his friend and endeavour to temper his impetuosity by some of his own coolness and discretion it required but a minute or two to put this plan in execution the canoe returning to the strand some ten or fifteen minutes after it had left it  contrary to his expectations perhaps deerslayer found the indian at his post from which he had not stirred fearful that his betrothed might arrive during his absence a conference followed in which chingachgook was made acquainted with the state of things in the camp when hist named the point as the place of meeting it was with the expectation of making her escape from the old position and of repairing to a spot that she expected to find without any occupants but the sudden change of localities had disconcerted all her plans a much greater degree of vigilance than had been previously required was now necessary and the circumstance that an aged woman was on watch also denoted some special grounds of alarm all these considerations and many more that will readily suggest themselves to the reader were briefly discussed before the young men came to any decision the occasion however being one that required acts instead of words the course to be pursued was soon chosen  disposing of the canoe in such a manner that hist must see it should she come to the place of meeting previously to their return the young men looked to their arms and prepared to enter the wood the whole projection into the lake contained about two acres of land and the part that formed the point and on which the camp was placed did not compose a surface of more than half that size it was principally covered with oaks which as is usual in the american forests grew to a great height without throwing out a branch and then arched in a dense and rich foliage beneath except the fringe of thick bushes along the shore there was very little underbrush though in consequence of their shape the trees were closer together than is common in regions where the axe has been freely used resembling tall straight rustic columns upholding the usual canopy of leaves the surface of the land was tolerably even but it had a small rise near its centre which divided it into a northern and southern half on the latter the hurons had built their fire profiting by the formation to conceal it from their enemies who it will be remembered were supposed to be in the castle which bore northerly a brook also came brawling down the sides of the adjacent hills and found its way into the lake on the southern side of the point it had cut for itself a deep passage through some of the higher portions of the ground and in later days when this spot has become subjected to the uses of civilization by its windings and shaded banks it has become no mean accessory in contributing to the beauty of the place this brook lay west of the encampment and its waters found their way into the great reservoir of that region on the same side and quite near to the spot chosen for the fire all these peculiarities so far as circumstances allowed had been noted by deerslayer and explained to his friend  the reader will understand that the little rise in the ground that lay behind the indian encampment greatly favoured the secret advance of the two adventurers it prevented the light of the fire diffusing itself on the ground directly in the rear although the land fell away towards the water so as to leave what might be termed the left or eastern flank of the position unprotected by this covering we have said unprotected though that is not properly the word since the knoll behind the huts and the fire offered a cover for those who were now stealthily approaching rather than any protection to the indians deerslayer did not break through the fringe of bushes immediately abreast of the canoe which might have brought him too suddenly within the influence of the light since the hillock did not extend to the water but he followed the beach northerly until he had got nearly on the opposite side of the tongue of land which brought him under the shelter of the low acclivity and consequently more in the shadow  as soon as the friends emerged from the bushes they stopped to reconnoitre the fire was still blazing behind the little ridge casting its light upward into the tops of the trees producing an effect that was more pleasing than advantageous still the glare had its uses for while the background was in obscurity the foreground was in strong light exposing the savages and concealing their foes profiting by the latter circumstance the young men advanced cautiously towards the ridge deerslayer in front for he insisted on this arrangement lest the delaware should be led by his feelings into some indiscretion it required but a moment to reach the foot of the little ascent and then commenced the most critical part of the enterprise moving with exceeding caution and trailing his rifle both to keep its barrel out of view and in readiness for service the hunter put foot before foot until he had got sufficiently high to overlook the summit his own head being alone brought into the light chingachgook was at his side and both paused to take another close examination of the camp in order however to protect themselves against any straggler in the rear they placed their bodies against the trunk of an oak standing on the side next the fire  the view that deerslayer now obtained of the camp was exactly the reverse of that he had perceived from the water the dim figures which he had formerly discovered must have been on the summit of the ridge a few feet in advance of the spot where he was now posted the fire was still blazing brightly and around it were seated on logs thirteen warriors which accounted for all whom he had seen from the canoe they were conversing with much earnestness among themselves the image of the elephant passing from hand to hand the first burst of savage wonder had abated and the question now under discussion was the probable existence the history and the habits of so extraordinary an animal we have not leisure to record the opinions of these rude men on a subject so consonant to their lives and experience but little is hazarded in saying that they were quite as plausible and far more ingenious than half the conjectures that precede the demonstrations of science however much they may have been at fault as to their conclusions and inferences it is certain that they discussed the questions with a zealous and most undivided attention for the time being all else was forgotten and our adventurers could not have approached at a more fortunate instant  the females were collected near each other much as deerslayer had last seen them nearly in a line between the place where he now stood and the fire the distance from the oak against which the young men leaned and the warriors was about thirty yards the women may have been half that number of yards nigher the latter indeed were so near as to make the utmost circumspection as to motion and noise indispensable although they conversed in their low soft voices it was possible in the profound stillness of the woods even to catch passages of the discourse and the lighthearted laugh that escaped the girls might occasionally have reached the canoe deerslayer felt the tremolo that passed through the frame of his friend when the latter first caught the sweet sounds that issued from the plump pretty lips of hist he even laid a hand on the shoulder of the indian as a sort of admonition to command himself as the conversation grew more earnest each leaned forward to listen  the hurons have more curious beasts than that said one of the girls contemptuously for like the men they conversed of the elephant and his qualities the delawares will think this creature wonderful but tomorrow no huron tongue will talk of it our young men will find him if the animals dare to come near our wigwams  this was in fact addressed to wahtawah though she who spoke uttered her words with an assumed diffidence and humility that prevented her looking at the other  the delawares are so far from letting such creatures come into their country returned hist that no one has even seen their images there their young men would frighten away the images as well as the beasts  the delaware young menthe nation is womeneven the deer walk when they hear their hunters coming who has ever heard the name of a young delaware warrior  this was said in goodhumour and with a laugh but it was also said bitingly that hist so felt it was apparent by the spirit betrayed in her answer  who has ever heard the name of a young delaware she repeated earnestly tamenund himself though now as old as the pines on the hill or as the eagles in the air was once young his name was heard from the great salt lake to the sweet waters of the west what is the family of uncas where is another as great though the palefaces have ploughed up its grates and trodden on its bones do the eagles fly as high is the deer as swift or the panther as brave is there no young warrior of that race let the huron maidens open their eyes wider and they may see one called chingachgook who is as stately as a young ash and as tough as the hickory  as the girl used her figurative language and told her companions to open their eyes and they would see the delaware deerslayer thrust his fingers into the sides of his friend and indulged in a fit of his hearty benevolent laughter the other smiled but the language of the speaker was too flattering and the tones of her voice too sweet for him to be led away by any accidental coincidence however ludicrous the speech of hist produced a retort and the dispute though conducted in goodhumour and without any of the coarse violence of tone and gesture that often impairs the charms of the sex in what is called civilized life grew warm and slightly clamorous in the midst of this scene the delaware caused his friend to stoop so as completely to conceal himself and then he made a noise so closely resembling the little chirrup of the smallest species of the american squirrel that deerslayer himself though he had heard the imitation a hundred times actually thought it came from one of the little animals skipping about over his head the sound is so familiar in the woods that none of the hurons paid it the least attention hist however instantly ceased talking and sat motionless still she had sufficient selfcommand to abstain from turning her head she had heard the signal by which her lover so often called her from the wigwam to the stolen interview and it came over her senses and her heart as the serenade affects the maiden in the land of song  from that moment chingachgook felt certain that his presence was known this was effecting much and he could now hope for a bolder line of conduct on the part of his mistress than she might dare to adopt under an uncertainty of his situation it left no doubt of her endeavouring to aid him in his effort to release her deerslayer arose as soon as the signal was given and though he had never held that sweet communion which is known only to lovers he was not slow to detect the great change that had come over the manner of the girl she still affected to dispute though it was no longer with spirit and ingenuity but what she said was uttered more as a lure to draw her antagonists on to an easy conquest than with any hopes of succeeding herself once or twice it is true her native readiness suggested a retort or an argument that raised a laugh and gave her a momentary advantage but these little sallies the offspring of motherwit served the better to conceal her real feelings and to give to the triumph of the other party a more natural air than it might have possessed without them at length the disputants became wearied and they rose in a body as if about to separate it was now that hist for the first time ventured to turn her face in the direction whence the signal had come in doing this her movements were natural but guarded and she stretched her arm and yawned as if overcome with a desire to sleep the chirrup was again heard and the girl felt satisfied as to the position of her lover though the strong light in which she herself was placed and the comparative darkness in which the adventurers stood prevented her from seeing their heads the only portions of their forms that appeared above the ridge at all the tree against which they were posted had a dark shadow cast upon it by the intervention of an enormous pine that grew between it and the fire a circumstance which alone would have rendered objects within its cloud invisible at any distance this deerslayer well knew and it was one of the reasons why he had selected this particular tree  the moment was near when it became necessary for hist to act she was to sleep in a small hut or bower that had been built near where she stood and her companion was the aged hag already mentioned once within the hut with this sleepless old woman stretched across the entrance as was her nightly practice the hope of escape was nearly destroyed and she might at any moment be summoned to her bed luckily at this instant one of the warriors called to the old woman by name and bade her bring him water to drink there was a delicious spring on the northern side of the point and the hag took a gourd from a branch and summoning hist to her side she moved towards the summit of the ridge intending to descend and cross the point to the natural fountain all this was seen and understood by the adventurers and they fell back into the obscurity concealing their persons by trees until the two females had passed them in walking hist was held tightly by the hand as she moved by the tree that hid chingachgook and his friend the former felt for his tomahawk with the intention to bury it in the brain of the woman but the other saw the hazard of such a measure since a single scream might bring all the warriors upon them and he was averse to the act on considerations of humanity his hand therefore prevented the blow still as the two moved past the chirrup was repeated and the huron woman stopped and faced the tree whence the sounds seemed to proceed standing at the moment within six feet of her enemies she expressed her surprise that a squirrel should be in motion at so late an hour and said it boded evil hist answered that she had heard the same squirrel three times within the last twenty minutes and that she supposed it was waiting to obtain some of the crumbs left from the late supper this explanation appeared satisfactory and they moved towards the spring the men following stealthily and closely the gourd was filled and the old woman was hurrying back her hand still grasping the wrist of the girl when she was suddenly seized so violently by the throat as to cause her to release her captive and to prevent her making any other sound than a sort of gurgling suffocating noise the serpent passed his arm round the waist of his mistress and dashed through the bushes with her on the north side of the point here he immediately turned along the beach and ran towards the canoe a more direct course could have been taken but it might have led to a discovery of the place of embarking  deerslayer kept playing on the throat of the old woman like the keys of an organ occasionally allowing her to breathe and then compressing his fingers again nearly to strangling the brief intervals for breath however were well improved and the hag succeeded in letting out a screech or two that served to alarm the camp the tramp of the warriors as they sprang from the fire was plainly audible and at the next moment three or four of them appeared on the top of the ridge drawn against the background of light resembling the dim shadows of the phantasmagoria it was now quite time for the hunter to retreat tripping up the heels of his captive and giving her throat a parting squeeze quite as much in resentment at her indomitable efforts to sound the alarm as from any policy he left her on her back and moved towards the bushes his rifle at a poise and his head over his shoulders like a lion at bay    chapter xvii      there ye wise saints behold your light your star     ye would be dupes and victims and ye are     is it enough  or must i while a thrill     lives in your sapient bosoms cheat you still      thomas moore lalla rookh the veiled prophet of khorassan  the fire the canoe and the spring near which deerslayer commenced his retreat would have stood in the angles of a triangle of tolerably equal sides the distance from the fire to the boat was a little less than the distance from the fire to the spring while the distance from the spring to the boat was about equal to that between the two points first named this however was in straight lines a means of escape to which the fugitives could not resort they were obliged to have recourse to a detour in order to get the cover of the bushes and to follow the curvature of the beach under these disadvantages then the hunter commenced his retreat disadvantages that he felt to be so much the greater from his knowledge of the habits of all indians who rarely fail in cases of sudden alarms more especially when in the midst of cover immediately to throw out flankers with a view to meet their foes at all points and if possible to turn their rear that some such course was now adopted he believed from the tramp of feet which not only came up the ascent as related but were also heard under the first impulse diverging not only towards the hill in the rear but towards the extremity of the point in a direction opposite to that he was about to take himself promptitude consequently became a matter of the last importance as the parties might meet on the strand before the fugitive could reach the canoe  notwithstanding the pressing nature of the emergency deerslayer hesitated a single instant ere he plunged into the bushes that lined the shore his feelings had been awakened by the whole scene and a sternness of purpose had come over him to which he was ordinarily a stranger four dark figures loomed on the ridge drawn against the brightness of the fire and an enemy might have been sacrificed at a glance the indians had paused to gaze into the gloom in search of the screeching hag and with many a man less given to reflection than the hunter the death of one of them would have been certain luckily he was more prudent although the rifle dropped a little towards the foremost of his pursuers he did not aim or fire but disappeared in the cover to gain the beach and to follow it round to the place where chingachgook was already in the canoe with hist anxiously waiting his appearance occupied but a moment laying his rifle in the bottom of the canoe deerslayer stooped to give the latter a vigorous shove from the shore when a powerful indian leaped through the bushes alighting like a panther on his back everything was now suspended by a hair a false step ruining all with a generosity that would have rendered a roman illustrious throughout all time but which in the career of one so simple and humble would have been forever lost to the world but for this unpretending legend deerslayer threw all his force into a desperate effort shoved the canoe off with a power that sent it a hundred feet from the shore as it might be in an instant and fell forward into the lake himself face downward his assailant necessarily following him  although the water was deep within a few yards of the beach it was not more than breast high as close in as the spot where the two combatants fell still this was quite sufficient to destroy one who had sunk under the great disadvantages in which deerslayer was placed his hands were free however and the savage was compelled to relinquish his hug to keep his own face above the surface for half a minute there was a desperate struggle like the floundering of an alligator that has just seized some powerful prey and then both stood erect grasping each others arms in order to prevent the use of the deadly knife in the darkness what might have been the issue of this severe personal struggle cannot be known for half a dozen savages came leaping into the water to the aid of their friend and deerslayer yielded himself a prisoner with a dignity that was as remarkable as his selfdevotion  to quit the lake and lead their new captive to the fire occupied the indians but another minute so much engaged were they all with the struggle and its consequences that the canoe was unseen though it still lay so near the shore as to render every syllable that was uttered perfectly intelligible to the delaware and his betrothed and the whole party left the spot some continuing the pursuit after hist along the beach though most proceeded to the light here deerslayers antagonist so far recovered his breath and his recollection for he had been throttled nearly to strangulation as to relate the manner in which the girl had got off it was now too late to assail the other fugitives for no sooner was his friend led into the bushes than the delaware placed his paddle into the water and the light canoe glided noiselessly away holding its course towards the centre of the lake until safe from shot after which it sought the ark when deerslayer reached the fire he found himself surrounded by no less than eight grim savages among whom was his old acquaintance rivenoak as soon as the latter caught a glimpse of the captives countenance he spoke apart to his companions and a low but general exclamation of pleasure and surprise escaped them they knew that the conqueror of their late friend he who had fallen on the opposite side of the lake was in their hands and subject to their mercy or vengeance there was no little admiration mingled in the ferocious looks that were thrown on the prisoner an admiration that was as much excited by his present composure as by his past deeds this scene may be said to have been the commencement of the great and terrible reputation that deerslayer or hawkeye as he was afterwards called enjoyed among all the tribes of new york and canada a reputation that was certainly more limited in its territorial and numerical extent than those which are possessed in civilized life but which was compensated for what it wanted in these particulars perhaps by its greater justice and the total absence of mystification and management  the arms of deerslayer were not pinioned and he was left the free use of his hands his knife having been first removed the only precaution that was taken to secure his person was untiring watchfulness and a strong rope of bark that passed from ankle to ankle not so much to prevent his walking as to place an obstacle in the way of his attempting to escape by any sudden leap even this extra provision against flight was not made until the captive had been brought to the light and his character ascertained it was in fact a compliment to his prowess and he felt proud of the distinction that he might be bound when the warriors slept he thought probable but to be bound in the moment of capture showed that he was already and thus early attaining a name while the young indians were fastening the rope he wondered if chingachgook would have been treated in the same manner had he too fallen into the hands of the enemy nor did the reputation of the young paleface rest altogether on his success in the previous combat or in his discriminating and cool manner of managing the late negotiation for it had received a great accession by the occurrences of the night ignorant of the movements of the ark and of the accident that had brought their fire into view the iroquois attributed the discovery of their new camp to the vigilance of so shrewd a foe the manner in which he ventured upon the point the abstraction or escape of hist and most of all the selfdevotion of the prisoner united to the readiness with which he had sent the canoe adrift were so many important links in the chain of facts on which his growing fame was founded many of these circumstances had been seen some had been explained and all were understood  while this admiration and these honors were so unreservedly bestowed on deerslayer he did not escape some of the penalties of his situation he was permitted to seat himself on the end of a log near the fire in order to dry his clothes his late adversary standing opposite now holding articles of his own scanty vestments to the heat and now feeling his throat on which the marks of his enemys fingers were still quite visible the rest of the warriors consulted together near at hand all those who had been out having returned to report that no signs of any other prowlers near the camp were to be found in this state of things the old woman whose name was shebear in plain english approached deerslayer with her fists clenched and her eyes flashing fire hitherto she had been occupied with screaming an employment at which she had played her part with no small degree of success but having succeeded in effectually alarming all within reach of a pair of lungs that had been strengthened by long practice she next turned her attention to the injuries her own person had sustained in the struggle these were in no manner material though they were of a nature to arouse all the fury of a woman who had long ceased to attract by means of the gentler qualities and who was much disposed to revenge the hardships she had so long endured as the neglected wife and mother of savages on all who came within her power if deerslayer had not permanently injured her he had temporarily caused her to suffer and she was not a person to overlook a wrong of this nature on account of its motive  skunk of the palefaces commenced this exasperated and semipoetic fury shaking her fist under the nose of the impassable hunter you are not even a woman your friends the delawares are only women and you are their sheep your own people will not own you and no tribe of redmen would have you in their wigwams you skulk among petticoated warriors you slay our brave friend who has left usnohis great soul scorned to fight you and left his body rather than have the shame of slaying you but the blood that you spilt when the spirit was not looking on has not sunk into the ground it must be buried in your groans what music do i hear those are not the wailings of a red manno red warrior groans so much like a hog they come from a paleface throata yengeese bosom and sound as pleasant as girls singingdogskunkwoodchuckminkhedgehogpigtoadspideryengee  here the old woman having expended her breath and exhausted her epithets was fain to pause a moment though both her fists were shaken in the prisoners face and the whole of her wrinkled countenance was filled with fierce resentment deerslayer looked upon these impotent attempts to arouse him as indifferently as a gentleman in our own state of society regards the vituperative terms of a blackguard the one party feeling that the tongue of an old woman could never injure a warrior and the other knowing that mendacity and vulgarity can only permanently affect those who resort to their use but he was spared any further attack at present by the interposition of rivenoak who shoved aside the hag bidding her quit the spot and prepared to take his seat at the side of his prisoner the old woman withdrew but the hunter well understood that he was to be the subject of all her means of annoyance if not of positive injury so long as he remained in the power of his enemies for nothing rankles so deeply as the consciousness that an attempt to irritate has been met by contempt a feeling that is usually the most passive of any that is harbored in the human breast rivenoak quietly took the seat we have mentioned and after a short pause he commenced a dialogue which we translate as usual for the benefit of those readers who have not studied the north american languages  my paleface friend is very welcome said the indian with a familiar nod and a smile so covert that it required all deerslayers vigilance to detect and not a little of his philosophy to detect unmoved he is welcome the hurons keep a hot fire to dry the white mans clothes by  i thank you huronor mingo as i most like to call you returned the other i thank you for the welcome and i thank you for the fire each is good in its way and the last is very good when one has been in a spring as cold as the glimmerglass even huron warmth may be pleasant at such a time to a man with a delaware heart  the palefacebut my brother has a name so great a warrior would not have lived without a name  mingo said the hunter a little of the weakness of human nature exhibiting itself in the glance of his eye and the colour on his cheekmingo your brave called me hawkeye i suppose on account of a quick and sartain aim when he was lying with his head in my lap afore his spirit started for the happy hunting grounds  tis a good name the hawk is sure of his blow hawkeye is not a woman why does he live with the delawares  i understand you mingo but we look on all that as a sarcumvention of some of your subtle devils and deny the charge providence placed me among the delawares young and bating what christian usages demand of my colour and gifts i hope to live and die in their tribe still i do not mean to throw away altogether my natyve rights and shall strive to do a palefaces duty in redskin society  good a huron is a redskin as well as a delaware hawkeye is more of a huron than of a woman  i suppose you know mingo your own meaning if you dont i make no question tis well known to satan but if you wish to get any thing out of me speak plainer for bargains can not be made blindfolded or tongue tied  good hawkeye has not a forked tongue and he likes to say what he thinks he is an acquaintance of the muskrat this was the name by which all the indians designated hutterand has lived in his wigwam but he is not a friend he wants no scalps like a miserable indian but fights like a stouthearted paleface the muskrat is neither white nor red neither a beast nor a fish he is a water snake sometimes in the spring and sometimes on the land he looks for scalps like an outcast hawkeye can go back and tell him how he has outwitted the hurons how he has escaped and when his eyes are in a fog when he cant see as far as from his cabin to the shore then hawkeye can open the door for the hurons and how will the plunder be divided why hawkeye will carry away the most and the hurons will take what he may choose to leave behind him the scalps can go to canada for a paleface has no satisfaction in them  well well rivenoakfor so i hear em tarm youthis is plain english enough though spoken in iroquois i understand all you mean now and must say it outdevils even mingo deviltry no doubt twould be easy enough to go back and tell the muskrat that i had got away from you and gain some credit too by the explite  good that is what i want the paleface to do  yesyesthats plain enough i know what you want me to do without more words when inside the house and eating the muskrats bread and laughing and talking with his pretty darters i might put his eyes into so thick a fog that he couldnt even see the door much less the land  good hawkeye should have been born a huron his blood is not more than half white  there youre out huron yes there youre as much out as if you mistook a wolf for a catamount im white in blood heart natur and gifts though a little redskin in feelins and habits but when old hutters eyes are well befogged and his pretty darters perhaps in a deep sleep and hurry harry the great pine as you indians tarm him is dreaming of any thing but mischief and all suppose hawkeye is acting as a faithful sentinel all i have to do is set a torch somewhere in sight for a signal open the door and let in the hurons to knock em all on the head  surely my brother is mistaken he cannot be white he is worthy to be a great chief among the hurons  that is true enough i dares to say if he could do all this now harkee huron and for once hear a few honest words from the mouth of a plain man i am christian born and them that come of such a stock and that listen to the words that were spoken to their fathers and will be spoken to their children until arth and all it holds perishes can never lend themselves to such wickedness sarcumventions in war may be and are lawful but sarcumventions and deceit and treachery among friinds are fit only for the paleface devils i know that there are white men enough to give you this wrong idee of our natur but such be ontrue to their blood and gifts and ought to be if they are not outcasts and vagabonds no upright paleface could do what you wish and to be as plain with you as i wish to be in my judgment no upright delaware either with a mingo it may be different  the huron listened to this rebuke with obvious disgust but he had his ends in view and was too wily to lose all chance of effecting them by a precipitate avowal of resentment affecting to smile he seemed to listen eagerly and he then pondered on what he had heard  does hawkeye love the muskrat he abruptly demanded or does he love his daughters  neither mingo old tom is not a man to gain my love and as for the darters they are comely enough to gain the liking of any young man but theres reason agin any very great love for either hetty is a good soul but natur has laid a heavy hand on her mind poor thing  and the wild rose exclaimed the huronfor the fame of judiths beauty had spread among those who could travel the wilderness as well as the highway by means of old eagles nests rocks and riven trees known to them by report and tradition as well as among the white borderers and the wild rose is she not sweet enough to be put in the bosom of my brother  deerslayer had far too much of the innate gentleman to insinuate aught against the fair fame of one who by nature and position was so helpless and as he did not choose to utter an untruth he preferred being silent the huron mistook the motive and supposed that disappointed affection lay at the bottom of his reserve still bent on corrupting or bribing his captive in order to obtain possession of the treasures with which his imagination filled the castle he persevered in his attack  hawkeye is talking with a friend he continued he knows that rivenoak is a man of his word for they have traded together and trade opens the soul my friend has come here on account of a little string held by a girl that can pull the whole body of the sternest warrior  you are nearer the truth now huron than youve been afore since we began to talk this is true but one end of that string was not fast to my heart nor did the wild rose hold the other  this is wonderful does my brother love in his head and not in his heart and can the feeble mind pull so hard against so stout a warrior  there it is agin sometimes right and sometimes wrong the string you mean is fast to the heart of a great delaware one of mohican stock in fact living among the delawares since the disparsion of his own people and of the family of uncaschingachgook by name or great sarpent he has come here led by the string and ive followed or rather come afore for i got here first pulled by nothing stronger than frindship which is strong enough for such as are not niggardly of their feelins and are willing to live a little for their fellow creaturs as well as for themselves  but a string has two endsone is fast to the mind of a mohican and the other  why the other was here close to the fire half an hour since wahtawah held it in her hand if she didnt hold it to her heart  i understand what you mean my brother returned the indian gravely for the first time catching a direct clue to the adventures of the evening the great serpent being strongest pulled the hardest and hist was forced to leave us  i dont think there was much pulling about it answered the other laughing always in his silent manner with as much heartiness as if he were not a captive and in danger of torture or deathi dont think there was much pulling about it no i dont lord help you huron he likes the gal and the gal likes him and it surpassed huron sarcumventions to keep two young people apart where there was so strong a feelin to bring em together  and hawkeye and chingachgook came into our camp on this errand only  thats a question thatll answer itself mingo yes if a question could talk it would answer itself to your parfect satisfaction for what else should we come and yet it isnt exactly so neither for we didnt come into your camp at all but only as far as that pine there that you see on the other side of the ridge where we stood watching your movements and conduct as long as we liked when we were ready the sarpent gave his signal and then all went just as it should down to the moment when yonder vagabond leaped upon my back sartain we come for that and for no other purpose and we got what we come for theres no use in pretending otherwise hist is off with a man whos the next thing to her husband and come what will to me thats one good thing detarmined  what sign or signal told the young maiden that her lover was nigh asked the huron with more curiosity than it was usual for him to betray  deerslayer laughed again and seemd to enjoy the success of the exploit with as much glee as if he had not been its victim  your squirrels are great gadabouts mingo he cried still laughingyes theyre sartainly great gadabouts when other folks squirrels are at home and asleep yourn keep in motion among the trees and chirrup and sing in a way that even a delaware gal can understand their musick well theres four legged squirrels and theres two legged squirrels and give me the last when theres a good tight string atween two hearts if one brings em together tother tells when to pull hardest  the huron looked vexed though he succeeded in suppressing any violent exhibition of resentment he now quitted his prisoner and joining the rest of the warriors he communicated the substance of what he had learned as in his own case admiration was mingled with anger at the boldness and success of their enemies three or four of them ascended the little acclivity and gazed at the tree where it was understood the adventurers had posted themselves and one even descended to it and examined for foot prints around its roots in order to make sure that the statement was true the result confirmed the story of the captive and they all returned to the fire with increased wonder and respect the messenger who had arrived with some communication from the party above while the two adventurers were watching the camp was now despatched with some answer and doubtless bore with him the intelligence of all that had happened  down to this moment the young indian who had been seen walking in company with hist and another female had made no advances to any communication with deerslayer he had held himself aloof from his friends even passing near the bevy of younger women who were clustering together apart as usual and conversed in low tones on the subject of the escape of their late companion perhaps it would be true to say that these last were pleased as well as vexed at what had just occurred their female sympathies were with the lovers while their pride was bound up in the success of their own tribe it is possible too that the superior personal advantages of hist rendered her dangerous to some of the younger part of the group and they were not sorry to find she was no longer in the way of their own ascendency on the whole however the better feeling was most prevalent for neither the wild condition in which they lived the clannish prejudices of tribes nor their hard fortunes as indian women could entirely conquer the inextinguishable leaning of their sex to the affections one of the girls even laughed at the disconsolate look of the swain who might fancy himself deserted a circumstance that seemed suddenly to arouse his energies and induce him to move towards the log on which the prisoner was still seated drying his clothes  this is catamount said the indian striking his hand boastfully on his naked breast as he uttered the words in a manner to show how much weight he expected them to carry  this is hawkeye quietly returned deerslayer adopting the name by which he knew he would be known in future among all the tribes of the iroquois my sight is keen is my brothers leap long  from here to the delaware villages hawkeye has stolen my wife he must bring her back or his scalp will hang on a pole and dry in my wigwam  hawkeye has stolen nothing huron he doesnt come of a thieving breed nor has he thieving gifts your wife as you call wahtawah will never be the wife of any redskin of the canadas her mind is in the cabin of a delaware and her body has gone to find it the catamount is actyve i know but its legs cant keep pace with a womans wishes  the serpent of the delawares is a doghe is a poor bull trout that keeps in the water he is afraid to stand on the hard earth like a brave indian  well well huron thats pretty impudent considering its not an hour since the sarpent stood within a hundred feet of you and would have tried the toughness of your skin with a rifle bullet when i pointed you out to him hadnt i laid the weight of a little judgment on his hand you may take in timorsome gals in the settlements with your catamount whine but the ears of a man can tell truth from ontruth  hist laughs at him she sees he is lame and a poor hunter and he has never been on a war path she will take a man for a husband and not a fish  how do you know that catamount how do you know that returned deerslayer laughing she has gone into the lake you see and maybe she prefars a trout to a mongrel cat as for war paths neither the sarpent nor i have much experence we are ready to own but if you dont call this one you must tarm it what the gals in the settlements tarm it the high road to matrimony take my advice catamount and sarch for a wife among the huron women youll never get one with a willing mind from among the delawares  catamounts hand felt for his tomahawk and when the fingers reached the handle they worked convulsively as if their owner hesitated between policy and resentment at this critical moment rivenoak approached and by a gesture of authority induced the young man to retire assuming his former position himself on the log at the side of deerslayer here he continued silent for a little time maintaining the grave reserve of an indian chief  hawkeye is right the iroquois at length began his sight is so strong that he can see truth in a dark night and our eyes have been blinded he is an owl darkness hiding nothing from him he ought not to strike his friends he is right  im glad you think so mingo returned the other for a traitor in my judgment is worse than a coward i care as little for the muskrat as one paleface ought to care for another but i care too much for him to ambush him in the way you wished in short according to my idees any sarcumventions except openwar sarcumventions are agin both law and what we whites call gospel too  my paleface brother is right he is no indian to forget his manitou and his colour the hurons know that they have a great warrior for their prisoner and they will treat him as one if he is to be tortured his torments shall be such as no common man can bear if he is to be treated as a friend it will be the friendship of chiefs  as the huron uttered this extraordinary assurance of consideration his eye furtively glanced at the countenance of his listener in order to discover how he stood the compliment though his gravity and apparent sincerity would have prevented any man but one practised in artifices from detecting his motives deerslayer belonged to the class of the unsuspicious and acquainted with the indian notions of what constitutes respect in matters connected with the treatment of captives he felt his blood chill at the announcement even while he maintained an aspect so steeled that his quick sighted enemy could discover in it no signs of weakness  god has put me in your hands huron the captive at length answered and i suppose you will act your will on me i shall not boast of what i can do under torment for ive never been tried and no man can say till he has been but ill do my endivours not to disgrace the people among whom i got my training howsever i wish you now to bear witness that im altogether of white blood and in a natral way of white gifts too so should i be overcome and forget myself i hope youll lay the fault where it properly belongs and in no manner put it on the delawares or their allies and friends the mohicans were all created with more or less weakness and im afeard its a palefaces to give in under great bodily torment when a redskin will sing his songs and boast of his deeds in the very teeth of his foes  we shall see hawkeye has a good countenance and he is toughbut why should he be tormented when the hurons love him he is not born their enemy and the death of one warrior will not cast a cloud between them forever  so much the better huron so much the better still i dont wish to owe any thing to a mistake about each others meaning it is so much the better that you bear no malice for the loss of a warrior who fell in war and yet it is ontrue that there is no inmitylawful inmity i meanatween us so far as i have redskin feelins at all ive delaware feelins and i leave you to judge for yourself how far they are likely to be frindly to the mingos  deerslayer ceased for a sort of spectre stood before him that put a stop to his words and indeed caused him for a moment to doubt the fidelity of his boasted vision hetty hutter was standing at the side of the fire as quietly as if she belonged to the tribe  as the hunter and the indian sat watching the emotions that were betrayed in each others countenance the girl had approached unnoticed doubtless ascending from the beach on the southern side of the point or that next to the spot where the ark had anchored and had advanced to the fire with the fearlessness that belonged to her simplicity and which was certainly justified by the treatment formerly received from the indians as soon as rivenoak perceived the girl she was recognised and calling to two or three of the younger warriors the chief sent them out to reconnoitre lest her appearance should be the forerunner of another attack he then motioned to hetty to draw near  i hope your visit is a sign that the sarpent and hist are in safety hetty said deerslayer as soon as the girl had complied with the hurons request i dont think youd come ashore agin on the arrnd that brought you here afore  judith told me to come this time deerslayer hetty replied she paddled me ashore herself in a canoe as soon as the serpent had shown her hist and told his story how handsome hist is tonight deerslayer and how much happier she looks than when she was with the hurons  thats natur gal yes that may be set down as human natur shes with her betrothed and no longer fears a mingo husband in my judgment judith herself would lose most of her beauty if she thought she was to bestow it all on a mingo content is a great fortifier of good looks and ill warrant you hist is contented enough now she is out of the hands of these miscreants and with her chosen warrior did you say that judith told you to come ashorewhy should your sister do that  she bid me come to see you and to try and persuade the savages to take more elephants to let you off but ive brought the bible with methat will do more than all the elephants in fathers chest  and your father good little hettyand hurry did they know of your arrnd  not they both are asleep and judith and the serpent thought it best they should not be woke lest they might want to come again after scalps when hist had told them how few warriors and how many women and children there were in the camp judith would give me no peace till i had come ashore to see what had happened to you  well thats remarkable as consarns judith whey should she feel so much unsartainty about meahi see how it is now yes i see into the whole matter now you must understand hetty that your sister is oneasy lest harry march should wake and come blundering here into the hands of the inimy agin under some idee that being a travelling comrade he ought to help me in this matter hurry is a blunderer i will allow but i dont think hed risk as much for my sake as he would for his own  judith dont care for hurry though hurry cares for her replied hetty innocently but quite positively  ive heard you say as much as that afore yes ive heard that from you afore gal and yet it isnt true one dont live in a tribe not to see something of the way in which liking works in a womans heart though no way given to marrying myself ive been a looker on among the delawares and this is a matter in which paleface and redskin gifts are all as one as the same when the feelin begins the young woman is thoughtful and has no eyes or ears onless for the warrior that has taken her fancy then follows melancholy and sighing and such sort of actions after which especially if matters dont come to plain discourse she often flies round to back biting and fault finding blaming the youth for the very things she likes best in him some young creaturs are forward in this way of showing their love and im of opinion judith is one of em now ive heard her as much as deny that hurry was goodlooking and the young woman who could do that must be far gone indeed  the young woman who liked hurry would own that he is handsome i think hurry very handsome deerslayer and im sure everybody must think so that has eyes judith dont like harry march and thats the reason she finds fault with him  wellwellmy good little hetty have it your own way if we should talk from now till winter each would think as at present and theres no use in words i must believe that judith is much wrapped up in hurry and that sooner or later shell have him and this too all the more from the manner in which she abuses him and i dare to say you think just the contrary but mind what i now tell you gal and pretend not to know it continued this being who was so obtuse on a point on which men are usually quick enough to make discoveries and so acute in matters that would baffle the observation of much the greater portion of mankind i see how it is with them vagabonds rivenoak has left us you see and is talking yonder with his young men and though too far to be heard i can see what he is telling them their orders is to watch your movements and to find where the canoe is to meet you to take you back to the ark and then to seize all and what they can im sorry judith sent you for i suppose she wants you to go back agin  all thats settled deerslayer returned the girl in a low confidential and meaning manner and you may trust me to outwit the best indian of them all i know i am feeble minded but ive got some sense and youll see how ill use it in getting back when my errand is done  ahs me poor girl im afeard all thats easier said than done theyre a venomous set of riptyles and their pisons none the milder for the loss of hist well im glad the sarpent was the one to get off with the gal for now therell be two happy at least whereas had he fallen into the hands of the mingos thered been two miserable and another far from feelin as a man likes to feel  now you put me in mind of a part of my errand that i had almost forgotten deerslayer judith told me to ask you what you thought the hurons would do with you if you couldnt be bought off and what she had best do to serve you yes this was the most important part of the errandwhat she had best do in order to serve you  thats as you think hetty but its no matter young women are apt to lay most stress on what most touches their feelins but no matter have it your own way so you be but careful not to let the vagabonds get the mastery of a canoe when you get back to the ark tell em to keep close and to keep moving too most especially at night many hours cant go by without the troops on the river hearing of this party and then your frinds may look for relief tis but a days march from the nearest garrison and true soldiers will never lie idle with the foe in their neighborhood this is my advice and you may say to your father and hurry that scalphunting will be a poor business now as the mingos are up and awake and nothing can save em till the troops come except keeping a good belt of water atween em and the savages  what shall i tell judith about you deerslayer i know she will send me back again if i dont bring her the truth about you  then tell her the truth i see no reason judith hutter shouldnt hear the truth about me as well as a lie im a captyve in indian hands and providence only knows what will come of it harkee hetty dropping his voice and speaking still more confidentially you are a little weak minded it must be allowed but you know something of injins here i am in their hands after having slain one of their stoutest warriors and theyve been endivouring to work upon me through fear of consequences to betray your father and all in the ark i understand the blackguards as well as if theyd told it all out plainly with their tongues they hold up avarice afore me on one side and fear on tother and think honesty will give way atween em both but let your father and hurry know tis all useless as for the sarpent he knows it already  but what shall i tell judith she will certainly send me back if i dont satisfy her mind  well tell judith the same no doubt the savages will try the torments to make me give in and to revenge the loss of their warrior but i must hold out agin natral weakness in the best manner i can you may tell judith to feel no consarn on my accountit will come hard i know seeing that a white mans gifts dont run to boasting and singing under torment for he generally feels smallest when he suffers mostbut you may tell her not to have any consarn i think i shall make out to stand it and she may rely on this let me give in as much as i may and prove completely that i am white by wailings and howlings and even tears yet ill never fall so far as to betray my frinds when it gets to burning holes in the flesh with heated ramrods and to hacking the body and tearing the hair out by the roots natur may get the upperhand so far as groans and complaints are consarned but there the triumph of the vagabonds will ind nothing short of gods abandoning him to the devils can make an honest man ontrue to his colour and duty  hetty listened with great attention and her mild but speaking countenance manifested a strong sympathy in the anticipated agony of the supposititious sufferer at first she seemed at a loss how to act then taking a hand of deerslayers she affectionately recommended to him to borrow her bible and to read it while the savages were inflicting their torments when the other honestly admitted that it exceeded his power to read she even volunteered to remain with him and to perform this holy office in person the offer was gently declined and rivenoak being about to join them deerslayer requested the girl to leave him first enjoining her again to tell those in the ark to have full confidence in his fidelity hetty now walked away and approached the group of females with as much confidence and selfpossession as if she were a native of the tribe on the other hand the huron resumed his seat by the side of his prisoner the one continuing to ask questions with all the wily ingenuity of a practised indian counsellor and the other baffling him by the very means that are known to be the most efficacious in defeating the finesse of the more pretending diplomacy of civilization or by confining his answers to the truth and the truth only    chapter xviii       thus died she never more on her     shall sorrow light or shame she was not made     through years or moons the inner weight to bear     which colder hearts endure till they are laid     by age in earth her days and pleasure were     brief but delightfulsuch as had not stayed     long with her destiny but she sleeps well     by the seashore whereon she loved to dwell      byron  don juan iv lxxi  the young men who had been sent out to reconnoitre on the sudden appearance of hetty soon returned to report their want of success in making any discovery one of them had even been along the beach as far as the spot opposite to the ark but the darkness had completely concealed that vessel from his notice others had examined in different directions and everywhere the stillness of night was added to the silence and solitude of the woods  it was consequently believed that the girl had come alone as on her former visit and on some similar errand the iroquois were ignorant that the ark had left the castle and there were movements projected if not in the course of actual execution by this time which also greatly added to the sense of security a watch was set therefore and all but the sentinels disposed themselves to sleep sufficient care was had to the safe keeping of the captive without inflicting on him any unnecessary suffering and as for hetty she was permitted to find a place among the indian girls in the best manner she could she did not find the friendly offices of hist though her character not only bestowed impunity from pain and captivity but it procured for her a consideration and an attention that placed her on the score of comfort quite on a level with the wild but gentle beings around her she was supplied with a skin and made her own bed on a pile of boughs a little apart from the huts here she was soon in a profound sleep like all around her  there were now thirteen men in the party and three kept watch at a time one remained in shadow not far from the fire however his duty was to guard the captive to take care that the fire neither blazed up so as to illuminate the spot nor yet became wholly extinguished and to keep an eye generally on the state of the camp another passed from one beach to the other crossing the base of the point while the third kept moving slowly around the strand on its outer extremity to prevent a repetition of the surprise that had already taken place that night this arrangement was far from being usual among savages who ordinarily rely more on the secrecy of their movements than on vigilance of this nature but it had been called for by the peculiarity of the circumstances in which the hurons were now placed their position was known to their foes and it could not easily be changed at an hour which demanded rest perhaps too they placed most of their confidence on the knowledge of what they believed to be passing higher up the lake and which it was thought would fully occupy the whole of the palefaces who were at liberty with their solitary indian ally it was also probable rivenoak was aware that in holding his captive he had in his own hands the most dangerous of all his enemies  the precision with which those accustomed to watchfulness or lives of disturbed rest sleep is not the least of the phenomena of our mysterious being the head is no sooner on the pillow than consciousness is lost and yet at a necessary hour the mind appears to arouse the body as promptly as if it had stood sentinel the while over it there can be no doubt that they who are thus roused awake by the influence of thought over matter though the mode in which this influence is exercised must remain hidden from our curiosity until it shall be explained should that hour ever arrive by the entire enlightenment of the soul on the subject of all human mysteries thus it was with hetty hutter feeble as the immaterial portion of her existence was thought to be it was sufficiently active to cause her to open her eyes at midnight at that hour she awoke and leaving her bed of skin and boughs she walked innocently and openly to the embers of the fire stirring the latter as the coolness of the night and the woods in connection with an exceedingly unsophisticated bed had a little chilled her as the flame shot up it lighted the swarthy countenance of the huron on watch whose dark eyes glistened under its light like the balls of the panther that is pursued to his den with burning brands but hetty felt no fear and she approached the spot where the indian stood her movements were so natural and so perfectly devoid of any of the stealthiness of cunning or deception that he imagined she had merely arisen on account of the coolness of the night a common occurrence in a bivouac and the one of all others perhaps the least likely to excite suspicion hetty spoke to him but he understood no english she then gazed near a minute at the sleeping captive and moved slowly away in a sad and melancholy manner the girl took no pains to conceal her movements any ingenious expedient of this nature quite likely exceeded her powers still her step was habitually light and scarcely audible as she took the direction of the extremity of the point or the place where she had landed in the first adventure and where hist had embarked the sentinel saw her light form gradually disappear in the gloom without uneasiness or changing his own position he knew that others were on the lookout and he did not believe that one who had twice come into the camp voluntarily and had already left it openly would take refuge in flight in short the conduct of the girl excited no more attention that that of any person of feeble intellect would excite in civilized society while her person met with more consideration and respect  hetty certainly had no very distinct notions of the localities but she found her way to the beach which she reached on the same side of the point as that on which the camp had been made by following the margin of the water taking a northern direction she soon encountered the indian who paced the strand as sentinel this was a young warrior and when he heard her light tread coming along the gravel he approached swiftly though with anything but menace in his manner the darkness was so intense that it was not easy to discover forms within the shadows of the woods at the distance of twenty feet and quite impossible to distinguish persons until near enough to touch them the young huron manifested disappointment when he found whom he had met for truth to say he was expecting his favourite who had promised to relieve the ennui of a midnight watch with her presence this man was also ignorant of english but he was at no loss to understand why the girl should be up at that hour such things were usual in an indian village and camp where sleep is as irregular as the meals then poor hettys known imbecility as in most things connected with the savages stood her friend on this occasion vexed at his disappointment and impatient of the presence of one he thought an intruder the young warrior signed for the girl to move forward holding the direction of the beach hetty complied but as she walked away she spoke aloud in english in her usual soft tones which the stillness of the night made audible at some little distance  if you took me for a huron girl warrior she said i dont wonder you are so little pleased i am hetty hutter thomas hutters daughter and have never met any man at night for mother always said it was wrong and modest young women should never do it modest young women of the palefaces i mean for customs are different in different parts of the world i know no no im hetty hutter and wouldnt meet even hurry harry though he should fall down on his knees and ask me mother said it was wrong  by the time hetty had said this she reached the place where the canoes had come ashore and owing to the curvature of the land and the bushes would have been completely hid from the sight of the sentinel had it been broad day but another footstep had caught the lovers ear and he was already nearly beyond the sound of the girls silvery voice still hetty bent only on her own thoughts and purposes continued to speak though the gentleness of her tones prevented the sounds from penetrating far into the woods on the water they were more widely diffused  here i am judith she added and there is no one near me the huron on watch has gone to meet his sweetheart who is an indian girl you know and never had a christian mother to tell her how wrong it is to meet a man at night  hettys voice was hushed by a hist that came from the water and then she caught a dim view of the canoe which approached noiselessly and soon grated on the shingle with its bow the moment the weight of hetty was felt in the light craft the canoe withdrew stern foremost as if possessed of life and volition until it was a hundred yards from the shore then it turned and making a wide sweep as much to prolong the passage as to get beyond the sound of voices it held its way towards the ark for several minutes nothing was uttered but believing herself to be in a favourable position to confer with her sister judith who alone sat in the stern managing the canoe with a skill little short of that of a man began a discourse which she had been burning to commence ever since they had quitted the point  here we are safe hetty she said and may talk without the fear of being overheard you must speak low however for sounds are heard far on the water in a still night i was so close to the point some of the time while you were on it that i have heard the voices of the warriors and i heard your shoes on the gravel of the beach even before you spoke  i dont believe judith the hurons know i have left them  quite likely they do not for a lover makes a poor sentry unless it be to watch for his sweetheart but tell me hetty did you see and speak with deerslayer  oh yesthere he was seated near the fire with his legs tied though they left his arms free to move them as he pleased  well what did he tell you child speak quick i am dying to know what message he sent me  what did he tell me why what do you think judith he told me that he couldnt read only think of that a white man and not know how to read his bible even he never could have had a mother sister  never mind that hetty all men cant read though mother knew so much and taught us so much father knows very little about books and he can barely read the bible you know  oh i never thought fathers could read much but mothers ought all to read else how can they teach their children depend on it judith deerslayer could never have had a mother else he would know how to read  did you tell him i sent you ashore hetty and how much concern i feel for his misfortune asked the other impatiently  i believe i did judith but you know i am feebleminded and i may have forgotten i did tell him you brought me ashore and he told me a great deal that i was to say to you which i remember well for it made my blood run cold to hear him he told me to say that his friendsi suppose you are one of them sister  how can you torment me thus hetty certainly i am one of the truest friends he has on earth  torment you yes now i remember all about it i am glad you used that word judith for it brings it all back to my mind well he said he might be tormented by the savages but he would try to bear it as becomes a christian white man and that no one need be afeardwhy does deerslayer call it afeard when mother always taught us to say afraid  never mind dear hetty never mind that now cried the other almost gasping for breath did deerslayer really tell you that he thought the savages would put him to the torture recollect now well hetty for this is a most awful and serious thing  yes he did and i remember it by your speaking about my tormenting you oh i felt very sorry for him and deerslayer took all so quietly and without noise deerslayer is not as handsome as hurry harry judith but he is more quiet  hes worth a million hurrys yes hes worth all the young men who ever came upon the lake put together said judith with an energy and positiveness that caused her sister to wonder he is true there is no lie about deerslayer you hetty may not know what a merit it is in a man to have truth but when you getnoi hope you will never know it why should one like you be ever made to learn the hard lesson to distrust and hate  judith bowed her face dark as it was and unseen as she must have been by any eye but that of omniscience between her hands and groaned this sudden paroxysm of feeling however lasted but for a moment and she continued more calmly still speaking frankly to her sister whose intelligence and whose discretion in any thing that related to herself she did not in the least distrust her voice however was low and husky instead of having its former clearness and animation  it is a hard thing to fear truth hetty she said and yet do i more dread deerslayers truth than any enemy one cannot tamper with such truthso much honestysuch obstinate uprightness but we are not altogether unequal sisterdeerslayer and i he is not altogether my superior  it was not usual for judith so far to demean herself as to appeal to hettys judgment nor did she often address her by the title of sister a distinction that is commonly given by the junior to the senior even where there is perfect equality in all other respects as trifling departures from habitual deportment oftener strike the imagination than more important changes hetty perceived the circumstances and wondered at them in her own simple way her ambition was a little quickened and the answer was as much out of the usual course of things as the question the poor girl attempting to refine beyond her strength  superior judith she repeated with pride in what can deerslayer be your superior are you not mothers childand does he know how to readand wasnt mother before any woman in all this part of the world i should think so far from supposing himself your superior he would hardly believe himself mine you are handsome and he is ugly  no not ugly hetty interrupted judith only plain but his honest face has a look in it that is far better than beauty in my eyes deerslayer is handsomer than hurry harry  judith hutter you frighten me hurry is the handsomest mortal in the worldeven handsomer than you are yourself because a mans good looks you know are always better than a womans good looks  this little innocent touch of natural taste did not please the elder sister at the moment and she did not scruple to betray it hetty you now speak foolishly and had better say no more on this subject she answered hurry is not the handsomest mortal in the world by many and there are officers in the garrisons judith stammered at the wordsthere are officers in the garrisons near us far comelier than he but why do you think me the equal of deerslayerspeak of that for i do not like to hear you show so much admiration of a man like hurry harry who has neither feelings manners nor conscience you are too good for him and he ought to be told it at once  i judith how you forget why i am not beautiful and am feebleminded  you are good hetty and that is more than can be said of harry march he may have a face and a body but he has no heart but enough of this for the present tell me what raises me to an equality with deerslayer  to think of you asking me this judith he cant read and you can he dont know how to talk but speaks worse than hurry evenfor sister harry doesnt always pronounce his words right did you ever notice that  certainly he is as coarse in speech as in everything else but i fear you flatter me hetty when you think i can be justly called the equal of a man like deerslayer it is true i have been better taught in one sense am more comely and perhaps might look higher but then his truthhis truthmakes a fearful difference between us well i will talk no more of this and we will bethink us of the means of getting him out of the hands of the hurons we have fathers chest in the ark hetty and might try the temptation of more elephants though i fear such baubles will not buy the liberty of a man like deerslayer i am afraid father and hurry will not be as willing to ransom deerslayer as deerslayer was to ransom them  why not judith hurry and deerslayer are friends and friends should always help one another  alas poor hetty you little know mankind seeming friends are often more to be dreaded than open enemies particularly by females but youll have to land in the morning and try again what can be done for deerslayer tortured he shall not be while judith hutter lives and can find means to prevent it  the conversation now grew desultory and was drawn out until the elder sister had extracted from the younger every fact that the feeble faculties of the latter permitted her to retain and to communicate when judith was satisfiedthough she could never be said to be satisfied whose feelings seemed to be so interwoven with all that related to the subject as to have excited a nearly inappeasable curiositybut when judith could think of no more questions to ask without resorting to repetition the canoe was paddled towards the scow the intense darkness of the night and the deep shadows which the hills and forest cast upon the water rendered it difficult to find the vessel anchored as it had been as close to the shore as a regard to safety rendered prudent judith was expert in the management of a bark canoe the lightness of which demanded skill rather than strength and she forced her own little vessel swiftly over the water the moment she had ended her conference with hetty and had come to the determination to return still no ark was seen several times the sisters fancied they saw it looming up in the obscurity like a low black rock but on each occasion it was found to be either an optical illusion or some swell of the foliage on the shore after a search that lasted half an hour the girls were forced to the unwelcome conviction that the ark had departed most young women would have felt the awkwardness of their situation in a physical sense under the circumstances in which the sisters were left more than any apprehensions of a different nature not so with judith however and even hetty felt more concern about the motives that might have influenced her father and hurry than any fears for her own safety  it cannot be hetty said judith when a thorough search had satisfied them both that no ark was to be found it cannot be that the indians have rafted or swum off and surprised our friends as they slept  i dont believe that hist and chingachgook would sleep until they had told each other all they had to say after so long a separationdo you sister  perhaps not child there was much to keep them awake but one indian may have been surprised even when not asleep especially as his thoughts may have been on other things still we should have heard a noise for in a night like this an oath of hurry harrys would have echoed in the eastern hills like a clap of thunder  hurry is sinful and thoughtless about his words judith hetty meekly and sorrowfully answered  nono tis impossible the ark could be taken and i not hear the noise it is not an hour since i left it and the whole time i have been attentive to the smallest sound and yet it is not easy to believe a father would willingly abandon his children  perhaps father has thought us in our cabin asleep judith and has moved away to go home you know we often move the ark in the night  this is true hetty and it must be as you suppose there is a little more southern air than there was and they have gone up the lake judith stopped for as the last word was on her tongue the scene was suddenly lighted though only for a single instant by a flash the crack of a rifle succeeded and then followed the roll of the echo along the eastern mountains almost at the same moment a piercing female cry rose in the air in a prolonged shriek the awful stillness that succeeded was if possible more appalling than the fierce and sudden interruption of the deep silence of midnight resolute as she was both by nature and habit judith scarce breathed while poor hetty hid her face and trembled  that was a womans cry hetty said the former solemnly and it was a cry of anguish if the ark has moved from this spot it can only have gone north with this air and the gun and shriek came from the point can any thing have befallen hist  let us go and see judith she may want our assistancefor besides herself there are none but men in the ark  it was not a moment for hesitation and ere judith had ceased speaking her paddle was in the water the distance to the point in a direct line was not great and the impulses under which the girls worked were too exciting to allow them to waste the precious moments in useless precautions they paddled incautiously for them but the same excitement kept others from noting their movements presently a glare of light caught the eye of judith through an opening in the bushes and steering by it she so directed the canoe as to keep it visible while she got as near the land as was either prudent or necessary  the scene that was now presented to the observation of the girls was within the woods on the side of the declivity so often mentioned and in plain view from the boat here all in the camp were collected some six or eight carrying torches of fatpine which cast a strong but funereal light on all beneath the arches of the forest with her back supported against a tree and sustained on one side by the young sentinel whose remissness had suffered hetty to escape sat the female whose expected visit had produced his delinquency by the glare of the torch that was held near her face it was evident that she was in the agonies of death while the blood that trickled from her bared bosom betrayed the nature of the injury she had received the pungent peculiar smell of gunpowder too was still quite perceptible in the heavy damp night air there could be no question that she had been shot judith understood it all at a glance the streak of light had appeared on the water a short distance from the point and either the rifle had been discharged from a canoe hovering near the land or it had been fired from the ark in passing an incautious exclamation or laugh may have produced the assault for it was barely possible that the aim had been assisted by any other agent than sound as to the effect that was soon still more apparent the head of the victim dropping and the body sinking in death then all the torches but one were extinguisheda measure of prudence and the melancholy train that bore the body to the camp was just to be distinguished by the glimmering light that remained judith sighed heavily and shuddered as her paddle again dipped and the canoe moved cautiously around the point a sight had afflicted her senses and now haunted her imagination that was still harder to be borne than even the untimely fate and passing agony of the deceased girl  she had seen under the strong glare of all the torches the erect form of deerslayer standing with commiseration and as she thought with shame depicted on his countenance near the dying female he betrayed neither fear nor backwardness himself but it was apparent by the glances cast at him by the warriors that fierce passions were struggling in their bosoms all this seemed to be unheeded by the captive but it remained impressed on the memory of judith throughout the night no canoe was met hovering near the point a stillness and darkness as complete as if the silence of the forest had never been disturbed or the sun had never shone on that retired region now reigned on the point and on the gloomy water the slumbering woods and even the murky sky no more could be done therefore than to seek a place of safety and this was only to be found in the centre of the lake paddling in silence to that spot the canoe was suffered to drift northerly while the girls sought such repose as their situation and feelings would permit    chapter xix       stand to your arms and guard the dooralls lost     unless that fearful bell be silenced soon     the officer hath missd his path or purpose     or met some unforeseen and hideous obstacle     anselmo with thy company proceed     straight to the tower the rest remain with me      byron marino faliero ivii23035  the conjecture of judith hutter concerning the manner in which the indian girl had met her death was accurate in the main after sleeping several hours her father and march awoke this occurred a few minutes after she had left the ark to go in quest of her sister and when of course chingachgook and his betrothed were on board from the delaware the old man learned the position of the camp and the recent events as well as the absence of his daughters the latter gave him no concern for he relied greatly on the sagacity of the elder and the known impunity with which the younger passed among the savages long familiarity with danger too had blunted his sensibilities nor did he seem much to regret the captivity of deerslayer for while he knew how material his aid might be in a defence the difference in their views on the morality of the woods had not left much sympathy between them he would have rejoiced to know the position of the camp before it had been alarmed by the escape of hist but it would be too hazardous now to venture to land and he reluctantly relinquished for the night the ruthless designs that cupidity and revenge had excited him to entertain in this mood hutter took a seat in the head of the scow where he was quickly joined by hurry leaving the serpent and hist in quiet possession of the other extremity of the vessel  deerslayer has shown himself a boy in going among the savages at this hour and letting himself fall into their hands like a deer that tumbles into a pit growled the old man perceiving as usual the mote in his neighbors eyes while he overlooked the beam in his own if he is left to pay for his stupidity with his own flesh he can blame no one but himself  thats the way of the world old tom returned hurry every man must meet his own debts and answer for his own sins im amazed howsever that a lad as skilful and watchful as deerslayer should have been caught in such a trap didnt he know any better than to go prowling about a huron camp at midnight with no place to retreat to but a lake or did he think himself a buck that by taking to the water could throw off the scent and swim himself out of difficulty i had a better opinion of the boys judgment ill own but we must overlook a little ignorance in a raw hand i say master hutter do you happen to know what has become of the galsi see no signs of judith or hetty though ive been through the ark and looked into all its living creaturs  hutter briefly explained the manner in which his daughters had taken to the canoe as it had been related by the delaware as well as the return of judith after landing her sister and her second departure  this comes of a smooth tongue floating tom exclaimed hurry grating his teeth in pure resentmentthis comes of a smooth tongue and a silly gals inclinations and you had best look into the matter you and i were both prisoners hurry could recall that circumstance nowyou and i were both prisoners and yet judith never stirred an inch to do us any sarvice she is bewitched with this lanklooking deerslayer and he and she and you and all of us had best look to it i am not a man to put up with such a wrong quietly and i say all the parties had best look to it lets up kedge old fellow and move nearer to this pint and see how matters are getting on  hutter had no objections to this movement and the ark was got under way in the usual manner care being taken to make no noise the wind was passing northward and the sail soon swept the scow so far up the lake as to render the dark outlines of the trees that clothed the point dimly visible floating tom steered and he sailed along as near the land as the depth of the water and the overhanging branches would allow it was impossible to distinguish anything that stood within the shadows of the shore but the forms of the sail and of the hut were discerned by the young sentinel on the beach who has already been mentioned in the moment of sudden surprise a deep indian exclamation escaped him in that spirit of recklessness and ferocity that formed the essence of hurrys character this man dropped his rifle and fired the ball was sped by accident or by that overruling providence which decides the fates of all and the girl fell then followed the scene with the torches which has just been described  at the precise moment when hurry committed this act of unthinking cruelty the canoe of judith was within a hundred feet of the spot from which the ark had so lately moved her own course has been described and it has now become our office to follow that of her father and his companions the shriek announced the effects of the random shot of march and it also proclaimed that the victim was a woman hurry himself was startled at these unlooked for consequences and for a moment he was sorely disturbed by conflicting sensations at first he laughed in reckless and rudeminded exultation and then conscience that monitor planted in our breasts by god and which receives its more general growth from the training bestowed in the tillage of childhood shot a pang to his heart for a minute the mind of this creature equally of civilization and of barbarism was a sort of chaos as to feeling not knowing what to think of its own act and then the obstinacy and pride of one of his habits interposed to assert their usual ascendency he struck the butt of his rifle on the bottom of the scow with a species of defiance and began to whistle a low air with an affectation of indifference all this time the ark was in motion and it was already opening the bay above the point and was consequently quitting the land  hurrys companions did not view his conduct with the same indulgence as that with which he appeared disposed to regard it himself hutter growled out his dissatisfaction for the act led to no advantage while it threatened to render the warfare more vindictive than ever and none censure motiveless departures from the right more severely than the mercenary and unprincipled still he commanded himself the captivity of deerslayer rendering the arm of the offender of double consequence to him at that moment chingachgook arose and for a single instant the ancient animosity of tribes was forgotten in a feeling of colour but he recollected himself in season to prevent any of the fierce consequences that for a passing moment he certainly meditated not so with hist rushing through the hut or cabin the girl stood at the side of hurry almost as soon as his rifle touched the bottom of the scow and with a fearlessness that did credit to her heart she poured out her reproaches with the generous warmth of a woman  what for you shoot she said what huron gal do dat you kill him what you tink manitou say what you tink manitou feel what iroquois do no get honourno get campno get prisonerno get battleno get scalpno get noting at all blood come after blood how you feel your wife killed who pity you when tear come for moder or sister you big as great pinehuron gal little slender birchwhy you fall on her and crush her you tink huron forget it no redskin never forget never forget friend never forget enemy red man manitou in dat why you so wicked great paleface  hurry had never been so daunted as by this close and warm attack of the indian girl it is true that she had a powerful ally in his conscience and while she spoke earnestly it was in tones so feminine as to deprive him of any pretext for unmanly anger the softness of her voice added to the weight of her remonstrance by lending to the latter an air of purity and truth like most vulgar minded men he had only regarded the indians through the medium of their coarser and fiercer characteristics it had never struck him that the affections are human that even high principlesmodified by habits and prejudices but not the less elevated within their circlecan exist in the savage state and that the warrior who is most ruthless in the field can submit to the softest and gentlest influences in the moments of domestic quiet in a word it was the habit of his mind to regard all indians as being only a slight degree removed from the wild beasts that roamed the woods and to feel disposed to treat them accordingly whenever interest or caprice supplied a motive or an impulse still though daunted by these reproaches the handsome barbarian could hardly be said to be penitent he was too much rebuked by conscience to suffer an outbreak of temper to escape him and perhaps he felt that he had already committed an act that might justly bring his manhood in question instead of resenting or answering the simple but natural appeal of hist he walked away like one who disdained entering into a controversy with a woman  in the mean while the ark swept onward and by the time the scene with the torches was enacting beneath the trees it had reached the open lake floating tom causing it to sheer further from the land with a sort of instinctive dread of retaliation an hour now passed in gloomy silence no one appearing disposed to break it hist had retired to her pallet and chingachgook lay sleeping in the forward part of the scow hutter and hurry alone remained awake the former at the steering oar while the latter brooded over his own conduct with the stubbornness of one little given to a confession of his errors and the secret goadings of the worm that never dies this was at the moment when judith and hetty reached the centre of the lake and had lain down to endeavor to sleep in their drifting canoe  the night was calm though so much obscured by clouds the season was not one of storms and those which did occur in the month of june on that embedded water though frequently violent were always of short continuance nevertheless there was the usual current of heavy damp night air which passing over the summits of the trees scarcely appeared to descend as low as the surface of the glassy lake but kept moving a short distance above it saturated with the humidity that constantly arose from the woods and apparently never proceeding far in any one direction the currents were influenced by the formation of the hills as a matter of course a circumstance that rendered even fresh breezes baffling and which reduced the feebler efforts of the night air to be a sort of capricious and fickle sighings of the woods several times the head of the ark pointed east and once it was actually turned towards the south again but on the whole it worked its way north hutter making always a fair wind if wind it could be called his principal motive appearing to keep in motion in order to defeat any treacherous design of his enemies he now felt some little concern about his daughters and perhaps as much about the canoe but on the whole this uncertainty did not much disturb him as he had the reliance already mentioned on the intelligence of judith  it was the season of the shortest nights and it was not long before the deep obscurity which precedes the day began to yield to the returning light if any earthly scene could be presented to the senses of man that might soothe his passions and temper his ferocity it was that which grew upon the eyes of hutter and hurry as the hours advanced changing night to morning there were the usual soft tints of the sky in which neither the gloom of darkness nor the brilliancy of the sun prevails and under which objects appear more unearthly and we might add holy than at any other portion of the twenty four hours the beautiful and soothing calm of eventide has been extolled by a thousand poets and yet it does not bring with it the farreaching and sublime thoughts of the half hour that precedes the rising of a summer sun in the one case the panorama is gradually hid from the sight while in the other its objects start out from the unfolding picture first dim and misty then marked in in solemn background next seen in the witchery of an increasing a thing as different as possible from the decreasing twilight and finally mellow distinct and luminous as the rays of the great centre of light diffuse themselves in the atmosphere the hymns of birds too have no moral counterpart in the retreat to the roost or the flight to the nest and these invariably accompany the advent of the day until the appearance of the sun itself  bathes in deep joy the land and sea  all this however hutter and hurry witnessed without experiencing any of that calm delight which the spectacle is wont to bring when the thoughts are just and the aspirations pure they not only witnessed it but they witnessed it under circumstances that had a tendency to increase its power and to heighten its charms only one solitary object became visible in the returning light that had received its form or uses from human taste or human desires which as often deform as beautify a landscape this was the castle all the rest being native and fresh from the hand of god that singular residence too was in keeping with the natural objects of the view starting out from the gloom quaint picturesque and ornamental nevertheless the whole was lost on the observers who knew no feeling of poetry had lost their sense of natural devotion in lives of obdurate and narrow selfishness and had little other sympathy with nature than that which originated with her lowest wants  as soon as the light was sufficiently strong to allow of a distinct view of the lake and more particularly of its shores hutter turned the head of the ark directly towards the castle with the avowed intention of taking possession for the day at least as the place most favorable for meeting his daughters and for carrying on his operations against the indians by this time chingachgook was up and hist was heard stirring among the furniture of the kitchen the place for which they steered was distant only a mile and the air was sufficiently favorable to permit it to be reached by means of the sail at this moment too to render the appearances generally auspicious the canoe of judith was seen floating northward in the broadest part of the lake having actually passed the scow in the darkness in obedience to no other power than that of the elements hutter got his glass and took a long and anxious survey to ascertain if his daughters were in the light craft or not and a slight exclamation like that of joy escaped him as he caught a glimpse of what he rightly conceived to be a part of judiths dress above the top of the canoe at the next instant the girl arose and was seen gazing about her like one assuring herself of her situation a minute later hetty was seen on her knees in the other end of the canoe repeating the prayers that had been taught her in childhood by a misguided but repentant mother as hutter laid down the glass still drawn to its focus the serpent raised it to his eye and turned it towards the canoe it was the first time he had ever used such an instrument and hist understood by his hugh the expression of his face and his entire mien that something wonderful had excited his admiration it is well known that the american indians more particularly those of superior characters and stations singularly maintain their selfpossession and stoicism in the midst of the flood of marvels that present themselves in their occasional visits to the abodes of civilization and chingachgook had imbibed enough of this impassibility to suppress any very undignified manifestation of surprise with hist however no such law was binding and when her lover managed to bring the glass in a line with the canoe and her eye was applied to the smaller end the girl started back in alarm then she clapped her hands with delight and a laugh the usual attendant of untutored admiration followed a few minutes sufficed to enable this quick witted girl to manage the instrument for herself and she directed it at every prominent object that struck her fancy finding a rest in one of the windows she and the delaware first surveyed the lake then the shores the hills and finally the castle attracted their attention after a long steady gaze at the latter hist took away her eye and spoke to her lover in a low earnest manner chingachgook immediately placed his eye to the glass and his look even exceeded that of his betrothed in length and intensity again they spoke together confidentially appearing to compare opinions after which the glass was laid aside and the young warrior quitted the cabin to join hutter and hurry  the ark was slowly but steadily advancing and the castle was materially within half a mile when chingachgook joined the two white men in the stern of the scow his manner was calm but it was evident to the others who were familiar with the habits of the indians that he had something to communicate hurry was generally prompt to speak and according to custom he took the lead on this occasion  out with it redskin he cried in his usual rough manner have you discovered a chipmunk in a tree or is there a salmontrout swimming under the bottom of the scow you find what a paleface can do in the way of eyes now sarpent and mustnt wonder that they can see the land of the indians from afar off  no good to go to castle put in chingachgook with emphasis the moment the other gave him an opportunity of speaking huron there  the devil he isif this should turn out to be true floating tom a pretty trap were we about to pull down on our heads huron therewell this may be so but no signs can i see of any thing near or about the old hut but logs water and barkbating two or three windows and one door  hutter called for the glass and took a careful survey of the spot before he ventured an opinion at all then he somewhat cavalierly expressed his dissent from that given by the indian  youve got this glass wrong end foremost delaware continued hurry neither the old man nor i can see any trail in the lake  no trailwater make no trail said hist eagerly stop boatno go too near huron there  ay thats itstick to the same tale and more people will believe you i hope sarpent you and your gal will agree in telling the same story arter marriage as well as you do now huron therewhereabouts is he to be seenin the padlock or the chains or the logs there isnt a gaol in the colony that has a more lock up look about it than old toms chiente and i know something about gaols from experence  no see moccasin said hist impatiently why no lookand see him  give me the glass harry interrupted hutter and lower the sail it is seldom that an indian woman meddles and when she does there is generally a cause for it there is truly a moccasin floating against one of the piles and it may or may not be a sign that the castle hasnt escaped visitors in our absence moccasins are no rarities however for i wear em myself and deerslayer wears em and you wear em march and for that matter so does hetty quite as often as she wears shoes though i never yet saw judith trust her pretty foot in a moccasin  hurry had lowered the sail and by this time the ark was within two hundred yards of the castle setting in nearer and nearer each moment but at a rate too slow to excite any uneasiness each now took the glass in turn and the castle and every thing near it was subjected to a scrutiny still more rigid than ever there the moccasin lay beyond a question floating so lightly and preserving its form so well that it was scarcely wet it had caught by a piece of the rough bark of one of the piles on the exterior of the waterpalisade that formed the dock already mentioned which circumstance alone prevented it from drifting away before the air there were many modes however of accounting for the presence of the moccasin without supposing it to have been dropped by an enemy it might have fallen from the platform even while hutter was in possession of the place and drifted to the spot where it was now seen remaining unnoticed until detected by the acute vision of hist it might have drifted from a distance up or down the lake and accidentally become attached to the pile or palisade it might have been thrown from a window and alighted in that particular place or it might certainly have fallen from a scout or an assailant during the past night who was obliged to abandon it to the lake in the deep obscurity which then prevailed  all these conjectures passed from hutter to hurry the former appearing disposed to regard the omen as a little sinister while the latter treated it with his usual reckless disdain as for the indian he was of opinion that the moccasin should be viewed as one would regard a trail in the woods which might or might not equally prove to be threatening hist however had something available to propose she declared her readiness to take a canoe to proceed to the palisade and bring away the moccasin when its ornaments would show whether it came from the canadas or not both the white men were disposed to accept this offer but the delaware interfered to prevent the risk if such a service was to be undertaken it best became a warrior to expose himself in its execution and he gave his refusal to let his betrothed proceed much in the quiet but brief manner in which an indian husband issues his commands  well then delaware go yourself if youre so tender of your squaw put in the unceremonious hurry that moccasin must be had or floating tom will keep off here at arms length till the hearth cools in his cabin its but a little deerskin ater all and cut thisaway or thataway its not a skearcrow to frighten true hunters from their game what say you sarpent shall you or i canoe it  let red man gobetter eyes than palefaceknow huron trick better too  that ill gainsay to the hour of my death a white mans eyes and a white mans nose and for that matter his sight and ears are all better than an injins when fairly tried time and agin have i put that to the proof and what is proved is sartain still i suppose the poorest vagabond going whether delaware or huron can find his way to yonder hut and back agin and so sarpent use your paddle and welcome  chingachgook was already in the canoe and he dipped the implement the other named into the water just as hurrys limber tongue ceased wahtawah saw the departure of her warrior on this occasion with the submissive silence of an indian girl but with most of the misgivings and apprehensions of her sex throughout the whole of the past night and down to the moment when they used the glass together in the hut chingachgook had manifested as much manly tenderness towards his betrothed as one of the most refined sentiment could have shown under similar circumstances but now every sign of weakness was lost in an appearance of stern resolution although hist timidly endeavored to catch his eye as the canoe left the side of the ark the pride of a warrior would not permit him to meet her fond and anxious looks the canoe departed and not a wandering glance rewarded her solicitude  nor were the delawares care and gravity misplaced under the impressions with which he proceeded on this enterprise if the enemy had really gained possession of the building he was obliged to put himself under the very muzzles of their rifles as it were and this too without the protection of any of that cover which forms so essential an ally in indian warfare it is scarcely possible to conceive of a service more dangerous and had the serpent been fortified by the experience of ten more years or had his friend the deerslayer been present it would never have been attempted the advantages in no degree compensating for the risk but the pride of an indian chief was acted on by the rivalry of colour and it is not unlikely that the presence of the very creature from whom his ideas of manhood prevented his receiving a single glance overflowing as he was with the love she so well merited had no small influence on his determination  chingachgook paddled steadily towards the palisades keeping his eyes on the different loops of the building each instant he expected to see the muzzle of a rifle protruded or to hear its sharp crack but he succeeded in reaching the piles in safety here he was in a measure protected having the heads of the palisades between him and the hut and the chances of any attempt on his life while thus covered were greatly diminished the canoe had reached the piles with its head inclining northward and at a short distance from the moccasin instead of turning to pick up the latter the delaware slowly made the circuit of the whole building deliberately examining every object that should betray the presence of enemies or the commission of violence not a single sign could he discover however to confirm the suspicions that had been awakened the stillness of desertion pervaded the building not a fastening was displaced not a window had been broken the door looked as secure as at the hour when it was closed by hutter and even the gate of the dock had all the customary fastenings in short the most wary and jealous eye could detect no other evidence of the visit of enemies than that which was connected with the appearance of the floating moccasin  the delaware was now greatly at a loss how to proceed at one moment as he came round in front of the castle he was on the point of stepping up on the platform and of applying his eye to one of the loops with a view of taking a direct personal inspection of the state of things within but he hesitated though of little experience in such matters himself he had heard so much of indian artifices through traditions had listened with such breathless interest to the narration of the escapes of the elder warriors and in short was so well schooled in the theory of his calling that it was almost as impossible for him to make any gross blunder on such an occasion as it was for a well grounded scholar who had commenced correctly to fail in solving his problem in mathematics relinquishing the momentary intention to land the chief slowly pursued his course round the palisades as he approached the moccasin having now nearly completed the circuit of the building he threw the ominous article into the canoe by a dexterous and almost imperceptible movement of his paddle he was now ready to depart but retreat was even more dangerous than the approach as the eye could no longer be riveted on the loops if there was really any one in the castle the motive of the delaware in reconnoitering must be understood and it was the wisest way however perilous it might be to retire with an air of confidence as if all distrust were terminated by the examination such accordingly was the course adopted by the indian who paddled deliberately away taking the direction of the ark suffering no nervous impulse to quicken the motions of his arms or to induce him to turn even a furtive glance behind him  no tender wife reared in the refinements of the highest civilization ever met a husband on his return from the field with more of sensibility in her countenance than hist discovered as she saw the great serpent of the delawares step unharmed into the ark still she repressed her emotion though the joy that sparkled in her dark eyes and the smile that lighted her pretty mouth spoke a language that her betrothed could understand  well sarpent cried hurry always the first to speak what news from the muskrats did they shew their teeth as you surrounded their dwelling  i no like him sententiously returned the delaware too still so still can see silence  thats downright injinas if any thing could make less noise than nothing if youve no better reason than this to give old tom had better hoist his sail and go and get his breakfast under his own roof what has become of the moccasin  here returned chingachgook holding up his prize for the general inspection the moccasin was examined and hist confidently pronounced it to be huron by the manner in which the porcupines quills were arranged on its front hutter and the delaware too were decidedly of the same opinion admitting all this however it did not necessarily follow that its owners were in the castle the moccasin might have drifted from a distance or it might have fallen from the foot of some scout who had quitted the place when his errand was accomplished in short it explained nothing while it awakened so much distrust  under the circumstances hutter and hurry were not men to be long deterred from proceeding by proofs as slight as that of the moccasin they hoisted the sail again and the ark was soon in motion heading towards the castle the wind or air continued light and the movement was sufficiently slow to allow of a deliberate survey of the building as the scow approached the same deathlike silence reigned and it was difficult to fancy that any thing possessing animal life could be in or around the place unlike the serpent whose imagination had acted through his traditions until he was ready to perceive an artificial in a natural stillness the others saw nothing to apprehend in a tranquility that in truth merely denoted the repose of inanimate objects the accessories of the scene too were soothing and calm rather than exciting the day had not yet advanced so far as to bring the sun above the horizon but the heavens the atmosphere and the woods and lake were all seen under that softened light which immediately precedes his appearance and which perhaps is the most witching period of the four and twenty hours it is the moment when every thing is distinct even the atmosphere seeming to possess a liquid lucidity the hues appearing gray and softened with the outlines of objects defined and the perspective just as moral truths that are presented in their simplicity without the meretricious aids of ornament or glitter in a word it is the moment when the senses seem to recover their powers in the simplest and most accurate forms like the mind emerging from the obscurity of doubts into the tranquility and peace of demonstration most of the influence that such a scene is apt to produce on those who are properly constituted in a moral sense was lost on hutter and hurry but both the delawares though too much accustomed to witness the loveliness of morningtide to stop to analyze their feelings were equally sensible of the beauties of the hour though it was probably in a way unknown to themselves it disposed the young warrior to peace and never had he felt less longings for the glory of the combat than when he joined hist in the cabin the instant the scow rubbed against the side of the platform from the indulgence of such gentle emotions however he was aroused by a rude summons from hurry who called on him to come forth and help to take in the sail and to secure the ark  chingachgook obeyed and by the time he had reached the head of the scow hurry was on the platform stamping his feet like one glad to touch what by comparison might be called terra firma and proclaiming his indifference to the whole huron tribe in his customary noisy dogmatical manner hutter had hauled a canoe up to the head of the scow and was already about to undo the fastenings of the gate in order to enter within the dock march had no other motive in landing than a senseless bravado and having shaken the door in a manner to put its solidity to the proof he joined hutter in the canoe and began to aid him in opening the gate the reader will remember that this mode of entrance was rendered necessary by the manner in which the owner of this singular residence habitually secured it whenever it was left empty more particularly at moments when danger was apprehended hutter had placed a line in the delawares hand on entering the canoe intimating that the other was to fasten the ark to the platform and to lower the sail instead of following these directions however chingachgook left the sail standing and throwing the bight of the rope over the head of a pile he permitted the ark to drift round until it lay against the defences in a position where it could be entered only by means of a boat or by passing along the summits of the palisades the latter being an exploit that required some command of the feet and which was not to be attempted in the face of a resolute enemy  in consequence of this change in the position of the scow which was effected before hutter had succeeded in opening the gate of his dock the ark and the castle lay as sailors would express it yardarm and yardarm kept asunder some ten or twelve feet by means of the piles as the scow pressed close against the latter their tops formed a species of breast work that rose to the height of a mans head covering in a certain degree the parts of the scow that were not protected by the cabin the delaware surveyed this arrangement with great satisfaction and as the canoe of hutter passed through the gate into the dock he thought that he might defend his position against any garrison in the castle for a sufficient time could he but have had the helping arm of his friend deerslayer as it was he felt comparatively secure and no longer suffered the keen apprehensions he had lately experienced in behalf of hist  a single shove sent the canoe from the gate to the trap beneath the castle here hutter found all fast neither padlock nor chain nor bar having been molested the key was produced the locks removed the chain loosened and the trap pushed upward hurry now thrust his head in at the opening the arms followed and the colossal legs rose without any apparent effort at the next instant his heavy foot was heard stamping in the passage above that which separated the chambers of the father and daughters and into which the trap opened he then gave a shout of triumph  come on old tom the reckless woodsman called out from within the buildingheres your tenement safe and sound ay and as empty as a nut that has passed half an hour in the paws of a squirrel the delaware brags of being able to see silence let him come here and he may feel it in the bargain  any silence where you are hurry harry returned hutter thrusting his head in at the hole as he uttered the last word which instantly caused his voice to sound smothered to those withoutany silence where you are ought to be both seen and felt for its unlike any other silence  come come old fellow hoist yourself up and well open doors and windows and let in the fresh air to brighten up matters few words in troublesome times make men the best frinds your darter judith is what i call a misbehaving young woman and the hold of the whole family on me is so much weakened by her late conduct that it wouldnt take a speech as long as the ten commandments to send me off to the river leaving you and your traps your ark and your children your man servants and your maid servants your oxen and your asses to fight this battle with the iroquois by yourselves open that window floating tom and ill blunder through and do the same job to the front door  a moment of silence succeeded and a noise like that produced by the fall of a heavy body followed a deep execration from hurry succeeded and then the whole interior of the building seemed alive the noises that now so suddenly and we may add so unexpectedly even to the delaware broke the stillness within could not be mistaken they resembled those that would be produced by a struggle between tigers in a cage once or twice the indian yell was given but it seemed smothered and as if it proceeded from exhausted or compressed throats and in a single instance a deep and another shockingly revolting execration came from the throat of hurry it appeared as if bodies were constantly thrown upon the floor with violence as often rising to renew the struggle chingachgook felt greatly at a loss what to do he had all the arms in the ark hutter and hurry having proceeded without their rifles but there was no means of using them or of passing them to the hands of their owners the combatants were literally caged rendering it almost as impossible under the circumstances to get out as to get into the building then there was hist to embarrass his movements and to cripple his efforts with a view to relieve himself from this disadvantage he told the girl to take the remaining canoe and to join hutters daughters who were incautiously but deliberately approaching in order to save herself and to warn the others of their danger but the girl positively and firmly refused to comply at that moment no human power short of an exercise of superior physical force could have induced her to quit the ark the exigency of the moment did not admit of delay and the delaware seeing no possibility of serving his friends cut the line and by a strong shove forced the scow some twenty feet clear of the piles here he took the sweeps and succeeded in getting a short distance to windward if any direction could be thus termed in so light an air but neither the time nor his skill at the oars allowed the distance to be great when he ceased rowing the ark might have been a hundred yards from the platform and half that distance to the southward of it the sail being lowered judith and hetty had now discovered that something was wrong and were stationary a thousand feet farther north  all this while the furious struggle continued within the house in scenes like these events thicken in less time than they can be related from the moment when the first fall was heard within the building to that when the delaware ceased his awkward attempts to row it might have been three or four minutes but it had evidently served to weaken the combatants the oaths and execrations of hurry were no longer heard and even the struggles had lost some of their force and fury nevertheless they still continued with unabated perseverance at this instant the door flew open and the fight was transferred to the platform the light and the open air a huron had undone the fastenings of the door and three or four of his tribe rushed after him upon the narrow space as if glad to escape from some terrible scene within the body of another followed pitched headlong through the door with terrific violence then march appeared raging like a lion at bay and for an instant freed from his numerous enemies hutter was already a captive and bound there was now a pause in the struggle which resembled a lull in a tempest the necessity of breathing was common to all and the combatants stood watching each other like mastiffs that have been driven from their holds and are waiting for a favorable opportunity of renewing them we shall profit by this pause to relate the manner in which the indians had obtained possession of the castle and this the more willingly because it may be necessary to explain to the reader why a conflict which had been so close and fierce should have also been so comparatively bloodless  rivenoak and his companion particularly the latter who had appeared to be a subordinate and occupied solely with his raft had made the closest observations in their visits to the castle even the boy had brought away minute and valuable information by these means the hurons obtained a general idea of the manner in which the place was constructed and secured as well as of details that enabled them to act intelligently in the dark notwithstanding the care that hutter had taken to drop the ark on the east side of the building when he was in the act of transferring the furniture from the former to the latter he had been watched in a way to render the precaution useless scouts were on the lookout on the eastern as well as on the western shore of the lake and the whole proceeding had been noted as soon as it was dark rafts like that already described approached from both shores to reconnoitre and the ark had passed within fifty feet of one of them without its being discovered the men it held lying at their length on the logs so as to blend themselves and their slow moving machine with the water when these two sets of adventurers drew near the castle they encountered each other and after communicating their respective observations they unhesitatingly approached the building as had been expected it was found empty the rafts were immediately sent for a reinforcement to the shore and two of the savages remained to profit by their situation these men succeeded in getting on the roof and by removing some of the bark in entering what might be termed the garret here they were found by their companions hatchets now opened a hole through the squared logs of the upper floor through which no less than eight of the most athletic of the indians dropped into the rooms beneath here they were left well supplied with arms and provisions either to stand a siege or to make a sortie as the case might require the night was passed in sleep as is usual with indians in a state of inactivity the returning day brought them a view of the approach of the ark through the loops the only manner in which light and air were now admitted the windows being closed most effectually with plank rudely fashioned to fit as soon as it was ascertained that the two white men were about to enter by the trap the chief who directed the proceedings of the hurons took his measures accordingly he removed all the arms from his own people even to the knives in distrust of savage ferocity when awakened by personal injuries and he hid them where they could not be found without a search ropes of bark were then prepared and taking their stations in the three different rooms they all waited for the signal to fall upon their intended captives as soon as the party had entered the building men without replaced the bark of the roof removed every sign of their visit with care and then departed for the shore it was one of these who had dropped his moccasin which he had not been able to find again in the dark had the death of the girl been known it is probable nothing could have saved the lives of hurry and hutter but that event occurred after the ambush was laid and at a distance of several miles from the encampment near the castle such were the means that had been employed to produce the state of things we shall continue to describe    chapter xx       now all is done that man can do     and all is done in vain     my love  my native land adieu     for i must cross the main my dear     for i must cross the main      robert burns it was a for our rightfu king ii  712  the last chapter we left the combatants breathing in their narrow lists accustomed to the rude sports of wrestling and jumping then so common in america more especially on the frontiers hurry possessed an advantage in addition to his prodigious strength that had rendered the struggle less unequal than it might otherwise appear to be this alone had enabled him to hold out so long against so many enemies for the indian is by no means remarkable for his skill or force in athletic exercises as yet no one had been seriously hurt though several of the savages had received severe falls and he in particular who had been thrown bodily upon the platform might be said to be temporarily hors de combat some of the rest were limping and march himself had not entirely escaped from bruises though want of breath was the principal loss that both sides wished to repair  under circumstances like those in which the parties were placed a truce let it come from what cause it might could not well be of long continuance the arena was too confined and the distrust of treachery too great to admit of this contrary to what might be expected in his situation hurry was the first to recommence hostilities whether this proceeded from policy an idea that he might gain some advantage by making a sudden and unexpected assault or was the fruit of irritation and his undying hatred of an indian it is impossible to say his onset was furious however and at first it carried all before it he seized the nearest huron by the waist raised him entirely from the platform and hurled him into the water as if he had been a child in half a minute two more were at his side one of whom received a grave injury by the friend who had just preceded him but four enemies remained and in a hand to hand conflict in which no arms were used but those which nature had furnished hurry believed himself fully able to cope with that number of redskins  hurrah old tom he shoutedthe rascals are taking to the lake and ill soon have em all swimming as these words were uttered a violent kick in the face sent back the injured indian who had caught at the edge of the platform and was endeavoring to raise himself to its level helplessly and hopelessly into the water when the affray was over his dark body was seen through the limpid element of the glimmerglass lying with outstretched arms extended on the bottom of the shoal on which the castle stood clinging to the sands and weeds as if life were to be retained by this frenzied grasp of death a blow sent into the pit of anothers stomach doubled him up like a worm that had been trodden on and but two able bodied foes remained to be dealt with one of these however was not only the largest and strongest of the hurons but he was also the most experienced of their warriors present and that one whose sinews were the best strung in fights and by marches on the warpath this man fully appreciated the gigantic strength of his opponent and had carefully husbanded his own he was also equipped in the best manner for such a conflict standing in nothing but his breechcloth the model of a naked and beautiful statue of agility and strength to grasp him required additional dexterity and unusual force still hurry did not hesitate but the kick that had actually destroyed one fellow creature was no sooner given than he closed in with this formidable antagonist endeavoring to force him into the water also the struggle that succeeded was truly frightful so fierce did it immediately become and so quick and changeful were the evolutions of the athletes that the remaining savage had no chance for interfering had he possessed the desire but wonder and apprehension held him spell bound he was an inexperienced youth and his blood curdled as he witnessed the fell strife of human passions exhibited too in an unaccustomed form  hurry first attempted to throw his antagonist with this view he seized him by the throat and an arm and tripped with the quickness and force of an american borderer the effect was frustrated by the agile movements of the huron who had clothes to grasp by and whose feet avoided the attempt with a nimbleness equal to that with which it was made then followed a sort of melee if such a term can be applied to a struggle between two in which no efforts were strictly visible the limbs and bodies of the combatants assuming so many attitudes and contortions as to defeat observation this confused but fierce rally lasted less than a minute however when hurry furious at having his strength baffled by the agility and nakedness of his foe made a desperate effort which sent the huron from him hurling his body violently against the logs of the hut the concussion was so great as momentarily to confuse the latters faculties the pain too extorted a deep groan an unusual concession to agony to escape a red man in the heat of battle still he rushed forward again to meet his enemy conscious that his safety rested on its resolution hurry now seized the other by the waist raised him bodily from the platform and fell with his own great weight on the form beneath this additional shock so stunned the sufferer that his gigantic white opponent now had him completely at his mercy passing his hands around the throat of his victim he compressed them with the strength of a vice fairly doubling the head of the huron over the edge of the platform until the chin was uppermost with the infernal strength he expended an instant sufficed to show the consequences the eyes of the sufferer seemed to start forward his tongue protruded and his nostrils dilated nearly to splitting at this instant a rope of bark having an eye was passed dexterously within the two arms of hurry the end threaded the eye forming a noose and his elbows were drawn together behind his back with a power that all his gigantic strength could not resist reluctantly even under such circumstances did the exasperated borderer see his hands drawn from their deadly grasp for all the evil passions were then in the ascendant almost at the same instant a similar fastening secured his ankles and his body was rolled to the centre of the platform as helplessly and as cavalierly as if it were a log of wood his rescued antagonist however did not rise for while he began again to breathe his head still hung helplessly over the edge of the logs and it was thought at first that his neck was dislocated he recovered gradually only and it was hours before he could walk some fancied that neither his body nor his mind ever totally recovered from this near approach to death  hurry owed his defeat and capture to the intensity with which he had concentrated all his powers on his fallen foe while thus occupied the two indians he had hurled into the water mounted to the heads of the piles along which they passed and joined their companion on the platform the latter had so far rallied his faculties as to have gotten the ropes which were in readiness for use as the others appeared and they were applied in the manner related as hurry lay pressing his enemy down with his whole weight intent only on the horrible office of strangling him thus were the tables turned in a single moment he who had been so near achieving a victory that would have been renowned for ages by means of traditions throughout all that region lying helpless bound and a captive so fearful had been the efforts of the paleface and so prodigious the strength he exhibited that even as he lay tethered like a sheep before them they regarded him with respect and not without dread the helpless body of their stoutest warrior was still stretched on the platform and as they cast their eyes towards the lake in quest of the comrade that had been hurled into it so unceremoniously and of whom they had lost sight in the confusion of the fray they perceived his lifeless form clinging to the grass on the bottom as already described these several circumstances contributed to render the victory of the hurons almost as astounding to themselves as a defeat  chingachgook and his betrothed witnessed the whole of this struggle from the ark when the three hurons were about to pass the cords around the arms of the prostrate hurry the delaware sought his rifle but before he could use it the white man was bound and the mischief was done he might still bring down an enemy but to obtain the scalp was impossible and the young chief who would so freely risk his own life to obtain such a trophy hesitated about taking that of a foe without such an object in view a glance at hist and the recollection of what might follow checked any transient wish for revenge the reader has been told that chingachgook could scarcely be said to know how to manage the oars of the ark at all however expert he might be in the use of the paddle perhaps there is no manual labor at which men are so bungling and awkward as in their first attempts to pull oar even the experienced mariner or boat man breaking down in his efforts to figure with the celebrated rullock of the gondolier in short it is temporarily an impracticable thing for a new beginner to succeed with a single oar but in this case it was necessary to handle two at the same time and those of great size sweeps or large oars however are sooner rendered of use by the raw hand than lighter implements and this was the reason that the delaware had succeeded in moving the ark as well as he did in a first trial that trial notwithstanding sufficed to produce distrust and he was fully aware of the critical situation in which hist and himself were now placed should the hurons take to the canoe that was still lying beneath the trap and come against them at the moment he thought of putting hist into the canoe in his own possession and of taking to the eastern mountain in the hope of reaching the delaware villages by direct flight but many considerations suggested themselves to put a stop to this indiscreet step it was almost certain that scouts watched the lake on both sides and no canoe could possibly approach shore without being seen from the hills then a trail could not be concealed from indian eyes and the strength of hist was unequal to a flight sufficiently sustained to outstrip the pursuit of trained warriors this was a part of america in which the indians did not know the use of horses and everything would depend on the physical energies of the fugitives last but far from being least were the thoughts connected with the situation of deerslayer a friend who was not to be deserted in his extremity  hist in some particulars reasoned and even felt differently though she arrived at the same conclusions her own anger disturbed her less than her concern for the two sisters on whose behalf her womanly sympathies were now strongly enlisted the canoe of the girls by the time the struggle on the platform had ceased was within three hundred yards of the castle and here judith ceased paddling the evidences of strife first becoming apparent to the eyes she and hetty were standing erect anxiously endeavoring to ascertain what had occurred but unable to satisfy their doubts from the circumstance that the building in a great measure concealed the scene of action  the parties in the ark and in the canoe were indebted to the ferocity of hurrys attack for their momentary security in any ordinary case the girls would have been immediately captured a measure easy of execution now the savages had a canoe were it not for the rude check the audacity of the hurons had received in the recent struggle it required some little time to recover from the effects of this violent scene and this so much the more because the principal man of the party in the way of personal prowess at least had been so great a sufferer still it was of the last importance that judith and her sister should seek immediate refuge in the ark where the defences offered a temporary shelter at least and the first step was to devise the means of inducing them to do so hist showed herself in the stern of the scow and made many gestures and signs in vain in order to induce the girls to make a circuit to avoid the castle and to approach the ark from the eastward but these signs were distrusted or misunderstood it is probable judith was not yet sufficiently aware of the real state of things to put full confidence in either party instead of doing as desired she rather kept more aloof paddling slowly back to the north or into the broadest part of the lake where she could command the widest view and had the fairest field for flight before her at this instant the sun appeared above the pines of the eastern range of mountains and a light southerly breeze arose as was usual enough at that season and hour chingachgook lost no time in hoisting the sail whatever might be in reserve for him there could be no question that it was every way desirable to get the ark at such a distance from the castle as to reduce his enemies to the necessity of approaching the former in the canoe which the chances of war had so inopportunely for his wishes and security thrown into their hands the appearance of the opening duck seemed first to arouse the hurons from their apathy and by the time the head of the scow had fallen off before the wind which it did unfortunately in the wrong direction bringing it within a few yards of the platform hist found it necessary to warn her lover of the importance of covering his person against the rifles of his foes this was a danger to be avoided under all circumstances and so much the more because the delaware found that hist would not take to the cover herself so long as he remained exposed accordingly chingachgook abandoned the scow to its own movements forced hist into the cabin the doors of which he immediately secured and then he looked about him for the rifles the situation of the parties was now so singular as to merit a particular description the ark was within sixty yards of the castle a little to the southward or to windward of it with its sail full and the steering oar abandoned the latter fortunately was loose so that it produced no great influence on the crab like movements of the unwieldy craft the sail being as sailors term it flying or having no braces the air forced the yard forward though both sheets were fast the effect was threefold on a boat with a bottom that was perfectly flat and which drew merely some three or four inches water it pressed the head slowly round to leeward it forced the whole fabric bodily in the same direction at the same time and the water that unavoidably gathered under the lee gave the scow also a forward movement all these changes were exceedingly slow however for the wind was not only light but it was baffling as usual and twice or thrice the sail shook once it was absolutely taken aback  had there been any keel to the ark it would inevitably have run foul of the platform bows on when it is probable nothing could have prevented the hurons from carrying it more particularly as the sail would have enabled them to approach under cover as it was the scow wore slowly round barely clearing that part of the building the piles projecting several feet they were not cleared but the head of the slow moving craft caught between two of them by one of its square corners and hung at this moment the delaware was vigilantly watching through a loop for an opportunity to fire while the hurons kept within the building similarly occupied the exhausted warrior reclined against the hut there having been no time to remove him and hurry lay almost as helpless as a log tethered like a sheep on its way to the slaughter near the middle of the platform chingachgook could have slain the first at any moment but his scalp would have been safe and the young chief disdained to strike a blow that could lead to neither honor nor advantage  run out one of the poles sarpent if sarpent you be said hurry amid the groans that the tightness of the ligatures was beginning to extort from himrun out one of the poles and shove the head of the scow off and youll drift clear of usand when youve done that good turn for yourself just finish this gagging blackguard for me  the appeal of hurry however had no other effect than to draw the attention of hist to his situation this quick witted creature comprehended it at a glance his ankles were bound with several turns of stout bark rope and his arms above the elbows were similarly secured behind his back barely leaving him a little play of the hands and wrists putting her mouth near a loop she said in a low but distinct voicewhy you dont roll here and fall in scow chingachgook shoot huron if he chase  by the lord gal thats a judgematical thought and it shall be tried if the starn of your scow will come a little nearer put a bed at the bottom for me to fall on  this was said at a happy moment for tired of waiting all the indians made a rapid discharge of their rifles almost simultaneously injuring no one though several bullets passed through the loops hist had heard part of hurrys words but most of what he said was lost in the sharp reports of the firearms she undid the bar of the door that led to the stern of the scow but did not dare to expose her person all this time the head of the ark hung but by a gradually decreasing hold as the other end swung slowly round nearer and nearer to the platform hurry who now lay with his face towards the ark occasionally writhing and turning over like one in pain evolutions he had performed ever since he was secured watched every change and at last he saw that the whole vessel was free and was beginning to grate slowly along the sides of the piles the attempt was desperate but it seemed to be the only chance for escaping torture and death and it suited the reckless daring of the mans character waiting to the last moment in order that the stern of the scow might fairly rub against the platform he began to writhe again as if in intolerable suffering execrating all indians in general and the hurons in particular and then he suddenly and rapidly rolled over and over taking the direction of the stern of the scow unfortunately hurrys shoulders required more space to revolve in than his feet and by the time he reached the edge of the platform his direction had so far changed as to carry him clear of the ark altogether and the rapidity of his revolutions and the emergency admitting of no delay he fell into the water at this instant chingachgook by an understanding with his betrothed drew the fire of the hurons again not a man of whom saw the manner in which one whom they knew to be effectually tethered had disappeared but hists feelings were strongly interested in the success of so bold a scheme and she watched the movements of hurry as the cat watches the mouse the moment he was in motion she foresaw the consequences and this the more readily as the scow was now beginning to move with some steadiness and she bethought her of the means of saving him with a sort of instinctive readiness she opened the door at the very moment the rifles were ringing in her ears and protected by the intervening cabin she stepped into the stem of the scow in time to witness the fall of hurry into the lake her foot was unconsciously placed on the end of one of the sheets of the sail which was fastened aft and catching up all the spare rope with the awkwardness but also with the generous resolution of a woman she threw it in the direction of the helpless hurry the line fell on the head and body of the sinking man and he not only succeeded in grasping separate parts of it with his hands but he actually got a portion of it between his teeth hurry was an expert swimmer and tethered as he was he resorted to the very expedient that philosophy and reflection would have suggested he had fallen on his back and instead of floundering and drowning himself by desperate efforts to walk on the water he permitted his body to sink as low as possible and was already submerged with the exception of his face when the line reached him in this situation he might possibly have remained until rescued by the hurons using his hands as fishes use their fins had he received no other succour but the movement of the ark soon tightened the rope and of course he was dragged gently ahead holding even pace with the scow the motion aided in keeping his face above the surface of the water and it would have been possible for one accustomed to endurance to have been towed a mile in this singular but simple manner  it has been said that the hurons did not observe the sudden disappearance of hurry in his present situation he was not only hid from view by the platform but as the ark drew slowly ahead impelled by a sail that was now filled he received the same friendly service from the piles the hurons indeed were too intent on endeavoring to slay their delaware foe by sending a bullet through some one of the loops or crevices of the cabin to bethink them at all of one whom they fancied so thoroughly tied their great concern was the manner in which the ark rubbed past the piles although its motion was lessened at least one half by the friction and they passed into the northern end of the castle in order to catch opportunities of firing through the loops of that part of the building chingachgook was similarly occupied and remained as ignorant as his enemies of the situation of hurry as the ark grated along the rifles sent their little clouds of smoke from one cover to the other but the eyes and movements of the opposing parties were too quick to permit any injury to be done at length one side had the mortification and the other the pleasure of seeing the scow swing clear of the piles altogether when it immediately moved away with a materially accelerated motion towards the north  chingachgook now first learned from hist the critical condition of hurry to have exposed either of their persons in the stern of the scow would have been certain death but fortunately the sheet to which the man clung led forward to the foot of the sail the delaware found means to unloosen it from the cleet aft and hist who was already forward for that purpose immediately began to pull upon the line at this moment hurry was towing fifty or sixty feet astern with nothing but his face above water as he was dragged out clear of the castle and the piles he was first perceived by the hurons who raised a hideous yell and commenced a fire on what may very well be termed the floating mass it was at the same instant that hist began to pull upon the line forwarda circumstance that probably saved hurrys life aided by his own selfpossession and border readiness the first bullet struck the water directly on the spot where the broad chest of the young giant was visible through the pure element and might have pierced his heart had the angle at which it was fired been less acute instead of penetrating the lake however it glanced from its smooth surface rose and buried itself in the logs of the cabin near the spot at which chingachgook had shown himself the minute before while clearing the line from the cleet a second and a third and a fourth bullet followed all meeting with the same resistance of the water though hurry sensibly felt the violence of the blows they struck upon the lake so immediately above and so near his breast discovering their mistake the hurons now changed their plan and aimed at the uncovered face but by this time hist was pulling on the line the target advanced and the deadly missiles still fell upon the water in another moment the body was dragged past the end of the scow and became concealed as for the delaware and hist they worked perfectly covered by the cabin and in less time than it requires to tell it they had hauled the huge frame of harry to the place they occupied chingachgook stood in readiness with his keen knife and bending over the side of the scow he soon severed the bark that bound the limbs of the borderer to raise him high enough to reach the edge of the boat and to aid him in entering were less easy as hurrys arms were still nearly useless but both were done in time when the liberated man staggered forward and fell exhausted and helpless into the bottom of the scow here we shall leave him to recover his strength and the due circulation of his blood while we proceed with the narrative of events that crowd upon us too fast to admit of any postponement the moment the hurons lost sight of the body of hurry they gave a common yell of disappointment and three of the most active of their number ran to the trap and entered the canoe it required some little delay however to embark with their weapons to find the paddles and if we may use a phrase so purely technical to get out of dock by this time hurry was in the scow and the delaware had his rifles again in readiness as the ark necessarily sailed before the wind it had got by this time quite two hundred yards from the castle and was sliding away each instant farther and farther though with a motion so easy as scarcely to stir the water the canoe of the girls was quite a quarter of a mile distant from the ark obviously keeping aloof in ignorance of what had occurred and in apprehension of the consequences of venturing too near they had taken the direction of the eastern shore endeavoring at the same time to get to windward of the ark and in a manner between the two parties as if distrusting which was to be considered a friend and which an enemy the girls from long habit used the paddles with great dexterity and judith in particular had often sportively gained races in trials of speed with the youths that occasionally visited the lake  when the three hurons emerged from behind the palisades and found themselves on the open lake and under the necessity of advancing unprotected on the ark if they persevered in the original design their ardor sensibly cooled in a bark canoe they were totally without cover and indian discretion was entirely opposed to such a sacrifice of life as would most probably follow any attempt to assault an enemy entrenched as effectually as the delaware instead of following the ark therefore these three warriors inclined towards the eastern shore keeping at a safe distance from the rifles of chingachgook but this manoeuvre rendered the position of the girls exceedingly critical it threatened to place them if not between two fires at least between two dangers or what they conceived to be dangers and instead of permitting the hurons to enclose her in what she fancied a sort of net judith immediately commenced her retreat in a southern direction at no very great distance from the shore she did not dare to land if such an expedient were to be resorted to at all she could only venture on it in the last extremity at first the indians paid little or no attention to the other canoe for fully apprised of its contents they deemed its capture of comparatively little moment while the ark with its imaginary treasures the persons of the delaware and of hurry and its means of movement on a large scale was before them but this ark had its dangers as well as its temptations and after wasting near an hour in vacillating evolutions always at a safe distance from the rifle the hurons seemed suddenly to take their resolution and began to display it by giving eager chase to the girls  when this last design was adopted the circumstances of all parties as connected with their relative positions were materially changed the ark had sailed and drifted quite half a mile and was nearly that distance due north of the castle as soon as the delaware perceived that the girls avoided him unable to manage his unwieldy craft and knowing that flight from a bark canoe in the event of pursuit would be a useless expedient if attempted he had lowered his sail in the hope it might induce the sisters to change their plan and to seek refuge in the scow this demonstration produced no other effect than to keep the ark nearer to the scene of action and to enable those in her to become witnesses of the chase the canoe of judith was about a quarter of a mile south of that of the hurons a little nearer to the east shore and about the same distance to the southward of the castle as it was from the hostile canoe a circumstance which necessarily put the last nearly abreast of hutters fortress with the several parties thus situated the chase commenced  at the moment when the hurons so suddenly changed their mode of attack their canoe was not in the best possible racing trim there were but two paddles and the third man so much extra and useless cargo then the difference in weight between the sisters and the other two men more especially in vessels so extremely light almost neutralized any difference that might proceed from the greater strength of the hurons and rendered the trial of speed far from being as unequal as it might seem judith did not commence her exertions until the near approach of the other canoe rendered the object of the movement certain and then she exhorted hetty to aid her with her utmost skill and strength  why should we run judith asked the simple minded girl the hurons have never harmed me nor do i think they ever will  that may be true as to you hetty but it will prove very different with me kneel down and say your prayer and then rise and do your utmost to help escape think of me dear girl too as you pray  judith gave these directions from a mixed feeling first because she knew that her sister ever sought the support of her great ally in trouble and next because a sensation of feebleness and dependance suddenly came over her own proud spirit in that moment of apparent desertion and trial the prayer was quickly said however and the canoe was soon in rapid motion still neither party resorted to their greatest exertions from the outset both knowing that the chase was likely to be arduous and long like two vessels of war that are preparing for an encounter they seemed desirous of first ascertaining their respective rates of speed in order that they might know how to graduate their exertions previously to the great effort a few minutes sufficed to show the hurons that the girls were expert and that it would require all their skill and energies to overtake them  judith had inclined towards the eastern shore at the commencement of the chase with a vague determination of landing and flying to the woods as a last resort but as she approached the land the certainty that scouts must be watching her movements made her reluctance to adopt such an expedient unconquerable then she was still fresh and had sanguine hopes of being able to tire out her pursuers with such feelings she gave a sweep with her paddle and sheered off from the fringe of dark hemlocks beneath the shades of which she was so near entering and held her way again more towards the centre of the lake this seemed the instant favorable for the hurons to make their push as it gave them the entire breadth of the sheet to do it in and this too in the widest part as soon as they had got between the fugitives and the land the canoes now flew judith making up for what she wanted in strength by her great dexterity and self command for half a mile the indians gained no material advantage but the continuance of so great exertions for so many minutes sensibly affected all concerned here the indians resorted to an expedient that enabled them to give one of their party time to breathe by shifting their paddles from hand to hand and this too without sensibly relaxing their efforts  judith occasionally looked behind her and she saw this expedient practised it caused her immediately to distrust the result since her powers of endurance were not likely to hold out against those of men who had the means of relieving each other still she persevered allowing no very visible consequences immediately to follow the change  as yet the indians had not been able to get nearer to the girls than two hundred yards though they were what seamen would term in their wake or in a direct line behind them passing over the same track of water this made the pursuit what is technically called a stern chase which is proverbially a long chase the meaning of which is that in consequence of the relative positions of the parties no change becomes apparent except that which is a direct gain in the nearest possible approach long as this species of chase is admitted to be however judith was enabled to perceive that the hurons were sensibly drawing nearer and nearer before she had gained the centre of the lake she was not a girl to despair but there was an instant when she thought of yielding with the wish of being carried to the camp where she knew the deerslayer to be a captive but the considerations connected with the means she hoped to be able to employ in order to procure his release immediately interposed in order to stimulate her to renewed exertions had there been any one there to note the progress of the two canoes he would have seen that of judith flying swiftly away from its pursuers as the girl gave it freshly impelled speed while her mind was thus dwelling on her own ardent and generous schemes so material indeed was the difference in the rate of going between the two canoes for the next five minutes that the hurons began to be convinced all their powers must be exerted or they would suffer the disgrace of being baffled by women making a furious effort under the mortification of such a conviction one of the strongest of their party broke his paddle at the very moment when he had taken it from the hand of a comrade to relieve him this at once decided the matter a canoe containing three men and having but one paddle being utterly unable to overtake fugitives like the daughters of thomas hutter  there judith exclaimed hetty who saw the accident i hope now you will own that praying is useful the hurons have broke a paddle and they never can overtake us  i never denied it poor hetty and sometimes wish in bitterness of spirit that i had prayed more myself and thought less of my beauty as you say we are now safe and need only go a little south and take breath  this was done the enemy giving up the pursuit as suddenly as a ship that has lost an important spar the instant the accident occurred instead of following judiths canoe which was now lightly skimming over the water towards the south the hurons turned their bows towards the castle where they soon arrived and landed the girls fearful that some spare paddles might be found in or about the buildings continued on nor did they stop until so distant from their enemies as to give them every chance of escape should the chase be renewed it would seem that the savages meditated no such design but at the end of an hour their canoe filled with men was seen quitting the castle and steering towards the shore the girls were without food and they now drew nearer to the buildings and the ark having finally made up their minds from its manoeuvres that the latter contained friends  notwithstanding the seeming desertion of the castle judith approached it with extreme caution the ark was now quite a mile to the northward but sweeping up towards the buildings and this too with a regularity of motion that satisfied judith a white man was at the oars when within a hundred yards of the building the girls began to encircle it in order to make sure that it was empty no canoe was nigh and this emboldened them to draw nearer and nearer until they had gone round the piles and reached the platform  do you go into the house hetty said judith and see that the savages are gone they will not harm you and if any of them are still here you can give me the alarm i do not think they will fire on a poor defenceless girl and i at least may escape until i shall be ready to go among them of my own accord  hetty did as desired judith retiring a few yards from the platform the instant her sister landed in readiness for flight but the last was unnecessary not a minute elapsing before hetty returned to communicate that all was safe  ive been in all the rooms judith said the latter earnestly and they are empty except fathers he is in his own chamber sleeping though not as quietly as we could wish  has any thing happened to father demanded judith as her foot touched the platform speaking quickly for her nerves were in a state to be easily alarmed  hetty seemed concerned and she looked furtively about her as if unwilling any one but a child should hear what she had to communicate and even that she should learn it abruptly  you know how it is with father sometimes judith she said when overtaken with liquor he doesnt always know what he says or does and he seems to be overtaken with liquor now  that is strange would the savages have drunk with him and then leave him behind but tis a grievous sight to a child hetty to witness such a failing in a parent and we will not go near him til he wakes  a groan from the inner room however changed this resolution and the girls ventured near a parent whom it was no unusual thing for them to find in a condition that lowers a man to the level of brutes he was seated reclining in a corner of the narrow room with his shoulders supported by the angle and his head fallen heavily on his chest judith moved forward with a sudden impulse and removed a canvass cap that was forced so low on his head as to conceal his face and indeed all but his shoulders the instant this obstacle was taken away the quivering and raw flesh the bared veins and muscles and all the other disgusting signs of mortality as they are revealed by tearing away the skin showed he had been scalped though still living    chapter xxi       lightly theyll talk of the spirit thats gone     and oer his cold ashes upbraid him     but nothing hell reck if theyll let him sleep on     in the grave where a briton has laid him      charles wolfe the burial of sir john moore vi  the reader must imagine the horror that daughters would experience at unexpectedly beholding the shocking spectacle that was placed before the eyes of judith and esther as related in the close of the last chapter we shall pass over the first emotions the first acts of filial piety and proceed with the narrative by imagining rather than relating most of the revolting features of the scene the mutilated and ragged head was bound up the unseemly blood was wiped from the face of the sufferer the other appliances required by appearances and care were resorted to and there was time to enquire into the more serious circumstances of the case the facts were never known until years later in all their details simple as they were but they may as well be related here as it can be done in a few words in the struggle with the hurons hutter had been stabbed by the knife of the old warrior who had used the discretion to remove the arms of every one but himself being hard pushed by his sturdy foe his knife had settled the matter this occurred just as the door was opened and hurry burst out upon the platform as has been previously related this was the secret of neither partys having appeared in the subsequent struggle hutter having been literally disabled and his conqueror being ashamed to be seen with the traces of blood about him after having used so many injunctions to convince his young warriors of the necessity of taking their prisoners alive when the three hurons returned from the chase and it was determined to abandon the castle and join the party on the land hutter was simply scalped to secure the usual trophy and was left to die by inches as has been done in a thousand similar instances by the ruthless warriors of this part of the american continent had the injury of hutter been confined to his head he might have recovered however for it was the blow of the knife that proved mortal there are moments of vivid consciousness when the stern justice of god stands forth in colours so prominent as to defy any attempts to veil them from the sight however unpleasant they may appear or however anxious we may be to avoid recognising it such was now the fact with judith and hetty who both perceived the decrees of a retributive providence in the manner of their fathers suffering as a punishment for his own recent attempts on the iroquois this was seen and felt by judith with the keenness of perception and sensibility that were suited to her character while the impression made on the simpler mind of her sister was perhaps less lively though it might well have proved more lasting  oh judith exclaimed the weak minded girl as soon as their first care had been bestowed on sufferer father went for scalps himself and now where is his own the bible might have foretold this dreadful punishment  hush hettyhush poor sisterhe opens his eyes he may hear and understand you tis as you say and think but tis too dreadful to speak  water ejaculated hutter as it might be by a desperate effort that rendered his voice frightfully deep and strong for one as near death as he evidently waswaterfoolish girlswill you let me die of thirst  water was brought and administered to the sufferer the first he had tasted in hours of physical anguish it had the double effect of clearing his throat and of momentarily reviving his sinking system his eyes opened with that anxious distended gaze which is apt to accompany the passage of a soul surprised by death and he seemed disposed to speak  father said judith inexpressibly pained by his deplorable situation and this so much the more from her ignorance of what remedies ought to be appliedfather can we do any thing for you can hetty and i relieve your pain  father slowly repeated the old man no judith no hettyim no father she was your mother but im no father look in the chesttis all theregive me more water  the girls complied and judith whose early recollections extended farther back than her sisters and who on every account had more distinct impressions of the past felt an uncontrollable impulse of joy as she heard these words there had never been much sympathy between her reputed father and herself and suspicions of this very truth had often glanced across her mind in consequence of dialogues she had overheard between hutter and her mother it might be going too far to say she had never loved him but it is not so to add that she rejoiced it was no longer a duty with hetty the feeling was different incapable of making all the distinctions of her sister her very nature was full of affection and she had loved her reputed parent though far less tenderly than the real parent and it grieved her now to hear him declare he was not naturally entitled to that love she felt a double grief as if his death and his words together were twice depriving her of parents yielding to her feelings the poor girl went aside and wept  the very opposite emotions of the two girls kept both silent for a long time judith gave water to the sufferer frequently but she forbore to urge him with questions in some measure out of consideration for his condition but if truth must be said quite as much lest something he should add in the way of explanation might disturb her pleasing belief that she was not thomas hutters child at length hetty dried her tears and came and seated herself on a stool by the side of the dying man who had been placed at his length on the floor with his head supported by some coarse vestments that had been left in the house  father she said you will let me call you father though you say you are not onefather shall i read the bible to youmother always said the bible was good for people in trouble she was often in trouble herself and then she made me read the bible to herfor judith wasnt as fond of the bible as i amand it always did her good many is the time ive known mother begin to listen with the tears streaming from her eyes and end with smiles and gladness oh father you dont know how much good the bible can do for youve never tried it now ill read a chapter and it will soften your heart as it softened the hearts of the hurons  while poor hetty had so much reverence for and faith in the virtues of the bible her intellect was too shallow to enable her fully to appreciate its beauties or to fathom its profound and sometimes mysterious wisdom that instinctive sense of right which appeared to shield her from the commission of wrong and even cast a mantle of moral loveliness and truth around her character could not penetrate abstrusities or trace the nice affinities between cause and effect beyond their more obvious and indisputable connection though she seldom failed to see all the latter and to defer to all their just consequences in a word she was one of those who feel and act correctly without being able to give a logical reason for it even admitting revelation as her authority her selections from the bible therefore were commonly distinguished by the simplicity of her own mind and were oftener marked for containing images of known and palpable things than for any of the higher cast of moral truths with which the pages of that wonderful book aboundwonderful and unequalled even without referring to its divine origin as a work replete with the profoundest philosophy expressed in the noblest language her mother with a connection that will probably strike the reader had been fond of the book of job and hetty had in a great measure learned to read by the frequent lessons she had received from the different chapters of this venerable and sublime poemnow believed to be the oldest book in the world on this occasion the poor girl was submissive to her training and she turned to that well known part of the sacred volume with the readiness with which the practised counsel would cite his authorities from the stores of legal wisdom in selecting the particular chapter she was influenced by the caption and she chose that which stands in our english version as job excuseth his desire of death this she read steadily from beginning to end in a sweet low and plaintive voice hoping devoutly that the allegorical and abstruse sentences might convey to the heart of the sufferer the consolation he needed it is another peculiarity of the comprehensive wisdom of the bible that scarce a chapter unless it be strictly narration can be turned to that does not contain some searching truth that is applicable to the condition of every human heart as well as to the temporal state of its owner either through the workings of that heart or even in a still more direct form in this instance the very opening sentenceis there not an appointed time to man on earth was startling and as hetty proceeded hutter applied or fancied he could apply many aphorisms and figures to his own worldly and mental condition as life is ebbing fast the mind clings eagerly to hope when it is not absolutely crushed by despair the solemn words i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thou preserver of men why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that i am a burden to myself struck hutter more perceptibly than the others and though too obscure for one of his blunted feelings and obtuse mind either to feel or to comprehend in their fullest extent they had a directness of application to his own state that caused him to wince under them  dont you feel better now father asked hetty closing the volume mother was always better when she had read the bible  water returned huttergive me water judith i wonder if my tongue will always be so hot hetty isnt there something in the bible about cooling the tongue of a man who was burning in hell fire  judith turned away shocked but hetty eagerly sought the passage which she read aloud to the conscience stricken victim of his own avaricious longings  thats it poor hetty yes thats it my tongue wants cooling nowwhat will it be hereafter  this appeal silenced even the confiding hetty for she had no answer ready for a confession so fraught with despair water so long as it could relieve the sufferer it was in the power of the sisters to give and from time to time it was offered to the lips of the sufferer as he asked for it even judith prayed as for hetty as soon as she found that her efforts to make her father listen to her texts were no longer rewarded with success she knelt at his side and devoutly repeated the words which the saviour has left behind him as a model for human petitions this she continued to do at intervals as long as it seemed to her that the act could benefit the dying man hutter however lingered longer than the girls had believed possible when they first found him at times he spoke intelligibly though his lips oftener moved in utterance of sounds that carried no distinct impressions to the mind judith listened intently and she heard the wordshusbanddeathpiratelawscalpsand several others of similar import though there was no sentence to tell the precise connection in which they were used still they were sufficiently expressive to be understood by one whose ears had not escaped all the rumours that had been circulated to her reputed fathers discredit and whose comprehension was as quick as her faculties were attentive  during the whole of the painful hour that succeeded neither of the sisters bethought her sufficiently of the hurons to dread their return it seemed as if their desolation and grief placed them above the danger of such an interruption and when the sound of oars was at length heard even judith who alone had any reason to apprehend the enemy did not start but at once understood that the ark was near she went upon the platform fearlessly for should it turn out that hurry was not there and that the hurons were masters of the scow also escape was impossible then she had the sort of confidence that is inspired by extreme misery but there was no cause for any new alarm chingachgook hist and hurry all standing in the open part of the scow cautiously examining the building to make certain of the absence of the enemy they too had seen the departure of the hurons as well as the approach of the canoe of the girls to the castle and presuming on the latter fact march had swept the scow up to the platform a word sufficed to explain that there was nothing to be apprehended and the ark was soon moored in her old berth  judith said not a word concerning the condition of her father but hurry knew her too well not to understand that something was more than usually wrong he led the way though with less of his confident bold manner than usual into the house and penetrating to the inner room found hutter lying on his back with hetty sitting at his side fanning him with pious care the events of the morning had sensibly changed the manner of hurry notwithstanding his skill as a swimmer and the readiness with which he had adopted the only expedient that could possibly save him the helplessness of being in the water bound hand and foot had produced some such effect on him as the near approach of punishment is known to produce on most criminals leaving a vivid impression of the horrors of death upon his mind and this too in connection with a picture of bodily helplessness the daring of this man being far more the offspring of vast physical powers than of the energy of the will or even of natural spirit such heroes invariably lose a large portion of their courage with the failure of their strength and though hurry was now unfettered and as vigorous as ever events were too recent to permit the recollection of his late deplorable condition to be at all weakened had he lived a century the occurrences of the few momentous minutes during which he was in the lake would have produced a chastening effect on his character if not always on his manner  hurry was not only shocked when he found his late associate in this desperate situation but he was greatly surprised during the struggle in the building he had been far too much occupied himself to learn what had befallen his comrade and as no deadly weapon had been used in his particular case but every effort had been made to capture him without injury he naturally believed that hutter had been overcome while he owed his own escape to his great bodily strength and to a fortunate concurrence of extraordinary circumstances death in the silence and solemnity of a chamber was a novelty to him though accustomed to scenes of violence he had been unused to sit by the bedside and watch the slow beating of the pulse as it gradually grew weaker and weaker notwithstanding the change in his feelings the manners of a life could not be altogether cast aside in a moment and the unexpected scene extorted a characteristic speech from the borderer  how now old tom he said have the vagabonds got you at an advantage where youre not only down but are likely to be kept down i thought you a captyve its true but never supposed you so hard run as this  hutter opened his glassy eyes and stared wildly at the speaker a flood of confused recollections rushed on his wavering mind at the sight of his late comrade it was evident that he struggled with his own images and knew not the real from the unreal  who are you he asked in a husky whisper his failing strength refusing to aid him in a louder effort of his voice  who are youyou look like the mate of the snowhe was a giant too and near overcoming us  im your mate floating tom and your comrade but have nothing to do with any snow its summer now and harry march always quits the hills as soon after the frosts set in as is convenient  i know youhurry skurryill sell you a scalpa sound one and of a full grown manwhatll you give  poor tom that scalp business hasnt turned out at all profitable and ive pretty much concluded to give it up and to follow a less bloody calling  have you got any scalp mines gonehow does it feel to have a scalp i know how it feels to lose onefire and flames about the brainand a wrenching at the heartnonokill first hurry and scalp afterwards  what does the old fellow mean judith he talks like one that is getting tired of the business as well as myself why have you bound up his head or have the savages tomahawked him about the brains  they have done that for him which you and he harry march would have so gladly done for them his skin and hair have been torn from his head to gain money from the governor of canada as you would have torn theirs from the heads of the hurons to gain money from the governor of york  judith spoke with a strong effort to appear composed but it was neither in her nature nor in the feeling of the moment to speak altogether without bitterness the strength of her emphasis indeed as well as her manner caused hetty to look up reproachfully  these are high words to come from thomas hutters darter as thomas hutter lies dying before her eyes retorted hurry  god be praised for thatwhatever reproach it may bring on my poor mother i am not thomas hutters daughter  not thomas hutters darterdont disown the old fellow in his last moments judith for thats a sin the lord will never overlook if youre not thomas hutters darter whose darter be you  this question rebuked the rebellious spirit of judith for in getting rid of a parent whom she felt it was a relief to find she might own she had never loved she overlooked the important circumstance that no substitute was ready to supply his place  i cannot tell you harry who my father was she answered more mildly i hope he was an honest man at least  which is more than you think was the case with old hutter well judith ill not deny that hard stories were in circulation consarning floating tom but who is there that doesnt get a scratch when an inimy holds the rake theres them that say hard things of me and even you beauty as you be dont always escape  this was said with a view to set up a species of community of character between the parties and as the politicians are wont to express it with ulterior intentions what might have been the consequences with one of judiths known spirit as well as her assured antipathy to the speaker it is not easy to say for just then hutter gave unequivocal signs that his last moment was nigh judith and hetty had stood by the dying bed of their mother and neither needed a monitor to warn them of the crisis and every sign of resentment vanished from the face of the first hutter opened his eyes and even tried to feel about him with his hands a sign that sight was failing a minute later his breathing grew ghastly a pause totally without respiration followed and then succeeded the last long drawn sigh on which the spirit is supposed to quit the body this sudden termination of the life of one who had hitherto filled so important a place in the narrow scene on which he had been an actor put an end to all discussion  the day passed by without further interruption the hurons though possessed of a canoe appearing so far satisfied with their success as to have relinquished all immediate designs on the castle it would not have been a safe undertaking indeed to approach it under the rifles of those it was now known to contain and it is probable that the truce was more owing to this circumstance than to any other in the mean while the preparations were made for the interment of hutter to bury him on the land was impracticable and it was hettys wish that his body should lie by the side of that of her mother in the lake she had it in her power to quote one of his speeches in which he himself had called the lake the family burying ground and luckily this was done without the knowledge of her sister who would have opposed the plan had she known it with unconquerable disgust but judith had not meddled with the arrangement and every necessary disposition was made without her privity or advice  the hour chosen for the rude ceremony was just as the sun was setting and a moment and a scene more suited to paying the last offices to one of calm and pure spirit could not have been chosen there are a mystery and a solemn dignity in death that dispose the living to regard the remains of even a malefactor with a certain degree of reverence all worldly distinctions have ceased it is thought that the veil has been removed and that the character and destiny of the departed are now as much beyond human opinions as they are beyond human ken in nothing is death more truly a leveller than in this since while it may be impossible absolutely to confound the great with the low the worthy with the unworthy the mind feels it to be arrogant to assume a right to judge of those who are believed to be standing at the judgment seat of god when judith was told that all was ready she went upon the platform passive to the request of her sister and then she first took heed of the arrangement the body was in the scow enveloped in a sheet and quite a hundred weight of stones that had been taken from the fire place were enclosed with it in order that it might sink no other preparation seemed to be thought necessary though hetty carried her bible beneath her arm  when all were on board the ark the singular habitation of the man whose body it now bore to its final abode was set in motion hurry was at the oars in his powerful hands indeed they seemed little more than a pair of sculls which were wielded without effort and as he was expert in their use the delaware remained a passive spectator of the proceedings the progress of the ark had something of the stately solemnity of a funeral procession the dip of the oars being measured and the movement slow and steady the wash of the water as the blades rose and fell kept time with the efforts of hurry and might have been likened to the measured tread of mourners then the tranquil scene was in beautiful accordance with a rite that ever associates with itself the idea of god at that instant the lake had not even a single ripple on its glassy surface and the broad panorama of woods seemed to look down on the holy tranquillity of the hour and ceremony in melancholy stillness judith was affected to tears and even hurry though he hardly knew why was troubled hetty preserved the outward signs of tranquillity but her inward grief greatly surpassed that of her sister since her affectionate heart loved more from habit and long association than from the usual connections of sentiment and taste she was sustained by religious hope however which in her simple mind usually occupied the space that worldly feelings filled in that of judith and she was not without an expectation of witnessing some open manifestation of divine power on an occasion so solemn still she was neither mystical nor exaggerated her mental imbecility denying both nevertheless her thoughts had generally so much of the purity of a better world about them that it was easy for her to forget earth altogether and to think only of heaven hist was serious attentive and interested for she had often seen the interments of the palefaces though never one that promised to be as peculiar as this while the delaware though grave and also observant in his demeanor was stoical and calm  hetty acted as pilot directing hurry how to proceed to find that spot in the lake which she was in the habit of terming mothers grave the reader will remember that the castle stood near the southern extremity of a shoal that extended near half a mile northerly and it was at the farthest end of this shallow water that floating tom had seen fit to deposit the remains of his wife and child his own were now in the course of being placed at their side hetty had marks on the land by which she usually found the spot although the position of the buildings the general direction of the shoal and the beautiful transparency of the water all aided her the latter even allowing the bottom to be seen by these means the girl was enabled to note their progress and at the proper time she approached march whispering now hurry you can stop rowing we have passed the stone on the bottom and mothers grave is near  march ceased his efforts immediately dropping the kedge and taking the warp in his hand in order to check the scow the ark turned slowly round under this restraint and when it was quite stationary hetty was seen at its stern pointing into the water the tears streaming from her eyes in ungovernable natural feeling judith had been present at the interment of her mother but she had never visited the spot since the neglect proceeded from no indifference to the memory of the deceased for she had loved her mother and bitterly had she found occasion to mourn her loss but she was averse to the contemplation of death and there had been passages in her own life since the day of that interment which increased this feeling and rendered her if possible still more reluctant to approach the spot that contained the remains of one whose severe lessons of female morality and propriety had been deepened and rendered doubly impressive by remorse for her own failings with hetty the case had been very different to her simple and innocent mind the remembrance of her mother brought no other feeling than one of gentle sorrow a grief that is so often termed luxurious even because it associates with itself the images of excellence and the purity of a better state of existence for an entire summer she had been in the habit of repairing to the place after nightfall and carefully anchoring her canoe so as not to disturb the body she would sit and hold fancied conversations with the deceased sing sweet hymns to the evening air and repeat the orisons that the being who now slumbered below had taught her in infancy hetty had passed her happiest hours in this indirect communion with the spirit of her mother the wildness of indian traditions and indian opinions unconsciously to herself mingling with the christian lore received in childhood once she had even been so far influenced by the former as to have bethought her of performing some of those physical rites at her mothers grave which the redmen are known to observe but the passing feeling had been obscured by the steady though mild light of christianity which never ceased to burn in her gentle bosom now her emotions were merely the natural outpourings of a daughter that wept for a mother whose love was indelibly impressed on the heart and whose lessons had been too earnestly taught to be easily forgotten by one who had so little temptation to err  there was no other priest than nature at that wild and singular funeral rite march cast his eyes below and through the transparent medium of the clear water which was almost as pure as air he saw what hetty was accustomed to call mothers grave it was a low straggling mound of earth fashioned by no spade out of a corner of which gleamed a bit of the white cloth that formed the shroud of the dead the body had been lowered to the bottom and hutter brought earth from the shore and let it fall upon it until all was concealed in this state the place had remained until the movement of the waters revealed the solitary sign of the uses of the spot that has just been mentioned  even the most rude and brawling are chastened by the ceremonies of a funeral march felt no desire to indulge his voice in any of its coarse outbreakings and was disposed to complete the office he had undertaken in decent sobriety perhaps he reflected on the retribution that had alighted on his late comrade and bethought him of the frightful jeopardy in which his own life had so lately been placed he signified to judith that all was ready received her directions to proceed and with no other assistant than his own vast strength raised the body and bore it to the end of the scow two parts of a rope were passed beneath the legs and shoulders as they are placed beneath coffins and then the corpse was slowly lowered beneath the surface of the lake  not thereharry marchno not there said judith shuddering involuntarily do not lower it quite so near the spot where mother lies  why not judith asked hetty earnestly they lived together in life and should lie together in death  nonoharry march further offfurther off poor hetty you know not what you say leave me to order this  i know i am weakminded judith and that you are cleverbut surely a husband should be placed near a wife mother always said that this was the way they bury in christian churchyards  this little controversy was conducted earnestly but in smothered voices as if the speakers feared that the dead might overhear them judith could not contend with her sister at such a moment but a significant gesture induced march to lower the body at a little distance from that of his wife when he withdrew the cords and the act was performed  theres an end of floating tom exclaimed hurry bending over the scow and gazing through the water at the body he was a brave companion on a scout and a notable hand with traps dont weep judith dont be overcome hetty for the righteousest of us all must die and when the time comes lamentations and tears cant bring the dead to life your father will be a loss to you no doubt most fathers are a loss especially to onmarried darters but theres a way to cure that evil and youre both too young and handsome to live long without finding it out when its agreeable to hear what an honest and onpretending man has to say judith i should like to talk a little with you apart  judith had scarce attended to this rude attempt of hurrys at consolation although she necessarily understood its general drift and had a tolerably accurate notion of its manner she was weeping at the recollection of her mothers early tenderness and painful images of long forgotten lessons and neglected precepts were crowding her mind the words of hurry however recalled her to the present time and abrupt and unseasonable as was their import they did not produce those signs of distaste that one might have expected from the girls character on the contrary she appeared to be struck with some sudden idea gazed intently for a moment at the young man dried her eyes and led the way to the other end of the scow signifying her wish for him to follow here she took a seat and motioned for march to place himself at her side the decision and earnestness with which all this was done a little intimidated her companion and judith found it necessary to open the subject herself  you wish to speak to me of marriage harry march she said and i have come here over the grave of my parents as it might benonoover the grave of my poor dear dear mother to hear what you have to say  this is oncommon and you have a skearful way with you this evening judith answered hurry more disturbed than he would have cared to own but truth is truth and it shall come out let what will follow you well know gal that ive long thought you the comeliest young woman my eyes ever beheld and that ive made no secret of that fact either here on the lake out among the hunters and trappers or in the settlements  yesyes ive heard this before and i suppose it to be true answered judith with a sort of feverish impatience  when a young man holds such language of any particular young woman its reasonable to calculate he sets store by her  truetrue hurryall this youve told me again and again  well if its agreeable i should think a woman coulnt hear it too often they all tell me this is the way with your sex that nothing pleases them more than to repeat over and over for the hundredth time how much you like em unless it be to talk to em of their good looks  no doubtwe like both on most occasions but this is an uncommon moment hurry and vain words should not be too freely used i would rather hear you speak plainly  you shall have your own way judith and i some suspect you always will ive often told you that i not only like you better than any other young woman going or for that matter better than all the young women going but you must have obsarved judith that ive never asked you in up and down tarms to marry me  i have observed both returned the girl a smile struggling about her beautiful mouth in spite of the singular and engrossing intentness which caused her cheeks to flush and lighted her eyes with a brilliancy that was almost dazzlingi have observed both and have thought the last remarkable for a man of harry marchs decision and fearlessness  theres been a reason gal and its one that troubles me even nownay dont flush up so and look fiery like for there are thoughts which will stick long in any mans mind as there be words that will stick in his throatbut then agin theres feelins that will get the better of em all and to these feelins i find i must submit youve no longer a father or a mother judith and its morally unpossible that you and hetty could live here alone allowing it was peace and the iroquois was quiet but as matters stand not only would you starve but youd both be prisoners or scalped afore a week was out its time to think of a change and a husband and if youll accept of me all thats past shall be forgotten and theres an end ont  judith had difficulty in repressing her impatience until this rude declaration and offer were made which she evidently wished to hear and which she now listened to with a willingness that might well have excited hope she hardly allowed the young man to conclude so eager was she to bring him to the point and so ready to answer  therehurrythats enough she said raising a hand as if to stop himi understand you as well as if you were to talk a month you prefer me to other girls and you wish me to become your wife  you put it in better words than i can do judith and i wish you to fancy them said just as you most like to hear em  theyre plain enough harry and tis fitting they should be so this is no place to trifle or deceive in now listen to my answer which shall be in every tittle as sincere as your offer there is a reason march why i should never  i suppose i understand you judith but if im willing to overlook that reason its no ones consarn but minenow dont brighten up like the sky at sundown for no offence is meant and none should be taken  i do not brighten up and will not take offence said judith struggling to repress her indignation in a way she had never found it necessary to exert before there is a reason why i should not cannot ever be your wife hurry that you seem to overlook and which it is my duty now to tell you as plainly as you have asked me to consent to become so i do not and i am certain that i never shall love you well enough to marry you no man can wish for a wife who does not prefer him to all other men and when i tell you this frankly i suppose you yourself will thank me for my sincerity  ah judith them flaunting gay scarletcoated officers of the garrisons have done all this mischief  hush march do not calumniate a daughter over her mothers grave do not when i only wish to treat you fairly give me reason to call for evil on your head in bitterness of heart do not forget that i am a woman and that you are a man and that i have neither father nor brother to revenge your words  well there is something in the last and ill say no more take time judith and think better on this  i want no timemy mind has long been made up and i have only waited for you to speak plainly to answer plainly we now understand each other and there is no use in saying any more  the impetuous earnestness of the girl awed the young man for never before had he seen her so serious and determined in most of their previous interviews she had met his advances with evasion or sarcasm but these hurry had mistaken for female coquetry and had supposed might easily be converted into consent the struggle had been with himself about offering nor had he ever seriously believed it possible that judith would refuse to become the wife of the handsomest man on all that frontier now that the refusal came and that in terms so decided as to put all cavilling out of the question if not absolutely dumbfounded he was so much mortified and surprised as to feel no wish to attempt to change her resolution  the glimmerglass has now no great call for me he exclaimed after a minutes silence old tom is gone the hurons are as plenty on the shore as pigeons in the woods and altogether it is getting to be an onsuitable place  then leave it you see it is surrounded by dangers and there is no reason why you should risk your life for others nor do i know that you can be of any service to us go tonight well never accuse you of having done any thing forgetful or unmanly  if i do go twill be with a heavy heart on your account judith i would rather take you with me  that is not to be spoken of any longer march but i will land you in one of the canoes as soon as it is dark and you can strike a trail for the nearest garrison when you reach the fort if you send a party  judith smothered the words for she felt that it was humiliating to be thus exposing herself to the comments and reflections of one who was not disposed to view her conduct in connection with all in those garrisons with an eye of favor hurry however caught the idea and without perverting it as the girl dreaded he answered to the purpose  i understand what you would say and why you dont say it he replied if i get safe to the fort a party shall start on the trail of these vagabonds and ill come with it myself for i should like to see you and hetty in a place of safety before we part forever  ah harry march had you always spoken thus felt thus my feelings towards you might have been different  is it too late now judith im rough and a woodsman but we all change under different treatment from what we have been used to  it is too late march i can never feel towards you or any other man but one as you would wish to have me there ive said enough surely and you will question me no further as soon as it is dark i or the delaware will put you on the shore you will make the best of your way to the mohawk and the nearest garrison and send all you can to our assistance and hurry we are now friends and i may trust in you may i not  sartain judith though our frindship would have been all the warmer could you look upon me as i look upon you  judith hesitated and some powerful emotion was struggling within her then as if determined to look down all weaknesses and accomplish her purposes at every hazard she spoke more plainly  you will find a captain of the name of warley at the nearest post she said pale as death and even trembling as she spoke i think it likely he will wish to head the party but i would greatly prefer it should be another if captain warley can be kept back t would make me very happy  thats easier said than done judith for these officers do pretty much as they please the major will order and captains and lieutenants and ensigns must obey i know the officer you mean a red faced gay oh be joyful sort of a gentleman who swallows madeira enough to drown the mohawk and yet a pleasant talker all the gals in the valley admire him and they say he admires all the gals i dont wonder he is your dislike judith for hes a very ginral lover if he isnt a ginral officer  judith did not answer though her frame shook and her colour changed from pale to crimson and from crimson back again to the hue of death  alas my poor mother she ejaculated mentally instead of uttering it aloud we are over thy grave but little dost thou know how much thy lessons have been forgotten thy care neglected thy love defeated  as this goading of the worm that never dies was felt she arose and signified to hurry that she had no more to communicate    chapter xxii       that point in misery which makes the oppressed man regardless      of his own life makes him too lord of the oppressors      coleridge remorse vi20104  all this time hetty had remained seated in the head of the scow looking sorrowfully into the water which held the body of her mother as well as that of the man whom she had been taught to consider her father hist stood near her in gentle quiet but had no consolation to offer in words the habits of her people taught her reserve in this respect and the habits of her sex induced her to wait patiently for a moment when she might manifest some soothing sympathy by means of acts rather than of speech chingachgook held himself a little aloof in grave reserve looking like a warrior but feeling like a man  judith joined her sister with an air of dignity and solemnity it was not her practice to show and though the gleamings of anguish were still visible on her beautiful face when she spoke it was firmly and without tremor at that instant hist and the delaware withdrew moving towards hurry in the other end of the boat  sister said judith kindly i have much to say to you we will get into this canoe and paddle off to a distance from the arkthe secrets of two orphans ought not to be heard by every ear  certainly judith by the ears of their parents let hurry lift the grapnel and move away with the ark and leave us here near the graves of father and mother to say what we may have to say  father repeated judith slowly the blood for the first time since her parting with march mounting to her cheekshe was no father of ours hetty that we had from his own mouth and in his dying moments  are you glad judith to find you had no father he took care of us and fed us and clothed us and loved us a father could have done no more i dont understand why he wasnt a father  never mind dear child but let us do as you have said it may be well to remain here and let the ark move a little away do you prepare the canoe and i will tell hurry and the indians our wishes  this was soon and simply done the ark moving with measured strokes of the sweeps a hundred yards from the spot leaving the girls floating seemingly in air above the place of the dead so buoyant was the light vessel that held them and so limpid the element by which it was sustained  the death of thomas hutter judith commenced after a short pause had prepared her sister to receive her communications has altered all our prospects hetty if he was not our father we are sisters and must feel alike and live together  how do i know judith that you wouldnt be as glad to find i am not your sister as you are in finding that thomas hutter as you call him was not your father i am only half witted and few people like to have half witted relations and then im not handsomeat least not as handsome as youand you may wish a handsomer sister  no no hetty you and you only are my sistermy heart and my love for you tell me thatand mother was my motherof that too am i glad and proud for she was a mother to be proud ofbut father was not father  hush judith his spirit may be near it would grieve it to hear his children talking so and that too over his very grave children should never grieve parents mother often told me and especially when they are dead  poor hetty they are happily removed beyond all cares on our account nothing that i can do or say will cause mother any sorrow nowthere is some consolation in that at least and nothing you can say or do will make her smile as she used to smile on your good conduct when living  you dont know that judith spirits can see and mother may see as well as any spirit she always told us that god saw all we did and that we should do nothing to offend him and now she has left us i strive to do nothing that can displease her think how her spirit would mourn and feel sorrow judith did it see either of us doing what is not right and spirits may see after all especially the spirits of parents that feel anxious about their children  hettyhettyyou know not what you say murmured judith almost livid with emotionthe dead cannot see and know nothing of what passes here but we will not talk of this any longer the bodies of mother and thomas hutter lie together in the lake and we will hope that the spirits of both are with god that we the children of one of them remain on earth is certain it is now proper to know what we are to do in future  if we are not thomas hutters children judith no one will dispute our right to his property we have the castle and the ark and the canoes and the woods and the lakes the same as when he was living and what can prevent us from staying here and passing our lives just as we ever have done  no no poor sisterthis can no longer be two girls would not be safe here even should these hurons fail in getting us into their power even father had as much as he could sometimes do to keep peace upon the lake and we should fail altogether we must quit this spot hetty and remove into the settlements  i am sorry you think so judith returned hetty dropping her head on her bosom and looking thoughtfully down at the spot where the funeral pile of her mother could just be seen i am very sorry to hear it i would rather stay here where if i wasnt born ive passed my life i dont like the settlementsthey are full of wickedness and heart burnings while god dwells unoffended in these hills i love the trees and the mountains and the lake and the springs all that his bounty has given us and it would grieve me sorely judith to be forced to quit them you are handsome and not at all halfwitted and one day you will marry and then you will have a husband and i a brother to take care of us if women cant really take care of themselves in such a place as this  ah if this could be so hetty then indeed i could now be a thousand times happier in these woods than in the settlements once i did not feel thus but now i do yet where is the man to turn this beautiful place into such a garden of eden for us  harry march loves you sister returned poor hetty unconsciously picking the bark off the canoe as she spoke he would be glad to be your husband im sure and a stouter and a braver youth is not to be met with the whole country round  harry march and i understand each other and no more need be said about him there is onebut no matter it is all in the hands of providence and we must shortly come to some conclusion about our future manner of living remain herethat is remain here alone we cannotand perhaps no occasion will ever offer for remaining in the manner you think of it is time too hetty we should learn all we can concerning our relations and family it is not probable we are altogether without relations and they may be glad to see us the old chest is now our property and we have a right to look into it and learn all we can by what it holds mother was so very different from thomas hutter that now i know we are not his children i burn with a desire to know whose children we can be there are papers in that chest i am certain and those papers may tell us all about our parents and natural friends  well judith you know best for you are cleverer than common mother always said and i am only halfwitted now father and mother are dead i dont much care for any relation but you and dont think i could love them i never saw as well as i ought if you dont like to marry hurry i dont see who you can choose for a husband and then i fear we shall have to quit the lake after all  what do you think of deerslayer hetty asked judith bending forward like her unsophisticated sister and endeavoring to conceal her embarrassment in a similar manner would he not make a brotherinlaw to your liking  deerslayer repeated the other looking up in unfeigned surprise why judith deerslayer isnt in the least comely and is altogether unfit for one like you  he is not illlooking hetty and beauty in a man is not of much matter  do you think so judith i know that beauty is of no great matter in man or woman in the eyes of god for mother has often told me so when she thought i might have been sorry i was not as handsome as you though she neednt have been uneasy on that account for i never coveted any thing that is yours sisterbut tell me so she didstill beauty is very pleasant to the eye in both i think if i were a man i should pine more for good looks than i do as a girl a handsome man is a more pleasing sight than a handsome woman  poor child you scarce know what you say or what you mean beauty in our sex is something but in men it passes for little to be sure a man ought to be tall but others are tall as well as hurry and activeand i think i know those that are more activeand strong well he hasnt all the strength in the worldand bravei am certain i can name a youth who is braver  this is strange judithi didnt think the earth held a handsomer or a stronger or a more active or a braver man than hurry harry im sure i never met his equal in either of these things  well well hettysay no more of this i dislike to hear you talking in this manner tis not suitable to your innocence and truth and warmhearted sincerity let harry march go he quits us tonight and no regret of mine will follow him unless it be that he has staid so long and to so little purpose  ah judith that is what ive long fearedand i did so hope he might be my brotherinlaw  never mind it now let us talk of our poor motherand of thomas hutter  speak kindly then sister for you cant be quite certain that spirits dont both hear and see if father wasnt father he was good to us and gave us food and shelter we cant put any stones over their graves here in the water to tell people all this and so we ought to say it with our tongues  they will care little for that girl tis a great consolation to know hetty that if mother ever did commit any heavy fault when young she lived sincerely to repent of it no doubt her sins were forgiven her  tisnt right judith for children to talk of their parents sins we had better talk of our own  talk of your sins hettyif there ever was a creature on earth without sin it is you i wish i could say or think the same of myself but we shall see no one knows what changes affection for a good husband can make in a womans heart i dont think child i have even now the same love for finery i once had  it would be a pity judith if you did think of clothes over your parents graves we will never quit this spot if you say so and will let hurry go where he pleases  i am willing enough to consent to the last but cannot answer for the first hetty we must live in future as becomes respectable young women and cannot remain here to be the talk and jest of all the rude and foul tongud trappers and hunters that may come upon the lake let hurry go by himself and then ill find the means to see deerslayer when the future shall be soon settled come girl the sun has set and the ark is drifting away from us let us paddle up to the scow and consult with our friends this night i shall look into the chest and tomorrow shall determine what we are to do as for the hurons now we can use our stores without fear of thomas hutter they will be easily bought off let me get deerslayer once out of their hands and a single hour shall bring things to an understanding  judith spoke with decision and she spoke with authority a habit she had long practised towards her feebleminded sister but while thus accustomed to have her way by the aid of manner and a readier command of words hetty occasionally checked her impetuous feelings and hasty acts by the aid of those simple moral truths that were so deeply engrafted in all her own thoughts and feelings shining through both with a mild and beautiful lustre that threw a sort of holy halo around so much of what she both said and did on the present occasion this healthful ascendancy of the girl of weak intellect over her of a capacity that in other situations might have become brilliant and admired was exhibited in the usual simple and earnest manner  you forget judith what has brought us here she said reproachfully this is mothers grave and we have just laid the body of father by her side we have done wrong to talk so much of ourselves at such a spot and ought now to pray god to forgive us and ask him to teach us where we are to go and what we are to do  judith involuntarily laid aside her paddle while hetty dropped on her knees and was soon lost in her devout but simple petitions her sister did not pray this she had long ceased to do directly though anguish of spirit frequently wrung from her mental and hasty appeals to the great source of benevolence for support if not for a change of spirit still she never beheld hetty on her knees that a feeling of tender recollection as well as of profound regret at the deadness of her own heart did not come over her thus had she herself done in childhood and even down to the hour of her ill fated visits to the garrisons and she would willingly have given worlds at such moments to be able to exchange her present sensations for the confiding faith those pure aspirations and the gentle hope that shone through every lineament and movement of her otherwise less favored sister all she could do however was to drop her head to her bosom and assume in her attitude some of that devotion in which her stubborn spirit refused to unite when hetty rose from her knees her countenance had a glow and serenity that rendered a face that was always agreeable positively handsome her mind was at peace and her conscience acquitted her of a neglect of duty  now you may go if you want to judith she said for god has been kind to me and lifted a burden off my heart mother had many such burdens she used to tell me and she always took them off in this way tis the only way sister such things can be done you may raise a stone or a log with your hands but the heart must be lightened by prayer i dont think you pray as often as you used to do when younger judith  never mindnever mind child answered the other huskily tis no matter now mother is gone and thomas hutter is gone and the time has come when we must think and act for ourselves  as the canoe moved slowly away from the place under the gentle impulsion of the elder sisters paddle the younger sat musing as was her wont whenever her mind was perplexed by any idea more abstract and difficult of comprehension than common  i dont know what you mean by future judith she at length suddenly observed mother used to call heaven the future but you seem to think it means next week or tomorrow  it means both dear sisterevery thing that is yet to come whether in this world or another it is a solemn word hetty and most so i fear to them that think the least about it mothers future is eternity ours may yet mean what will happen while we live in this worldis not that a canoe just passing behind the castlehere more in the direction of the point i mean it is hid now but certainly i saw a canoe stealing behind the logs  ive seen it some time hetty quietly answered for the indians had few terrors for her but i didnt think it right to talk about such things over mothers grave the canoe came from the camp judith and was paddled by a single man he seemed to be deerslayer and no iroquois  deerslayer returned the other with much of her native impetuositythat cannot be deerslayer is a prisoner and i have been thinking of the means of setting him free why did you fancy it deerslayer child  you can look for yourself sister for there comes the canoe in sight again on this side of the hut  sure enough the light boat had passed the building and was now steadily advancing towards the ark the persons on board of which were already collecting in the head of the scow to receive their visitor a single glance sufficed to assure judith that her sister was right and that deerslayer was alone in the canoe his approach was so calm and leisurely however as to fill her with wonder since a man who had effected his escape from enemies by either artifice or violence would not be apt to move with the steadiness and deliberation with which his paddle swept the water by this time the day was fairly departing and objects were already seen dimly under the shores in the broad lake however the light still lingered and around the immediate scene of the present incidents which was less shaded than most of the sheet being in its broadest part it cast a glow that bore some faint resemblance to the warm tints of an italian or grecian sunset the logs of the hut and ark had a sort of purple hue blended with the growing obscurity and the bark of the hunters boat was losing its distinctness in colours richer but more mellowed than those it showed under a bright sun as the two canoes approached each otherfor judith and her sister had plied their paddles so as to intercept the unexpected visiter ere he reached the arkeven deerslayers sunburned countenance wore a brighter aspect than common under the pleasing tints that seemed to dance in the atmosphere judith fancied that delight at meeting her had some share in this unusual and agreeable expression she was not aware that her own beauty appeared to more advantage than common from the same natural cause nor did she understand what it would have given her so much pleasure to know that the young man actually thought her as she drew nearer the loveliest creature of her sex his eyes had ever dwelt on  welcomewelcome deerslayer exclaimed the girl as the canoes floated at each others side we have had a melancholya frightful daybut your return is at least one misfortune the less have the hurons become more human and let you go or have you escaped from the wretches by your own courage and skill  neither judithneither one nor tother the mingos are mingos still and will live and die mingos it is not likely their naturs will ever undergo much improvement well theyve their gifts and weve ourn judith and it doesnt much become either to speak ill of what the lord has created though if the truth must be said i find it a sore trial to think kindly or to talk kindly of them vagabonds as for outwitting them that might have been done and it was done too atween the sarpent yonder and me when we were on the trail of hist here the hunter stopped to laugh in his own silent fashionbut its no easy matter to sarcumvent the sarcumvented even the faans get to know the tricks of the hunters afore a single season is over and an indian whose eyes have once been opened by a sarcumvention never shuts them agin in precisely the same spot ive known whites to do that but never a redskin what they larn comes by practice and not by books and of all schoolmasters experence gives lessons that are the longest remembered  all this is true deerslayer but if you have not escaped from the savages how came you here  thats a natral question and charmingly put you are wonderful handsome this evening judith or wild rose as the sarpent calls you and i may as well say it since i honestly think it you may well call them mingos savages too for savage enough do they feel and savage enough will they act if you once give them an opportunity they feel their loss here in the late skrimmage to their hearts cores and are ready to revenge it on any creatur of english blood that may fall in their way nor for that matter do i much think they would stand at taking their satisfaction out of a dutch man  they have killed father that ought to satisfy their wicked cravings for blood observed hetty reproachfully  i know it gali know the whole storypartly from what ive seen from the shore since they brought me up from the point and partly from their threats agin myself and their other discourse well life is unsartain at the best and we all depend on the breath of our nostrils for it from day to day if youve lost a staunch frind as i make no doubt you have providence will raise up new ones in his stead and since our acquaintance has begun in this oncommon manner i shall take it as a hint that it will be a part of my duty in futur should the occasion offer to see you dont suffer for want of food in the wigwam i cant bring the dead to life but as to feeding the living theres few on all this frontier can outdo me though i say it in the way of pity and consolation like and in no particular in the way of boasting  we understand you deerslayer returned judith hastily and take all that falls from your lips as it is meant in kindness and friendship would to heaven all men had tongues as true and hearts as honest  in that respect men do differ of a sartainty judith ive known them that wasnt to be trusted any farther than you can see them and others agin whose messages sent with a small piece of wampum perhaps might just as much be depended on as if the whole business was finished afore your face yes judith you never said truer word than when you said some men might be depended on and other some might not  you are an unaccountable being deerslayer returned the girl not a little puzzled with the childish simplicity of character that the hunter so often betrayeda simplicity so striking that it frequently appeared to place him nearly on a level with the fatuity of poor hetty though always relieved by the beautiful moral truth that shone through all that this unfortunate girl both said and didyou are a most unaccountable man and i often do not know how to understand you but never mind just now you have forgotten to tell us by what means you are here  ioh thats not very onaccountable if i am myself judith im out on furlough  furloughthat word has a meaning among the soldiers that i understand but i cannot tell what it signifies when used by a prisoner  it means just the same youre right enough the soldiers do use it and just in the same way as i use it a furlough is when a man has leave to quit a camp or a garrison for a sartain specified time at the end of which he is to come back and shoulder his musket or submit to his torments just as he may happen to be a soldier or a captyve being the last i must take the chances of a prisoner  have the hurons suffered you to quit them in this manner without watch or guard  sartaini woulnt have come in any other manner unless indeed it had been by a bold rising or a sarcumvention  what pledge have they that you will ever return  my word answered the hunter simply yes i own i gave em that and big fools would they have been to let me come without it why in that case i shouldnt have been obliged to go back and ondergo any deviltries their fury may invent but might have shouldered my rifle and made the best of my way to the delaware villages but lord judith they knowd this just as well as you and i do and would no more let me come away without a promise to go back than they would let the wolves dig up the bones of their fathers  is it possible you mean to do this act of extraordinary selfdestruction and recklessness  anan  i ask if it can be possible that you expect to be able to put yourself again in the power of such ruthless enemies by keeping your word  deerslayer looked at his fair questioner for a moment with stern displeasure then the expression of his honest and guileless face suddenly changed lighting as by a quick illumination of thought after which he laughed in his ordinary manner  i didnt understand you at first judith no i didnt you believe that chingachgook and hurry harry wont suffer it but you dont know mankind thoroughly yet i see the delaware would be the last man on arth to offer any objections to what he knows is a duty and as for march he doesnt care enough about any creatur but himself to spend many words on such a subject if he did twould make no great difference howsever but not he for he thinks more of his gains than of even his own word as for my promises or yourn judith or any body elses they give him no consarn dont be under any oneasiness therefore gal i shall be allowed to go back according to the furlough and if difficulties was made ive not been brought up and edicated as one may say in the woods without knowing how to look em down  judith made no answer for some little time all her feelings as a woman and as a woman who for the first time in her life was beginning to submit to that sentiment which has so much influence on the happiness or misery of her sex revolted at the cruel fate that she fancied deerslayer was drawing down upon himself while the sense of right which god has implanted in every human breast told her to admire an integrity as indomitable and as unpretending as that which the other so unconsciously displayed argument she felt would be useless nor was she at that moment disposed to lessen the dignity and high principle that were so striking in the intentions of the hunter by any attempt to turn him from his purpose that something might yet occur to supersede the necessity for this self immolation she tried to hope and then she proceeded to ascertain the facts in order that her own conduct might be regulated by her knowledge of circumstances  when is your furlough out deerslayer she asked after both canoes were heading towards the ark and moving with scarcely a perceptible effort of the paddles through the water  tomorrow noon not a minute afore and you may depend on it judith i shant quit what i call christian company to go and give myself up to them vagabonds an instant sooner than is downright necessary they begin to fear a visit from the garrisons and wouldnt lengthen the time a moment and its pretty well understood atween us that should i fail in my arnd the torments are to take place when the sun begins to fall that they may strike upon their home trail as soon as it is dark  this was said solemnly as if the thought of what was believed to be in reserve duly weighed on the prisoners mind and yet so simply and without a parade of suffering as rather to repel than to invite any open manifestations of sympathy  are they bent on revenging their losses judith asked faintly her own high spirit yielding to the influence of the others quiet but dignified integrity of purpose  downright if i can judge of indian inclinations by the symptoms they think howsever i dont suspect their designs i do believe but one that has lived so long among men of redskin gifts is no more likely to be misled in injin feelins than a true hunter is like to lose his trail or a stanch hound his scent my own judgment is greatly agin my own escape for i see the women are a good deal enraged on behalf of hist though i say it perhaps that shouldnt say it seein that i had a considerable hand myself in getting the gal off then there was a cruel murder in their camp last night and that shot might just as well have been fired into my breast howsever come what will the sarpent and his wife will be safe and that is some happiness in any case  oh deerslayer they will think better of this since they have given you until tomorrow noon to make up your mind  i judge not judith yes i judge not an injin is an injin gal and its pretty much hopeless to think of swarving him when hes got the scent and follows it with his nose in the air the delawares now are a half christianized tribenot that i think such sort of christians much better than your whole blooded onbelieversbut nevertheless what good half christianizing can do to a man some among em have got and yet revenge clings to their hearts like the wild creepers here to the tree then i slew one of the best and boldest of their warriors they say and it is too much to expect that they should captivate the man who did this deed in the very same scouting on which it was performed and they take no account of the matter had a month or so gone by their feelins would have been softened down and we might have met in a more friendly way but it is as it is judith this is talking of nothing but myself and my own consarns when you have had trouble enough and may want to consult a frind a little about your own matters is the old man laid in the water where i should think his body would like to rest  it is deerslayer answered judith almost inaudibly that duty has just been performed you are right in thinking that i wish to consult a friend and that friend is yourself hurry harry is about to leave us when he is gone and we have got a little over the feelings of this solemn office i hope you will give me an hour alone hetty and i are at a loss what to do  thats quite natral coming as things have suddenly and fearfully but heres the ark and well say more of this when there is a better opportunity    chapter xxiii       the winde is great upon the highest hilles     the quiet life is in the dale below     who tread on ice shall slide against their willes     they want not cares that curious arts should know     who lives at ease and can content him so     is perfect wise and sets us all to schoole     who hates this lore may well be called a foole      thomas churchyard shores wife xlvii  the meeting between deerslayer and his friends in the ark was grave and anxious the two indians in particular read in his manner that he was not a successful fugitive and a few sententious words sufficed to let them comprehend the nature of what their friend had termed his furlough chingachgook immediately became thoughtful while hist as usual had no better mode of expressing her sympathy than by those little attentions which mark the affectionate manner of woman  in a few minutes however something like a general plan for the proceedings of the night was adopted and to the eye of an uninstructed observer things would be thought to move in their ordinary train it was now getting to be dark and it was decided to sweep the ark up to the castle and secure it in its ordinary berth this decision was come to in some measure on account of the fact that all the canoes were again in the possession of their proper owners but principally from the security that was created by the representations of deerslayer he had examined the state of things among the hurons and felt satisfied that they meditated no further hostilities during the night the loss they had met having indisposed them to further exertions for the moment then he had a proposition to make the object of his visit and if this were accepted the war would at once terminate between the parties and it was improbable that the hurons would anticipate the failure of a project on which their chiefs had apparently set their hearts by having recourse to violence previously to the return of their messenger as soon as the ark was properly secured the different members of the party occupied themselves in their several peculiar manners haste in council or in decision no more characterizing the proceedings of these border whites than it did those of their red neighbors the women busied themselves in preparations for the evening meal sad and silent but ever attentive to the first wants of nature hurry set about repairing his moccasins by the light of a blazing knot chingachgook seated himself in gloomy thought while deerslayer proceeded in a manner equally free from affectation and concern to examine killdeer the rifle of hutter that has been already mentioned and which subsequently became so celebrated in the hands of the individual who was now making a survey of its merits the piece was a little longer than usual and had evidently been turned out from the work shops of some manufacturer of a superior order it had a few silver ornaments though on the whole it would have been deemed a plain piece by most frontier men its great merit consisting in the accuracy of its bore the perfection of the details and the excellence of the metal again and again did the hunter apply the breech to his shoulder and glance his eye along the sights and as often did he poise his body and raise the weapon slowly as if about to catch an aim at a deer in order to try the weight and to ascertain its fitness for quick and accurate firing all this was done by the aid of hurrys torch simply but with an earnestness and abstraction that would have been found touching by any spectator who happened to know the real situation of the man  tis a glorious wepon hurry deerslayer at length exclaimed and it may be thought a pity that it has fallen into the hands of women the hunters have told me of its explites and by all i have heard i should set it down as sartain death in experenced hands hearken to the tick of this locka wolf trap hasnt a livelier spring pan and cock speak together like two singing masters undertaking a psalm in meetin i never did see so true a bore hurry thats sartain  ay old tom used to give the piece a character though he wasnt the man to particularize the raal natur of any sort of fire arms in practise returned march passing the deers thongs through the moccasin with the coolness of a cobbler he was no marksman that we must all allow but he had his good pints as well as his bad ones i have had hopes that judith might consait the idee of giving killdeer to me  theres no saying what young women may do thats a truth hurry and i suppose youre as likely to own the rifle as another still when things are so very near perfection its a pity not to reach it entirely  what do you mean by thatwould not that piece look as well on my shoulder as on any mans  as for looks i say nothing you are both goodlooking and might make what is called a goodlooking couple but the true pint is as to conduct more deer would fall in one day by that piece in some mans hands than would fall in a week in yourn hurry ive seen you try yes remember the buck tother day  that buck was out of season and who wishes to kill venison out of season i was merely trying to frighten the creatur and i think you will own that he was pretty well skeared at any rate  well well have it as you say but this is a lordly piece and would make a steady hand and quick eye the king of the woods  then keep it deerslayer and become king of the woods said judith earnestly who had heard the conversation and whose eye was never long averted from the honest countenance of the hunter it can never be in better hands than it is at this moment and there i hope it will remain these fifty years  judith you cant be in arnest exclaimed deerslayer taken so much by surprise as to betray more emotion than it was usual for him to manifest on ordinary occasions such a gift would be fit for a raal king to make yes and for a raal king to receive  i never was more in earnest in my life deerslayer and i am as much in earnest in the wish as in the gift  well gal well well find time to talk of this agin you mustnt be down hearted hurry for judith is a sprightly young woman and she has a quick reason she knows that the credit of her fathers rifle is safer in my hands than it can possibly be in yourn and therefore you mustnt be down hearted in other matters more to your liking too youll find shell give you the preference  hurry growled out his dissatisfaction but he was too intent on quitting the lake and in making his preparations to waste his breath on a subject of this nature shortly after the supper was ready and it was eaten in silence as is so much the habit of those who consider the table as merely a place of animal refreshment on this occasion however sadness and thought contributed their share to the general desire not to converse for deerslayer was so far an exception to the usages of men of his cast as not only to wish to hold discourse on such occasions but as often to create a similar desire in his companions  the meal ended and the humble preparations removed the whole party assembled on the platform to hear the expected intelligence from deerslayer on the subject of his visit it had been evident he was in no haste to make his communication but the feelings of judith would no longer admit of delay stools were brought from the ark and the hut and the whole six placed themselves in a circle near the door watching each others countenances as best they could by the scanty means that were furnished by a lovely starlight night along the shores beneath the mountains lay the usual body of gloom but in the broad lake no shadow was cast and a thousand mimic stars were dancing in the limpid element that was just stirred enough by the evening air to set them all in motion  now deerslayer commenced judith whose impatience resisted further restraintnow deerslayer tell us all the hurons have to say and the reason why they have sent you on parole to make us some offer  furlough judith furlough is the word and it carries the same meaning with a captyve at large as it does with a soldier who has leave to quit his colors in both cases the word is passed to come back and now i remember to have heard thats the raal signification furlough meaning a word passed for the doing of any thing of the like parole i rather think is dutch and has something to do with the tattoos of the garrisons but this makes no great difference since the vartue of a pledge lies in the idee and not in the word well then if the message must be given it must and perhaps there is no use in putting it off hurry will soon be wanting to set out on his journey to the river and the stars rise and set just as if they cared for neither injin nor message ahs me tisnt a pleasant and i know its a useless arnd but it must be told  harkee deerslayer put in hurry a little authoritativelyyoure a sensible man in a hunt and as good a fellow on a march as a sixtymileraday could wish to meet with but youre oncommon slow about messages especially them that you think wont be likely to be well received when a thing is to be told why tell it and dont hang back like a yankee lawyer pretending he cant understand a dutchmans english just to get a double fee out of him  i understand you hurry and well are you named tonight seeing youve no time to lose but let us come at once to the pint seeing thats the object of this councilfor council it may be called though women have seats among us the simple fact is this when the party came back from the castle the mingos held a council and bitter thoughts were uppermost as was plain to be seen by their gloomy faces no one likes to be beaten and a redskin as little as a paleface well when they had smoked upon it and made their speeches and their council fire had burnt low the matter came out it seems the elders among em consaited i was a man to be trusted on a furloughtheyre wonderful obsarvant them mingos that their worst mimics must allowbut they consaited i was such a man and it isnt often added the hunter with a pleasing consciousness that his previous life justified this implicit reliance on his good faithit isnt often they consait any thing so good of a paleface but so they did with me and therefore they didnt hesitate to speak their minds which is just this you see the state of things the lake and all on it they fancy lie at their marcy thomas hutter is deceased and as for hurry theyve got the idee he has been near enough to death today not to wish to take another look at him this summer therefore they account all your forces as reduced to chingachgook and the two young women and while they know the delaware to be of a high race and a born warrior they know hes now on his first war path as for the gals of course they set them down much as they do women in ginral  you mean that they despise us interrupted judith with eyes that flashed so brightly as to be observed by all present  that will be seen in the end they hold that all on the lake lies at their marcy and therefore they send by me this belt of wampum showing the article in question to the delaware as he spoke with these words tell the sarpent they say that he has done well for a beginner he may now strike across the mountains for his own villages and no one shall look for his trail if he has found a scalp let him take it with him for the huron braves have hearts and can feel for a young warrior who doesnt wish to go home emptyhanded if he is nimble he is welcome to lead out a party in pursuit hist howsever must go back to the hurons for when she left there in the night she carried away by mistake that which doesnt belong to her  that cant be true said hetty earnestly hist is no such girl but one that gives every body his due  how much more she would have said in remonstrance cannot be known inasmuch as hist partly laughing and partly hiding her face in shame passed her own hand across the speakers mouth in a way to check the words  you dont understand mingo messages poor hetty resumed deerslayer which seldom mean what lies exactly uppermost hist has brought away with her the inclinations of a young huron and they want her back again that the poor young man may find them where he last saw them the sarpent they say is too promising a young warrior not to find as many wives as he wants but this one he cannot have thats their meaning and nothing else as i understand it  they are very obliging and thoughtful in supposing a young woman can forget all her own inclinations in order to let this unhappy youth find his said judith ironically though her manner became more bitter as she proceeded i suppose a woman is a woman let her colour be white or red and your chiefs know little of a womans heart deerslayer if they think it can ever forgive when wronged or ever forget when it fairly loves  i suppose thats pretty much the truth with some women judith though ive known them that could do both the next message is to you they say the muskrat as they called your father has dove to the bottom of the lake that he will never come up again and that his young will soon be in want of wigwams if not of food the huron huts they think are better than the huts of york and they wish you to come and try them your colour is white they own but they think young women whove lived so long in the woods would lose their way in the clearins a great warrior among them has lately lost his wife and he would be glad to put the wild rose on her bench at his fireside as for the feeble mind she will always be honored and taken care of by red warriors your fathers goods they think ought to go to enrich the tribe but your own property which is to include everything of a female natur will go like that of all wives into the wigwam of the husband moreover theyve lost a young maiden by violence lately and twill take two palefaces to fill her seat  and do you bring such a message to me exclaimed judith though the tone in which the words were uttered had more in it of sorrow than of anger am i a girl to be an indians slave  if you wish my honest thoughts on this pint judith i shall answer that i dont think youll willingly ever become any mans slave redskin or white youre not to think hard howsever of my bringing the message as near as i could in the very words in which it was given to me them was the conditions on which i got my furlough and a bargain is a bargain though it is made with a vagabond ive told you what theyve said but ive not yet told you what i think you ought one and all to answer  ay lets hear that deerslayer put in hurry my curosity is up on that consideration and i should like right well to hear your idees of the reasonableness of the reply for my part though my own mind is pretty much settled on the pint of my own answer which shall be made known as soon as necessary  and so is mine hurry on all the different heads and on no one is it more sartainly settled that on yourn if i was you i should saydeerslayer tell them scamps they dont know harry march he is human and having a white skin he has also a white natur which natur wont let him desart females of his own race and gifts in their greatest need so set me down as one that will refuse to come into your treaty though you should smoke a hogshead of tobacco over it  march was a little embarrassed at this rebuke which was uttered with sufficient warmth of manner and with a point that left no doubt of the meaning had judith encouraged him he would not have hesitated about remaining to defend her and her sister but under the circumstances a feeling of resentment rather urged him to abandon them at all events there was not a sufficiency of chivalry in hurry harry to induce him to hazard the safety of his own person unless he could see a direct connection between the probable consequences and his own interests it is no wonder therefore that his answer partook equally of his intention and of the reliance he so boastingly placed on his gigantic strength which if it did not always make him outrageous usually made him impudent as respects those with whom he conversed  fair words make long friendships master deerslayer he said a little menacingly youre but a stripling and you know by experence what you are in the hands of a man as youre not me but only a go between sent by the savages to us christians you may tell your emplyers that they do know harry march which is a proof of their sense as well as his hes human enough to follow human natur and that tells him to see the folly of one mans fighting a whole tribe if females desart him they must expect to be desarted by him whether theyre of his own gifts or another mans gifts should judith see fit to change her mind shes welcome to my company to the river and hetty with her but shouldnt she come to this conclusion i start as soon as i think the enemys scouts are beginning to nestle themselves in among the brush and leaves for the night  judith will not change her mind and she does not ask your company master march returned the girl with spirit  that pints settled then resumed deerslayer unmoved by the others warmth hurry harry must act for himself and do that which will be most likely to suit his own fancy the course he means to take will give him an easy race if it dont give him an easy conscience next comes the question with histwhat say you galwill you desart your duty too and go back to the mingos and take a huron husband and all not for the love of the man youre to marry but for the love of your own scalp  why you talk so to hist demanded the girl halfoffended you tink a redskin girl made like captains lady to laugh and joke with any officer that come  what i think hist is neither here nor there in this matter i must carry back your answer and in order to do so it is necessary that you should send it a faithful messenger gives his arnd word for word  hist no longer hesitated to speak her mind fully in the excitement she rose from her bench and naturally recurring to that language in which she expressed herself the most readily she delivered her thoughts and intentions beautifully and with dignity in the tongue of her own people  tell the hurons deerslayer she said that they are as ignorant as moles they dont know the wolf from the dog among my people the rose dies on the stem where it budded the tears of the child fall on the graves of its parents the corn grows where the seed has been planted the delaware girls are not messengers to be sent like belts of wampum from tribe to tribe they are honeysuckles that are sweetest in their own woods their own young men carry them away in their bosoms because they are fragrant they are sweetest when plucked from their native stems even the robin and the martin come back year after year to their old nests shall a woman be less true hearted than a bird set the pine in the clay and it will turn yellow the willow will not flourish on the hill the tamarack is healthiest in the swamp the tribes of the sea love best to hear the winds that blow over the salt water as for a huron youth what is he to a maiden of the lenni lenape he may be fleet but her eyes do not follow him in the race they look back towards the lodges of the delawares he may sing a sweet song for the girls of canada but there is no music for wah but in the tongue she has listened to from childhood were the huron born of the people that once owned the shores of the salt lake it would be in vain unless he were of the family of uncas the young pine will rise to be as high as any of its fathers wahtawah has but one heart and it can love but one husband  deerslayer listened to this characteristic message which was given with an earnestness suited to the feelings from which it sprung with undisguised delight meeting the ardent eloquence of the girl as she concluded with one of his own heartfelt silent and peculiar fits of laughter  thats worth all the wampum in the woods he exclaimed you dont understand it i suppose judith but if youll look into your feelins and fancy that an inimy had sent to tell you to give up the man of your chice and to take up with another that wasnt the man of your chice youll get the substance of it ill warrant give me a woman for raal eloquence if theyll only make up their minds to speak what they feel by speakin i dont mean chatterin howsever for most of them will do that by the hour but comm out with their honest deepest feelins in proper words and now judith having got the answer of a redskin girl it is fit i should get that of a paleface if indeed a countenance that is as blooming as yourn can in any wise so be tarmed you are well named the wild rose and so far as colour goes hetty ought to be called the honeysuckle  did this language come from one of the garrison gallants i should deride it deerslayer but coming from you i know it can be depended on returned judith deeply gratified by his unmeditated and characteristic compliments it is too soon however to ask my answer the great serpent has not yet spoken  the sarpent lord i could carry back his speech without hearing a word of it i didnt think of putting the question to him at all i will allow though twould be hardly right either seeing that truth is truth and im bound to tell these mingos the fact and nothing else so chingachgook let us hear your mind on this matterare you inclined to strike across the hills towards your village to give up hist to a huron and to tell the chiefs at home that if theyre actyve and successful they may possibly get on the end of the iroquois trail some two or three days ater the inimy has got off of it  like his betrothed the young chief arose that his answer might be given with due distinctness and dignity hist had spoken with her hands crossed upon her bosom as if to suppress the emotions within but the warrior stretched an arm before him with a calm energy that aided in giving emphasis to his expressions wampum should be sent for wampum he said a message must be answered by a message hear what the great serpent of the delawares has to say to the pretended wolves from the great lakes that are howling through our woods they are no wolves they are dogs that have come to get their tails and ears cropped by the hands of the delawares they are good at stealing young women bad at keeping them chingachgook takes his own where he finds it he asks leave of no cur from the canadas if he has a tender feeling in his heart it is no business of the hurons he tells it to her who most likes to know it he will not bellow it in the forest for the ears of those that only understand yells of terror what passes in his lodge is not for the chiefs of his own people to know still less for mingo rogues  call em vagabonds sarpent interrupted deerslayer unable to restrain his delightyes just call em upanddown vagabonds which is a word easily intarpreted and the most hateful of all to their ears its so true never fear me ill give em your message syllable for syllable sneer for sneer idee for idee scorn for scorn and they desarve no better at your handsonly call em vagabonds once or twice and that will set the sap mounting in em from their lowest roots to the uppermost branches  still less for mingo vagabonds resumed chingachgook quite willingly complying with his friends request tell the huron dogs to howl louder if they wish a delaware to find them in the woods where they burrow like foxes instead of hunting like warriors when they had a delaware maiden in their camp there was a reason for hunting them up now they will be forgotten unless they make a noise chingachgook dont like the trouble of going to his villages for more warriors he can strike their runaway trail unless they hide it under ground he will follow it to canada alone he will keep wahtawah with him to cook his game they two will be delawares enough to scare all the hurons back to their own country  thats a grand despatch as the officers call them things cried deerslayer twill set all the huron blood in motion most particularily that part where he tells em hist too will keep on their heels til theyre fairly driven out of the country ahs me big words aint always big deeds notwithstanding the lord send that we be able to be only one half as good as we promise to be and now judith its your turn to speak for them miscreants will expect an answer from each person poor hetty perhaps excepted  and why not hetty deerslayer she often speaks to the purpose the indians may respect her words for they feel for people in her condition  that is true judith and quickthoughted in you the redskins do respect misfortunes of all kinds and hettys in particular so hetty if you have any thing to say ill carry it to the hurons as faithfully as if it was spoken by a schoolmaster or a missionary  the girl hesitated a moment and then she answered in her own gentle soft tones as earnestly as any who had preceded her  the hurons cant understand the difference between white people and themselves she said or they wouldnt ask judith and me to go and live in their villages god has given one country to the red men and another to us he meant us to live apart then mother always said that we should never dwell with any but christians if possible and that is a reason why we cant go this lake is ours and we wont leave it father and mothers graves are in it and even the worst indians love to stay near the graves of their fathers i will come and see them again if they wish me to and read more out of the bible to them but i cant quit fathers and mothers graves  that will dothat will do hetty just as well as if you sent them a message twice as long interrupted the hunter ill tell em all youve said and all you mean and ill answer for it that theyll be easily satisfied now judith your turn comes next and then this part of my arnd will be tarminated for the night  judith manifested a reluctance to give her reply that had awakened a little curiosity in the messenger judging from her known spirit he had never supposed the girl would be less true her feelings and principles than hist or hetty and yet there was a visible wavering of purpose that rendered him slightly uneasy even now when directly required to speak she seemed to hesitate nor did she open her lips until the profound silence told her how anxiously her words were expected then indeed she spoke but it was doubtingly and with reluctance  tell me firsttell us first deerslayer she commenced repeating the words merely to change the emphasiswhat effect will our answers have on your fate if you are to be the sacrifice of our spirit it would have been better had we all been more wary as to the language we use what then are likely to be the consequences to yourself  lord judith you might as well ask me which way the wind will blow next week or what will be the age of the next deer that will be shot i can only say that their faces look a little dark upon me but it doesnt thunder every time a black cloud rises nor does every puff of wind blow up rain thats a question therefore much more easily put than answered  so is this message of the iroquois to me answered judith rising as if she had determined on her own course for the present my answer shall be given deerslayer after you and i have talked together alone when the others have laid themselves down for the night  there was a decision in the manner of the girl that disposed deerslayer to comply and this he did the more readily as the delay could produce no material consequences one way or the other the meeting now broke up hurry announcing his resolution to leave them speedily during the hour that was suffered to intervene in order that the darkness might deepen before the frontierman took his departure the different individuals occupied themselves in their customary modes the hunter in particular passing most of the time in making further enquiries into the perfection of the rifle already mentioned  the hour of nine soon arrived however and then it had been determined that hurry should commence his journey instead of making his adieus frankly and in a generous spirit the little he thought it necessary to say was uttered sullenly and in coldness resentment at what he considered judiths obstinacy was blended with mortification at the career he had since reaching the lake and as is usual with the vulgar and narrowminded he was more disposed to reproach others with his failures than to censure himself judith gave him her hand but it was quite as much in gladness as with regret while the two delawares were not sorry to find he was leaving them of the whole party hetty alone betrayed any real feeling bashfulness and the timidity of her sex and character kept even her aloof so that hurry entered the canoe where deerslayer was already waiting for him before she ventured near enough to be observed then indeed the girl came into the ark and approached its end just as the little bark was turning from it with a movement so light and steady as to be almost imperceptible an impulse of feeling now overcame her timidity and hetty spoke  goodbye hurry she called out in her sweet voicegoodbye dear hurry take care of yourself in the woods and dont stop once til you reach the garrison the leaves on the trees are scarcely plentier than the hurons round the lake and theyll not treat a strong man like you as kindly as they treat me  the ascendency which march had obtained over this feebleminded but rightthinking and rightfeeling girl arose from a law of nature her senses had been captivated by his personal advantages and her moral communications with him had never been sufficiently intimate to counteract an effect that must have been otherwise lessened even with one whose mind was as obtuse as her own hettys instinct of right if such a term can be applied to one who seemed taught by some kind spirit how to steer her course with unerring accuracy between good and evil would have revolted at hurrys character on a thousand points had there been opportunities to enlighten her but while he conversed and trifled with her sister at a distance from herself his perfection of form and feature had been left to produce their influence on her simple imagination and naturally tender feelings without suffering by the alloy of his opinions and coarseness it is true she found him rough and rude but her father was that and most of the other men she had seen and that which she believed to belong to all of the sex struck her less unfavorably in hurrys character than it might otherwise have done still it was not absolutely love that hetty felt for hurry nor do we wish so to portray it but merely that awakening sensibility and admiration which under more propitious circumstances and always supposing no untoward revelations of character on the part of the young man had supervened to prevent it might soon have ripened into that engrossing feeling she felt for him an incipient tenderness but scarcely any passion perhaps the nearest approach to the latter that hetty had manifested was to be seen in the sensitiveness which had caused her to detect marchs predilection for her sister for among judiths many admirers this was the only instance in which the dull mind of the girl had been quickened into an observation of the circumstances  hurry received so little sympathy at his departure that the gentle tones of hetty as she thus called after him sounded soothingly he checked the canoe and with one sweep of his powerful arm brought it back to the side of the ark this was more than hetty whose courage had risen with the departure of her hero expected and she now shrunk timidly back at this unexpected return  youre a good gal hetty and i cant quit you without shaking hands said march kindly judith ater all isnt worth as much as you though she may be a trifle better looking as to wits if honesty and fair dealing with a young man is a sign of sense in a young woman youre worth a dozen judiths ay and for that matter most young women of my acquaintance  dont say any thing against judith harry returned hetty imploringly fathers gone and mothers gone and nobodys left but judith and me and it isnt right for sisters to speak evil or to hear evil of each other fathers in the lake and so is mother and we should all fear god for we dont know when we may be in the lake too  that sounds reasonable child as does most you say well if we ever meet agin hetty youll find a frind in me let your sister do what she may i was no great frind of your mother ill allow for we didnt think alike on most pints but then your father old tom and i fitted each other as remarkably as a buckskin garment will fit any reasonablebuilt man ive always been unanimous of opinion that old floating tom hutter at the bottom was a good fellow and will maintain that agin all inimies for his sake as well as for yourn  goodbye hurry said hetty who now wanted to hasten the young man off as ardently as she had wished to keep him only the moment before though she could give no clearer account of the latter than of the former feeling goodbye hurry take care of yourself in the woods dont halt til you reach the garrison ill read a chapter in the bible for you before i go to bed and think of you in my prayers  this was touching a point on which march had no sympathies and without more words he shook the girl cordially by the hand and reentered the canoe in another minute the two adventurers were a hundred feet from the ark and half a dozen had not elapsed before they were completely lost to view hetty sighed deeply and rejoined her sister and hist  for some time deerslayer and his companion paddled ahead in silence it had been determined to land hurry at the precise point where he is represented in the commencement of our tale as having embarked not only as a place little likely to be watched by the hurons but because he was sufficiently familiar with the signs of the woods at that spot to thread his way through them in the dark thither then the light craft proceeded being urged as diligently and as swiftly as two vigorous and skilful canoemen could force their little vessel through or rather over the water less than a quarter of an hour sufficed for the object and at the end of that time being within the shadows of the shore and quite near the point they sought each ceased his efforts in order to make their parting communications out of earshot of any straggler who might happen to be in the neighborhood  you will do well to persuade the officers at the garrison to lead out a party agin these vagabonds as soon as you git in hurry deerslayer commenced and youll do better if you volunteer to guide it up yourself you know the paths and the shape of the lake and the natur of the land and can do it better than a common ginralizing scout strike at the huron camp first and follow the signs that will then show themselves a few looks at the hut and the ark will satisfy you as to the state of the delaware and the women and at any rate therell be a fine opportunity to fall on the mingo trail and to make a mark on the memories of the blackguards that theyll be apt to carry with em a long time it wont be likely to make much difference with me since that matter will be detarmined afore tomorrows sun has set but it may make a great change in judith and hettys hopes and prospects  and as for yourself nathaniel hurry enquired with more interest than he was accustomed to betray in the welfare of othersand as for yourself what do you think is likely to turn up  the lord in his wisdom only can tell henry march the clouds look black and threatening and i keep my mind in a state to meet the worst vengeful feelins are uppermost in the hearts of the mingos and any little disappintment about the plunder or the prisoners or hist may make the torments sartain the lord in his wisdom can only detarmine my fate or yourn  this is a black business and ought to be put a stop to in some way or other answered hurry confounding the distinctions between right and wrong as is usual with selfish and vulgar men i heartily wish old hutter and i had scalped every creatur in their camp the night we first landed with that capital object had you not held back deerslayer it might have been done and then you wouldnt have found yourself at the last moment in the desperate condition you mention  twould have been better had you said you wished you had never attempted to do what it little becomes any white mans gifts to undertake in which case not only might we have kept from coming to blows but thomas hutter would now have been living and the hearts of the savages would be less given to vengeance the death of that young woman too was oncalled for henry march and leaves a heavy load on our names if not on our consciences  this was so apparent and it seemed so obvious to hurry himself at the moment that he dashed his paddle into the water and began to urge the canoe towards the shore as if bent only on running away from his own lively remorse his companion humoured this feverish desire for change and in a minute or two the bows of the boat grated lightly on the shingle of the beach to land shoulder his pack and rifle and to get ready for his march occupied hurry but an instant and with a growling adieu he had already commenced his march when a sudden twinge of feeling brought him to a dead stop and immediately after to the others side  you cannot mean to give yourself up agin to them murdering savages deerslayer he said quite as much in angry remonstrance as with generous feeling twould be the act of a madman or a fool  theres them that thinks it madness to keep their words and theres them that dont hurry harry you may be one of the first but im one of the last no redskin breathing shall have it in his power to say that a mingo minds his word more than a man of white blood and white gifts in any thing that consarns me im out on a furlough and if ive strength and reason ill go in on a furlough afore noon tomorrow  whats an injin or a word passed or a furlough taken from creaturs like them that have neither souls nor reason  if theyve got neither souls nor reason you and i have both henry march and one is accountable for the other this furlough is not as you seem to think a matter altogether atween me and the mingos seeing it is a solemn bargain made atween me and god he who thinks that he can say what he pleases in his distress and that twill all pass for nothing because tis uttered in the forest and into red mens ears knows little of his situation and hopes and wants the woods are but the ears of the almighty the air is his breath and the light of the sun is little more than a glance of his eye farewell harry we may not meet agin but i would wish you never to treat a furlough or any other solemn thing that your christian god has been called on to witness as a duty so light that it may be forgotten according to the wants of the body or even accordin to the cravings of the spirit  march was now glad again to escape it was quite impossible that he could enter into the sentiments that ennobled his companion and he broke away from both with an impatience that caused him secretly to curse the folly that could induce a man to rush as it were on his own destruction deerslayer on the contrary manifested no such excitement sustained by his principles inflexible in the purpose of acting up to them and superior to any unmanly apprehension he regarded all before him as a matter of course and no more thought of making any unworthy attempt to avoid it than a mussulman thinks of counteracting the decrees of providence he stood calmly on the shore listening to the reckless tread with which hurry betrayed his progress through the bushes shook his head in dissatisfaction at the want of caution and then stepped quietly into his canoe before he dropped the paddle again into the water the young man gazed about him at the scene presented by the starlit night this was the spot where he had first laid his eyes on the beautiful sheet of water on which he floated if it was then glorious in the bright light of a summers noontide it was now sad and melancholy under the shadows of night the mountains rose around it like black barriers to exclude the outer world and the gleams of pale light that rested on the broader parts of the basin were no bad symbols of the faintness of the hopes that were so dimly visible in his own future sighing heavily he pushed the canoe from the land and took his way back with steady diligence towards the ark and the castle    chapter xxiv       thy secret pleasure turns to open shame     thy private feasting to a public fast     thy smoothing titles to a ragged name     thy sugard tongue to bitter worm wood taste     thy violent vanities can never last      shakespeare rape of lucrece 11  89094  judith was waiting the return of deerslayer on the platform with stifled impatience when the latter reached the hut hist and hetty were both in a deep sleep on the bed usually occupied by the two daughters of the house and the delaware was stretched on the floor of the adjoining room his rifle at his side and a blanket over him already dreaming of the events of the last few days there was a lamp burning in the ark for the family was accustomed to indulge in this luxury on extraordinary occasions and possessed the means the vessel being of a form and material to render it probable it had once been an occupant of the chest  as soon as the girl got a glimpse of the canoe she ceased her hurried walk up and down the platform and stood ready to receive the young man whose return she had now been anxiously expecting for some time she helped him to fasten the canoe and by aiding in the other little similar employments manifested her desire to reach a moment of liberty as soon as possible when this was done in answer to an inquiry of his she informed him of the manner in which their companions had disposed of themselves he listened attentively for the manner of the girl was so earnest and impressive as to apprise him that she had something on her mind of more than common concern  and now deerslayer judith continued you see i have lighted the lamp and put it in the cabin of the ark that is never done with us unless on great occasions and i consider this night as the most important of my life will you follow me and see what i have to show youhear what i have to say  the hunter was a little surprised but making no objections both were soon in the scow and in the room that contained the light here two stools were placed at the side of the chest with the lamp on another and a table near by to receive the different articles as they might be brought to view this arrangement had its rise in the feverish impatience of the girl which could brook no delay that it was in her power to obviate even all the padlocks were removed and it only remained to raise the heavy lid again to expose all the treasures of this long secreted hoard  i see in part what all this means observed deerslayeryes i see through it in part but why is not hetty present now thomas hutter is gone she is one of the owners of these curosities and ought to see them opened and handled  hetty sleeps answered judith huskily happily for her fine clothes and riches have no charms besides she has this night given her share of all that the chest may hold to me that i may do with it as i please  is poor hetty compass enough for that judith demanded the justminded young man its a good rule and a righteous one never to take when them that give dont know the valie of their gifts and such as god has visited heavily in their wits ought to be dealt with as carefully as children that havent yet come to their understandings  judith was hurt at this rebuke coming from the person it did but she would have felt it far more keenly had not her conscience fully acquitted her of any unjust intentions towards her feebleminded but confiding sister it was not a moment however to betray any of her usual mountings of the spirit and she smothered the passing sensation in the desire to come to the great object she had in view  hetty will not be wronged she mildly answered she even knows not only what i am about to do deerslayer but why i do it so take your seat raise the lid of the chest and this time we will go to the bottom i shall be disappointed if something is not found to tell us more of the history of thomas hutter and my mother  why thomas hutter judith and not your father the dead ought to meet with as much reverence as the living  i have long suspected that thomas hutter was not my father though i did think he might have been hettys but now we know he was the father of neither he acknowledged that much in his dying moments i am old enough to remember better things than we have seen on this lake though they are so faintly impressed on my memory that the earlier part of my life seems like a dream  dreams are but miserable guides when one has to detarmine about realities judith returned the other admonishingly fancy nothing and hope nothing on their account though ive known chiefs that thought em useful  i expect nothing for the future from them my good friend but cannot help remembering what has been this is idle however when half an hour of examination may tell us all or even more than i want to know  deerslayer who comprehended the girls impatience now took his seat and proceeded once more to bring to light the different articles that the chest contained as a matter of course all that had been previously examined were found where they had been last deposited and they excited much less interest or comment than when formerly exposed to view even judith laid aside the rich brocade with an air of indifference for she had a far higher aim before her than the indulgence of vanity and was impatient to come at the still hidden or rather unknown treasures  all these we have seen before she said and will not stop to open the bundle under your hand deerslayer is a fresh one that we will look into god send it may contain something to tell poor hetty and myself who we really are  ay if some bundles could speak they might tell wonderful secrets returned the young man deliberately undoing the folds of another piece of course canvass in order to come at the contents of the roll that lay on his knees though this doesnt seem to be one of that family seeing tis neither more nor less than a sort of flag though of what nation it passes my larnin to say  that flag must have some meaning to it judith hurriedly interposed open it wider deerslayer that we may see the colours  well i pity the ensign that has to shoulder this cloth and to parade it about on the field why tis large enough judith to make a dozen of them colours the kings officers set so much store by these can be no ensigns colours but a ginrals  a ship might carry it deerslayer and ships i know do use such things have you never heard any fearful stories about thomas hutters having once been concerned with the people they call buccaneers  buckahnear not inot ii never heard him mentioned as good at a buck far off or near by hurry harry did till me something about its being supposed that he had formerly in some way or other dealings with sartain sea robbers but lord judith it cant surely give you any satisfaction to make out that agin your mothers own husband though he isnt your father  anything will give me satisfaction that tells me who i am and helps to explain the dreams of childhood my mothers husband yes he must have been that though why a woman like her should have chosen a man like him is more than mortal reason can explain you never saw mother deerslayer and cant feel the vast vast difference there was between them  such things do happen howseveryes they do happen though why providence lets them come to pass is more than i understand ive knew the fercest warriors with the gentlest wives of any in the tribe and awful scolds fall to the lot of injins fit to be missionaries  that was not it deerslayer that was not it oh if it should prove thatno i cannot wish she should not have been his wife at all that no daughter can wish for her own mother go on now and let us see what the square looking bundle holds  deerslayer complied and he found that it contained a small trunk of pretty workmanship but fastened the next point was to find a key but search proving ineffectual it was determined to force the lock this deerslayer soon effected by the aid of an iron instrument and it was found that the interior was nearly filled with papers many were letters some fragments of manuscripts memorandums accounts and other similar documents the hawk does not pounce upon the chicken with a more sudden swoop than judith sprang forward to seize this mine of hitherto concealed knowledge her education as the reader will have perceived was far superior to her situation in life and her eye glanced over page after page of the letters with a readiness that her schooling supplied and with an avidity that found its origin in her feelings at first it was evident that the girl was gratified and we may add with reason for the letters written by females in innocence and affection were of a character to cause her to feel proud of those with whom she had every reason to think she was closely connected by the ties of blood it does not come within the scope of our plan to give more of these epistles however than a general idea of their contents and this will best be done by describing the effect they produced on the manner appearance and feeling of her who was so eagerly perusing them  it has been said already that judith was much gratified with the letters that first met her eye they contained the correspondence of an affectionate and inteffigent mother to an absent daughter with such allusions to the answers as served in a great measure to fill up the vacuum left by the replies they were not without admonitions and warnings however and judith felt the blood mounting to her temples and a cold shudder succeeding as she read one in which the propriety of the daughters indulging in as much intimacy as had evidently been described in one of the daughters own letters with an officer who came from europe and who could hardly be supposed to wish to form an honorable connection in america was rather coldly commented on by the mother what rendered it singular was the fact that the signatures had been carefully cut from every one of these letters and wherever a name occurred in the body of the epistles it had been erased with so much diligence as to render it impossible to read it they had all been enclosed in envelopes according to the fashion of the age and not an address either was to be found still the letters themselves had been religiously preserved and judith thought she could discover traces of tears remaining on several she now remembered to have seen the little trunk in her mothers keeping previously to her death and she supposed it had first been deposited in the chest along with the other forgotten or concealed objects when the letters could no longer contribute to that parents grief or happiness  next came another bundle and these were filled with the protestations of love written with passion certainly but also with that deceit which men so often think it justifiable to use to the other sex judith had shed tears abundantly over the first packet but now she felt a sentiment of indignation and pride better sustaining her her hand shook however and cold shivers again passed through her frame as she discovered a few points of strong resemblance between these letters and some it had been her own fate to receive once indeed she laid the packet down bowed her head to her knees and seemed nearly convulsed all this time deerslayer sat a silent but attentive observer of every thing that passed as judith read a letter she put it into his hands to hold until she could peruse the next but this served in no degree to enlighten her companion as he was totally unable to read nevertheless he was not entirely at fault in discovering the passions that were contending in the bosom of the fair creature by his side and as occasional sentences escaped her in murmurs he was nearer the truth in his divinations or conjectures than the girl would have been pleased at discovering  judith had commenced with the earliest letters luckily for a ready comprehension of the tale they told for they were carefully arranged in chronological order and to any one who would take the trouble to peruse them would have revealed a sad history of gratified passion coldness and finally of aversion as she obtained the clue to their import her impatience would not admit of delay and she soon got to glancing her eyes over a page by way of coming at the truth in the briefest manner possible by adopting this expedient one to which all who are eager to arrive at results without encumbering themselves with details are so apt to resort judith made a rapid progress in these melancholy revelations of her mothers failing and punishment she saw that the period of her own birth was distinctly referred to and even learned that the homely name she bore was given her by the father of whose person she retained so faint an impression as to resemble a dream this name was not obliterated from the text of the letters but stood as if nothing was to be gained by erasing it hettys birth was mentioned once and in that instance the name was the mothers but ere this period was reached came the signs of coldness shadowing forth the desertion that was so soon to follow it was in this stage of the correspondence that her mother had recourse to the plan of copying her own epistles they were but few but were eloquent with the feelings of blighted affection and contrition judith sobbed over them until again and again she felt compelled to lay them aside from sheer physical inability to see her eyes being literally obscured with tears still she returned to the task with increasing interest and finally succeeded in reaching the end of the latest communication that had probably ever passed between her parents  all this occupied fully an hour for near a hundred letters were glanced at and some twenty had been closely read the truth now shone clear upon the acute mind of judith so far as her own birth and that of hetty were concerned she sickened at the conviction and for the moment the rest of the world seemed to be cut off from her and she had now additional reasons for wishing to pass the remainder of her life on the lake where she had already seen so many bright and so many sorrowing days  there yet remained more letters to examine judith found these were a correspondence between her mother and thomas hovey the originals of both parties were carefully arranged letter and answer side by side and they told the early history of the connection between the illassorted pair far more plainly than judith wished to learn it her mother made the advances towards a marriage to the surprise not to say horror of her daughter and she actually found a relief when she discovered traces of what struck her as insanityor a morbid desperation bordering on that dire calamityin the earlier letters of that illfated woman the answers of hovey were coarse and illiterate though they manifested a sufficient desire to obtain the hand of a woman of singular personal attractions and whose great error he was willing to overlook for the advantage of possessing one every way so much his superior and who it also appeared was not altogether destitute of money the remainder of this part of the correspondence was brief and it was soon confined to a few communications on business in which the miserable wife hastened the absent husband in his preparations to abandon a world which there was a sufficient reason to think was as dangerous to one of the parties as it was disagreeable to the other but a sincere expression had escaped her mother by which judith could get a clue to the motives that had induced her to marry hovey or hutter and this she found was that feeling of resentment which so often tempts the injured to inflict wrongs on themselves by way of heaping coals on the heads of those through whom they have suffered judith had enough of the spirit of that mother to comprehend this sentiment and for a moment did she see the exceeding folly which permitted such revengeful feelings to get the ascendancy  there what may be called the historical part of the papers ceased among the loose fragments however was an old newspaper that contained a proclamation offering a reward for the apprehension of certain freebooters by name among which was that of thomas hovey the attention of the girl was drawn to the proclamation and to this particular name by the circumstance that black lines had been drawn under both in ink nothing else was found among the papers that could lead to a discovery of either the name or the place of residence of the wife of hutter all the dates signatures and addresses had been cut from the letters and wherever a word occurred in the body of the communications that might furnish a clue it was scrupulously erased thus judith found all her hopes of ascertaining who her parents were defeated and she was obliged to fall back on her own resources and habits for everything connected with the future her recollection of her mothers manners conversation and sufferings filled up many a gap in the historical facts she had now discovered and the truth in its outlines stood sufficiently distinct before her to take away all desire indeed to possess any more details throwing herself back in her seat she simply desired her companion to finish the examination of the other articles in the chest as it might yet contain something of importance  ill do it judith ill do it returned the patient deerslayer but if theres many more letters to read we shall see the sun agin afore youve got through with the reading of them two good hours have you been looking at them bits of papers  they tell me of my parents deerslayer and have settled my plans for life a girl may be excused who reads about her own father and mother and that too for the first time in her life i am sorry to have kept you waiting  never mind me gal never mind me it matters little whether i sleep or watch but though you be pleasant to look at and are so handsome judith it is not altogether agreeable to sit so long to behold you shedding tears i know that tears dont kill and that some people are better for shedding a few now and then especially young women but id rather see you smile any time judith than see you weep  this gallant speech was rewarded with a sweet though a melancholy smile and then the girl again desired her companion to finish the examination of the chest the search necessarily continued some time during which judith collected her thoughts and regained her composure she took no part in the search leaving everything to the young man looking listlessly herself at the different articles that came uppermost nothing further of much interest or value however was found a sword or two such as were then worn by gentlemen some buckles of silver or so richly plated as to appear silver and a few handsome articles of female dress composed the principal discoveries it struck both judith and the deerslayer notwithstanding that some of these things might be made useful in effecting a negotiation with the iroquois though the latter saw a difficulty in the way that was not so apparent to the former the conversation was first renewed in connection with this point  and now deerslayer said judith we may talk of yourself and of the means of getting you out of the hands of the hurons any part or all of what you have seen in the chest will be cheerfully given by me and hetty to set you at liberty  well thats ginrousyes tis downright freehearted and freehanded and ginrous this is the way with women when they take up a frindship they do nothing by halves but are as willing to part with their property as if it had no value in their eyes however while i thank you both just as much as if the bargain was made and rivenoak or any of the other vagabonds was here to accept and close the treaty theres two principal reasons why it can never come to pass which may be as well told at once in order no onlikely expectations may be raised in you or any onjustifiable hopes in me  what reason can there be if hetty and i are willing to part with the trifles for your sake and the savages are willing to receive them  thats it judith youve got the idees but theyre a little out of their places as if a hound should take the backard instead of the leading scent that the mingos will be willing to receive them things or any more like em you may have to offer is probable enough but whether theyll pay valie for em is quite another matter ask yourself judith if any one should send you a message to say that for such or such a price you and hetty might have that chist and all it holds whether youd think it worth your while to waste many words on the bargain  but this chest and all it holds are already ours there is no reason why we should purchase what is already our own  just so the mingos caculate they say the chist is theirn already or as good as theirn and theyll not thank anybody for the key  i understand you deerslayer surely we are yet in possession of the lake and we can keep possession of it until hurry sends troops to drive off the enemy this we may certainly do provided you will stay with us instead of going back and giving yourself up a prisoner again as you now seem determined on  that hurry harry should talk in thisaway is natral and according to the gifts of the man he knows no better and therefore he is little likely to feel or to act any better but judith i put it to your heart and consciencewould you could you think of me as favorably as i hope and believe you now do was i to forget my furlough and not go back to the camp  to think more favorably of you than i now do deerslayer would not be easy but i might continue to think as favorablyat least it seems soi hope i could for a world wouldnt tempt me to let you do anything that might change my real opinion of you  then dont try to entice me to overlook my furlough gal a furlough is a sacred thing among warriors and men that carry their lives in their hands as we of the forests do and what a grievous disappintment would it be to old tamenund and to uncas the father of the sarpent and to my other frinds in the tribe if i was so to disgrace myself on my very first warpath this you will pairceive moreover judith is without laying any stress on natral gifts and a white mans duties to say nothing of conscience the last is king with me and i try never to dispute his orders  i believe you are right deerslayer returned the girl after a little reflection and in a saddened voice a man like you ought not to act as the selfish and dishonest would be apt to act you must indeed go back we will talk no more of this then should i persuade you to anything for which you would be sorry hereafter my own regret would not be less than yours you shall not have it to say judithi scarce know by what name to call myself now  and why not why not gal children take the names of their parents natrally and by a sort of gift like and why shouldnt you and hetty do as others have done afore ye hutter was the old mans name and hutter should be the name of his dartersat least until you are given away in lawful and holy wedlock  i am judith and judith only returned the girl positivelyuntil the law gives me a right to another name never will i use that of thomas hutter again nor with my consent shall hetty hutter was not even his own name i find but had he a thousand rights to it it would give none to me he was not my father thank heaven though i may have no reason to be proud of him that was  this is strange said deerslayer looking steadily at the excited girl anxious to know more but unwilling to inquire into matters that did not properly concern him yes this is very strange and oncommon thomas hutter wasnt thomas hutter and his darters werent his darters who then could thomas hutter be and who are his darters  did you never hear anything whispered against the former life of this person deerslayer demanded judith passing as i did for his child such reports reached even me  ill not deny it judith no ill not deny it sartain things have been said as ive told you but im not very credible as to reports young as i am ive lived long enough to larn theres two sorts of characters in the worldthem that is arned by deeds and them that is arned by tongues and so i prefar to see and judge for myself instead of letting every jaw that chooses to wag become my judgment hurry harry spoke pretty plainly of the whole family as we journeyed thisaway and he did hint something consarning thomas hutters having been a freeliver on the water in his younger days by freeliver i mean that he made free to live on other mens goods  he told you he was a piratethere is no need of mincing matters between friends read that deerslayer and you will see that he told you no more than the truth this thomas hovey was the thomas hutter you knew as is seen by these letters  as judith spoke with a flushed cheek and eyes dazzling with the brilliancy of excitement she held the newspaper towards her companion pointing to the proclamation of a colonial governor already mentioned  bless you judith answered the other laughing you might as well ask me to print thator for that matter to write it my edication has been altogether in the woods the only book i read or care about reading is the one which god has opened afore all his creaturs in the noble forests broad lakes rolling rivers blue skies and the winds and tempests and sunshine and other glorious marvels of the land this book i can read and i find it full of wisdom and knowledge  i crave your pardon deerslayer said judith earnestly more abashed than was her wont in finding that she had in advertently made an appeal that might wound her compan ions pride i had forgotten your manner of life and least of all did i wish to hurt your feelings  hurt my feelins why should it hurt my feelins to ask me to read when i cant read im a hunterand i may now begin to say a warrior and no missionary and therefore books and papers are of no account with such as ino nojudith and here the young man laughed cordially not even for wads seeing that your true deerkiller always uses the hide of a faan if hes got one or some other bit of leather suitably prepared theres some that do say all that stands in print is true in which case ill own an unlarned man must be somewhat of a loser nevertheless it cant be truer than that which god has printed with his own hand in the sky and the woods and the rivers and the springs  well then hutter or hovey was a pirate and being no father of mine i cannot wish to call him one his name shall no longer be my name  if you dislike the name of that man theres the name of your mother judith hern may sarve you just as good a turn  i do not know it ive lookd through those papers deerslayer in the hope of finding some hint by which i might discover who my mother was but there is no more trace of the past in that respect than the bird leaves in the air  thats both oncommon and onreasonable parents are bound to give their offspring a name even though they give em nothing else now i come of a humble stock though we have white gifts and a white natur but we are not so poorly off as to have no name bumppo we are called and ive heard it said a touch of human vanity glowing on his cheek that the time has been when the bumppos had more standing and note among mankind than they have just now  they never deserved them more deerslayer and the name is a good one either hetty or myself would a thousand times rather be called hetty bumppo or judith bumppo than to be called hetty or judith hutter  thats a moral impossible returned the hunter good humouredly onless one of you should so far demean herself as to marry me  judith could not refrain from smiling when she found how simply and naturally the conversation had come round to the very point at which she had aimed to bring it although far from unfeminine or forward either in her feelings or her habits the girl was goaded by a sense of wrongs not altogether merited incited by the hopelessness of a future that seemed to contain no resting place and still more influenced by feelings that were as novel to her as they proved to be active and engrossing the opening was too good therefore to be neglected though she came to the subject with much of the indirectness and perhaps justifiable address of a woman  i do not think hetty will ever marry deerslayer she said and if your name is to be borne by either of us it must be borne by me  theres been handsome women too they tell me among the bumppos judith afore now and should you take up with the name oncommon as you be in this particular them that knows the family wont be altogether surprised  this is not talking as becomes either of us deerslayer for whatever is said on such a subject between man and woman should be said seriously and in sincerity of heart forgetting the shame that ought to keep girls silent until spoken to in most cases i will deal with you as frankly as i know one of your generous nature will most like to be dealt by can youdo you think deerslayer that you could be happy with such a wife as a woman like myself would make  a woman like you judith but wheres the sense in trifling about such a thing a woman like you that is handsome enough to be a captains lady and fine enough and so far as i know edicated enough would be little apt to think of becoming my wife i suppose young gals that feel themselves to be smart and know themselves to be handsome find a sartain satisfaction in passing their jokes agin them thats neither like a poor delaware hunter  this was said good naturedly but not without a betrayal of feeling which showed that something like mortified sensibility was blended with the reply nothing could have occurred more likely to awaken all judiths generous regrets or to aid her in her purpose by adding the stimulant of a disinterested desire to atone to her other impulses and cloaking all under a guise so winning and natural as greatly to lessen the unpleasant feature of a forwardness unbecoming the sex  you do me injustice if you suppose i have any such thought or wish she answered earnestly never was i more serious in my life or more willing to abide by any agreement that we may make tonight i have had many suitors deerslayernay scarce an unmarried trapper or hunter has been in at the lake these four years who has not offered to take me away with him and i fear some that were married too  ay ill warrant that interrupted the otherill warrant all that take em as a body judith arth dont hold a set of men more given to theirselves and less given to god and the law  not one of them would icould i listen to happily for myself perhaps has it been that such was the case there have been well looking youths among them too as you may have seen in your acquaintance henry march  yes harry is sightly to the eye though to my idees less so to the judgment i thought at first you meant to have him judith i did but afore he went it was easy enough to verify that the same lodge wouldnt be big enough for you both  you have done me justice in that at least deerslayer hurry is a man i could never marry though he were ten times more comely to the eye and a hundred times more stout of heart than he really is  why not judith why not i own im curous to know why a youth like hurry shouldnt find favor with a maiden like you  then you shall know deerslayer returned the girl gladly availing herself of the opportunity of indirectly extolling the qualities which had so strongly interested her in her listener hoping by these means covertly to approach the subject nearest her heart in the first place looks in a man are of no importance with a woman provided he is manly and not disfigured or deformed  there i cant altogether agree with you returned the other thoughtfully for he had a very humble opinion of his own personal appearance i have noticed that the comeliest warriors commonly get the bestlooking maidens of the tribe for wives and the sarpent yonder who is sometimes wonderful in his paint is a gineral favorite with all the delaware young women though he takes to hist himself as if she was the only beauty on arth  it may be so with indians but it is different with white girls so long as a young man has a straight and manly frame that promises to make him able to protect a woman and to keep want from the door it is all they ask of the figure giants like hurry may do for grenadiers but are of little account as lovers then as to the face an honest look one that answers for the heart within is of more value than any shape or colour or eyes or teeth or trifles like them the last may do for girls but who thinks of them at all in a hunter or a warrior or a husband if there are women so silly judith is not among them  well this is wonderful i always thought that handsome liked handsome as riches love riches  it may be so with you men deerslayer but it is not always so with us women we like stouthearted men but we wish to see them modest sure on a hunt or the warpath ready to die for the right and unwilling to yield to the wrong above all we wish for honestytongues that are not used to say what the mind does not mean and hearts that feel a little for others as well as for themselves a truehearted girl could die for such a husband while the boaster and the doubletongued suitor gets to be as hateful to the sight as he is to the mind  judith spoke bitterly and with her usual force but her listener was too much struck with the novelty of the sensations he experienced to advert to her manner there was something so soothing to the humility of a man of his temperament to hear qualities that he could not but know he possessed himself thus highly extolled by the loveliest female he had ever beheld that for the moment his faculties seemed suspended in a natural and excusable pride then it was that the idea of the possibility of such a creature as judith becoming his companion for life first crossed his mind the image was so pleasant and so novel that he continued completely absorbed by it for more than a minute totally regardless of the beautiful reality that was seated before him watching the expression of his upright and truthtelling countenance with a keenness that gave her a very fair if not an absolutely accurate clue to his thoughts never before had so pleasing a vision floated before the minds eye of the young hunter but accustomed most to practical things and little addicted to submitting to the power of his imagination even while possessed of so much true poetical feeling in connection with natural objects in particular he soon recovered his reason and smiled at his own weakness as the fancied picture faded from his mental sight and left him the simple untaught but highly moral being he was seated in the ark of thomas hutter at midnight with the lovely countenance of its late owners reputed daughter beaming on him with anxious scrutiny by the light of the solitary lamp  youre wonderful handsome and enticing and pleasing to look on judith he exclaimed in his simplicity as fact resumed its ascendency over fancy wonderful i dont remember ever to have seen so beautiful a gal even among the delawares and im not astonished that hurry harry went away soured as well as disappinted  would you have had me deerslayer become the wife of such a man as henry march  theres that which is in his favor and theres that which is agin him to my taste hurry wouldnt make the best of husbands but i fear that the tastes of most young women hereaway wouldnt be so hard upon him  nonojudith without a name would never consent to be called judith march anything would be better than that  judith bumppo wouldnt sound as well gal and theres many names that would fall short of march in pleasing the ear  ah deerslayer the pleasantness of the sound in such cases doesnt come through the ear but through the heart everything is agreeable when the heart is satisfied were natty bumppo henry march and henry march natty bumppo i might think the name of march better than it is or were he you i should fancy the name of bumppo horrible  thats just ityes thats the reason of the matter now im natrally avarse to sarpents and i hate even the word which the missionaries tell me comes from human natur on account of a sartain sarpent at the creation of the arth that outwitted the first woman yet ever since chingachgook has arned the title he bears why the sound is as pleasant to my ears as the whistle of the whippoorwill of a calm eveningit is the feelins make all the difference in the world judith in the natur of sounds ay even in that of looks too  this is so true deerslayer that i am surprised you should think it remarkable a girl who may have some comeliness herself should not think it necessary that her husband should have the same advantage or what you fancy an advantage to me looks in a man is nothing provided his countenance be as honest as his heart  yes honesty is a great advantage in the long run and they that are the most apt to forget it in the beginning are the most apt to larn it in the ind nevertheless theres more judith that look to present profit than to the benefit that is to come after a time one they think a sartainty and the other an onsartainty im glad howsever that you look at the thing in its true light and not in the way in which so many is apt to deceive themselves  i do thus look at it deerslayer returned the girl with emphasis still shrinking with a womans sensitiveness from a direct offer of her hand and can say from the bottom of my heart that i would rather trust my happiness to a man whose truth and feelings may be depended on than to a falsetongued and falsehearted wretch that had chests of gold and houses and landsyes though he were even seated on a throne  these are brave words judith theyre downright brave words but do you think that the feelins would keep em company did the chice actually lie afore you if a gay gallant in a scarlet coat stood on one side with his head smelling like a deers foot his face smooth and blooming as your own his hands as white and soft as if god hadnt bestowed em that man might live by the sweat of his brow and his step as lofty as dancingteachers and a light heart could make it and the other side stood one that has passed his days in the open air till his forehead is as red as his cheek had cut his way through swamps and bushes till his hand was as rugged as the oaks he slept under had trodden on the scent of game till his step was as stealthy as the catamounts and had no other pleasant odor about him than such as natur gives in the free air and the forestnow if both these men stood here as suitors for your feelins which do you think would win your favor  judiths fine face flushed for the picture that her companion had so simply drawn of a gay officer of the garrisons had once been particularly grateful to her imagination though experience and disappointment had not only chilled all her affections but given them a backward current and the passing image had a momentary influence on her feelings but the mounting colour was succeeded by a paleness so deadly as to make her appear ghastly  as god is my judge the girl solemnly answered did both these men stand before me as i may say one of them does my choice if i know my own heart would be the latter i have no wish for a husband who is any way better than myself  this is pleasant to listen to and might lead a young man in time to forget his own onworthiness judith howsever you hardly think all that you say a man like me is too rude and ignorant for one that has had such a mother to teach her vanity is natral i do believe but vanity like that would surpass reason  then you do not know of what a womans heart is capable rude you are not deerslayer nor can one be called ignorant that has studied what is before his eyes as closely as you have done when the affections are concerned all things appear in their pleasantest colors and trifles are overlooked or are forgotten when the heart feels sunshine nothing is gloomy even dull looking objects seeming gay and bright and so it would be between you and the woman who should love you even though your wife might happen in some matters to possess what the world calls the advantage over you  judith you come of people altogether above mine in the world and onequal matches like onequal frindships cant often tarminate kindly i speak of this matter altogether as a fanciful thing since its not very likely that you at least would be apt to treat it as a matter that can ever come to pass  judith fastened her deep blue eyes on the open frank countenance of her companion as if she would read his soul nothing there betrayed any covert meaning and she was obliged to admit to herself that he regarded the conversation as argumentative rather than positive and that he was still without any active suspicion that her feelings were seriously involved in the issue at first she felt offended then she saw the injustice of making the selfabasement and modesty of the hunter a charge against him and this novel difficulty gave a piquancy to the state of affairs that rather increased her interest in the young man at that critical instant a change of plan flashed on her mind and with a readiness of invention that is peculiar to the quickwitted and ingenious she adopted a scheme by which she hoped effectually to bind him to her person this scheme partook equally of her fertility of invention and of the decision and boldness of her character that the conversation might not terminate too abruptly however or any suspicion of her design exist she answered the last remark of deerslayer as earnestly and as truly as if her original intention remained unaltered  i certainly have no reason to boast of parentage after what i have seen this night said the girl in a saddened voice i had a mother it is true but of her name even i am ignorantand as for my father it is better perhaps that i should never know who he was lest i speak too bitterly of him  judith said deerslayer taking her hand kindly and with a manly sincerity that went directly to the girls heart tis better to say no more tonight sleep on what youve seen and felt in the morning things that now look gloomy may look more cherful above all never do anything in bitterness or because you feel as if youd like to take revenge on yourself for other peoples backslidings all that has been said or done atween us this night is your secret and shall never be talked of by me even with the sarpent and you may be sartain if he cant get it out of me no man can if your parents have been faulty let the darter be less so remember that youre young and the youthful may always hope for better times that youre more quickwitted than usual and such ginrally get the better of difficulties and that as for beauty youre oncommon which is an advantage with all it is time to get a little rest for tomorrow is like to prove a trying day to some of us  deerslayer arose as he spoke and judith had no choice but to comply the chest was closed and secured and they parted in silence she to take her place by the side of hist and hetty and he to seek a blanket on the floor of the cabin he was in it was not five minutes ere the young man was in a deep sleep but the girl continued awake for a long time she scarce knew whether to lament or to rejoice at having failed in making herself understood on the one hand were her womanly sensibilities spared on the other was the disappointment of defeated or at least of delayed expectations and the uncertainty of a future that looked so dark then came the new resolution and the bold project for the morrow and when drowsiness finally shut her eyes they closed on a scene of success and happiness that was pictured by the fancy under the influence of a sanguine temperament and a happy invention    chapter xxv       but mother now a shade has past     athwart my brightest visions here     a cloud of darkest gloom has wrapt     the remnant of my brief career     no song no echo can i win     the sparkling fount has died within      margaret davidson to my mother 11  712  hist and hetty arose with the return of light leaving judith still buried in sleep it took but a minute for the first to complete her toilet her long coalblack hair was soon adjusted in a simple knot the calico dress belted tight to her slender waist and her little feet concealed in their gaudily ornamented moccasins when attired she left her companion employed in household affairs and went herself on the platform to breathe the pure air of the morning here she found chingachgook studying the shores of the lake the mountains and the heavens with the sagacity of a man of the woods and the gravity of an indian  the meeting between the two lovers was simple but affectionate the chief showed a manly kindness equally removed from boyish weakness and haste while the girl betrayed in her smile and half averted looks the bashful tenderness of her sex neither spoke unless it were with the eyes though each understood the other as fully as if a vocabulary of words and protestations had been poured out hist seldom appeared to more advantage than at that moment for just from her rest and ablutions there was a freshness about her youthful form and face that the toils of the wood do not always permit to be exhibited by even the juvenile and pretty then judith had not only imparted some of her own skill in the toilet during their short intercourse but she had actually bestowed a few well selected ornaments from her own stores that contributed not a little to set off the natural graces of the indian maid all this the lover saw and felt and for a moment his countenance was illuminated with a look of pleasure but it soon grew grave again and became saddened and anxious the stools used the previous night were still standing on the platform placing two against the walls of the hut he seated himself on one making a gesture to his companion to take the other this done he continued thoughtful and silent for quite a minute maintaining the reflecting dignity of one born to take his seat at the councilfire while hist was furtively watching the expression of his face patient and submissive as became a woman of her people then the young warrior stretched his arm before him as if to point out the glories of the scene at that witching hour when the whole panorama as usual was adorned by the mellow distinctness of early morning sweeping with his hand slowly over lake hills and heavens the girl followed the movement with pleased wonder smiling as each new beauty met her gaze  hugh exclaimed the chief in admiration of a scene so unusual even to him for this was the first lake he had ever beheld this is the country of the manitou it is too good for mingos hist but the curs of that tribe are howling in packs through the woods they think that the delawares are asleep over the mountains  all but one of them is chingachgook there is one here and he is of the blood of uncas  what is one warrior against a tribe the path to our villages is very long and crooked and we shall travel it under a cloudy sky i am afraid too honeysuckle of the hills that we shall travel it alone  hist understood the allusion and it made her sad though it sounded sweet to her ears to be compared by the warrior she so loved to the most fragrant and the pleasantest of all the wild flowers of her native woods still she continued silent as became her when the allusion was to a grave interest that men could best control though it exceeded the power of education to conceal the smile that gratified feeling brought to her pretty mouth  when the sun is thus continued the delaware pointing to the zenith by simply casting upward a hand and finger by a play of the wrist the great hunter of our tribe will go back to the hurons to be treated like a bear that they roast and skin even on full stomachs  the great spirit may soften their hearts and not suffer them to be so bloody minded i have lived among the hurons and know them they have hearts and will not forget their own children should they fall into the hands of the delawares  a wolf is forever howling a hog will always eat they have lost warriors even their women will call out for vengeance the paleface has the eyes of an eagle and can see into a mingos heart he looks for no mercy there is a cloud over his spirit though it is not before his face  a long thoughtful pause succeeded during which hist stealthily took the hand of the chief as if seeking his support though she scarce ventured to raise her eyes to a countenance that was now literally becoming terrible under the conflicting passions and stern resolution that were struggling in the breast of its owner  what will the son of uncas do the girl at length timidly asked he is a chief and is already celebrated in council though so young what does his heart tell him is wisest does the head too speak the same words as the heart  what does wahtawah say at a moment when my dearest friend is in such danger the smallest birds sing the sweetest it is always pleasant to hearken to their songs i wish i could hear the wren of the woods in my difficulty its note would reach deeper than the ear  again hist experienced the profound gratification that the language of praise can always awaken when uttered by those we love the honeysuckle of the hills was a term often applied to the girl by the young men of the delawares though it never sounded so sweet in her ears as from the lips of chingachgook but the latter alone had ever styled her the wren of the woods with him however it had got to be a familiar phrase and it was past expression pleasant to the listener since it conveyed to her mind the idea that her advice and sentiments were as acceptable to her future husband as the tones of her voice and modes of conveying them were agreeable uniting the two things most prized by an indian girl as coming from her betrothed admiration for a valued physical advantage with respect for her opinion she pressed the hand she held between both her own and answered  wahtawah says that neither she nor the great serpent could ever laugh again or ever sleep without dreaming of the hurons should the deerslayer die under a mingo tomahawk and they do nothing to save him she would rather go back and start on her long path alone than let such a dark cloud pass before her happiness  good the husband and the wife will have but one heart they will see with the same eyes and feel with the same feelings  what further was said need not be related here that the conversation was of deerslayer and his hopes has been seen already but the decision that was come to will better appear in the course of the narrative the youthful pair were yet conversing when the sun appeared above the tops of the pines and the light of a brilliant american day streamed down into the valley bathing in deep joy the lake the forests and the mountain sides just at this instant deerslayer came out of the cabin of the ark and stepped upon the platform his first look was at the cloudless heavens then his rapid glance took in the entire panorama of land and water when he had leisure for a friendly nod at his friends and a cheerful smile for hist  well he said in his usual composed manner and pleasant voice he that sees the sun set in the west and wakes arly enough in the morning will be sartain to find him coming back agin in the east like a buck that is hunted round his hant i dare say now hist youve beheld this time and agin and yet it never entered into your galish mind to ask the reason  both chingachgook and his betrothed looked up at the luminary with an air that betokened sudden wonder and then they gazed at each other as if to seek the solution of the difficulty familiarity deadens the sensibilities even as connected with the gravest natural phenomena and never before had these simple beings thought of enquiring into a movement that was of daily occurrence however puzzling it might appear on investigation when the subject was thus suddenly started it struck both alike and at the same instant with some such force as any new and brilliant proposition in the natural sciences would strike the scholar chingachgook alone saw fit to answer  the palefaces know everything he said can they tell us why the sun hides his face when he goes back at night  ay that is downright redskin larnin returned the other laughing though he was not altogether insensible to the pleasure of proving the superiority of his race by solving the difficulty which he set about doing in his own peculiar manner harkee sarpent he continued more gravely though too simply for affectation this is easierly explained than an indian brain may fancy the sun while he seems to keep traveling in the heavens never budges but it is the arth that turns round and any one can understand if he is placed on the side of a millwheel for instance when its in motion that he must some times see the heavens while he is at other times under water theres no great secret in that but plain natur the difficulty being in setting the arth in motion  how does my brother know that the earth turns round demanded the indian can he see it  well thats been a puzzler i will own delaware for ive often tried but never could fairly make it out sometimes ive consaited that i could and then agin ive been obliged to own it an onpossibility howsever turn it does as all my people say and you ought to believe em since they can foretell eclipses and other prodigies that used to fill the tribes with terror according to your own traditions of such things  good this is true no red man will deny it when a wheel turns my eyes can see itthey do not see the earth turn  ay thats what i call sense obstinacy seeing is believing they say and what they cant see some men wont in the least give credit to neverthless chief that isnt quite as good reason as it mayat first seem you believe in the great spirit i know and yet i conclude it would puzzle you to show where you see him  chingachgook can see him everywhereeverywhere in good thingsthe evil spirit in bad here in the lake there in the forest yonder in the clouds in hist in the son of uncas in tannemund in deerslayer the evil spirit is in the mingos that i see i do not see the earth turn round  i dont wonder they call you the sarpent delaware no i dont theres always a meaning in your words and theres often a meaning in your countenance too notwithstanding your answers doesnt quite meet my idee that god is observable in all natral objects is allowable but then he is not perceptible in the way i mean you know there is a great spirit by his works and the palefaces know that the arth turns round by its works this is the reason of the matter though how it is to be explained is more than i can exactly tell you this i know all my people consait that fact and what all the palefaces consait is very likely to be true  when the sun is in the top of that pine tomorrow where will my brother deerslayer be  the hunter started and he looked intently though totally without alarm at his friend then he signed for him to follow and led the way into the ark where he might pursue the subject unheard by those whose feelings he feared might get the mastery over their reason here he stopped and pursued the conversation in a more confidential tone  twas a little onreasonable in you sarpent he said to bring up such a subject afore hist and when the young women of my own colour might overhear what was said yes twas a little more onreasonable than most things that you do no matter hist didnt comprehend and the other didnt hear howsever the question is easier put than answered no mortal can say where he will be when the sun rises tomorrow i will ask you the same question sarpent and should like to hear what answer you can give  chingachgook will be with his friend deerslayerif he be in the land of spirits the great serpent will crawl at his side if beneath yonder sun its warmth and light shall fall on both  i understand you delaware returned the other touched with the simple selfdevotion of his friend such language is as plain in one tongue as in another it comes from the heart and goes to the heart too tis well to think so and it may be well to say so for that matter but it would not be well to do so sarpent you are no longer alone in life for though you have the lodges to change and other ceremonies to go through afore hist becomes your lawful wife yet are you as good as married in all that bears on the feelins and joy and misery nonohist must not be desarted because a cloud is passing atween you and me a little onexpectedly and a little darker than we may have looked for  hist is a daughter of the mohicans she knows how to obey her husband where he goes she will follow both will be with the great hunter of the delawares when the sun shall be in the pine tomorrow  the lord bless and protect you chief this is downright madness can either or both of you alter a mingo natur will your grand looks or hists tears and beauty change a wolf into a squirrel or make a catamount as innocent as a faan nosarpent you will think better of this matter and leave me in the hands of god ater all its by no means sartain that the scamps design the torments for they may yet be pitiful and bethink them of the wickedness of such a coursethough it is but a hopeless expectation to look forward to a mingos turning aside from evil and letting marcy get uppermost in his heart nevertheless no one knows to a sartainty what will happen and young creaturs like hist ant to be risked on onsartainties this marrying is altogether a different undertaking from what some young men fancy now if you was single or as good as single delaware i should expect you to be actyve and stirring about the camp of the vagabonds from sunrise to sunset sarcumventing and contriving as restless as a hound off the scent and doing all manner of things to help me and to distract the inimy but two are oftener feebler than one and we must take things as they are and not as we want em to be  listen deerslayer returned the indian with an emphasis so decided as to show how much he was in earnest if chingachgook was in the hands of the hurons what would my paleface brother do sneak off to the delaware villages and say to the chiefs and old men and young warriorssee here is wahtawah she is safe but a little tired and here is the son of uncas not as tired as the honeysuckle being stronger but just as safe would he do this  well thats oncommon ingenous its cunning enough for a mingo himself the lord only knows what put it into your head to ask such a question what would i do why in the first place hist wouldnt be likely to be in my company at all for she would stay as near you as possible and therefore all that part about her couldnt be said without talking nonsense as for her being tired that would fall through too if she didnt go and no part of your speech would be likely to come from me so you see sarpent reason is agin you and you may as well give it up since to hold out agin reason is no way becoming a chief of your character and repitation  my brother is not himself he forgets that he is talking to one who has sat at the council fire of his nation returned the other kindly when men speak they should say that which does not go in at one side of the head and out at the other their words shouldnt be feathers so light that a wind which does not ruffle the water can blow them away he has not answered my question when a chief puts a question his friend should not talk of other things  i understand you delaware i understand well enough what you mean and truth wont allow me to say otherwise still its not as easy to answer as you seem to think for this plain reason you wish me to say what i would do if i had a betrothed as you have here on the lake and a frind yonder in the huron camp in danger of the torments thats it isnt it  the indian bowed his head silently and always with unmoved gravity though his eye twinkled at the sight of the others embarrassment  well i never had a betrothednever had the kind of feelins toward any young woman that you have towards hist though the lord knows my feelins are kind enough towards em all still my heart as they call it in such matters isnt touched and therefore i cant say what i would do a frind pulls strong that i know by experence sarpent but by all that ive seen and heard consarning love im led to think that a betrothed pulls stronger  true but the betrothed of chingachgook does not pull towards the lodges of the delawares she pulls towards the camp of the hurons  shes a noble gal for all her little feet and hands that ant bigger than a childs and a voice that is as pleasant as a mockers shes a noble gal and like the stock of her sires well what is it sarpent for i conclude she hasnt changed her mind and means to give herself up and turn huron wife what is it you want  wahtawah will never live in the wigwam of an iroquois answered the delaware drily she has little feet but they can carry her to the villages of her people she has small hands too but her mind is large my brother will see what we can do when the time shall come rather than let him die under mingo torments  attempt nothing heedlessly delaware said the other earnestly i suppose you must and will have your way and on the whole its right you should for youd neither be happy unless something was undertaken but attempt nothing heedlesslyi didnt expect youd quit the lake while my matter remained in unsartainty but remember sarpent that no torments that mingo ingenuity can invent no tantings and revilings no burnings and roastings and nailtearings nor any other onhuman contrivances can so soon break down my spirit as to find that you and hist have fallen into the power of the inimy in striving to do something for my good  the delawares are prudent the deerslayer will not find them running into a strange camp with their eyes shut  here the dialogue terminated hetty announced that the breakfast was ready and the whole party was soon seated around the simple board in the usual primitive manner of borderers judith was the last to take her seat pale silent and betraying in her countenance that she had passed a painful if not a sleepless night at this meal scarce a syllable was exchanged all the females manifesting want of appetites though the two men were unchanged in this particular it was early when the party arose and there still remained several hours before it would be necessary for the prisoner to leave his friends the knowledge of this circumstance and the interest all felt in his welfare induced the whole to assemble on the platform again in the desire to be near the expected victim to listen to his discourse and if possible to show their interest in him by anticipating his wishes deerslayer himself so far as human eyes could penetrate was wholly unmoved conversing cheerfully and naturally though he avoided any direct allusions to the expected and great event of the day if any evidence could be discovered of his thoughts reverting to that painful subject at all it was in the manner in which he spoke of death and the last great change  grieve not hetty he said for it was while consoling this simpleminded girl for the loss of her parents that he thus betrayed his feelings since god has appinted that all must die your parents or them you fancied your parents which is the same thing have gone afore you this is only in the order of natur my good gal for the aged go first and the young follow but one that had a mother like yourn hetty can be at no loss to hope the best as to how matters will turn out in another world the delaware here and hist believe in happy hunting grounds and have idees befitting their notions and gifts as redskins but we who are of white blood hold altogether to a different doctrine still i rather conclude our heaven is their land of spirits and that the path which leads to it will be travelled by all colours alike tis onpossible for the wicked to enter on it i will allow but frinds can scarce be separated though they are not of the same race on arth keep up your spirits poor hetty and look forward to the day when you will meet your mother agin and that without pain or sorrowing  i do expect to see mother returned the truthtelling and simple girl but what will become of father  thats a nonplusser delaware said the hunter in the indian dialectyes that is a downright nonplusser the muskrat was not a saint on arth and its fair to guess hell not be much of one hereafter howsever hetty dropping into the english by an easy transition howsever hetty we must all hope for the best that is wisest and it is much the easiest to the mind if one can only do it i ricommend to you trusting to god and putting down all misgivings and fainthearted feelins its wonderful judith how different people have different notions about the futur some fancying one change and some fancying another ive known white teachers that have thought all was spirit hereafter and them agin that believed the body will be transported to another world much as the redskins themselves imagine and that we shall walk about in the flesh and know each other and talk together and be frinds there as weve been frinds here  which of these opinions is most pleasing to you deerslayer asked the girl willing to indulge his melancholy mood and far from being free from its influence herself would it be disagreeable to think that you should meet all who are now on this platform in another world or have you known enough of us here to be glad to see us no more  the last would make death a bitter portion yes it would its eight good years since the sarpent and i began to hunt together and the thought that we were never to meet agin would be a hard thought to me he looks forward to the time when he shall chase a sort of spiritdeer in company on plains where theres no thorns or brambles or marshes or other hardships to overcome whereas i cant fall into all these notions seeing that they appear to be agin reason spirits cant eat nor have they any use for clothes and deer can only rightfully be chased to be slain or slain unless it be for the venison or the hides now i find it hard to suppose that blessed spirits can be put to chasing game without an object tormenting the dumb animals just for the pleasure and agreeableness of their own amusements i never yet pulled a trigger on buck or doe judith unless when food or clothes was wanting  the recollection of which deerslayer must now be a great consolation to you  it is the thought of such things my frinds that enables a man to keep his furlough it might be done without it i own for the worst redskins sometimes do their duty in this matter but it makes that which might otherwise be hard easy if not altogether to our liking nothing truly makes a bolder heart than a light conscience  judith turned paler than ever but she struggled for selfcommand and succeeded in obtaining it the conflict had been severe however and it left her so little disposed to speak that hetty pursued the subject this was done in the simple manner natural to the girl  it would be cruel to kill the poor deer she said in this world or any other when you dont want their venison or their skins no good white man and no good red man would do it but its wicked for a christian to talk about chasing anything in heaven such things are not done before the face of god and the missionary that teaches these doctrines cant be a true missionary he must be a wolf in sheeps clothing i suppose you know what a sheep is deerslayer  that i do gal and a useful creatur it is to such as like cloths better than skins for winter garments i understand the natur of sheep though ive had but little to do with em and the natur of wolves too and can take the idee of a wolf in the fleece of a sheep though i think it would be like to prove a hot jacket for such a beast in the warm months  and sin and hypocrisy are hot jackets as they will find who put them on returned hetty positively so the wolf would be no worse off than the sinner spirits dont hunt nor trap nor fish nor do anything that vain men undertake since theyve none of the longings of this world to feed oh mother told me all that years ago and i dont wish to hear it denied  well my good hetty in that case youd better not broach your doctrine to hist when she and you are alone and the young delaware maiden is inclined to talk religion its her fixed idee i know that the good warriors do nothing but hunt and fish in the other world though i dont believe that she fancies any of them are brought down to trapping which is no emplyment for a brave but of hunting and fishing accordin to her notion theyve their fill and that too over the most agreeablest hunting grounds and among game that is never out of season and which is just actyve and instinctyve enough to give a pleasure to death so i wouldnt ricommend it to you to start hist on that idee  hist cant be so wicked as to believe any such thing returned the other earnestly no indian hunts after he is dead  no wicked indian i grant you no wicked indian sartainly he is obliged to carry the ammunition and to look on without sharing in the sport and to cook and to light the fires and to do every thing that isnt manful now mind i dont tell you these are my idees but they are hists idees and therefore for the sake of peace the less you say to her agin em the better  and what are your ideas of the fate of an indian in the other world demanded judith who had just found her voice  ah gal any thing but that i am too christianized to expect any thing so fanciful as hunting and fishing after death nor do i believe there is one manitou for the redskin and another for a paleface you find different colours on arth as any one may see but you dont find different naturs different gifts but only one natur  in what is a gift different from a nature is not nature itself a gift from god  sartain thats quickthoughted and creditable judith though the main idee is wrong a natur is the creatur itself its wishes wants idees and feelins as all are born in him this natur never can be changed in the main though it may undergo some increase or lessening now gifts come of sarcumstances thus if you put a man in a town he gets town gifts in a settlement settlement gifts in a forest gifts of the woods a soldier has soldierly gifts and a missionary preaching gifts all these increase and strengthen until they get to fortify natur as it might be and excuse a thousand acts and idees still the creatur is the same at the bottom just as a man who is clad in regimentals is the same as the man that is clad in skins the garments make a change to the eye and some change in the conduct perhaps but none in the man herein lies the apology for gifts seein that you expect different conduct from one in silks and satins from one in homespun though the lord who didnt make the dresses but who made the creaturs themselves looks only at his own work this isnt raal missionary doctrine but its as near it as a man of white colour need be ahs me little did i think to be talking of such matters today but its one of our weaknesses never to know what will come to pass step into the ark with me judith for a minute i wish to convarse with you  judith complied with a willingness she could scarce conceal following the hunter into the cabin she took a seat on a stool while the young man brought killdeer the rifle she had given him out of a corner and placed himself on another with the weapon laid upon his knees after turning the piece round and round and examining its lock and its breech with a sort of affectionate assiduity he laid it down and proceeded to the subject which had induced him to desire the interview  i understand you judith to say that you gave me this rifle he said i agreed to take it because a young woman can have no particular use for firearms the wepon has a great name and it desarves it and ought of right to be carried by some known and sure hand for the best repitation may be lost by careless and thoughtless handling  can it be in better hands than those in which it is now deerslayer thomas hutter seldom missed with it with you it must turn out to be  sartain death interrupted the hunter laughing i once knowd a beaverman that had a piece he called by that very name but twas all boastfulness for ive seen delawares that were as true with arrows at a short range howsever ill not deny my giftsfor this is a gift judith and not naturbut ill not deny my gifts and therefore allow that the rifle couldnt well be in better hands than it is at present but how long will it be likely to remain there atween us the truth may be said though i shouldnt like to have it known to the sarpent and hist but to you the truth may be spoken since your feelins will not be as likely to be tormented by it as those of them that have known me longer and better how long am i like to own this rifle or any other that is a serious question for our thoughts to rest on and should that happen which is so likely to happen killdeer would be without an owner  judith listened with apparent composure though the conflict within came near overpowering her appreciating the singular character of her companion however she succeeded in appearing calm though had not his attention been drawn exclusively to the rifle a man of his keenness of observation could scarce have failed to detect the agony of mind with which the girl had hearkened to his words her great selfcommand notwithstanding enabled her to pursue the subject in a way still to deceive him  what would you have me do with the weapon she asked should that which you seem to expect take place  thats just what i wanted to speak to you about judith thats just it theres chingachgook now though far from being parfect sartainty with a riflefor few redskins ever get to be thatthough far from being parfect sartainty he is respectable and is coming on nevertheless he is my frind and all the better frind perhaps because there never can be any hard feelins atween us touchin our gifts hisn bein red and mine bein altogether white now i should like to leave killdeer to the sarpent should any thing happen to keep me from doing credit and honor to your precious gift judith  leave it to whom you please deerslayer the rifle is your own to do with as you please chingachgook shall have it should you never return to claim it if that be your wish  has hetty been consulted in this matter property goes from the parent to the children and not to one child in particlar  if you place your right on that of the law deerslayer i fear none of us can claim to be the owner thomas hutter was no more the father of esther than he was the father of judith judith and esther we are truly having no other name  there may be law in that but theres no great reason gal accordin to the custom of families the goods are yourn and theres no one here to gainsay it if hetty would only say that she is willing my mind would be quite at ease in the matter its true judith that your sister has neither your beauty nor your wit but we should be the tenderest of the rights and welfare of the most weakminded  the girl made no answer but placing herself at a window she summoned her sister to her side when the question was put to hetty that simpleminded and affectionate creature cheerfully assented to the proposal to confer on deerslayer a full right of ownership to the muchcoveted rifle the latter now seemed perfectly happy for the time being at least and after again examining and reexamining his prize he expressed a determination to put its merits to a practical test before he left the spot no boy could have been more eager to exhibit the qualities of his trumpet or his crossbow than this simple forester was to prove those of his rifle returning to the platform he first took the delaware aside and informed him that this celebrated piece was to become his property in the event of any thing serious befalling himself  this is a new reason why you should be wary sarpent and not run into any oncalculated danger the hunter added for it will be a victory of itself to a tribe to own such a piece as this the mingos will turn green with envy and what is more they will not ventur heedlessly near a village where it is known to be kept so look well to it delaware and remember that youve now to watch over a thing that has all the valie of a creatur without its failins hist may be and should be precious to you but killdeer will have the love and veneration of your whole people  one rifle like another deerslayer returned the indian in english the language used by the other a little hurt at his friends lowering his betrothed to the level of a gun all kill all wood and iron wife dear to heart rifle good to shoot  and what is a man in the woods without something to shoot witha miserable trapper or a forlorn broom and basket maker at the best such a man may hoe corn and keep soul and body together but he can never know the savory morsels of venison or tell a bears ham from a hogs come my frind such another occasion may never offer agin and i feel a strong craving for a trial with this celebrated piece you shall bring out your own rifle and i will just sight killdeer in a careless way in order that we may know a few of its secret vartues  as this proposition served to relieve the thoughts of the whole party by giving them a new direction while it was likely to produce no unpleasant results every one was willing to enter into it the girls bringing forth the firearms with an alacrity bordering on cheerfulness hutters armory was well supplied possessing several rifles all of which were habitually kept loaded in readiness to meet any sudden demand for their use on the present occasion it only remained to freshen the primings and each piece was in a state for service this was soon done as all assisted in it the females being as expert in this part of the system of defence as their male companions  now sarpent well begin in a humble way using old toms commoners first and coming to your wepon and killdeer as the winding up observations said deerslayer delighted to be again weapon in hand ready to display his skill heres birds in abundance some in and some over the lake and they keep at just a good range hovering round the hut speak your mind delaware and pint out the creatur you wish to alarm heres a diver nearest in off to the eastward and thats a creatur that buries itself at the flash and will be like enough to try both piece and powder  chingachgook was a man of few words no sooner was the bird pointed out to him than he took his aim and fired the duck dove at the flash as had been expected and the bullet skipped harmlessly along the surface of the lake first striking the water within a few inches of the spot where the bird had so lately swam deerslayer laughed cordially and naturally but at the same time he threw himself into an attitude of preparation and stood keenly watching the sheet of placid water presently a dark spot appeared and then the duck arose to breathe and shook its wings while in this act a bullet passed directly through its breast actually turning it over lifeless on its back at the next moment deerslayer stood with the breech of his rifle on the platform as tranquil as if nothing had happened though laughing in his own peculiar manner  theres no great trial of the pieces in that he said as if anxious to prevent a false impression of his own merit no that proofs neither for nor agin the rifles seeing it was all quickness of hand and eye i took the bird at a disadvantage or he might have got under again afore the bullet reached him but the sarpent is too wise to mind such tricks having long been used to them do you remember the time chief when you thought yourself sartain of the wildgoose and i took him out of your very eyes as it might be with a little smoke howsever such things pass for nothing atween frinds and young folk will have their fun judith ay heres just the bird we want for its as good for the fire as it is for the aim and nothing should be lost that can be turned to just account there further north delaware  the latter looked in the required direction and he soon saw a large black duck floating in stately repose on the water at that distant day when so few men were present to derange the harmony of the wilderness all the smaller lakes with which the interior of new york so abounds were places of resort for the migratory aquatic birds and this sheet like the others had once been much frequented by all the varieties of the duck by the goose the gull and the loon on the appearance of hutter the spot was comparatively deserted for other sheets more retired and remote though some of each species continued to resort thither as indeed they do to the present hour at that instant a hundred birds were visible from the castle sleeping on the water or laying their feathers in the limpid element though no other offered so favorable a mark as that deerslayer had just pointed out to his friend chingachgook as usual spared his words and proceeded to execution this time his aim was more careful than before and his success in proportion the bird had a wing crippled and fluttered along the water screaming materially increasing its distance from its enemies  that bird must be put out of pain exclaimed deerslayer the moment the animal endeavored to rise on the wing and this is the rifle and the eye to do it  the duck was still floundering along when the fatal bullet overtook it severing the head from the neck as neatly as if it had been done with an axe hist had indulged in a low cry of delight at the success of the young indian but now she affected to frown and resent the greater skill of his friend the chief on the contrary uttered the usual exclamation of pleasure and his smile proved how much he admired and how little he envied  never mind the gal sarpent never mind hists feelins which will neither choke nor drown slay nor beautify said deerslayer laughing tis natral for women to enter into their husbands victories and defeats and you are as good as man and wife so far as prejudyce and frindship go here is a bird over head that will put the pieces to the proof i challenge you to an upward aim with a flying target thats a raal proof and one that needs sartain rifles as well as sartain eyes  the species of eagle that frequents the water and lives on fish was also present and one was hovering at a considerable height above the hut greedily watching for an opportunity to make a swoop its hungry young elevating their heads from a nest that was in sight in the naked summit of a dead pine chingachgook silently turned a new piece against this bird and after carefully watching his time fired a wider circuit than common denoted that the messenger had passed through the air at no great distance from the bird though it missed its object deerslayer whose aim was not more true than it was quick fired as soon as it was certain his friend had missed and the deep swoop that followed left it momentarily doubtful whether the eagle was hit or not the marksman himself however proclaimed his own want of success calling on his friend to seize another rifle for he saw signs on the part of the bird of an intention to quit the spot  i made him wink sarpent i do think his feathers were ruffled but no blood has yet been drawn nor is that old piece fit for so nice and quick a sight quick delaware youve now a better rifle and judith bring out killdeer for this is the occasion to try his merits if he has em  a general movement followed each of the competitors got ready and the girls stood in eager expectation of the result the eagle had made a wide circuit after his low swoop and fanning his way upward once more hovered nearly over the hut at a distance even greater than before chingachgook gazed at him and then expressed his opinion of the impossibility of striking a bird at that great height and while he was so nearly perpendicular as to the range but a low murmur from hist produced a sudden impulse and he fired the result showed how well he had calculated the eagle not even varying his flight sailing round and round in his airy circle and looking down as if in contempt at his foes  now judith cried deerslayer laughing with glistening and delighted eyes well see if killdeer isnt killeagle too give me room sarpent and watch the reason of the aim for by reason any thing may be larned  a careful sight followed and was repeated again and again the bird continuing to rise higher and higher then followed the flash and the report the swift messenger sped upward and at the next instant the bird turned on its side and came swooping down now struggling with one wing and then with the other sometimes whirling in a circuit next fanning desperately as if conscious of its injury until having described several complete circles around the spot it fell heavily into the end of the ark on examining the body it was found that the bullet had pierced it about half way between one of its wings and the breastbone    chapter xxvi       upon two stony tables spread before her     she leand her bosom more than stony hard     there slept th impartial judge and strict restorer     of wrong or right with pain or with reward     there hung the score of all our debts the card     where good and bad and life and death were painted     was never heart of mortal so untainted     but when the roll was read with thousand terrors fainted      giles fletcher christs victory in heaven lxv  weve done an unthoughtful thing sarpentyes judith weve done an unthoughtful thing in taking life with an object no better than vanity exclaimed deerslayer when the delaware held up the enormous bird by its wings and exhibited the dying eyes riveted on its enemies with the gaze that the helpless ever fasten on their destroyers twas more becomin two boys to gratify their feelins in this onthoughtful manner than two warriors on a warpath even though it be their first ahs me well as a punishment ill quit you at once and when i find myself alone with them bloodyminded mingos its more than like ill have occasion to remember that life is sweet even to the beasts of the woods and the fowls of the air there judith theres kildeer take him back agin and keep him for some hand thats more desarving to own such a piece  i know of none as deserving as your own deerslayer answered the girl in haste none but yours shall keep the rifle  if it depended on skill you might be right enough gal but we should know when to use firearms as well as how to use em i havent larnt the first duty yet it seems so keep the piece till i have the sight of a dyin and distressed creatur even though it be only a bird brings wholesome thoughts to a man who dont know how soon his own time may come and who is pretty sartain that it will come afore the sun sets id give back all my vain feelins and rejicins in hand and eye if that poor eagle was only on its nest agin with its young praisin the lord for anything that we can know about the matter for health and strength  the listeners were confounded with this proof of sudden repentance in the hunter and that too for an indulgence so very common that men seldom stop to weigh its consequences or the physical suffering it may bring on the unoffending and helpless the delaware understood what was said though he scarce understood the feelings which had prompted the words and by way of disposing of the difficulty he drew his keen knife and severed the head of the sufferer from its body  what a thing is power continued the hunter and what a thing it is to have it and not to know how to use it its no wonder judith that the great so often fail of their duties when even the little and the humble find it so hard to do whats right and not to do whats wrong then how one evil act brings others ater it now wasnt it for this furlough of mine which must soon take me back to the mingos id find this creaturs nest if i travelled the woods a fortnightthough an eagles nest is soon found by them that understands the birds naturbut id travel a fortnight rather than not find it just to put the young too out of their pain  im glad to hear you say this deerslayer observed hetty and god will be more apt to remember your sorrow for what youve done than the wickedness itself i thought how wicked it was to kill harmless birds while you were shooting and meant to tell you so but i dont know how it happenedi was so curious to see if you could hit an eagle at so great a height that i forgot altogether to speak till the mischief was done  thats it thats just it my good hetty we can all see our faults and mistakes when its too late to help them howsever im glad you didnt speak for i dont think a word or two would have stopped me just at that moment and so the sin stands in its nakedness and not aggravated by any unheeded calls to forbear well well bitter thoughts are hard to be borne at all times but theres times when theyre harder than at others  little did deerslayer know while thus indulging in feelings that were natural to the man and so strictly in accordance with his own unsophisticated and just principles that in the course of the inscrutable providence which so uniformly and yet so mysteriously covers all events with its mantle the very fault he was disposed so severely to censure was to be made the means of determining his own earthly fate the mode and the moment in which he was to feel the influence of this interference it would be premature to relate but both will appear in the course of the succeeding chapters as for the young man he now slowly left the ark like one sorrowing for his misdeeds and seated himself in silence on the platform by this time the sun had ascended to some height and its appearance taken in connection with his present feelings induced him to prepare to depart the delaware got the canoe ready for his friend as soon as apprised of his intention while hist busied herself in making the few arrangements that were thought necessary to his comfort all this was done without ostentation but in a way that left deerslayer fully acquainted with and equally disposed to appreciate the motive when all was ready both returned to the side of judith and hetty neither of whom had moved from the spot where the young hunter sat  the best frinds must often part the last began when he saw the whole party grouped around himyes frindship cant alter the ways of providence and let our feelins be as they may we must part ive often thought theres moments when our words dwell longer on the mind than common and when advice is remembered just because the mouth that gives it isnt likely to give it agin no one knows what will happen in this world and therefore it may be well when frinds separate under a likelihood that the parting may be long to say a few words in kindness as a sort of keepsakes if all but one will go into the ark ill talk to each in turn and what is more ill listen to what you may have to say back agin for its a poor counsellor that wont take as well as give  as the meaning of the speaker was understood the two indians immediately withdrew as desired leaving the sisters however still standing at the young mans side a look of deerslayers induced judith to explain  you can advise hetty as you land she said hastily for i intend that she shall accompany you to the shore  is this wise judith its true that under common sarcumstances a feeble mind is a great protection among redskins but when their feelins are up and theyre bent on revenge its hard to say what may come to pass besides  what were you about to say deerslayer asked judith whose gentleness of voice and manner amounted nearly to tenderness though she struggled hard to keep her emotions and apprehensions in subjection  why simply that there are sights and doins that one even as little gifted with reason and memory as hetty here might better not witness so judith you would do well to let me land alone and to keep your sister back  never fear for me deerslayer put in hetty who comprehended enough of the discourse to know its general drift im feeble minded and that they say is an excuse for going anywhere and what that wont excuse will be overlooked on account of the bible i always carry it is wonderful judith how all sorts of men the trappers as well as the hunters redmen as well as white mingos as well as delawares do reverence and fear the bible  i think you have not the least ground to fear any injury hetty answered the sister and therefore i shall insist on your going to the huron camp with our friend your being there can do no harm not even to yourself and may do great good to deerslayer  this is not a moment judith to dispute and so have the matter your own way returned the young man get yourself ready hetty and go into the canoe for ive a few parting words to say to your sister which can do you no good  judith and her companion continued silent until hetty had so far complied as to leave them alone when deerslayer took up the subject as if it had been interrupted by some ordinary occurrence and in a very matter of fact way  words spoken at parting and which may be the last we ever hear from a frind are not soon forgotten he repeated and so judith i intend to speak to you like a brother seein im not old enough to be your father in the first place i wish to caution you agin your inimies of which two may be said to hant your very footsteps and to beset your ways the first is oncommon good looks which is as dangerous a foe to some young women as a whole tribe of mingos could prove and which calls for great watchfulnessnot to admire and praisebut to distrust and sarcumvent yes good looks may be sarcumvented and fairly outwitted too in order to do this youve only to remember that they melt like the snows and when once gone they never come back agin the seasons come and go judith and if we have winter with storms and frosts and spring with chills and leafless trees we have summer with its sun and glorious skies and fall with its fruits and a garment thrown over the forest that no beauty of the town could rummage out of all the shops in america arth is in an etarnal round the goodness of god bringing back the pleasant when weve had enough of the onpleasant but its not so with good looks they are lent for a short time in youth to be used and not abused and as i never met with a young woman to whom providence has been as bountiful as it has to you judith in this particlar i warn you as it might be with my dyin breath to beware of the inimyfrind or inimy as we deal with the gift  it was so grateful to judith to hear these unequivocal admissions of her personal charms that much would have been forgiven to the man who made them let him be who he might but at that moment and from a far better feeling it would not have been easy for deerslayer seriously to offend her and she listened with a patience which had it been foretold only a week earlier it would have excited her indignation to hear  i understand your meaning deerslayer returned the girl with a meekness and humility that a little surprised her listener and hope to be able to profit by it but you have mentioned only one of the enemies i have to fear who or what is the other  the other is givin way afore your own good sense and judgment i find judith yes hes not as dangerous as i supposed howsever havin opened the subject it will be as well to end it honestly the first inimy you have to be watchful of as ive already told you judith is oncommon good looks and the next is an oncommon knowledge of the sarcumstance if the first is bad the last doesnt in any way mend the matter so far as safety and peace of mind are consarned  how much longer the young man would have gone on in his simple and unsuspecting but well intentioned manner it might not be easy to say had he not been interrupted by his listeners bursting into tears and giving way to an outbreak of feeling which was so much the more violent from the fact that it had been with so much difficulty suppressed at first her sobs were so violent and uncontrollable that deerslayer was a little appalled and he was abundantly repentant from the instant that he discovered how much greater was the effect produced by his words than he had anticipated even the austere and exacting are usually appeased by the signs of contrition but the nature of deerslayer did not require proofs of intense feelings so strong in order to bring him down to a level with the regrets felt by the girl herself he arose as if an adder had stung him and the accents of the mother that soothes her child were scarcely more gentle and winning than the tones of his voice as he now expressed his contrition at having gone so far  it was well meant judith he said but it was not intended to hurt your feelins so much i have overdone the advice i see yes ive overdone it and i crave your pardon for the same frindships an awful thing sometimes it chides us for not having done enough and then agin it speaks in strong words for havin done too much howsever i acknowledge ive overdone the matter and as ive a raal and strong regard for you i rejice to say it inasmuch as it proves how much better you are than my own vanity and consaits had made you out to be  judith now removed her hands from her face her tears had ceased and she unveiled a countenance so winning with the smile which rendered it even radiant that the young man gazed at her for a moment with speechless delight  say no more deerslayer she hastily interposed it pains me to hear you find fault with yourself i know my own weakness all the better now i see that you have discovered it the lesson bitter as i have found it for a moment shall not be forgotten we will not talk any longer of these things for i do not feel myself brave enough for the undertaking and i should not like the delaware or hist or even hetty to notice my weakness farewell deerslayer may god bless and protect you as your honest heart deserves blessings and protection and as i must think he will  judith had so far regained the superiority that properly belonged to her better education high spirit and surpassing personal advantages as to preserve the ascendancy she had thus accidentally obtained and effectually prevented any return to the subject that was as singularly interrupted as it had been singularly introduced the young man permitted her to have every thing her own way and when she pressed his hard hand in both her own he made no resistance but submitted to the homage as quietly and with quite as matter of course a manner as a sovereign would have received a similar tribute from a subject or the mistress from her suitor feeling had flushed the face and illuminated the whole countenance of the girl and her beauty was never more resplendant than when she cast a parting glance at the youth that glance was filled with anxiety interest and gentle pity at the next instant she darted into the hut and was seen no more though she spoke to hist from a window to inform her that their friend expected her appearance  you know enough of redskin natur and redskin usages wahtawah to see the condition i am in on account of this furlough commenced the hunter in delaware as soon as the patient and submissive girl of that people had moved quietly to his side you will therefore best onderstand how onlikely i am ever to talk with you agin ive but little to say but that little comes from long livin among your people and from havin obsarved and noted their usages the life of a woman is hard at the best but i must own though im not opinionated in favor of my own colour that it is harder among the red men than it is among the palefaces this is a pint on which christians may well boast if boasting can be set down for christianity in any manner or form which i rather think it cannot howsever all women have their trials red women have theirn in what i should call the natral way while white women take em innoculated like bear your burthen hist becomingly and remember if it be a little toilsome how much lighter it is than that of most indian women i know the sarpent wellwhat i call cordiallyand he will never be a tyrant to any thing he loves though he will expect to be treated himself like a mohican chief there will be cloudy days in your lodge i suppose for they happen under all usages and among all people but by keepin the windows of the heart open there will always be room for the sunshine to enter you come of a great stock yourself and so does chingachgook its not very likely that either will ever forget the sarcumstance and do any thing to disgrace your forefathers nevertheless likin is a tender plant and never thrives long when watered with tears let the arth around your married happiness be moistened by the dews of kindness  my pale brother is very wise wah will keep in her mind all that his wisdom tells her  thats judicious and womanly hist care in listening and stoutheartedness in holding to good counsel is a wifes great protection and now ask the sarpent to come and speak with me for a moment and carry away with you all my best wishes and prayers i shall think of you hist and of your intended husband let what may come to pass and always wish you well here and hereafter whether the last is to be according to indian idees or christian doctrines  hist shed no tear at parting she was sustained by the high resolution of one who had decided on her course but her dark eyes were luminous with the feelings that glowed within and her pretty countenance beamed with an expression of determination that was in marked and singular contrast to its ordinary gentleness it was but a minute ere the delaware advanced to the side of his friend with the light noiseless tread of an indian  come thisaway sarpent here more out of sight of the women commenced the deerslayer for ive several things to say that mustnt so much as be suspected much less overheard you know too well the natur of furloughs and mingos to have any doubts or misgivins consarnin what is like to happen when i get back to the camp on them two pints therefore a few words will go a great way in the first place chief i wish to say a little about hist and the manner in which you red men treat your wives i suppose its accordin to the gifts of your people that the women should work and the men hunt but theres such a thing as moderation in all matters as for huntin i see no good reason why any limits need be set to that but hist comes of too good a stock to toil like a common drudge one of your means and standin need never want for corn or potatoes or anything that the fields yield therefore i hope the hoe will never be put into the hands of any wife of yourn you know i am not quite a beggar and all i own whether in ammunition skins arms or calicoes i give to hist should i not come back to claim them by the end of the season this will set the maiden up and will buy labor for her for a long time to come i suppose i neednt tell you to love the young woman for that you do already and whomsoever the man raally loves hell be likely enough to cherish nevertheless it can do no harm to say that kind words never rankle while bitter words do i know youre a man sarpent that is less apt to talk in his own lodge than to speak at the council fire but forgetful moments may overtake us all and the practyse of kind doin and kind talkin is a wonderful advantage in keepin peace in a cabin as well as on a hunt  my ears are open returned the delaware gravely the words of my brother have entered so far that they never can fall out again they are like rings that have no end and cannot drop let him speak on the song of the wren and the voice of a friend never tire  i will speak a little longer chief but you will excuse it for the sake of old companionship should i now talk about myself if the worst comes to the worst its not likely therell be much left of me but ashes so a grave would be useless and a sort of vanity on that score im no way particlar though it might be well enough to take a look at the remains of the pile and should any bones or pieces be found twould be more decent to gather them together and bury them than to let them lie for the wolves to gnaw at and howl over these matters can make no great difference in the mind but men of white blood and christian feelins have rather a gift for graves  it shall be done as my brother says returned the indian gravely if his mind is full let him empty it in the bosom of a friend  i thank you sarpent my minds easy enough yes its tolerable easy idees will come uppermost that im not apt to think about in common its true but by striving agin some and lettin other some out all will come right in the long run theres one thing howsever chief that does seem to me to be onreasonable and agin natur though the missionaries say its true and bein of my religion and colour i feel bound to believe them they say an injin may torment and tortur the body to his hearts content and scalp and cut and tear and burn and consume all his inventions and deviltries until nothin is left but ashes and they shall be scattered to the four winds of heaven yet when the trumpet of god shall sound all will come together agin and the man will stand forth in his flesh the same creatur as to looks if not as to feelins that he was afore he was harmed  the missionaries are good menmean well returned the delaware courteously they are not great medicines they think all they say deerslayer that is no reason why warriors and orators should be all ears when chingachgook shall see the father of tamenund standing in his scalp and paint and war lock then will he believe the missionaries  seein is believin of a sartainty ahs meand some of us may see these things sooner than we thought i comprehind your meanin about tamenunds father sarpent and the idees a close idee tamenund is now an elderly man say eighty every day of it and his father was scalped and tormented and burnt when the present prophet was a youngster yes if one could see that come to pass there wouldnt be much difficulty in yieldin faith to all that the missionaries say howsever i am not agin the opinion now for you must know sarpent that the great principle of christianity is to believe without seeing and a man should always act up to his religion and principles let them be what they may  that is strange for a wise nation said the delaware with emphasis the red man looks hard that he may see and understand  yes thats plauserble and is agreeable to mortal pride but its not as deep as it seems if we could understand all we see sarpent there might be not only sense but safety in refusin to give faith to any one thing that we might find oncomperhensible but when theres so many things about which it may be said we know nothin at all why theres little use and no reason in bein difficult touchin any one in particlar for my part delaware all my thoughts havent been on the game when outlyin in the hunts and scoutins of our youth manys the hour ive passed pleasantly enough too in what is tarmed conterplation by my people on such occasions the mind is actyve though the body seems lazy and listless an open spot on a mountain side where a wide look can be had at the heavens and the arth is a most judicious place for a man to get a just idee of the power of the manitou and of his own littleness at such times there isnt any great disposition to find fault with little difficulties in the way of comperhension as there are so many big ones to hide them believin comes easy enough to me at such times and if the lord made man first out of arth as they tell me it is written in the bible then turns him into dust at death i see no great difficulty in the way to bringin him back in the body though ashes be the only substance left these things lie beyond our understandin though they may and do lie so close to our feelins but of all the doctrines sarpent that which disturbs me and disconsarts my mind the most is the one which teaches us to think that a paleface goes to one heaven and a redskin to another it may separate in death them which lived much together and loved each other well in life  do the missionaries teach their white brethren to think it is so demanded the indian with serious earnestness the delawares believe that good men and brave warriors will hunt together in the same pleasant woods let them belong to whatever tribe they may that all the unjust indians and cowards will have to sneak in with the dogs and the wolves to get venison for their lodges  tis wonderful how many consaits mankind have consarnin happiness and misery here after exclaimed the hunter borne away by the power of his own thoughts some believe in burnins and flames and some think punishment is to eat with the wolves and dogs then agin some fancy heaven to be only the carryin out of their own arthly longins while others fancy it all gold and shinin lights well ive an idee of my own in that matter which is just this sarpent whenever ive done wrong ive ginirally found twas owin to some blindness of the mind which hid the right from view and when sight has returned then has come sorrow and repentance now i consait that after death when the body is laid aside or if used at all is purified and without its longins the spirit sees all things in their raal lights and never becomes blind to truth and justice such bein the case all that has been done in life is beheld as plainly as the sun is seen at noon the good brings joy while the evil brings sorrow theres nothin onreasonable in that but its agreeable to every mans experence  i thought the palefaces believed all men were wicked who then could ever find the white mans heaven  thats ingenous but it falls short of the missionary teachins youll be christianized one day i make no doubt and then twill all come plain enough you must know sarpent that theres been a great deed of salvation done that by gods help enables all men to find a pardon for their wickednesses and that is the essence of the white mans religion i cant stop to talk this matter over with you any longer for hettys in the canoe and the furlough takes me away but the time will come i hope when youll feel these things for after all they must be felt rather than reasoned about ahs me well delaware theres my hand you know its that of a frind and will shake it as such though it never has done you one half the good its owner wishes it had  the indian took the offered hand and returned its pressure warmly then falling back on his acquired stoicism of manner which so many mistake for constitutional indifference he drew up in reserve and prepared to part from his friend with dignity deerslayer however was more natural nor would he have at all cared about giving way to his feelings had not the recent conduct and language of judith given him some secret though ill defined apprehensions of a scene he was too humble to imagine the truth concerning the actual feelings of that beautiful girl while he was too observant not to have noted the struggle she had maintained with herself and which had so often led her to the very verge of discovery that something extraordinary was concealed in her breast he thought obvious enough and through a sentiment of manly delicacy that would have done credit to the highest human refinement he shrunk from any exposure of her secret that might subsequently cause regret to the girl herself he therefore determined to depart now and that without any further manifestations of feeling either from him or from others  god bless you sarpentgod bless you cried the hunter as the canoe left the side of the platform your manitou and my god only know when and where we shall meet agin i shall count it a great blessing and a full reward for any little good i may have done on arth if we shall be permitted to know each other and to consort together hereafter as we have so long done in these pleasant woods afore us  chingachgook waved his hand drawing the light blanket he wore over his head as a roman would conceal his grief in his robes he slowly withdrew into the ark in order to indulge his sorrow and his musings alone deerslayer did not speak again until the canoe was halfway to the shore then he suddenly ceased paddling at an interruption that came from the mild musical voice of hetty  why do you go back to the hurons deerslayer demanded the girl they say i am feebleminded and such they never harm but you have as much sense as hurry harry and more too judith thinks though i dont see how that can well be  ah hetty afore we land i must convarse a little with you child and that too on matters touching your own welfare principally stop paddlingor rather that the mingos neednt think we are plotting and contriving and so treat us accordingly just dip your paddle lightly and give the canoe a little motion and no more thats just the idee and the movement i see youre ready enough at an appearance and might be made useful at a sarcumvention if it was lawful now to use onethats just the idee and the movement ahs me desait and a false tongue are evil things and altogether onbecoming our colour hetty but it is a pleasure and a satisfaction to outdo the contrivances of a redskin in the strife of lawful warfare my path has been short and is like soon to have an end but i can see that the wanderings of a warrior arent altogether among brambles and difficulties theres a bright side to a warpath as well as to most other things if well only have the wisdom to see it and the ginerosity to own it  and why should your warpath as you call it come so near to an end deerslayer  because my good girl my furlough comes so near to an end theyre likely to have pretty much the same tarmination as regards time one following on the heels of the other as a matter of course  i dont understand your meaning deerslayer returned the girl looking a little bewildered mother always said people ought to speak more plainly to me than to most other persons because im feeble minded those that are feeble minded dont understand as easily as those that have sense  well then hetty the simple truth is this you know that im now a captyve to the hurons and captyves cant do in all things as they please  but how can you be a captive eagerly interrupted the girlwhen you are out here on the lake in fathers best canoe and the indians are in the woods with no canoe at all that cant be true deerslayer  i wish with all my heart and soul hetty that you was right and that i was wrong instead of your bein all wrong and i bein only too near the truth free as i seem to your eyes gal im bound hand and foot in raality  well it is a great misfortune not to have sense now i cant see or understand that you are a captive or bound in any manner if you are bound with what are your hands and feet fastened  with a furlough gal thats a thong that binds tighter than any chain one may be broken but the other cant ropes and chains allow of knives and desait and contrivances but a furlough can be neither cut slipped nor sarcumvented  what sort of a thing is a furlough then if it be stronger than hemp or iron i never saw a furlough  i hope you may never feel one gal the tie is altogether in the feelins in these matters and therefore is to be felt and not seen you can understand what it is to give a promise i dare to say good little hetty  certainly a promise is to say you will do a thing and that binds you to be as good as your word mother always kept her promises to me and then she said it would be wicked if i didnt keep my promises to her and to every body else  you have had a good mother in some matters child whatever she may have been in other some that is a promise and as you say it must be kept now i fell into the hands of the mingos last night and they let me come off to see my frinds and send messages in to my own colour if any such feel consarn on my account on condition that i shall be back when the sun is up today and take whatever their revenge and hatred can contrive in the way of torments in satisfaction for the life of a warrior that fell by my rifle as well as for that of the young woman shot by hurry and other disappintments met with on and about this lake what is called a promise atween mother and darter or even atween strangers in the settlements is called a furlough when given by one soldier to another on a warpath and now i suppose you understand my situation hetty  the girl made no answer for some time but she ceased paddling altogether as if the novel idea distracted her mind too much to admit of other employment then she resumed the dialogue earnestly and with solicitude  do you think the hurons will have the heart to do what you say deerslayer she asked i have found them kind and harmless  thats true enough as consarns one like you hetty but its a very different affair when it comes to an open inimy and he too the owner of a pretty sartain rifle i dont say that they bear me special malice on account of any explites already performed for that would be bragging as it might be on the varge of the grave but its no vanity to believe that they know one of their bravest and cunninest chiefs fell by my hands such bein the case the tribe would reproach them if they failed to send the spirit of a paleface to keep the company of the spirit of their red brother always supposin that he can catch it i look for no marcy hetty at their hands and my principal sorrow is that such a calamity should befall me on my first warpath that it would come sooner or later every soldier counts on and expects  the hurons shall not harm you deerslayer cried the girl much excitedtis wicked as well as cruel i have the bible here to tell them so do you think i would stand by and see you tormented  i hope not my good hetty i hope not and therefore when the moment comes i expect you will move off and not be a witness of what you cant help while it would grieve you but i havent stopped the paddles to talk of my own afflictions and difficulties but to speak a little plainly to you gal consarnin your own matters  what can you have to say to me deerslayer since mother died few talk to me of such things  so much the worse poor gal yes tis so much the worse for one of your state of mind needs frequent talking to in order to escape the snares and desaits of this wicked world you havent forgotten hurry harry gal so soon i calculate  ii forget henry march exclaimed hetty starting why should i forget him deerslayer when he is our friend and only left us last night then the large bright star that mother loved so much to gaze at was just over the top of yonder tall pine on the mountain as hurry got into the canoe and when you landed him on the point near the east bay it wasnt more than the length of judiths handsomest ribbon above it  and how can you know how long i was gone or how far i went to land hurry seein you were not with us and the distance was so great to say nothing of the night  oh i know when it was well enough returned hetty positivelytheres more ways than one for counting time and distance when the mind is engaged it is better than any clock mine is feeble i know but it goes true enough in all that touches poor hurry harry judith will never marry march deerslayer  thats the pint hetty thats the very pint i want to come to i suppose you know that its natral for young people to have kind feelins for one another more especially when one happens to be a youth and tother a maiden now one of your years and mind gal that has neither father nor mother and who lives in a wilderness frequented by hunters and trappers needs be on her guard against evils she little dreams of  what harm can it be to think well of a fellow creature returned hetty simply though the conscious blood was stealing to her cheeks in spite of a spirit so pure that it scarce knew why it prompted the blush the bible tells us to love them who despitefully use us and why shouldnt we like them that do not  ah hetty the love of the missionaries isnt the sort of likin i

perceiving his impatience without very clearly comprehending its cause however seconded his efforts in a way that soon rendered their timely return no longer a matter of doubt then and then only did the young man suffer his exertions to flag and hetty began again to prattle in her simple confiding manner though nothing farther was uttered that it may be thought necessary to relate    chapter xxvii       thou hast been busy death this day and yet     but half thy work is done  the gates of hell     are thronged yet twice ten thousand spirits more     who from their warm and healthful tenements     fear no divorce must ere the sun go down     enter the world of woe      southey roderick the last of the goths xxiv i6  one experienced in the signs of the heavens would have seen that the sun wanted but two or three minutes of the zenith when deerslayer landed on the point where the hurons were now encamped nearly abreast of the castle this spot was similar to the one already described with the exception that the surface of the land was less broken and less crowded with trees owing to these two circumstances it was all the better suited to the purpose for which it had been selected the space beneath the branches bearing some resemblance to a densely wooded lawn favoured by its position and its spring it had been much resorted to by savages and hunters and the natural grasses had succeeded their fires leaving an appearance of sward in places a very unusual accompaniment of the virgin forest nor was the margin of water fringed with bushes as on so much of its shore but the eye penetrated the woods immediately on reaching the strand commanding nearly the whole area of the projection  if it was a point of honor with the indian warrior to redeem his word when pledged to return and meet his death at a given hour so was it a point of characteristic pride to show no womanish impatience but to reappear as nearly as possible at the appointed moment it was well not to exceed the grace accorded by the generosity of the enemy but it was better to meet it to a minute something of this dramatic effect mingles with most of the graver usages of the american aborigines and no doubt like the prevalence of a similar feeling among people more sophisticated and refined may be referred to a principle of nature we all love the wonderful and when it comes attended by chivalrous selfdevotion and a rigid regard to honor it presents itself to our admiration in a shape doubly attractive as respects deerslayer though he took a pride in showing his white blood by often deviating from the usages of the redmen he frequently dropped into their customs and oftener into their feelings unconsciously to himself in consequence of having no other arbiters to appeal to than their judgments and tastes on the present occasion he would have abstained from betraying a feverish haste by a too speedy return since it would have contained a tacit admission that the time asked for was more than had been wanted but on the other hand had the idea occurred to him he would have quickened his movements a little in order to avoid the dramatic appearance of returning at the precise instant set as the utmost limit of his absence still accident had interfered to defeat the last intention for when the young man put his foot on the point and advanced with a steady tread towards the group of chiefs that was seated in grave array on a fallen tree the oldest of their number cast his eye upward at an opening in the trees and pointed out to his companions the startling fact that the sun was just entering a space that was known to mark the zenith a common but low exclamation of surprise and admiration escaped every mouth and the grim warriors looked at each other some with envy and disappointment some with astonishment at the precise accuracy of their victim and others with a more generous and liberal feeling the american indian always deemed his moral victories the noblest prizing the groans and yielding of his victim under torture more than the trophy of his scalp and the trophy itself more than his life to slay and not to bring off the proof of victory indeed was scarcely deemed honorable even these rude and fierce tenants of the forest like their more nurtured brethren of the court and the camp having set up for themselves imaginary and arbitrary points of honor to supplant the conclusions of the right and the decisions of reason  the hurons had been divided in their opinions concerning the probability of their captives return most among them indeed had not expected it possible for a paleface to come back voluntarily and meet the known penalties of an indian torture but a few of the seniors expected better things from one who had already shown himself so singularly cool brave and upright the party had come to its decision however less in the expectation of finding the pledge redeemed than in the hope of disgracing the delawares by casting into their teeth the delinquency of one bred in their villages they would have greatly preferred that chingachgook should be their prisoner and prove the traitor but the paleface scion of the hated stock was no bad substitute for their purposes failing in their designs against the ancient stem with a view to render their triumph as signal as possible in the event of the hours passing without the reappearance of the hunter all the warriors and scouts of the party had been called in and the whole band men women and children was now assembled at this single point to be a witness of the expected scene as the castle was in plain view and by no means distant it was easily watched by daylight and it being thought that its inmates were now limited to hurry the delaware and the two girls no apprehensions were felt of their being able to escape unseen a large raft having a breastwork of logs had been prepared and was in actual readiness to be used against either ark or castle as occasion might require so soon as the fate of deerslayer was determined the seniors of the party having come to the opinion that it was getting to be hazardous to delay their departure for canada beyond the coming night in short the band waited merely to dispose of this single affair ere it brought matters with those in the castle to a crisis and prepared to commence its retreat towards the distant waters of ontario  it was an imposing scene into which deerslayer now found himself advancing all the older warriors were seated on the trunk of the fallen tree waiting his approach with grave decorum on the right stood the young men armed while left was occupied by the women and children in the centre was an open space of considerable extent always canopied by trees but from which the underbrush dead wood and other obstacles had been carefully removed the more open area had probably been much used by former parties for this was the place where the appearance of a sward was the most decided the arches of the woods even at high noon cast their sombre shadows on the spot which the brilliant rays of the sun that struggled through the leaves contributed to mellow and if such an expression can be used to illuminate it was probably from a similar scene that the mind of man first got its idea of the effects of gothic tracery and churchly hues this temple of nature producing some such effect so far as light and shadow were concerned as the wellknown offspring of human invention  as was not unusual among the tribes and wandering bands of the aborigines two chiefs shared in nearly equal degrees the principal and primitive authority that was wielded over these children of the forest there were several who might claim the distinction of being chief men but the two in question were so much superior to all the rest in influence that when they agreed no one disputed their mandates and when they were divided the band hesitated like men who had lost their governing principle of action it was also in conformity with practice perhaps we might add in conformity with nature that one of the chiefs was indebted to his mind for his influence whereas the other owed his distinction altogether to qualities that were physical one was a senior well known for eloquence in debate wisdom in council and prudence in measures while his great competitor if not his rival was a brave distinguished in war notorious for ferocity and remarkable in the way of intellect for nothing but the cunning and expedients of the war path the first was rivenoak who has already been introduced to the reader while the last was called le panthere in the language of the canadas or the panther to resort to the vernacular of the english colonies the appellation of the fighting chief was supposed to indicate the qualities of the warrior agreeably to a practice of the red mans nomenclature ferocity cunning and treachery being perhaps the distinctive features of his character the title had been received from the french and was prized so much the more from that circumstance the indian submitting profoundly to the greater intelligence of his paleface allies in most things of this nature how well the sobriquet was merited will be seen in the sequel  rivenoak and the panther sat side by side awaiting the approach of their prisoner as deerslayer put his moccasined foot on the strand nor did either move or utter a syllable until the young man had advanced into the centre of the area and proclaimed his presence with his voice this was done firmly though in the simple manner that marked the character of the individual  here i am mingos he said in the dialect of the delawares a language that most present understood here i am and there is the sun one is not more true to the laws of natur than the other has proved true to his word i am your prisoner do with me what you please my business with man and arth is settled nothing remains now but to meet the white mans god accordin to a white mans duties and gifts  a murmur of approbation escaped even the women at this address and for an instant there was a strong and pretty general desire to adopt into the tribe one who owned so brave a spirit still there were dissenters from this wish among the principal of whom might be classed the panther and his sister le sumach so called from the number of her children who was the widow of le loup cervier now known to have fallen by the hand of the captive native ferocity held one in subjection while the corroding passion of revenge prevented the other from admitting any gentler feeling at the moment not so with rivenoak this chief arose stretched his arm before him in a gesture of courtesy and paid his compliments with an ease and dignity that a prince might have envied as in that band his wisdom and eloquence were confessedly without rivals he knew that on himself would properly fall the duty of first replying to the speech of the paleface  paleface you are honest said the huron orator my people are happy in having captured a man and not a skulking fox we now know you we shall treat you like a brave if you have slain one of our warriors and helped to kill others you have a life of your own ready to give away in return some of my young men thought that the blood of a paleface was too thin that it would refuse to run under the huron knife you will show them it is not so your heart is stout as well as your body it is a pleasure to make such a prisoner should my warriors say that the death of le loup cervier ought not to be forgotten and that he cannot travel towards the land of spirits alone that his enemy must be sent to overtake him they will remember that he fell by the hand of a brave and send you after him with such signs of our friendship as shall not make him ashamed to keep your company i have spoken you know what i have said  true enough mingo all true as the gospel returned the simple minded hunter you have spoken and i do know not only what you have said but what is still more important what you mean i dare to say your warrior the lynx was a stouthearted brave and worthy of your frindship and respect but i do not feel unworthy to keep his company without any passport from your hands nevertheless here i am ready to receive judgment from your council if indeed the matter was not detarmined among you afore i got back  my old men would not sit in council over a paleface until they saw him among them answered rivenoak looking around him a little ironically they said it would be like sitting in council over the winds they go where they will and come back as they see fit and not otherwise there was one voice that spoke in your favor deerslayer but it was alone like the song of the wren whose mate has been struck by the hawk  i thank that voice whosever it may have been mingo and will say it was as true a voice as the rest were lying voices a furlough is as binding on a paleface if he be honest as it is on a redskin and was it not so i would never bring disgrace on the delawares among whom i may be said to have received my edication but words are useless and lead to braggin feelins here i am act your will on me  rivenoak made a sign of acquiescence and then a short conference was privately held among the chiefs as soon as the latter ended three or four young men fell back from among the armed group and disappeared then it was signified to the prisoner that he was at liberty to go at large on the point until a council was held concerning his fate there was more of seeming than of real confidence however in this apparent liberality inasmuch as the young men mentioned already formed a line of sentinels across the breadth of the point inland and escape from any other part was out of the question even the canoe was removed beyond this line of sentinels to a spot where it was considered safe from any sudden attempt these precautions did not proceed from a failure of confidence but from the circumstance that the prisoner had now complied with all the required conditions of his parole and it would have been considered a commendable and honorable exploit to escape from his foes so nice indeed were the distinctions drawn by the savages in cases of this nature that they often gave their victims a chance to evade the torture deeming it as creditable to the captors to overtake or to outwit a fugitive when his exertions were supposed to be quickened by the extreme jeopardy of his situation as it was for him to get clear from so much extraordinary vigilance  nor was deerslayer unconscious of or forgetful of his rights and of his opportunities could he now have seen any probable opening for an escape the attempt would not have been delayed a minute but the case seemd desperate he was aware of the line of sentinels and felt the difficulty of breaking through it unharmed the lake offered no advantages as the canoe would have given his foes the greatest facilities for overtaking him else would he have found it no difficult task to swim as far as the castle as he walked about the point he even examined the spot to ascertain if it offered no place of concealment but its openness its size and the hundred watchful glances that were turned towards him even while those who made them affected not to see him prevented any such expedient from succeeding the dread and disgrace of failure had no influence on deerslayer who deemed it even a point of honor to reason and feel like a white man rather than as an indian and who felt it a sort of duty to do all he could that did not involve a dereliction from principle in order to save his life still he hesitated about making the effort for he also felt that he ought to see the chance of success before he committed himself  in the mean time the business of the camp appeared to proceed in its regular train the chiefs consulted apart admitting no one but the sumach to their councils for she the widow of the fallen warrior had an exclusive right to be heard on such an occasion the young men strolled about in indolent listlessness awaiting the result with indian patience while the females prepared the feast that was to celebrate the termination of the affair whether it proved fortunate or otherwise for our hero no one betrayed feeling and an indifferent observer beyond the extreme watchfulness of the sentinels would have detected no extraordinary movement or sensation to denote the real state of things two or three old women put their heads together and it appeared unfavorably to the prospects of deerslayer by their scowling looks and angry gestures but a group of indian girls were evidently animated by a different impulse as was apparent by stolen glances that expressed pity and regret in this condition of the camp an hour soon glided away  suspense is perhaps the feeling of all others that is most difficult to be supported when deerslayer landed he fully expected in the course of a few minutes to undergo the tortures of an indian revenge and he was prepared to meet his fate manfully but the delay proved far more trying than the nearer approach of suffering and the intended victim began seriously to meditate some desperate effort at escape as it might be from sheer anxiety to terminate the scene when he was suddenly summoned to appear once more in front of his judges who had already arranged the band in its former order in readiness to receive him  killer of the deer commenced rivenoak as soon as his captive stood before him my aged men have listened to wise words they are ready to speak you are a man whose fathers came from beyond the rising sun we are children of the setting sun we turn our faces towards the great sweet lakes when we look towards our villages it may be a wide country and full of riches towards the morning but it is very pleasant towards the evening we love most to look in that direction when we gaze at the east we feel afraid canoe after canoe bringing more and more of your people in the track of the sun as if their land was so full as to run over the red men are few already they have need of help one of our best lodges has lately been emptied by the death of its master it will be a long time before his son can grow big enough to sit in his place there is his widow she will want venison to feed her and her children for her sons are yet like the young of the robin before they quit the nest by your hand has this great calamity befallen her she has two duties one to le loup cervier and one to his children scalp for scalp life for life blood for blood is one law to feed her young another we know you killer of the deer you are honest when you say a thing it is so you have but one tongue and that is not forked like a snakes your head is never hid in the grass all can see it what you say that will you do you are just when you have done wrong it is your wish to do right again as soon as you can here is the sumach she is alone in her wigwam with children crying around her for foodyonder is a rifle it is loaded and ready to be fired take the gun go forth and shoot a deer bring the venison and lay it before the widow of le loup cervier feed her children call yourself her husband after which your heart will no longer be delaware but huron le sumachs ears will not hear the cries of her children my people will count the proper number of warriors  i feard this rivenoak answered deerslayer when the other had ceased speakingyes i did dread that it would come to this howsever the truth is soon told and that will put an end to all expectations on this head mingo im white and christian born t would ill become me to take a wife under redskin forms from among heathen that which i wouldnt do in peaceable times and under a bright sun still less would i do behind clouds in order to save my life i may never marry most likely providence in putting me up here in the woods has intended i should live single and without a lodge of my own but should such a thing come to pass none but a woman of my own colour and gifts shall darken the door of my wigwam as for feeding the young of your dead warrior i would do that cheerfully could it be done without discredit but it cannot seeing that i can never live in a huron village your own young men must find the sumach in venison and the next time she marries let her take a husband whose legs are not long enough to overrun territory that dont belong to him we fout a fair battle and he fell in this there is nothin but what a brave expects and should be ready to meet as for getting a mingo heart as well might you expect to see gray hairs on a boy or the blackberry growing on the pine nono huron my gifts are white so far as wives are consarned it is delaware in all things touchin injins  these words were scarcely out of the mouth of deerslayer before a common murmur betrayed the dissatisfaction with which they had been heard the aged women in particular were loud in their expressions of disgust and the gentle sumach herself a woman quite old enough to be our heros mother was not the least pacific in her denunciations but all the other manifestations of disappointment and discontent were thrown into the background by the fierce resentment of the panther this grim chief had thought it a degradation to permit his sister to become the wife of a paleface of the yengeese at all and had only given a reluctant consent to the arrangementone by no means unusual among the indians howeverat the earnest solicitations of the bereaved widow and it goaded him to the quick to find his condescension slighted the honor he had with so much regret been persuaded to accord condemned the animal from which he got his name does not glare on his intended prey with more frightful ferocity than his eyes gleamed on the captive nor was his arm backward in seconding the fierce resentment that almost consumed his breast  dog of the palefaces he exclaimed in iroquois go yell among the curs of your own evil hunting grounds  the denunciation was accompanied by an appropriate action even while speaking his arm was lifted and the tomahawk hurled luckily the loud tones of the speaker had drawn the eye of deerslayer towards him else would that moment have probably closed his career so great was the dexterity with which this dangerous weapon was thrown and so deadly the intent that it would have riven the scull of the prisoner had he not stretched forth an arm and caught the handle in one of its turns with a readiness quite as remarkable as the skill with which the missile had been hurled the projectile force was so great notwithstanding that when deerslayers arm was arrested his hand was raised above and behind his own head and in the very attitude necessary to return the attack it is not certain whether the circumstance of finding himself unexpectedly in this menacing posture and armed tempted the young man to retaliate or whether sudden resentment overcame his forbearance and prudence his eye kindled however and a small red spot appeared on each cheek while he cast all his energy into the effort of his arm and threw back the weapon at his assailant the unexpectedness of this blow contributed to its success the panther neither raising an arm nor bending his head to avoid it the keen little axe struck the victim in a perpendicular line with the nose directly between the eyes literally braining him on the spot sallying forward as the serpent darts at its enemy even while receiving its own death wound this man of powerful frame fell his length into the open area formed by the circle quivering in death a common rush to his relief left the captive in a single instant quite without the crowd and willing to make one desperate effort for life he bounded off with the activity of a deer there was but a breathless instant when the whole band old and young women and children abandoning the lifeless body of the panther where it lay raised the yell of alarm and followed in pursuit  sudden as had been the event which induced deerslayer to make this desperate trial of speed his mind was not wholly unprepared for the fearful emergency in the course of the past hour he had pondered well on the chances of such an experiment and had shrewdly calculated all the details of success and failure at the first leap therefore his body was completely under the direction of an intelligence that turned all its efforts to the best account and prevented everything like hesitation or indecision at the important instant of the start to this alone was he indebted for the first great advantage that of getting through the line of sentinels unharmed the manner in which this was done though sufficiently simple merits a description  although the shores of the point were not fringed with bushes as was the case with most of the others on the lake it was owing altogether to the circumstance that the spot had been so much used by hunters and fishermen this fringe commenced on what might be termed the main land and was as dense as usual extending in long lines both north and south in the latter direction then deerslayer held his way and as the sentinels were a little without the commencement of this thicket before the alarm was clearly communicated to them the fugitive had gained its cover to run among the bushes however was out of the question and deerslayer held his way for some forty or fifty yards in the water which was barely knee deep offering as great an obstacle to the speed of his pursuers as it did to his own as soon as a favorable spot presented he darted through the line of bushes and issued into the open woods several rifles were discharged at deerslayer while in the water and more followed as he came out into the comparative exposure of the clear forest but the direction of his line of flight which partially crossed that of the fire the haste with which the weapons had been aimed and the general confusion that prevailed in the camp prevented any harm from being done bullets whistled past him and many cut twigs from the branches at his side but not one touched even his dress the delay caused by these fruitless attempts was of great service to the fugitive who had gained more than a hundred yards on even the leading men of the hurons ere something like concert and order had entered into the chase to think of following with rifles in hand was out of the question and after emptying their pieces in vague hopes of wounding their captive the best runners of the indians threw them aside calling out to the women and boys to recover and load them again as soon as possible  deerslayer knew too well the desperate nature of the struggle in which he was engaged to lose one of the precious moments he also knew that his only hope was to run in a straight line for as soon as he began to turn or double the greater number of his pursuers would put escape out of the question he held his way therefore in a diagonal direction up the acclivity which was neither very high nor very steep in this part of the mountain but which was sufficiently toilsome for one contending for life to render it painfully oppressive there however he slackened his speed to recover breath proceeding even at a quick walk or a slow trot along the more difficult parts of the way the hurons were whooping and leaping behind him but this he disregarded well knowing they must overcome the difficulties he had surmounted ere they could reach the elevation to which he had attained the summit of the first hill was now quite near him and he saw by the formation of the land that a deep glen intervened before the base of a second hill could be reached walking deliberately to the summit he glanced eagerly about him in every direction in quest of a cover none offered in the ground but a fallen tree lay near him and desperate circumstances required desperate remedies this tree lay in a line parallel to the glen at the brow of the hill to leap on it and then to force his person as close as possible under its lower side took but a moment previously to disappearing from his pursuers however deerslayer stood on the height and gave a cry of triumph as if exulting at the sight of the descent that lay before him in the next instant he was stretched beneath the tree  no sooner was this expedient adopted than the young man ascertained how desperate had been his own efforts by the violence of the pulsations in his frame he could hear his heart beat and his breathing was like the action of a bellows in quick motion breath was gained however and the heart soon ceased to throb as if about to break through its confinement the footsteps of those who toiled up the opposite side of the acclivity were now audible and presently voices and treads announced the arrival of the pursuers the foremost shouted as they reached the height then fearful that their enemy would escape under favor of the descent each leaped upon the fallen tree and plunged into the ravine trusting to get a sight of the pursued ere he reached the bottom in this manner huron followed huron until natty began to hope the whole had passed others succeeded however until quite forty had leaped over the tree and then he counted them as the surest mode of ascertaining how many could be behind presently all were in the bottom of the glen quite a hundred feet below him and some had even ascended part of the opposite hill when it became evident an inquiry was making as to the direction he had taken this was the critical moment and one of nerves less steady or of a training that had been neglected would have seized it to rise and fly not so with deerslayer he still lay quiet watching with jealous vigilance every movement below and fast regaining his breath  the hurons now resembled a pack of hounds at fault little was said but each man ran about examining the dead leaves as the hound hunts for the lost scent the great number of moccasins that had passed made the examination difficult though the intoe of an indian was easily to be distinguished from the freer and wider step of a white man believing that no more pursuers remained behind and hoping to steal away unseen deerslayer suddenly threw himself over the tree and fell on the upper side this achievement appeared to be effected successfully and hope beat high in the bosom of the fugitive  rising to his hands and feet after a moment lost in listening to the sounds in the glen in order to ascertain if he had been seen the young man next scrambled to the top of the hill a distance of only ten yards in the expectation of getting its brow between him and his pursuers and himself so far under cover even this was effected and he rose to his feet walking swiftly but steadily along the summit in a direction opposite to that in which he had first fled the nature of the calls in the glen however soon made him uneasy and he sprang upon the summit again in order to reconnoitre no sooner did he reach the height than he was seen and the chase renewed as it was better footing on the level ground deerslayer now avoided the side hill holding his flight along the ridge while the hurons judging from the general formation of the land saw that the ridge would soon melt into the hollow and kept to the latter as the easiest mode of heading the fugitive a few at the same time turned south with a view to prevent his escaping in that direction while some crossed his trail towards the water in order to prevent his retreat by the lake running southerly  the situation of deerslayer was now more critical than it ever had been he was virtually surrounded on three sides having the lake on the fourth but he had pondered well on all the chances and took his measures with coolness even while at the top of his speed as is generally the case with the vigorous border men he could outrun any single indian among his pursuers who were principally formidable to him on account of their numbers and the advantages they possessed in position and he would not have hesitated to break off in a straight line at any spot could he have got the whole band again fairly behind him but no such chance did or indeed could now offer and when he found that he was descending towards the glen by the melting away of the ridge he turned short at right angles to his previous course and went down the declivity with tremendous velocity holding his way towards the shore some of his pursuers came panting up the hill in direct chase while most still kept on in the ravine intending to head him at its termination  deerslayer had now a different though a desperate project in view abandoning all thoughts of escape by the woods he made the best of his way towards the canoe he knew where it lay could it be reached he had only to run the gauntlet of a few rifles and success would be certain none of the warriors had kept their weapons which would have retarded their speed and the risk would come either from the uncertain hands of the women or from those of some well grown boy though most of the latter were already out in hot pursuit everything seemed propitious to the execution of this plan and the course being a continued descent the young man went over the ground at a rate that promised a speedy termination to his toil  as deerslayer approached the point several women and children were passed but though the former endeavoured to cast dried branches between his legs the terror inspired by his bold retaliation on the redoubted panther was so great that none dared come near enough seriously to molest him he went by all triumphantly and reached the fringe of bushes plunging through these our hero found himself once more in the lake and within fifty feet of the canoe here he ceased to run for he well understood that his breath was now all important to him he even stooped as he advanced and cooled his parched mouth by scooping water up in his hand to drink still the moments pressed and he soon stood at the side of the canoe the first glance told him that the paddles had been removed this was a sore disappointment after all his efforts and for a single moment he thought of turning and of facing his foes by walking with dignity into the centre of the camp again but an infernal yell such as the american savage alone can raise proclaimed the quick approach of the nearest of his pursuers and the instinct of life triumphed preparing himself duly and giving a right direction to its bows he ran off into the water bearing the canoe before him threw all his strength and skill into a last effort and cast himself forward so as to fall into the bottom of the light craft without materially impeding its way here he remained on his back both to regain his breath and to cover his person from the deadly rifle the lightness which was such an advantage in paddling the canoe now operated unfavorably the material was so like a feather that the boat had no momentum else would the impulse in that smooth and placid sheet have impelled it to a distance from the shore that would have rendered paddling with the hands safe could such a point once be reached deerslayer thought he might get far enough out to attract the attention of chingachgook and judith who would not fail to come to his relief with other canoes a circumstance that promised everything as the young man lay in the bottom of the canoe he watched its movements by studying the tops of the trees on the mountainside and judged of his distance by the time and the motions voices on the shore were now numerous and he heard something said about manning the raft which fortunately for the fugitive lay at a considerable distance on the other side of the point  perhaps the situation of deerslayer had not been more critical that day than it was at this moment it certainly had not been one half as tantalizing he lay perfectly quiet for two or three minutes trusting to the single sense of hearing confident that the noise in the lake would reach his ears did any one venture to approach by swimming once or twice he fancied that the element was stirred by the cautious movement of an arm and then he perceived it was the wash of the water on the pebbles of the strand for in mimicry of the ocean it is seldom that those little lakes are so totally tranquil as not to possess a slight heaving and setting on their shores suddenly all the voices ceased and a death like stillness pervaded the spot a quietness as profound as if all lay in the repose of inanimate life by this time the canoe had drifted so far as to render nothing visible to deerslayer as he lay on his back except the blue void of space and a few of those brighter rays that proceed from the effulgence of the sun marking his proximity it was not possible to endure this uncertainty long the young man well knew that the profound stillness foreboded evil the savages never being so silent as when about to strike a blow resembling the stealthy foot of the panther ere he takes his leap he took out a knife and was about to cut a hole through the bark in order to get a view of the shore when he paused from a dread of being seen in the operation which would direct the enemy where to aim their bullets at this instant a rifle was fired and the ball pierced both sides of the canoe within eighteen inches of the spot where his head lay this was close work but our hero had too lately gone through that which was closer to be appalled he lay still half a minute longer and then he saw the summit of an oak coming slowly within his narrow horizon  unable to account for this change deerslayer could restrain his impatience no longer hitching his body along with the utmost caution he got his eye at the bullet hole and fortunately commanded a very tolerable view of the point the canoe by one of those imperceptible impulses that so often decide the fate of men as well as the course of things had inclined southerly and was slowly drifting down the lake it was lucky that deerslayer had given it a shove sufficiently vigorous to send it past the end of the point ere it took this inclination or it must have gone ashore again as it was it drifted so near it as to bring the tops of two or three trees within the range of the young mans view as has been mentioned and indeed to come in quite as close proximity with the extremity of the point as was at all safe the distance could not much have exceeded a hundred feet though fortunately a light current of air from the southwest began to set it slowly off shore  deerslayer now felt the urgent necessity of resorting to some expedient to get farther from his foes and if possible to apprise his friends of his situation the distance rendered the last difficult while the proximity to the point rendered the first indispensable as was usual in such craft a large round smooth stone was in each end of the canoe for the double purpose of seats and ballast one of these was within reach of his feet this stone he contrived to get so far between his legs as to reach it with his hands and then he managed to roll it to the side of its fellow in the bows where the two served to keep the trim of the light boat while he worked his own body as far aft as possible before quitting the shore and as soon as he perceived that the paddles were gone deerslayer had thrown a bit of dead branch into the canoe and this was within reach of his arm removing the cap he wore he put it on the end of this stick and just let it appear over the edge of the canoe as far as possible from his own person this ruse was scarcely adopted before the young man had a proof how much he had underrated the intelligence of his enemies in contempt of an artifice so shallow and common place a bullet was fired directly through another part of the canoe which actually raised his skin he dropped the cap and instantly raised it immediately over his head as a safeguard it would seem that this second artifice was unseen or what was more probable the hurons feeling certain of recovering their captive wished to take him alive  deerslayer lay passive a few minutes longer his eye at the bullet hole however and much did he rejoice at seeing that he was drifting gradually farther and farther from the shore when he looked upward the treetops had disappeared but he soon found that the canoe was slowly turning so as to prevent his getting a view of anything at his peephole but of the two extremities of the lake he now bethought him of the stick which was crooked and offered some facilities for rowing without the necessity of rising the experiment succeeded on trial better even than he had hoped though his great embarrassment was to keep the canoe straight that his present manoeuvre was seen soon became apparent by the clamor on the shore and a bullet entering the stern of the canoe traversed its length whistling between the arms of our hero and passed out at the head this satisfied the fugitive that he was getting away with tolerable speed and induced him to increase his efforts he was making a stronger push than common when another messenger from the point broke the stick outboard and at once deprived him of his oar as the sound of voices seemed to grow more and more distant however deerslayer determined to leave all to the drift until he believed himself beyond the reach of bullets this was nervous work but it was the wisest of all the expedients that offered and the young man was encouraged to persevere in it by the circumstance that he felt his face fanned by the air a proof that there was a little more wind    chapter xxviii       nor widows tears nor tender orphans cries     can stop th invaders force     nor swelling seas nor threatening skies     prevent the pirates course     their lives to selfish ends decreed     through blood and rapine they proceed     no anxious thoughts of ill repute     suspend the impetuous and unjust pursuit     but power and wealth obtaind guilty and great     their fellow creatures fears they raise or urge their hate      congreve pindaric ode ii  by this time deerslayer had been twenty minutes in the canoe and he began to grow a little impatient for some signs of relief from his friends the position of the boat still prevented his seeing in any direction unless it were up or down the lake and though he knew that his line of sight must pass within a hundred yards of the castle it in fact passed that distance to the westward of the buildings the profound stillness troubled him also for he knew not whether to ascribe it to the increasing space between him and the indians or to some new artifice at length wearied with fruitless watchfulness the young man turned himself on his back closed his eyes and awaited the result in determined acquiescence if the savages could so completely control their thirst for revenge he was resolved to be as calm as themselves and to trust his fate to the interposition of the currents and air  some additional ten minutes may have passed in this quiescent manner on both sides when deerslayer thought he heard a slight noise like a low rubbing against the bottom of his canoe he opened his eyes of course in expectation of seeing the face or arm of an indian rising from the water and found that a canopy of leaves was impending directly over his head starting to his feet the first object that met his eye was rivenoak who had so far aided the slow progress of the boat as to draw it on the point the grating on the strand being the sound that had first given our hero the alarm the change in the drift of the canoe had been altogether owing to the baffling nature of the light currents of the air aided by some eddies in the water  come said the huron with a quiet gesture of authority to order his prisoner to land my young friend has sailed about till he is tired he will forget how to run again unless he uses his legs  youve the best of it huron returned deerslayer stepping steadily from the canoe and passively following his leader to the open area of the point providence has helped you in an onexpected manner im your prisoner agin and i hope youll allow that im as good at breaking gaol as i am at keeping furloughs  my young friend is a moose exclaimed the huron his legs are very long they have given my young men trouble but he is not a fish he cannot find his way in the lake we did not shoot him fish are taken in nets and not killed by bullets when he turns moose again he will be treated like a moose  ay have your talk rivenoak make the most of your advantage tis your right i suppose and i know it is your gift on that pint therell be no words atween us for all men must and ought to follow their gifts howsever when your women begin to tant and abuse me as i suppose will soon happen let em remember that if a paleface struggles for life so long as its lawful and manful he knows how to loosen his hold on it decently when he feels that the time has come im your captyve work your will on me  my brother has had a long run on the hills and a pleasant sail on the water returned rivenoak more mildly smiling at the same time in a way that his listener knew denoted pacific intentions he has seen the woods he has seen the water which does he like best perhaps he has seen enough to change his mind and make him hear reason  speak out huron something is in your thoughts and the sooner it is said the sooner youll get my answer  that is straight there is no turning in the talk of my paleface friend though he is a fox in running i will speak to him his ears are now open wider than before and his eyes are not shut the sumach is poorer than ever once she had a brother and a husband she had children too the time came and the husband started for the happy hunting grounds without saying farewell he left her alone with his children this he could not help or he would not have done it le loup cervier was a good husband it was pleasant to see the venison and wild ducks and geese and bears meat that hung in his lodge in winter it is now gone it will not keep in warm weather who shall bring it back again some thought the brother would not forget his sister and that next winter he would see that the lodge should not be empty we thought this but the panther yelled and followed the husband on the path of death they are now trying which shall first reach the happy hunting grounds some think the lynx can run fastest and some think the panther can jump the farthest the sumach thinks both will travel so fast and so far that neither will ever come back who shall feed her and her young the man who told her husband and her brother to quit her lodge that there might be room for him to come into it he is a great hunter and we know that the woman will never want  ay huron this is soon settled accordin to your notions but it goes sorely agin the grain of a white mans feelins ive heard of mens saving their lives thisaway and ive knowd them that would prefar death to such a sort of captivity for my part i do not seek my end nor do i seek matrimony  the paleface will think of this while my people get ready for the council he will be told what will happen let him remember how hard it is to lose a husband and a brother go when we want him the name of deerslayer will be called  this conversation had been held with no one near but the speakers of all the band that had so lately thronged the place rivenoak alone was visible the rest seemed to have totally abandoned the spot even the furniture clothes arms and other property of the camp had entirely disappeared and the place bore no other proofs of the crowd that had so lately occupied it than the traces of their fires and resting places and the trodden earth that still showed the marks of their feet so sudden and unexpected a change caused deerslayer a good deal of surprise and some uneasiness for he had never known it to occur in the course of his experience among the delawares he suspected however and rightly that a change of encampment was intended and that the mystery of the movement was resorted to in order to work on his apprehensions  rivenoak walked up the vista of trees as soon as he ceased speaking leaving deerslayer by himself the chief disappeared behind the covers of the forest and one unpractised in such scenes might have believed the prisoner left to the dictates of his own judgment but the young man while he felt a little amazement at the dramatic aspect of things knew his enemies too well to fancy himself at liberty or a free agent still he was ignorant how far the hurons meant to carry their artifices and he determined to bring the question as soon as practicable to the proof affecting an indifference he was far from feeling he strolled about the area gradually getting nearer and nearer to the spot where he had landed when he suddenly quickened his pace though carefully avoiding all appearance of flight and pushing aside the bushes he stepped upon the beach the canoe was gone nor could he see any traces of it after walking to the northern and southern verges of the point and examining the shores in both directions it was evidently removed beyond his reach and knowledge and under circumstances to show that such had been the intention of the savages  deerslayer now better understood his actual situation he was a prisoner on the narrow tongue of land vigilantly watched beyond a question and with no other means of escape than that of swimming he again thought of this last expedient but the certainty that the canoe would be sent in chase and the desperate nature of the chances of success deterred him from the undertaking while on the strand he came to a spot where the bushes had been cut and thrust into a small pile removing a few of the upper branches he found beneath them the dead body of the panther he knew that it was kept until the savages might find a place to inter it where it would be beyond the reach of the scalping knife he gazed wistfully towards the castle but there all seemed to be silent and desolate and a feeling of loneliness and desertion came over him to increase the gloom of the moment  gods will be done murmured the young man as he walked sorrowfully away from the beach entering again beneath the arches of the wood gods will be done on arth as it is in heaven i did hope that my days would not be numbered so soon but it matters little ater all a few more winters and a few more summers and twould have been over accordin to natur ahs me the young and actyve seldom think death possible till he grins in their faces and tells em the hour is come  while this soliloquy was being pronounced the hunter advanced into the area where to his surprise he saw hetty alone evidently awaiting his return the girl carried the bible under her arm and her face over which a shadow of gentle melancholy was usually thrown now seemed sad and downcast moving nearer deerslayer spoke  poor hetty he said times have been so troublesome of late that id altogether forgotten you we meet as it might be to mourn over what is to happen i wonder what has become of chingachgook and wah  why did you kill the huron deerslayer returned the girl reproachfully dont you know your commandments which say thou shalt not kill they tell me you have now slain the womans husband and brother  its true my good hettytis gospel truth and ill not deny what has come to pass but you must remember gal that many things are lawful in war which would be onlawful in peace the husband was shot in open fightor open so far as i was consarned while he had a better cover than commonand the brother brought his end on himself by casting his tomahawk at an unarmed prisoner did you witness that deed gal  i saw it and was sorry it happened deerslayer for i hoped you wouldnt have returned blow for blow but good for evil  ah hetty that may do among the missionaries but twould make an onsartain life in the woods the panther craved my blood and he was foolish enough to throw arms into my hands at the very moment he was striving ater it twould have been agin natur not to raise a hand in such a trial and twould have done discredit to my training and gifts nonoim as willing to give every man his own as another and so i hope youll testify to them that will be likely to question you as to what youve seen this day  deerslayer do you mean to marry sumach now she has neither husband nor brother to feed her  are such your idees of matrimony hetty ought the young to wive with the oldthe paleface with the redskinthe christian with the heathen its agin reason and natur and so youll see if you think of it a moment  ive always heard mother say returned hetty averting her face more from a feminine instinct than from any consciousness of wrong that people should never marry until they loved each other better than brothers and sisters and i suppose that is what you mean sumach is old and you are young  ay and shes red and im white beside hetty suppose you was a wife now having married some young man of your own years and state and colourhurry harry for instance deerslayer selected this example simply from the circumstance that he was the only young man known to bothand that he had fallen on a war path would you wish to take to your bosom for a husband the man that slew him  oh no no no returned the girl shudderingthat would be wicked as well as heartless no christian girl could or would do that i never shall be the wife of hurry i know but were he my husband no man should ever be it again after his death  i thought it would get to this hetty when you come to understand sarcumstances tis a moral impossibility that i should ever marry sumach and though injin weddins have no priests and not much religion a white man who knows his gifts and duties cant profit by that and so make his escape at the fitting time i do think death would be more natral like and welcome than wedlock with this woman  dont say it too loud interrupted hetty impatiently i suppose she will not like to hear it im sure hurry would rather marry even me than suffer torments though i am feeble minded and i am sure it would kill me to think hed prefer death to being my husband  ay gal you aint sumach but a comely young christian with a good heart pleasant smile and kind eye hurry might be proud to get you and that too not in misery and sorrow but in his best and happiest days howsever take my advice and never talk to hurry about these things hes only a borderer at the best  i wouldnt tell him for the world exclaimed the girl looking about her like one affrighted and blushing she knew not why mother always said young women shouldnt be forward and speak their minds before theyre asked oh i never forget what mother told me tis a pity hurry is so handsome deerslayer i do think fewer girls would like him then and he would sooner know his own mind  poor gal poor gal its plain enough how it is but the lord will bear in mind one of your simple heart and kind feelins well talk no more of these things if you had reason youd be sorrowful at having let others so much into your secret tell me hetty what has become of all the hurons and why they let you roam about the pint as if you too was a prisoner  im no prisoner deerslayer but a free girl and go when and where i please nobody dare hurt me if they did god would be angry as i can show them in the bible nonohetty hutter is not afraid shes in good hands the hurons are up yonder in the woods and keep a good watch on us both ill answer for it since all the women and children are on the lookout some are burying the body of the poor girl who was shot so that the enemy and the wild beasts cant find it i told em that father and mother lay in the lake but i wouldnt let them know in what part of it for judith and i dont want any of their heathenish company in our burying ground  ahs me well it is an awful despatch to be standing here alive and angry and with the feelins up and ferocious one hour and then to be carried away at the next and put out of sight of mankind in a hole in the arth no one knows what will happen to him on a warpath thats sartain  here the stirring of leaves and the cracking of dried twigs interrupted the discourse and apprised deerslayer of the approach of his enemies the hurons closed around the spot that had been prepared for the coming scene and in the centre of which the intended victim now stood in a circle the armed men being so distributed among the feebler members of the band that there was no safe opening through which the prisoner could break but the latter no longer contemplated flight the recent trial having satisfied him of his inability to escape when pursued so closely by numbers on the contrary all his energies were aroused in order to meet his expected fate with a calmness that should do credit to his colour and his manhood one equally removed from recreant alarm and savage boasting  when rivenoak reappeared in the circle he occupied his old place at the head of the area several of the elder warriors stood near him but now that the brother of sumach had fallen there was no longer any recognised chief present whose influence and authority offered a dangerous rivalry to his own nevertheless it is well known that little which could be called monarchical or despotic entered into the politics of the north american tribes although the first colonists bringing with them to this hemisphere the notions and opinions of their own countries often dignified the chief men of those primitive nations with the titles of kings and princes hereditary influence did certainly exist but there is much reason to believe it existed rather as a consequence of hereditary merit and acquired qualifications than as a birthright rivenoak however had not even this claim having risen to consideration purely by the force of talents sagacity and as bacon expresses it in relation to all distinguished statesmen by a union of great and mean qualities a truth of which the career of the profound englishman himself furnishes so apt an illustration next to arms eloquence offers the great avenue to popular favor whether it be in civilized or savage life and rivenoak had succeeded as so many have succeeded before him quite as much by rendering fallacies acceptable to his listeners as by any profound or learned expositions of truth or the accuracy of his logic nevertheless he had influence and was far from being altogether without just claims to its possession like most men who reason more than they feel the huron was not addicted to the indulgence of the more ferocious passions of his people he had been commonly found on the side of mercy in all the scenes of vindictive torture and revenge that had occurred in his tribe since his own attainment to power on the present occasion he was reluctant to proceed to extremities although the provocation was so great still it exceeded his ingenuity to see how that alternative could well be avoided sumach resented her rejection more than she did the deaths of her husband and brother and there was little probability that the woman would pardon a man who had so unequivocally preferred death to her embraces without her forgiveness there was scarce a hope that the tribe could be induced to overlook its loss and even to rivenoak himself much as he was disposed to pardon the fate of our hero now appeared to be almost hopelessly sealed  when the whole band was arrayed around the captive a grave silence so much the more threatening from its profound quiet pervaded the place deerslayer perceived that the women and boys had been preparing splinters of the fat pine roots which he well knew were to be stuck into his flesh and set in flames while two or three of the young men held the thongs of bark with which he was to be bound the smoke of a distant fire announced that the burning brands were in preparation and several of the elder warriors passed their fingers over the edges of their tomahawks as if to prove their keenness and temper even the knives seemed loosened in their sheathes impatient for the bloody and merciless work to begin  killer of the deer recommenced rivenoak certainly without any signs of sympathy or pity in his manner though with calmness and dignity killer of the deer it is time that my people knew their minds the sun is no longer over our heads tired of waiting on the hurons he has begun to fall near the pines on this side of the valley he is travelling fast towards the country of our french fathers it is to warn his children that their lodges are empty and that they ought to be at home the roaming wolf has his den and he goes to it when he wishes to see his young the iroquois are not poorer than the wolves they have villages and wigwams and fields of corn the good spirits will be tired of watching them alone my people must go back and see to their own business there will be joy in the lodges when they hear our whoop from the forest it will be a sorrowful whoop when it is understood grief will come after it there will be one scalpwhoop but there will be only one we have the fur of the muskrat his body is among the fishes deerslayer must say whether another scalp shall be on our pole two lodges are empty a scalp living or dead is wanted at each door  then take em dead huron firmly but altogether without dramatic boasting returned the captive my hour is come i do suppose and what must be must if you are bent on the tortur ill do my indivours to bear up agin it though no man can say how far his natur will stand pain until hes been tried  the paleface cur begins to put his tail between his legs cried a young and garrulous savage who bore the appropriate title of the corbeau rouge a sobriquet he had gained from the french by his facility in making unseasonable noises and an undue tendency to hear his own voice he is no warrior he has killed the loup cervier when looking behind him not to see the flash of his own rifle he grunts like a hog already when the huron women begin to torment him he will cry like the young of the catamount he is a delaware woman dressed in the skin of a yengeese  have your say young man have your say returned deerslayer unmoved you know no better and i can overlook it talking may aggravate women but can hardly make knives sharper fire hotter or rifles more sartain  rivenoak now interposed reproving the red crow for his premature interference and then directing the proper persons to bind the captive this expedient was adopted not from any apprehensions that he would escape or from any necessity that was yet apparent of his being unable to endure the torture with his limbs free but from an ingenious design of making him feel his helplessness and of gradually sapping his resolution by undermining it as it might be little by little deerslayer offered no resistance he submitted his arms and legs freely if not cheerfully to the ligaments of bark which were bound around them by order of the chief in a way to produce as little pain as possible these directions were secret and given in the hope that the captive would finally save himself from any serious bodily suffering by consenting to take the sumach for a wife as soon as the body of deerslayer was withed in bark sufficiently to create a lively sense of helplessness he was literally carried to a young tree and bound against it in a way that effectually prevented him from moving as well as from falling the hands were laid flat against the legs and thongs were passed over all in a way nearly to incorporate the prisoner with the tree his cap was then removed and he was left halfstanding halfsustained by his bonds to face the coming scene in the best manner he could  previously to proceeding to any thing like extremities it was the wish of rivenoak to put his captives resolution to the proof by renewing the attempt at a compromise this could be effected only in one manner the acquiescence of the sumach being indispensably necessary to a compromise of her right to be revenged with this view then the woman was next desired to advance and to look to her own interests no agent being considered as efficient as the principal herself in this negotiation the indian females when girls are usually mild and submissive with musical tones pleasant voices and merry laughs but toil and suffering generally deprive them of most of these advantages by the time they have reached an age which the sumach had long before passed to render their voices harsh it would seem to require active malignant passions though when excited their screams can rise to a sufficiently conspicuous degree of discordancy to assert their claim to possess this distinctive peculiarity of the sex the sumach was not altogether without feminine attraction however and had so recently been deemed handsome in her tribe as not to have yet learned the full influence that time and exposure produce on man as well as on woman by an arrangement of rivenoaks some of the women around her had been employing the time in endeavoring to persuade the bereaved widow that there was still a hope deerslayer might be prevailed on to enter her wigwam in preference to entering the world of spirits and this too with a success that previous symptoms scarcely justified all this was the result of a resolution on the part of the chief to leave no proper means unemployed in order to get transferred to his own nation the greatest hunter that was then thought to exist in all that region as well as a husband for a woman who he felt would be likely to be troublesome were any of her claims to the attention and care of the tribe overlooked  in conformity with this scheme the sumach had been secretly advised to advance into the circle and to make her appeal to the prisoners sense of justice before the band had recourse to the last experiment the woman nothing loth consented for there was some such attraction in becoming the wife of a noted hunter among the females of the tribes as is experienced by the sex in more refined life when they bestow their hands on the affluent as the duties of a mother were thought to be paramount to all other considerations the widow felt none of that embarrassment in preferring her claims to which even a female fortune hunter among ourselves might be liable when she stood forth before the whole party therefore the children that she led by the hands fully justified all she did  you see me before you cruel paleface the woman commenced your spirit must tell you my errand i have found you i cannot find le loup cervier nor the panther i have looked for them in the lake in the woods in the clouds i cannot say where they have gone  no man knows good sumach no man knows interposed the captive when the spirit leaves the body it passes into a world beyond our knowledge and the wisest way for them that are left behind is to hope for the best no doubt both your warriors have gone to the happy hunting grounds and at the proper time you will see em agin in their improved state the wife and sister of braves must have looked forward to some such tarmination of their arthly careers  cruel paleface what had my warriors done that you should slay them they were the best hunters and the boldest young men of their tribe the great spirit intended that they should live until they withered like the branches of the hemlock and fell of their own weight  naynaygood sumach interrupted deerslayer whose love of truth was too indomitable to listen to such hyperbole with patience even though it came from the torn breast of a widownaynay good sumach this is a little outdoing redskin privileges young man was neither any more than you can be called a young woman and as to the great spirits intending that they should fall otherwise than they did thats a grievous mistake inasmuch as what the great spirit intends is sartain to come to pass then agin its plain enough neither of your frinds did me any harm i raised my hand agin em on account of what they were striving to do rather than what they did this is natral law to do lest you should be done by  it is so sumach has but one tongue she can tell but one story the pale face struck the hurons lest the hurons should strike him the hurons are a just nation they will forget it the chiefs will shut their eyes and pretend not to have seen it the young men will believe the panther and the lynx have gone to far off hunts and the sumach will take her children by the hand and go into the lodge of the paleface and saysee these are your children they are also minefeed us and we will live with you  the tarms are onadmissable woman and though i feel for your losses which must be hard to bear the tarms cannot be accepted as to givin you venson in case we lived near enough together that would be no great explite but as for becomin your husband and the father of your children to be honest with you i feel no callin thataway  look at this boy cruel paleface he has no father to teach him to kill the deer or to take scalps see this girl what young man will come to look for a wife in a lodge that has no head there are more among my people in the canadas and the killer of deer will find as many mouths to feed as his heart can wish for  i tell you woman exclaimed deerslayer whose imagination was far from seconding the appeal of the widow and who began to grow restive under the vivid pictures she was drawing all this is nothing to me people and kindred must take care of their own fatherless leaving them that have no children to their own loneliness as for me i have no offspring and i want no wife now go away sumach leave me in the hands of your chiefs for my colour and gifts and natur itself cry out agin the idee of taking you for a wife  it is unnecessary to expatiate on the effect of this downright refusal of the womans proposals if there was anything like tenderness in her bosomand no woman was probably ever entirely without that feminine qualityit all disappeared at this plain announcement fury rage mortified pride and a volcano of wrath burst out at one explosion converting her into a sort of maniac as it might beat the touch of a magicians wand without deigning a reply in words she made the arches of the forest ring with screams and then flew forward at her victim seizing him by the hair which she appeared resolute to draw out by the roots it was some time before her grasp could be loosened fortunately for the prisoner her rage was blind since his total helplessness left him entirely at her mercy had it been better directed it might have proved fatal before any relief could have been offered as it was she did succeed in wrenching out two or three handsful of hair before the young men could tear her away from her victim  the insult that had been offered to the sumach was deemed an insult to the whole tribe not so much however on account of any respect that was felt for the woman as on account of the honor of the huron nation sumach herself was generally considered to be as acid as the berry from which she derived her name and now that her great supporters her husband and brother were both gone few cared about concealing their aversion nevertheless it had become a point of honor to punish the paleface who disdained a huron woman and more particularly one who coolly preferred death to relieving the tribe from the support of a widow and her children the young men showed an impatience to begin to torture that rivenoak understood and as his older associates manifested no disposition to permit any longer delay he was compelled to give the signal for the infernal work to proceed    chapter xxix       the ugly bear now minded not the stake     nor how the cruel mastiffs do him tear     the stag lay still unroused from the brake     the foamy boar feared not the hunters spear     all thing was still in desert bush and briar      thomas sackville the complaint of henry duke of buckingham     lxxxi  twas one of the common expedients of the savages on such occasions to put the nerves of their victims to the severest proofs on the other hand it was a matter of indian pride to betray no yielding to terror or pain but for the prisoner to provoke his enemies to such acts of violence as would soonest produce death many a warrior had been known to bring his own sufferings to a more speedy termination by taunting reproaches and reviling language when he found that his physical system was giving way under the agony of sufferings produced by a hellish ingenuity that might well eclipse all that has been said of the infernal devices of religious persecution this happy expedient of taking refuge from the ferocity of his foes in their passions was denied deerslayer however by his peculiar notions of the duty of a white man and he had stoutly made up his mind to endure everything in preference to disgracing his colour  no sooner did the young men understand that they were at liberty to commence than some of the boldest and most forward among them sprang into the arena tomahawk in hand here they prepared to throw that dangerous weapon the object being to strike the tree as near as possible to the victims head without absolutely hitting him this was so hazardous an experiment that none but those who were known to be exceedingly expert with the weapon were allowed to enter the lists at all lest an early death might interfere with the expected entertainment in the truest hands it was seldom that the captive escaped injury in these trials and it often happened that death followed even when the blow was not premeditated in the particular case of our hero rivenoak and the older warriors were apprehensive that the example of the panthers fate might prove a motive with some fiery spirit suddenly to sacrifice his conqueror when the temptation of effecting it in precisely the same manner and possibly with the identical weapon with which the warrior had fallen offered this circumstance of itself rendered the ordeal of the tomahawk doubly critical for the deerslayer it would seem however that all who now entered what we shall call the lists were more disposed to exhibit their own dexterity than to resent the deaths of their comrades each prepared himself for the trial with the feelings of rivalry rather than with the desire for vengeance and for the first few minutes the prisoner had little more connection with the result than grew out of the interest that necessarily attached itself to a living target the young men were eager instead of being fierce and rivenoak thought he still saw signs of being able to save the life of the captive when the vanity of the young men had been gratified always admitting that it was not sacrificed to the delicate experiments that were about to be made the first youth who presented himself for the trial was called the raven having as yet had no opportunity of obtaining a more warlike sobriquet he was remarkable for high pretension rather than for skill or exploits and those who knew his character thought the captive in imminent danger when he took his stand and poised the tomahawk nevertheless the young man was good natured and no thought was uppermost in his mind other than the desire to make a better cast than any of his fellows deerslayer got an inkling of this warriors want of reputation by the injunctions that he had received from the seniors who indeed would have objected to his appearing in the arena at all but for an influence derived from his father an aged warrior of great merit who was then in the lodges of the tribe still our hero maintained an appearance of selfpossession he had made up his mind that his hour was come and it would have been a mercy instead of a calamity to fall by the unsteadiness of the first hand that was raised against him after a suitable number of flourishes and gesticulations that promised much more than he could perform the raven let the tomahawk quit his hand the weapon whirled through the air with the usual evolutions cut a chip from the sapling to which the prisoner was bound within a few inches of his cheek and stuck in a large oak that grew several yards behind him this was decidedly a bad effort and a common sneer proclaimed as much to the great mortification of the young man on the other hand there was a general but suppressed murmur of admiration at the steadiness with which the captive stood the trial the head was the only part he could move and this had been purposely left free that the tormentors might have the amusement and the tormented endure the shame of his dodging and otherwise attempting to avoid the blows deerslayer disappointed these hopes by a command of nerve that rendered his whole body as immovable as the tree to which he was bound nor did he even adopt the natural and usual expedient of shutting his eyes the firmest and oldest warrior of the redmen never having more disdainfully denied himself this advantage under similar circumstances  the raven had no sooner made his unsuccessful and puerile effort than he was succeeded by le daimmose or the moose a middle aged warrior who was particularly skilful in the use of the tomahawk and from whose attempt the spectators confidently looked for gratification this man had none of the good nature of the raven but he would gladly have sacrificed the captive to his hatred of the palefaces generally were it not for the greater interest he felt in his own success as one particularly skilled in the use of this weapon he took his stand quietly but with an air of confidence poised his little axe but a single instant advanced a foot with a quick motion and threw deerslayer saw the keen instrument whirling towards him and believed all was over still he was not touched the tomahawk had actually bound the head of the captive to the tree by carrying before it some of his hair having buried itself deep beneath the soft bark a general yell expressed the delight of the spectators and the moose felt his heart soften a little towards the prisoner whose steadiness of nerve alone enabled him to give this evidence of his consummate skill  le daimmose was succeeded by the bounding boy or le garcon qui bondi who came leaping into the circle like a hound or a goat at play this was one of those elastic youths whose muscles seemed always in motion and who either affected or who from habit was actually unable to move in any other manner than by showing the antics just mentioned nevertheless he was both brave and skilful and had gained the respect of his people by deeds in war as well as success in the hunts a far nobler name would long since have fallen to his share had not a frenchman of rank inadvertently given him this sobriquet which he religiously preserved as coming from his great father who lived beyond the wide salt lake the bounding boy skipped about in front of the captive menacing him with his tomahawk now on one side and now on another and then again in front in the vain hope of being able to extort some sign of fear by this parade of danger at length deerslayers patience became exhausted by all this mummery and he spoke for the first time since the trial had actually commenced  throw away huron he cried or your tomahawk will forget its arnd why do you keep loping about like a faan thats showing its dam how well it can skip when youre a warrior grown yourself and a warrior grown defies you and all your silly antiks throw or the huron gals will laugh in your face  although not intended to produce such an effect the last words aroused the bounding warrior to fury the same nervous excitability which rendered him so active in his person made it difficult to repress his feelings and the words were scarcely past the lips of the speaker than the tomahawk left the hand of the indian nor was it cast without illwill and a fierce determination to slay had the intention been less deadly the danger might have been greater the aim was uncertain and the weapon glanced near the cheek of the captive slightly cutting the shoulder in its evolutions this was the first instance in which any other object than that of terrifying the prisoner and of displaying skill had been manifested and the bounding boy was immediately led from the arena and was warmly rebuked for his intemperate haste which had come so near defeating all the hopes of the band to this irritable person succeeded several other young warriors who not only hurled the tomahawk but who cast the knife a far more dangerous experiment with reckless indifference yet they always manifested a skill that prevented any injury to the captive several times deerslayer was grazed but in no instance did he receive what might be termed a wound the unflinching firmness with which he faced his assailants more especially in the sort of rally with which this trial terminated excited a profound respect in the spectators and when the chiefs announced that the prisoner had well withstood the trials of the knife and the tomahawk there was not a single individual in the band who really felt any hostility towards him with the exception of sumach and the bounding boy these two discontented spirits got together it is true feeding each others ire but as yet their malignant feelings were confined very much to themselves though there existed the danger that the others ere long could not fail to be excited by their own efforts into that demoniacal state which usually accompanied all similar scenes among the red men  rivenoak now told his people that the paleface had proved himself to be a man he might live with the delawares but he had not been made woman with that tribe he wished to know whether it was the desire of the hurons to proceed any further even the gentlest of the females however had received too much satisfaction in the late trials to forego their expectations of a gratifying exhibition and there was but one voice in the request to proceed the politic chief who had some such desire to receive so celebrated a hunter into his tribe as a european minister has to devise a new and available means of taxation sought every plausible means of arresting the trial in season for he well knew if permitted to go far enough to arouse the more ferocious passions of the tormentors it would be as easy to dam the waters of the great lakes of his own region as to attempt to arrest them in their bloody career he therefore called four or five of the best marksmen to him and bid them put the captive to the proof of the rifle while at the same time he cautioned them touching the necessity of their maintaining their own credit by the closest attention to the manner of exhibiting their skill  when deerslayer saw the chosen warriors step into the circle with their arms prepared for service he felt some such relief as the miserable sufferer who has long endured the agonies of disease feels at the certain approach of death any trifling variance in the aim of this formidable weapon would prove fatal since the head being the target or rather the point it was desired to graze without injuring an inch or two of difference in the line of projection must at once determine the question of life or death  in the torture by the rifle there was none of the latitude permitted that appeared in the case of even gesslers apple a hairs breadth being in fact the utmost limits that an expert marksman would allow himself on an occasion like this victims were frequently shot through the head by too eager or unskilful hands and it often occurred that exasperated by the fortitude and taunts of the prisoner death was dealt intentionally in a moment of ungovernable irritation all this deerslayer well knew for it was in relating the traditions of such scenes as well as of the battles and victories of their people that the old men beguiled the long winter evenings in their cabins he now fully expected the end of his career and experienced a sort of melancholy pleasure in the idea that he was to fall by a weapon as much beloved as the rifle a slight interruption however took place before the business was allowed to proceed  hetty hutter witnessed all that passed and the scene at first had pressed upon her feeble mind in a way to paralyze it entirely but by this time she had rallied and was growing indignant at the unmerited suffering the indians were inflicting on her friend though timid and shy as the young of the deer on so many occasions this rightfeeling girl was always intrepid in the cause of humanity the lessons of her mother and the impulses of her own heartperhaps we might say the promptings of that unseen and pure spirit that seemed ever to watch over and direct her actionsuniting to keep down the apprehensions of woman and to impel her to be bold and resolute she now appeared in the circle gentle feminine even bashful in mien as usual but earnest in her words and countenance speaking like one who knew herself to be sustained by the high authority of god  why do you torment deerslayer redmen she asked what has he done that you trifle with his life who has given you the right to be his judges suppose one of your knives or tomahawks had hit him what indian among you all could cure the wound you would make besides in harming deerslayer you injure your own friend when father and hurry harry came after your scalps he refused to be of the party and staid in the canoe by himself you are tormenting a good friend in tormenting this young man  the hurons listened with grave attention and one among them who understood english translated what had been said into their native tongue as soon as rivenoak was made acquainted with the purport of her address he answered it in his own dialect the interpreter conveying it to the girl in english  my daughter is very welcome to speak said the stern old orator using gentle intonations and smiling as kindly as if addressing a childthe hurons are glad to hear her voice they listen to what she says the great spirit often speaks to men with such tongues this time her eyes have not been open wide enough to see all that has happened deerslayer did not come for our scalps that is true why did he not come here they are on our heads the war locks are ready to be taken hold of a bold enemy ought to stretch out his hand to seize them the iroquois are too great a nation to punish men that take scalps what they do themselves they like to see others do let my daughter look around her and count my warriors had i as many hands as four warriors their fingers would be fewer than my people when they came into your hunting grounds now a whole hand is missing where are the fingers two have been cut off by this paleface my hurons wish to see if he did this by means of a stout heart or by treachery like a skulking fox or like a leaping panther  you know yourself huron how one of them fell i saw it and you all saw it too twas too bloody to look at but it was not deerslayers fault your warrior sought his life and he defended himself i dont know whether this good book says that it was right but all men will do that come if you want to know which of you can shoot best give deerslayer a rifle and then you will find how much more expert he is than any of your warriors yes than all of them together  could one have looked upon such a scene with indifference he would have been amused at the gravity with which the savages listened to the translation of this unusual request no taunt no smile mingled with their surprise for hetty had a character and a manner too saintly to subject her infirmity to the mockings of the rude and ferocious on the contrary she was answered with respectful attention  my daughter does not always talk like a chief at a council fire returned rivenoak or she would not have said this two of my warriors have fallen by the blows of our prisoner their grave is too small to hold a third the hurons do not like to crowd their dead if there is another spirit about to set out for the far off world it must not be the spirit of a huron it must be the spirit of a paleface go daughter and sit by sumach who is in grief let the huron warriors show how well they can shoot let the paleface show how little he cares for their bullets  hettys mind was unequal to a sustained discussion and accustomed to defer to the directions of her seniors she did as told seating herself passively on a log by the side of the sumach and averting her face from the painful scene that was occurring within the circle  the warriors as soon as this interruption had ceased resumed their places and again prepared to exhibit their skill as there was a double object in view that of putting the constancy of the captive to the proof and that of showing how steady were the hands of the marksmen under circumstances of excitement the distance was small and in one sense safe but in diminishing the distance taken by the tormentors the trial to the nerves of the captive was essentially increased the face of deerslayer indeed was just removed sufficiently from the ends of the guns to escape the effects of the flash and his steady eye was enabled to look directly into their muzzles as it might be in anticipation of the fatal messenger that was to issue from each the cunning hurons well knew this fact and scarce one levelled his piece without first causing it to point as near as possible at the forehead of the prisoner in the hope that his fortitude would fail him and that the band would enjoy the triumph of seeing a victim quail under their ingenious cruelty nevertheless each of the competitors was still careful not to injure the disgrace of striking prematurely being second only to that of failing altogether in attaining the object shot after shot was made all the bullets coming in close proximity to the deerslayers head without touching it still no one could detect even the twitching of a muscle on the part of the captive or the slightest winking of an eye this indomitable resolution which so much exceeded everything of its kind that any present had before witnessed might be referred to three distinct causes the first was resignation to his fate blended with natural steadiness of deportment for our hero had calmly made up his mind that he must die and preferred this mode to any other the second was his great familiarity with this particular weapon which deprived it of all the terror that is usually connected with the mere form of the danger and the third was this familiarity carried out in practice to a degree so nice as to enable the intended victim to tell within an inch the precise spot where each bullet must strike for he calculated its range by looking in at the bore of the piece so exact was deerslayers estimation of the line of fire that his pride of feeling finally got the better of his resignation and when five or six had discharged their bullets into the tree he could not refrain from expressing his contempt at their want of hand and eye  you may call this shooting mingos he exclaimed but weve squaws among the delawares and i have known dutch gals on the mohawk that could outdo your greatest indivours ondo these arms of mine put a rifle into my hands and ill pin the thinnest warlock in your party to any tree you can show me and this at a hundred yardsay or at two hundred if the objects can be seen nineteen shots in twenty or for that matter twenty in twenty if the piece is creditable and trusty  a low menacing murmur followed this cool taunt the ire of the warriors kindled at listening to such a reproach from one who so far disdained their efforts as to refuse even to wink when a rifle was discharged as near his face as could be done without burning it rivenoak perceived that the moment was critical and still retaining his hope of adopting so noted a hunter into his tribe the politic old chief interposed in time probably to prevent an immediate resort to that portion of the torture which must necessarily have produced death through extreme bodily suffering if in no other manner moving into the centre of the irritated group he addressed them with his usual wily logic and plausible manner at once suppressing the fierce movement that had commenced  i see how it is he said we have been like the palefaces when they fasten their doors at night out of fear of the red men they use so many bars that the fire comes and burns them before they can get out we have bound the deerslayer too tight the thongs keep his limbs from shaking and his eyes from shutting loosen him let us see what his own body is really made of  it is often the case when we are thwarted in a cherished scheme that any expedient however unlikely to succeed is gladly resorted to in preference to a total abandonment of the project so it was with the hurons the proposal of the chief found instant favor and several hands were immediately at work cutting and tearing the ropes of bark from the body of our hero in half a minute deerslayer stood as free from bonds as when an hour before he had commenced his flight on the side of the mountain some little time was necessary that he should recover the use of his limbs the circulation of the blood having been checked by the tightness of the ligatures and this was accorded to him by the politic rivenoak under the pretence that his body would be more likely to submit to apprehension if its true tone were restored though really with a view to give time to the fierce passions which had been awakened in the bosoms of his young men to subside this ruse succeeded and deerslayer by rubbing his limbs stamping his feet and moving about soon regained the circulation recovering all his physical powers as effectually as if nothing had occurred to disturb them  it is seldom men think of death in the pride of their health and strength so it was with deerslayer having been helplessly bound and as he had every reason to suppose so lately on the very verge of the other world to find himself so unexpectedly liberated in possession of his strength and with a full command of limb acted on him like a sudden restoration to life reanimating hopes that he had once absolutely abandoned from that instant all his plans changed in this he simply obeyed a law of nature for while we have wished to represent our hero as being resigned to his fate it has been far from our intention to represent him as anxious to die from the instant that his buoyancy of feeling revived his thoughts were keenly bent on the various projects that presented themselves as modes of evading the designs of his enemies and he again became the quick witted ingenious and determined woodsman alive to all his own powers and resources the change was so great that his mind resumed its elasticity and no longer thinking of submission it dwelt only on the devices of the sort of warfare in which he was engaged  as soon as deerslayer was released the band divided itself in a circle around him in order to hedge him in and the desire to break down his spirit grew in them precisely as they saw proofs of the difficulty there would be in subduing it the honor of the band was now involved in the issue and even the fair sex lost all its sympathy with suffering in the desire to save the reputation of the tribe the voices of the girls soft and melodious as nature had made them were heard mingling with the menaces of the men and the wrongs of sumach suddenly assumed the character of injuries inflicted on every huron female yielding to this rising tumult the men drew back a little signifying to the females that they left the captive for a time in their hands it being a common practice on such occasions for the women to endeavor to throw the victim into a rage by their taunts and revilings and then to turn him suddenly over to the men in a state of mind that was little favorable to resisting the agony of bodily suffering nor was this party without the proper instruments for effecting such a purpose sumach had a notoriety as a scold and one or two crones like the she bear had come out with the party most probably as the conservators of its decency and moral discipline such things occurring in savage as well as in civilized life it is unnecessary to repeat all that ferocity and ignorance could invent for such a purpose the only difference between this outbreaking of feminine anger and a similar scene among ourselves consisting in the figures of speech and the epithets the huron women calling their prisoner by the names of the lower and least respected animals that were known to themselves  but deerslayers mind was too much occupied to permit him to be disturbed by the abuse of excited hags and their rage necessarily increasing with his indifference as his indifference increased with their rage the furies soon rendered themselves impotent by their own excesses perceiving that the attempt was a complete failure the warriors interfered to put a stop to this scene and this so much the more because preparations were now seriously making for the commencement of the real tortures or that which would put the fortitude of the sufferer to the test of severe bodily pain a sudden and unlooked for announcement that proceeded from one of the lookouts a boy ten or twelve years old however put a momentary check to the whole proceedings as this interruption has a close connection with the dénouement of our story it shall be given in a separate chapter    chapter xxx       so deemst thouso each mortal deems     of that which is from that which seems     but other harvest here     than that which peasants scythe demands     was gatherd in by sterner hands     with bayonet blade and spear      scott the field of waterloo vi6  it exceeded deerslayers power to ascertain what had produced the sudden pause in the movements of his enemies until the fact was revealed in the due course of events he perceived that much agitation prevailed among the women in particular while the warriors rested on their arms in a sort of dignified expectation it was plain no alarm was excited though it was not equally apparent that a friendly occurrence produced the delay rivenoak was evidently apprised of all and by a gesture of his arm he appeared to direct the circle to remain unbroken and for each person to await the issue in the situation he or she then occupied it required but a minute or two to bring an explanation of this singular and mysterious pause which was soon terminated by the appearance of judith on the exterior of the line of bodies and her ready admission within its circle  if deerslayer was startled by this unexpected arrival well knowing that the quick witted girl could claim none of that exemption from the penalties of captivity that was so cheerfully accorded to her feebler minded sister he was equally astonished at the guise in which she came all her ordinary forest attire neat and becoming as this usually was had been laid aside for the brocade that has been already mentioned and which had once before wrought so great and magical an effect in her appearance nor was this all accustomed to see the ladies of the garrison in the formal gala attire of the day and familiar with the more critical niceties of these matters the girl had managed to complete her dress in a way to leave nothing strikingly defective in its details or even to betray an incongruity that would have been detected by one practised in the mysteries of the toilet head feet arms hands bust and drapery were all in harmony as female attire was then deemed attractive and harmonious and the end she aimed at that of imposing on the uninstructed senses of the savages by causing them to believe their guest was a woman of rank and importance might well have succeeded with those whose habits had taught them to discriminate between persons judith in addition to her rare native beauty had a singular grace of person and her mother had imparted enough of her own deportment to prevent any striking or offensive vulgarity of manner so that sooth to say the gorgeous dress might have been worse bestowed in nearly every particular had it been displayed in a capital a thousand might have worn it before one could have been found to do more credit to its gay colours glossy satins and rich laces than the beautiful creature whose person it now aided to adorn the effect of such an apparition had not been miscalculated the instant judith found herself within the circle she was in a degree compensated for the fearful personal risk she ran by the unequivocal sensation of surprise and admiration produced by her appearance the grim old warriors uttered their favorite exclamation hugh the younger men were still more sensibly overcome and even the women were not backward in letting open manifestations of pleasure escape them it was seldom that these untutored children of the forest had ever seen any white female above the commonest sort and as to dress never before had so much splendor shone before their eyes the gayest uniforms of both french and english seemed dull compared with the lustre of the brocade and while the rare personal beauty of the wearer added to the effect produced by its hues the attire did not fail to adorn that beauty in a way which surpassed even the hopes of its wearer deerslayer himself was astounded and this quite as much by the brilliant picture the girl presented as at the indifference to consequences with which she had braved the danger of the step she had taken under such circumstances all waited for the visitor to explain her object which to most of the spectators seemed as inexplicable as her appearance  which of these warriors is the principal chief demanded judith of deerslayer as soon as she found it was expected that she should open the communications my errand is too important to be delivered to any of inferior rank first explain to the hurons what i say then give an answer to the question i have put  deerslayer quietly complied his auditors greedily listening to the interpretation of the first words that fell from so extraordinary a vision the demand seemed perfectly in character for one who had every appearance of an exalted rank herself rivenoak gave an appropriate reply by presenting himself before his fair visitor in a way to leave no doubt that he was entitled to all the consideration he claimed  i can believe this huron resumed judith enacting her assumed part with a steadiness and dignity that did credit to her powers of imitation for she strove to impart to her manner the condescending courtesy she had once observed in the wife of a general officer at a similar though a more amicable scene i can believe you to be the principal person of this party i see in your countenance the marks of thought and reflection to you then i must make my communication  let the flower of the woods speak returned the old chief courteously as soon as her address had been translated so that all might understand itif her words are as pleasant as her looks they will never quit my ears i shall hear them long after the winter of canada has killed all the flowers and frozen all the speeches of summer  this admiration was grateful to one constituted like judith and contributed to aid her selfpossession quite as much as it fed her vanity smiling involuntarily or in spite of her wish to seem reserved she proceeded in her plot  now huron she continued listen to my words your eyes tell you that i am no common woman i will not say i am queen of this country she is afar off in a distant land but under our gracious monarchs there are many degrees of rank one of these i fill what that rank is precisely it is unnecessary for me to say since you would not understand it for that information you must trust your eyes you see what i am you must feel that in listening to my words you listen to one who can be your friend or your enemy as you treat her  this was well uttered with a due attention to manner and a steadiness of tone that was really surprising considering all the circumstances of the case it was well though simply rendered into the indian dialect too and it was received with a respect and gravity that augured favourably for the girls success but indian thought is not easily traced to its sources judith waited with anxiety to hear the answer filled with hope even while she doubted rivenoak was a ready speaker and he answered as promptly as comported with the notions of indian decorum that peculiar people seeming to think a short delay respectful inasmuch as it manifests that the words already heard have been duly weighed  my daughter is handsomer than the wild roses of ontario her voice is pleasant to the ear as the song of the wren answered the cautious and wily chief who of all the band stood alone in not being fully imposed on by the magnificent and unusual appearance of judith but who distrusted even while he wondered the humming bird is not much larger than the bee yet its feathers are as gay as the tail of the peacock the great spirit sometimes puts very bright clothes on very little animals still he covers the moose with coarse hair these things are beyond the understanding of poor indians who can only comprehend what they see and hear no doubt my daughter has a very large wigwam somewhere about the lake the hurons have not found it on account of their ignorance  i have told you chief that it would be useless to state my rank and residence in as much as you would not comprehend them you must trust to your eyes for this knowledge what red man is there who cannot see this blanket that i wear is not the blanket of a common squaw these ornaments are such as the wives and daughters of chiefs only appear in now listen and hear why i have come alone among your people and hearken to the errand that has brought me here the yengeese have young men as well as the hurons and plenty of them too this you well know  the yengeese are as plenty as the leaves on the trees this every huron knows and feels  i understand you chief had i brought a party with me it might have caused trouble my young men and your young men would have looked angrily at each other especially had my young men seen that paleface bound for the torture he is a great hunter and is much loved by all the garrisons far and near there would have been blows about him and the trail of the iroquois back to the canadas would have been marked with blood  there is so much blood on it now returned the chief gloomily that it blinds our eyes my young men see that it is all huron  no doubt and more huron blood would be spilt had i come surrounded with palefaces i have heard of rivenoak and have thought it would be better to send him back in peace to his village that he might leave his women and children behind him if he then wished to come for our scalps we would meet him he loves animals made of ivory and little rifles see i have brought some with me to show him i am his friend when he has packed up these things among his goods he will start for his village before any of my young men can overtake him and then he will show his people in canada what riches they can come to seek now that our great fathers across the salt lake have sent each other the war hatchet i will lead back with me this great hunter of whom i have need to keep my house in venison  judith who was sufficiently familiar with indian phraseology endeavored to express her ideas in the sententious manner common to those people and she succeeded even beyond her own expectations deerslayer did her full justice in the translation and this so much the more readily since the girl carefully abstained from uttering any direct untruth a homage she paid to the young mans known aversion to falsehood which he deemed a meanness altogether unworthy of a white mans gifts the offering of the two remaining elephants and of the pistols already mentioned one of which was all the worse for the recent accident produced a lively sensation among the hurons generally though rivenoak received it coldly notwithstanding the delight with which he had first discovered the probable existence of a creature with two tails in a word this cool and sagacious savage was not so easily imposed on as his followers and with a sentiment of honor that half the civilized world would have deemed supererogatory he declined the acceptance of a bribe that he felt no disposition to earn by a compliance with the donors wishes  let my daughter keep her twotailed hog to eat when venison is scarce he drily answered and the little gun which has two muzzles the hurons will kill deer when they are hungry and they have long rifles to fight with this hunter cannot quit my young men now they wish to know if he is as stouthearted as he boasts himself to be  that i deny huron interrupted deerslayer with warmthyes that i downright deny as agin truth and reason no man has heard me boast and no man shall though ye flay me alive and then roast the quivering flesh with your own infarnal devices and cruelties i may be humble and misfortunate and your prisoner but im no boaster by my very gifts  my young paleface boasts he is no boaster returned the crafty chief he must be right i hear a strange bird singing it has very rich feathers no huron ever before saw such feathers they will be ashamed to go back to their village and tell their people that they let their prisoner go on account of the song of this strange bird and not be able to give the name of the bird they do not know how to say whether it is a wren or a cat bird this would be a great disgrace my young men would not be allowed to travel in the woods without taking their mothers with them to tell them the names of the birds  you can ask my name of your prisoner returned the girl it is judith and there is a great deal of the history of judith in the palefaces best book the bible if i am a bird of fine feathers i have also my name  no answered the wily huron betraying the artifice he had so long practised by speaking in english with tolerable accuracy i not ask prisoner he tired he want rest i ask my daughter with feeble mind she speak truth come here daughter you answer your name hetty  yes thats what they call me returned the girl though its written esther in the bible  he write him in bible too all write in bible no matterwhat her name  thats judith and its so written in the bible though father sometimes called her jude thats my sister judith thomas hutters daughterthomas hutter whom you called the muskrat though he was no muskrat but a man like yourselveshe lived in a house on the water and that was enough for you  a smile of triumph gleamed on the hard wrinkled countenance of the chief when he found how completely his appeal to the truthloving hetty had succeeded as for judith herself the moment her sister was questioned she saw that all was lost for no sign or even intreaty could have induced the right feeling girl to utter a falsehood to attempt to impose a daughter of the muskrat on the savages as a princess or a great lady she knew would be idle and she saw her bold and ingenious expedient for liberating the captive fail through one of the simplest and most natural causes that could be imagined she turned her eye on deerslayer therefore as if imploring him to interfere to save them both  it will not do judith said the young man in answer to this appeal which he understood though he saw its uselessness it will not do twas a bold idea and fit for a generals lady but yonder mingo rivenoak had withdrawn to a little distance and was out of earshotbut yonder mingo is an oncommon man and not to be deceived by any unnatral sarcumvention things must come afore him in their right order to draw a cloud afore his eyes twas too much to attempt making him fancy that a queen or a great lady lived in these mountains and no doubt he thinks the fine clothes you wear is some of the plunder of your own fatheror at least of him who once passed for your father as quite likely it was if all they say is true  at all events deerslayer my presence here will save you for a time they will hardly attempt torturing you before my face  why not judith do you think they will treat a woman of the pale faces more tenderly than they treat their own its true that your sex will most likely save you from the torments but it will not save your liberty and may not save your scalp i wish you had not come my good judith it can do no good to me while it may do great harm to yourself  i can share your fate the girl answered with generous enthusiasm they shall not injure you while i stand by if in my power to prevent itbesides  besides what judith what means have you to stop injin cruelties or to avart injin deviltries  none perhaps deerslayer answered the girl with firmness but i can suffer with my friendsdie with them if necessary  ah judithsuffer you may but die you will not until the lords time shall come its little likely that one of your sex and beauty will meet with a harder fate than to become the wife of a chief if indeed your white inclinations can stoop to match with an injin twould have been better had you staid in the ark or the castle but what has been done is done you was about to say something when you stopped at besides  it might not be safe to mention it here deerslayer the girl hurriedly answered moving past him carelessly that she might speak in a lower tone half an hour is all in all to us none of your friends are idle  the hunter replied merely by a grateful look then he turned towards his enemies as if ready again to face their torments a short consultation had passed among the elders of the band and by this time they also were prepared with their decision the merciful purpose of rivenoak had been much weakened by the artifice of judith which failing of its real object was likely to produce results the very opposite of those she had anticipated this was natural the feeling being aided by the resentment of an indian who found how near he had been to becoming the dupe of an inexperienced girl by this time judiths real character was fully understood the wide spread reputation of her beauty contributing to the exposure as for the unusual attire it was confounded with the profound mystery of the animals with two tails and for the moment lost its influence  when rivenoak therefore faced the captive again it was with an altered countenance he had abandoned the wish of saving him and was no longer disposed to retard the more serious part of the torture this change of sentiment was in effect communicated to the young men who were already eagerly engaged in making their preparations for the contemplated scene fragments of dried wood were rapidly collected near the sapling the splinters which it was intended to thrust into the flesh of the victim previously to lighting were all collected and the thongs were already produced that were again to bind him to the tree all this was done in profound silence judith watching every movement with breathless expectation while deerslayer himself stood seemingly as unmoved as one of the pines of the hills when the warriors advanced to bind him however the young man glanced at judith as if to enquire whether resistance or submission were most advisable by a significant gesture she counselled the last and in a minute he was once more fastened to the tree a helpless object of any insult or wrong that might be offered so eagerly did every one now act that nothing was said the fire was immediately lighted in the pile and the end of all was anxiously expected  it was not the intention of the hurons absolutely to destroy the life of their victim by means of fire they designed merely to put his physical fortitude to the severest proofs it could endure short of that extremity in the end they fully intended to carry his scalp with them into their village but it was their wish first to break down his resolution and to reduce him to the level of a complaining sufferer with this view the pile of brush and branches had been placed at a proper distance or one at which it was thought the heat would soon become intolerable though it might not be immediately dangerous as often happened however on these occasions this distance had been miscalculated and the flames began to wave their forked tongues in a proximity to the face of the victim that would have proved fatal in another instant had not hetty rushed through the crowd armed with a stick and scattered the blazing pile in a dozen directions more than one hand was raised to strike this presumptuous intruder to the earth but the chiefs prevented the blows by reminding their irritated followers of the state of her mind hetty herself was insensible to the risk she ran but as soon as she had performed this bold act she stood looking about her in frowning resentment as if to rebuke the crowd of attentive savages for their cruelty  god bless you dearest sister for that brave and ready act murmured judith herself unnerved so much as to be incapable of exertionheaven itself has sent you on its holy errand  twas well meant judith rejoined the victimtwas excellently meant and twas timely though it may prove ontimely in the ind what is to come to pass must come to pass soon or twill quickly be too late had i drawn in one mouthful of that flame in breathing the power of man could not save my life and you see that this time theyve so bound my forehead as not to leave my head the smallest chance twas well meant but it might have been more marciful to let the flames act their part  cruel heartless hurons exclaimed the still indignant hettywould you burn a man and a christian as you would burn a log of wood do you never read your bibles or do you think god will forget such things  a gesture from rivenoak caused the scattered brands to be collected fresh wood was brought even the women and children busying themselves eagerly in the gathering of dried sticks the flame was just kindling a second time when an indian female pushed through the circle advanced to the heap and with her foot dashed aside the lighted twigs in time to prevent the conflagration a yell followed this second disappointment but when the offender turned towards the circle and presented the countenance of hist it was succeeded by a common exclamation of pleasure and surprise for a minute all thought of pursuing the business in hand was forgotten young and old crowded around the girl in haste to demand an explanation of her sudden and unlookedfor return it was at this critical instant that hist spoke to judith in a low voice placed some small object unseen in her hand and then turned to meet the salutations of the huron girls with whom she was personally a great favorite judith recovered her self possession and acted promptly the small keen edged knife that hist had given to the other was passed by the latter into the hands of hetty as the safest and least suspected medium of transferring it to deerslayer but the feeble intellect of the last defeated the wellgrounded hopes of all three instead of first cutting loose the hands of the victim and then concealing the knife in his clothes in readiness for action at the most available instant she went to work herself with earnestness and simplicity to cut the thongs that bound his head that he might not again be in danger of inhaling flames of course this deliberate procedure was seen and the hands of hetty were arrested ere she had more than liberated the upper portion of the captives body not including his arms below the elbows this discovery at once pointed distrust towards hist and to judiths surprise when questioned on the subject that spirited girl was not disposed to deny her agency in what had passed  why should i not help the deerslayer the girl demanded in the tones of a firm minded woman he is the brother of a delaware chief my heart is all delaware come forth miserable briarthorn and wash the iroquois paint from your face stand before the hurons the crow that you are you would eat the carrion of your own dead rather than starve put him face to face with deerslayer chiefs and warriors i will show you how great a knave you have been keeping in your tribe  this bold language uttered in their own dialect and with a manner full of confidence produced a deep sensation among the hurons treachery is always liable to distrust and though the recreant briarthorn had endeavoured to serve the enemy well his exertions and assiduities had gained for him little more than toleration his wish to obtain hist for a wife had first induced him to betray her and his own people but serious rivals to his first project had risen up among his new friends weakening still more their sympathies with treason in a word briarthorn had been barely permitted to remain in the huron encampment where he was as closely and as jealously watched as hist herself seldom appearing before the chiefs and sedulously keeping out of view of deerslayer who until this moment was ignorant even of his presence thus summoned however it was impossible to remain in the back ground wash the iroquois paint from his face he did not for when he stood in the centre of the circle he was so disguised in these new colours that at first the hunter did not recognise him he assumed an air of defiance notwithstanding and haughtily demanded what any could say against briarthorn  ask yourself that continued hist with spirit though her manner grew less concentrated and there was a slight air of abstraction that became observable to deerslayer and judith if to no othersask that of your own heart sneaking woodchuck of the delawares come not here with the face of an innocent man go look into the spring see the colours of your enemies on your lying skin then come back and boast how you run from your tribe and took the blanket of the french for your covering paint yourself as bright as the humming bird you will still be black as the crow  hist had been so uniformly gentle while living with the hurons that they now listened to her language with surprise as for the delinquent his blood boiled in his veins and it was well for the pretty speaker that it was not in his power to execute the revenge he burned to inflict on her in spite of his pretended love  who wishes briarthorn he sternly askedif this paleface is tired of life if afraid of indian torments speak rivenoak i will send him after the warriors we have lost  no chiefsno rivenoak eagerly interrupted histdeerslayer fears nothing least of all a crow unbind himcut his withes place him face to face with this cawing bird then let us see which is tired of life  hist made a forward movement as if to take a knife from a young man and perform the office she had mentioned in person but an aged warrior interposed at a sign from rivenoak this chief watched all the girl did with distrust for even while speaking in her most boastful language and in the steadiest manner there was an air of uncertainty and expectation about her that could not escape so close an observer she acted well but two or three of the old men were equally satisfied that it was merely acting her proposal to release deerslayer therefore was rejected and the disappointed hist found herself driven back from the sapling at the very moment she fancied herself about to be successful at the same time the circle which had got to be crowded and confused was enlarged and brought once more into order rivenoak now announced the intention of the old men again to proceed the delay having continued long enough and leading to no result  stop huronstay chiefs exclaimed judith scarce knowing what she said or why she interposed unless to obtain time for gods sake a single minute longer  the words were cut short by another and a still more extraordinary interruption a young indian came bounding through the huron ranks leaping into the very centre of the circle in a way to denote the utmost confidence or a temerity bordering on foolhardiness five or six sentinels were still watching the lake at different and distant points and it was the first impression of rivenoak that one of these had come in with tidings of import still the movements of the stranger were so rapid and his war dress which scarcely left him more drapery than an antique statue had so little distinguishing about it that at the first moment it was impossible to ascertain whether he were friend or foe three leaps carried this warrior to the side of deerslayer whose withes were cut in the twinkling of an eye with a quickness and precision that left the prisoner perfect master of his limbs not till this was effected did the stranger bestow a glance on any other object then he turned and showed the astonished hurons the noble brow fine person and eagle eye of a young warrior in the paint and panoply of a delaware he held a rifle in each hand the butts of both resting on the earth while from one dangled its proper pouch and horn this was killdeer which even as he looked boldly and in defiance at the crowd around him he suffered to fall back into the hands of its proper owner the presence of two armed men though it was in their midst startled the hurons their rifles were scattered about against the different trees and their only weapons were their knives and tomahawks still they had too much selfpossession to betray fear it was little likely that so small a force would assail so strong a band and each man expected some extraordinary proposition to succeed so decisive a step the stranger did not seem disposed to disappoint them he prepared to speak  hurons he said this earth is very big the great lakes are big too there is room beyond them for the iroquois there is room for the delawares on this side i am chingachgook the son of uncas the kinsman of tamenund this is my betrothed that paleface is my friend my heart was heavy when i missed him i followed him to your camp to see that no harm happened to him all the delaware girls are waiting for wah they wonder that she stays away so long come let us say farewell and go on our path  hurons this is your mortal enemy the great serpent of them you hate cried briarthorn if he escape blood will be in your moccasin prints from this spot to the canadas i am all huron as the last words were uttered the traitor cast his knife at the naked breast of the delaware a quick movement of the arm on the part of hist who stood near turned aside the blow the dangerous weapon burying its point in a pine at the next instant a similar weapon glanced from the hand of the serpent and quivered in the recreants heart a minute had scarcely elapsed from the moment in which chingachgook bounded into the circle and that in which briarthorn fell like a log dead in his tracks the rapidity of events had prevented the hurons from acting but this catastrophe permitted no farther delay a common exclamation followed and the whole party was in motion at this instant a sound unusual to the woods was heard and every huron male and female paused to listen with ears erect and faces filled with expectation the sound was regular and heavy as if the earth were struck with beetles objects became visible among the trees of the background and a body of troops was seen advancing with measured tread they came upon the charge the scarlet of the kings livery shining among the bright green foliage of the forest  the scene that followed is not easily described it was one in which wild confusion despair and frenzied efforts were so blended as to destroy the unity and distinctness of the action a general yell burst from the enclosed hurons it was succeeded by the hearty cheers of england still not a musket or rifle was fired though that steady measured tramp continued and the bayonet was seen gleaming in advance of a line that counted nearly sixty men the hurons were taken at a fearful disadvantage on three sides was the water while their formidable and trained foes cut them off from flight on the fourth each warrior rushed for his arms and then all on the point man woman and child eagerly sought the covers in this scene of confusion and dismay however nothing could surpass the discretion and coolness of deerslayer his first care was to place judith and hist behind trees and he looked for hetty but she had been hurried away in the crowd of huron women this effected he threw himself on a flank of the retiring hurons who were inclining off towards the southern margin of the point in the hope of escaping through the water deerslayer watched his opportunity and finding two of his recent tormentors in a range his rifle first broke the silence of the terrific scene the bullet brought down both at one discharge this drew a general fire from the hurons and the rifle and war cry of the serpent were heard in the clamor still the trained men returned no answering volley the whoop and piece of hurry alone being heard on their side if we except the short prompt word of authority and that heavy measured and menacing tread presently however the shrieks groans and denunciations that usually accompany the use of the bayonet followed that terrible and deadly weapon was glutted in vengeance the scene that succeeded was one of those of which so many have occurred in our own times in which neither age nor sex forms an exemption to the lot of a savage warfare    chapter xxxi       the flower that smiles today     tomorrow dies     all that we wish to stay     tempts and then flies     what is this worlds delight     lightning that mocks the night     brief even as bright      shelley mutability ii  iv  the picture next presented by the point of land that the unfortunate hurons had selected for their last place of encampment need scarcely be laid before the eyes of the reader happily for the more tenderminded and the more timid the trunks of the trees the leaves and the smoke had concealed much of that which passed and night shortly after drew its veil over the lake and the whole of that seemingly interminable wilderness which may be said to have then stretched with few and immaterial interruptions from the banks of the hudson to the shores of the pacific ocean our business carries us into the following day when light returned upon the earth as sunny and as smiling as if nothing extraordinary had occurred  when the sun rose on the following morning every sign of hostility and alarm had vanished from the basin of the glimmerglass the frightful event of the preceding evening had left no impression on the placid sheet and the untiring hours pursued their course in the placid order prescribed by the powerful hand that set them in motion the birds were again skimming the water or were seen poised on the wing high above the tops of the tallest pines of the mountains ready to make their swoops in obedience to the irresistable law of their natures in a word nothing was changed but the air of movement and life that prevailed in and around the castle here indeed was an alteration that must have struck the least observant eye a sentinel who wore the light infantry uniform of a royal regiment paced the platform with measured tread and some twenty more of the same corps lounged about the place or were seated in the ark their arms were stacked under the eye of their comrade on post two officers stood examining the shore with the ships glass so often mentioned their looks were directed to that fatal point where scarlet coats were still to be seen gliding among the trees and where the magnifying power of the instrument also showed spades at work and the sad duty of interment going on several of the common men bore proofs on their persons that their enemies had not been overcome entirely without resistance and the youngest of the two officers on the platform wore an arm in a sling his companion who commanded the party had been more fortunate he it was who used the glass in making the reconnoissances in which the two were engaged  a sergeant approached to make a report he addressed the senior of these officers as capt warley while the other was alluded to as mr which was equivalent to ensign thornton the former it will at once be seen was the officer who had been named with so much feeling in the parting dialogue between judith and hurry he was in truth the very individual with whom the scandal of the garrisons had most freely connected the name of this beautiful but indiscreet girl he was a hard featured red faced man of about five and thirty but of a military carriage and with an air of fashion that might easily impose on the imagination of one as ignorant of the world as judith  craig is covering us with benedictions observed this person to his young ensign with an air of indifference as he shut the glass and handed it to his servant to say the truth not without reason it is certainly more agreeable to be here in attendance on miss judith hutter than to be burying indians on a point of the lake however romantic the position or brilliant the victory by the way wrightis davis still living  he died about ten minutes since your honor returned the sergeant to whom this question was addressed i knew how it would be as soon as i found the bullet had touched the stomach i never knew a man who could hold out long if he had a hole in his stomach  no it is rather inconvenient for carrying away any thing very nourishing observed warley gaping this being up two nights de suite arthur plays the devil with a mans faculties im as stupid as one of those dutch parsons on the mohawki hope your arm is not painful my dear boy  it draws a few grimaces from me sir as i suppose you see answered the youth laughing at the very moment his countenance was a little awry with pain but it may be borne i suppose graham can spare a few minutes soon to look at my hurt  she is a lovely creature this judith hutter after all thornton and it shall not be my fault if she is not seen and admired in the parks resumed warley who thought little of his companions woundyour arm eh quite truego into the ark sergeant and tell dr graham i desire he would look at mr thorntons injury as soon as he has done with the poor fellow with the broken leg a lovely creature and she looked like a queen in that brocade dress in which we met her i find all changed here father and mother both gone the sister dying if not dead and none of the family left but the beauty this has been a lucky expedition all round and promises to terminate better than indian skirmishes in general  am i to suppose sir that you are about to desert your colours in the great corps of bachelors and close the campaign with matrimony  i tom warley turn benedict faith my dear boy you little know the corps you speak of if you fancy any such thing i do suppose there are women in the colonies that a captain of light infantry need not disdain but they are not to be found up here on a mountain lake or even down on the dutch river where we are posted it is true my uncle the general once did me the favor to choose a wife for me in yorkshire but she had no beautyand i would not marry a princess unless she were handsome  if handsome you would marry a beggar  ay these are the notions of an ensign love in a cottagedoorsand windowsthe old story for the hundredth time the 20thdont marry we are not a marrying corps my dear boy theres the colonel old sir edwin now though a full general he has never thought of a wife and when a man gets as high as a lieutenant general without matrimony he is pretty safe then the lieutenant colonel is confirmed as i tell my cousin the bishop the major is a widower having tried matrimony for twelve months in his youth and we look upon him now as one of our most certain men out of ten captains but one is in the dilemma and he poor devil is always kept at regimental headquarters as a sort of memento mori to the young men as they join as for the subalterns not one has ever yet had the audacity to speak of introducing a wife into the regiment but your arm is troublesome and well go ourselves and see what has become of graham  the surgeon who had accompanied the party was employed very differently from what the captain supposed when the assault was over and the dead and wounded were collected poor hetty had been found among the latter a rifle bullet had passed through her body inflicting an injury that was known at a glance to be mortal how this wound was received no one knew it was probably one of those casualties that ever accompany scenes like that related in the previous chapter  the sumach all the elderly women and some of the huron girls had fallen by the bayonet either in the confusion of the melee or from the difficulty of distinguishing the sexes when the dress was so simple much the greater portion of the warriors suffered on the spot a few had escaped however and two or three had been taken unharmed as for the wounded the bayonet saved the surgeon much trouble rivenoak had escaped with life and limb but was injured and a prisoner as captain warley and his ensign went into the ark they passed him seated in dignified silence in one end of the scow his head and leg bound but betraying no visible sign of despondency or despair that he mourned the loss of his tribe is certain still he did it in a manner that best became a warrior and a chief  the two soldiers found their surgeon in the principal room of the ark he was just quitting the pallet of hetty with an expression of sorrowful regret on his hard pockmarked scottish features that it was not usual to see there all his assiduity had been useless and he was compelled reluctantly to abandon the expectation of seeing the girl survive many hours dr graham was accustomed to deathbed scenes and ordinarily they produced but little impression on him in all that relates to religion his was one of those minds which in consequence of reasoning much on material things logically and consecutively and overlooking the total want of premises which such a theory must ever possess through its want of a primary agent had become sceptical leaving a vague opinion concerning the origin of things that with high pretentions to philosophy failed in the first of all philosophical principles a cause to him religious dependence appeared a weakness but when he found one gentle and young like hetty with a mind beneath the level of her race sustained at such a moment by these pious sentiments and that too in a way that many a sturdy warrior and reputed hero might have looked upon with envy he found himself affected by the sight to a degree that he would have been ashamed to confess edinburgh and aberdeen then as now supplied no small portion of the medical men of the british service and dr graham as indeed his name and countenance equally indicated was by birth a north briton  here is an extraordinary exhibition for a forest and one but halfgifted with reason he observed with a decided scotch accent as warley and the ensign entered i just hope gentlemen that when we three shall be called on to quit the 20th we may be found as resigned to go on the half pay of another existence as this poor demented chiel  is there no hope that she can survive the hurt demanded warley turning his eyes towards the pallid judith on whose cheeks however two large spots of red had settled as soon as he came into the cabin  no more than there is for chairlie stuart approach and judge for yourselves gentlemen yell see faith exemplified in an exceeding and wonderful manner there is a sort of arbitrium between life and death in actual conflict in the poor girls mind that renders her an interesting study to a philosopher mr thornton im at your service now we can just look at the arm in the next room while we speculate as much as we please on the operations and sinuosities of the human mind  the surgeon and ensign retired and warley had an opportunity of looking about him more at leisure and with a better understanding of the nature and feelings of the group collected in the cabin poor hetty had been placed on her own simple bed and was reclining in a half seated attitude with the approaches of death on her countenance though they were singularly dimmed by the lustre of an expression in which all the intelligence of her entire being appeared to be concentrated judith and hist were near her the former seated in deep grief the latter standing in readiness to offer any of the gentle attentions of feminine care deerslayer stood at the end of the pallet leaning on killdeer unharmed in person all the fine martial ardor that had so lately glowed in his countenance having given place to the usual look of honesty and benevolence qualities of which the expression was now softened by manly regret and pity the serpent was in the background of the picture erect and motionless as a statue but so observant that not a look of the eye escaped his own keen glances hurry completed the group being seated on a stool near the door like one who felt himself out of place in such a scene but who was ashamed to quit it unbidden  who is that in scarlet asked hetty as soon as the captains uniform caught her eye tell me judith is it the friend of hurry  tis the officer who commands the troops that have rescued us all from the hands of the hurons was the low answer of the sister  am i rescued tooi thought they said i was shot and about to die mother is dead and so is father but you are living judith and so is hurry i was afraid hurry would be killed when i heard him shouting among the soldiers  never mindnever mind dear hetty interrupted judith sensitively alive to the preservation of her sisters secret more perhaps at such a moment than at any other hurry is well and deerslayer is well and the delaware is well too  how came they to shoot a poor girl like me and let so many men go unharmed i didnt know that the hurons were so wicked judith  twas an accident poor hetty a sad accident it has been no one would willingly have injured you  im glad of thati thought it strange i am feeble minded and the redmen have never harmed me before i should be sorry to think that they had changed their minds i am glad too judith that they havent hurt hurry deerslayer i dont think god will suffer any one to harm it was very fortunate the soldiers came as they did though for fire will burn  it was indeed fortunate my sister gods holy name be forever blessed for the mercy  i dare say judith you know some of the officers you used to know so many  judith made no reply she hid her face in her hands and groaned hetty gazed at her in wonder but naturally supposing her own situation was the cause of this grief she kindly offered to console her sister  dont mind me dear judith said the affectionate and purehearted creature i dont suffer if i do die why father and mother are both dead and what happens to them may well happen to me you know i am of less account than any of the family therefore few will think of me after im in the lake  no no nopoor dear dear hetty exclaimed judith in an uncontrollable burst of sorrow i at least will ever think of you and gladly oh how gladly would i exchange places with you to be the pure excellent sinless creature you are  until now captain warley had stood leaning against the door of the cabin when this outbreak of feeling and perchance of penitence however escaped the beautiful girl he walked slowly and thoughtfully away even passing the ensign then suffering under the surgeons care without noticing him  i have got my bible here judith returned her sister in a voice of triumph its true i cant read any longer theres something the matter with my eyesyou look dim and distantand so does hurry now i look at himwell i never could have believed that henry march would have so dull a look what can be the reason judith that i see so badly today i who mother always said had the best eyes in the whole family yes that was it my mind was feeblewhat people call halfwittedbut my eyes were so good  again judith groaned this time no feeling of self no retrospect of the past caused the pain it was the pure heartfelt sorrow of sisterly love heightened by a sense of the meek humility and perfect truth of the being before her at that moment she would gladly have given up her own life to save that of hetty as the last however was beyond the reach of human power she felt there was nothing left her but sorrow at this moment warley returned to the cabin drawn by a secret impulse he could not withstand though he felt just then as if he would gladly abandon the american continent forever were it practicable instead of pausing at the door he now advanced so near the pallet of the sufferer as to come more plainly within her gaze hetty could still distinguish large objects and her look soon fastened on him  are you the officer that came with hurry she asked if you are we ought all to thank you for though i am hurt the rest have saved their lives did harry march tell you where to find us and how much need there was for your services  the news of the party reached us by means of a friendly runner returned the captain glad to relieve his feelings by this appearance of a friendly communication and i was immediately sent out to cut it off it was fortunate certainly that we met hurry harry as you call him for he acted as a guide and it was not less fortunate that we heard a firing which i now understand was merely a shooting at the mark for it not only quickened our march but called us to the right side of the lake the delaware saw us on the shore with the glass it would seem and he and hist as i find his squaw is named did us excellent service it was really altogether a fortunate concurrence of circumstances judith  talk not to me of any thing fortunate sir returned the girl huskily again concealing her face to me the world is full of misery i wish never to hear of marks or rifles or soldiers or men again  do you know my sister asked hetty ere the rebuked soldier had time to rally for an answer how came you to know that her name is judith you are right for that is her name and i am hetty thomas hutters daughters  for heavens sake dearest sister for my sake beloved hetty interposed judith imploringly say no more of this  hetty looked surprised but accustomed to comply she ceased her awkward and painful interrogations of warley bending her eyes towards the bible which she still held between her hands as one would cling to a casket of precious stones in a shipwreck or a conflagration her mind now adverted to the future losing sight in a great measure of the scenes of the past  we shall not long be parted judith she said when you die you must be brought and be buried in the lake by the side of mother too  would to god hetty that i lay there at this moment  no that cannot be judith people must die before they have any right to be buried twould be wicked to bury you or for you to bury yourself while living once i thought of burying myself god kept me from that sin  youyou hetty hutter think of such an act exclaimed judith looking up in uncontrollable surprise for she well knew nothing passed the lips of her conscientious sister that was not religiously true  yes i did judith but god has forgottenno he forgets nothingbut he has forgiven it returned the dying girl with the subdued manner of a repentant child twas after mothers death i felt i had lost the best friend i had on earth if not the only friend tis true you and father were kind to me judith but i was so feebleminded i knew i should only give you trouble and then you were so often ashamed of such a sister and daughter and tis hard to live in a world where all look upon you as below them i thought then if i could bury myself by the side of mother i should be happier in the lake than in the hut  forgive mepardon me dearest hettyon my bended knees i beg you to pardon me sweet sister if any word or act of mine drove you to so maddening and cruel a thought  get up judithkneel to god dont kneel to me just so i felt when mother was dying i remembered everything i had said and done to vex her and could have kissed her feet for forgiveness i think it must be so with all dying people though now i think of it i dont remember to have had such feelings on account of father  judith arose hid her face in her apron and wept a long pauseone of more than two hourssucceeded during which warley entered and left the cabin several times apparently uneasy when absent and yet unable to remain he issued various orders which his men proceeded to execute and there was an air of movement in the party more especially as mr craig the lieutenant had got through the unpleasant duty of burying the dead and had sent for instructions from the shore desiring to know what he was to do with his detachment during this interval hetty slept a little and deerslayer and chingachgook left the ark to confer together but at the end of the time mentioned the surgeon passed upon the platform and with a degree of feeling his comrades had never before observed in one of his habits he announced that the patient was rapidly drawing near her end on receiving this intelligence the group collected again curiosity to witness such a deathor a better feelingdrawing to the spot men who had so lately been actors in a scene seemingly of so much greater interest and moment by this time judith had got to be inactive through grief and hist alone was performing the little offices of feminine attention that are so appropriate to the sick bed hetty herself had undergone no other apparent change than the general failing that indicated the near approach of dissolution all that she possessed of mind was as clear as ever and in some respects her intellect perhaps was more than usually active  dont grieve for me so much judith said the gentle sufferer after a pause in her remarks i shall soon see motheri think i see her now her face is just as sweet and smiling as it used to be perhaps when im dead god will give me all my mind and i shall become a more fitting companion for mother than i ever was before  you will be an angel in heaven hetty sobbed the sister no spirit there will be more worthy of its holy residence  i dont understand it quite still i know it must be all true ive read it in the bible how dark its becoming can it be night so soon i can hardly see you at allwhere is hist  i here poor girlwhy you no see me  i do see you but i couldnt tell whether twas you or judith i believe i shant see you much longer hist  sorry for that poor hetty never mindpaleface got a heaven for girl as well as for warrior  wheres the serpent let me speak to him give me his hand so i feel it delaware you will love and cherish this young indian womani know how fond she is of you you must be fond of her dont treat her as some of your people treat their wives be a real husband to her now bring deerslayer near me give me his hand  this request was complied with and the hunter stood by the side of the pallet submitting to the wishes of the girl with the docility of a child  i feel deerslayer she resumed though i couldnt tell whybut i feel that you and i are not going to part for ever tis a strange feeling i never had it before i wonder what it comes from  tis god encouraging you in extremity hetty as such it ought to be harbored and respected yes we shall meet agin though it may be a long time first and in a far distant land  do you mean to be buried in the lake too if so that may account for the feeling  tis little likely gal tis little likely but theres a region for christian souls where theres no lakes nor woods they say though why there should be none of the last is more than i can account for seeing that pleasantness and peace is the object in view my grave will be found in the forest most likely but i hope my spirit will not be far from yourn  so it must be then i am too weakminded to understand these things but i feel that you and i will meet again sister where are you i cant see now anything but darkness it must be night surely  oh hetty i am here at your side these are my arms that are around you sobbed judith speak dearest is there anything you wish to say or have done in this awful moment  by this time hettys sight had entirely failed her nevertheless death approached with less than usual of its horrors as if in tenderness to one of her halfendowed faculties she was pale as a corpse but her breathing was easy and unbroken while her voice though lowered almost to a whisper remained clear and distinct when her sister put this question however a blush diffused itself over the features of the dying girl so faint however as to be nearly imperceptible resembling that hue of the rose which is thought to portray the tint of modesty rather than the dye of the flower in its richer bloom no one but judith detected this exposure of feeling one of the gentle expressions of womanly sensibility even in death on her however it was not lost nor did she conceal from herself the cause  hurry is here dearest hetty whispered the sister with her face so near the sufferer as to keep the words from other ears shall i tell him to come and receive your good wishes  a gentle pressure of the hand answered in the affirmative then hurry was brought to the side of the pallet it is probable that this handsome but rude woodsman had never before found himself so awkwardly placed though the inclination which hetty felt for him a sort of secret yielding to the instincts of nature rather than any unbecoming impulse of an illregulated imagination was too pure and unobtrusive to have created the slightest suspicion of the circumstance in his mind he allowed judith to put his hard colossal hand between those of hetty and stood waiting the result in awkward silence  this is hurry dearest whispered judith bending over her sister ashamed to utter the words so as to be audible to herself speak to him and let him go  what shall i say judith  nay whatever your own pure spirit teaches my love trust to that and you need fear nothing  good bye hurry murmured the girl with a gentle pressure of his hand i wish you would try and be more like deerslayer  these words were uttered with difficulty a faint flush succeeded them for a single instant then the hand was relinquished and hetty turned her face aside as if done with the world the mysterious feeling that bound her to the young man a sentiment so gentle as to be almost imperceptible to herself and which could never have existed at all had her reason possessed more command over her senses was forever lost in thoughts of a more elevated though scarcely of a purer character  of what are you thinking my sweet sister whispered judith tell me that i may aid you at this moment  motheri see mother now and bright beings around her in the lake why isnt father there its odd that i can see mother when i cant see you farewell judith  the last words were uttered after a pause and her sister had hung over her some time in anxious watchfulness before she perceived that the gentle spirit had departed thus died hetty hutter one of those mysterious links between the material and immaterial world which while they appear to be deprived of so much that it is esteemed and necessary for this state of being draw so near to and offer so beautiful an illustration of the truth purity and simplicity of another    chapter xxxii       a barons chylde to be begylde     it were a cursed dede     to be felàwe with an outlàwe

followed proved to be melancholy though one of much activity the soldiers who had so lately been employed in interring their victims were now called on to bury their own dead the scene of the morning had left a saddened feeling on all the gentlemen of the party and the rest felt the influence of a similar sensation in a variety of ways and from many causes hour dragged on after hour until evening arrived and then came the last melancholy offices in honor of poor hetty hutter her body was laid in the lake by the side of that of the mother she had so loved and reverenced the surgeon though actually an unbeliever so far complying with the received decencies of life as to read the funeral service over her grave as he had previously done over those of the other christian slain it mattered not that all seeing eye which reads the heart could not fail to discriminate between the living and the dead and the gentle soul of the unfortunate girl was already far removed beyond the errors or deceptions of any human ritual these simple rites however were not wholly wanting in suitable accompaniments the tears of judith and hist were shed freely and deerslayer gazed upon the limpid water that now flowed over one whose spirit was even purer than its own mountain springs with glistening eyes even the delaware turned aside to conceal his weakness while the common men gazed on the ceremony with wondering eyes and chastened feelings  the business of the day closed with this pious office by order of the commanding officer all retired early to rest for it was intended to begin the march homeward with the return of light one party indeed bearing the wounded the prisoners and the trophies had left the castle in the middle of the day under the guidance of hurry intending to reach the fort by shorter marches it had been landed on the point so often mentioned or that described in our opening pages and when the sun set was already encamped on the brow of the long broken and ridgy hills that fell away towards the valley of the mohawk the departure of this detachment had greatly simplified the duty of the succeeding day disencumbering its march of its baggage and wounded and otherwise leaving him who had issued the order greater liberty of action  judith held no communications with any but hist after the death of her sister until she retired for the night her sorrow had been respected and both the females had been left with the body unintruded on to the last moment the rattling of the drum broke the silence of that tranquil water and the echoes of the tattoo were heard among the mountains so soon after the ceremony was over as to preclude the danger of interruption that star which had been the guide of hist rose on a scene as silent as if the quiet of nature had never yet been disturbed by the labors or passions of man one solitary sentinel with his relief paced the platform throughout the night and morning was ushered in as usual by the martial beat of the reveille  military precision succeeded to the desultory proceedings of border men and when a hasty and frugal breakfast was taken the party began its movement towards the shore with a regularity and order that prevented noise or confusion of all the officers warley alone remained craig headed the detachment in advance thornton was with the wounded and graham accompanied his patients as a matter of course even the chest of hutter with all the more valuable of his effects was borne away leaving nothing behind that was worth the labor of a removal judith was not sorry to see that the captain respected her feelings and that he occupied himself entirely with the duty of his command leaving her to her own discretion and feelings it was understood by all that the place was to be totally abandoned but beyond this no explanations were asked or given  the soldiers embarked in the ark with the captain at their head he had enquired of judith in what way she chose to proceed and understanding her wish to remain with hist to the last moment he neither molested her with requests nor offended her with advice there was but one safe and familiar trail to the mohawk and on that at the proper hour he doubted not that they should meet in amity if not in renewed intercourse when all were on board the sweeps were manned and the ark moved in its sluggish manner towards the distant point deerslayer and chingachgook now lifted two of the canoes from the water and placed them in the castle the windows and door were then barred and the house was left by means of the trap in the manner already described on quitting the palisades hist was seen in the remaining canoe where the delaware immediately joined her and paddled away leaving judith standing alone on the platform owing to this prompt proceeding deerslayer found himself alone with the beautiful and still weeping mourner too simple to suspect anything the young man swept the light boat round and received its mistress in it when he followed the course already taken by his friend the direction to the point led diagonally past and at no great distance from the graves of the dead as the canoe glided by judith for the first time that morning spoke to her companion she said but little merely uttering a simple request to stop for a minute or two ere she left the place  i may never see this spot again deerslayer she said and it contains the bodies of my mother and sister is it not possible think you that the innocence of one of these beings may answer in the eyes of god for the salvation of both  i dont understand it so judith though im no missionary and am but poorly taught each spirit answers for its own backslidings though a hearty repentance will satisfy gods laws  then must my poor poor mother be in heaven bitterly bitterly has she repented of her sins and surely her sufferings in this life ought to count as something against her sufferings in the next  all this goes beyond me judith i strive to do right here as the surest means of keeping all right hereafter hetty was oncommon as all that knowd her must allow and her soul was as fit to consart with angels the hour it left its body as that of any saint in the bible  i do believe you only do her justice alas alas that there should be so great differences between those who were nursed at the same breast slept in the same bed and dwelt under the same roof but no mattermove the canoe a little farther east deerslayerthe sun so dazzles my eyes that i cannot see the graves this is hettys on the right of mothers  sartainyou askd that of us and all are glad to do as you wish judith when you do that which is right  the girl gazed at him near a minute in silent attention then she turned her eyes backward at the castle this lake will soon be entirely deserted she said and this too at a moment when it will be a more secure dwelling place than ever what has so lately happened will prevent the iroquois from venturing again to visit it for a long time to come  that it will yes that may be set down as sartain i do not mean to pass thisaway agin so long as the war lasts for to my mind no huron moccasin will leave its print on the leaves of this forest until their traditions have forgotten to tell their young men of their disgrace and rout  and do you so delight in violence and bloodshed i had thought better of you deerslayerbelieved you one who could find his happiness in a quiet domestic home with an attached and loving wife ready to study your wishes and healthy and dutiful children anxious to follow in your footsteps and to become as honest and just as yourself  lord judith what a tongue youre mistress of speech and looks go hand in hand like and what one cant do the other is pretty sartain to perform such a gal in a month might spoil the stoutest warrior in the colony  and am i then so mistaken do you really love war deerslayer better than the hearth and the affections  i understand your meaning gal yes i do understand what you mean i believe though i dont think you altogether understand me warrior i may now call myself i suppose for ive both fout and conquered which is sufficient for the name neither will i deny that ive feelins for the callin which is both manful and honorable when carried on accordin to natral gifts but ive no relish for blood youth is youth howsever and a mingo is a mingo if the young men of this region stood by and suffered the vagabonds to overrun the land why we might as well all turn frenchers at once and give up country and kin im no fire eater judith or one that likes fightin for fightins sake but i can see no great difference atween givin up territory afore a war out of a dread of war and givin it up ater a war because we cant help it onless it be that the last is the most manful and honorable  no woman would ever wish to see her husband or brother stand by and submit to insult and wrong deerslayer however she might mourn the necessity of his running into the dangers of battle but youve done enough already in clearing this region of the hurons since to you is principally owing the credit of our late victory now listen to me patiently and answer me with that native honesty which it is as pleasant to regard in one of your sex as it is unusual to meet with  judith paused for now that she was on the very point of explaining herself native modesty asserted its power notwithstanding the encouragement and confidence she derived from the great simplicity of her companions character her cheeks which had so lately been pale flushed and her eyes lighted with some of their former brilliancy feeling gave expression to her countenance and softness to her voice rendering her who was always beautiful trebly seductive and winning  deerslayer she said after a considerable pause this is not a moment for affectation deception or a want of frankness of any sort here over my mothers grave and over the grave of truthloving truthtelling hetty everything like unfair dealing seems to be out of place i will therefore speak to you without any reserve and without any dread of being misunderstood you are not an acquaintance of a week but it appears to me as if i had known you for years so much and so much that is important has taken place within that short time that the sorrows and dangers and escapes of a whole life have been crowded into a few days and they who have suffered and acted together in such scenes ought not to feel like strangers i know that what i am about to say might be misunderstood by most men but i hope for a generous construction of my course from you we are not here dwelling among the arts and deceptions of the settlements but young people who have no occasion to deceive each other in any manner or form i hope i make myself understood  sartain judith few convarse better than yourself and none more agreeable like your words are as pleasant as your looks  it is the manner in which you have so often praised those looks that gives me courage to proceed still deerslayer it is not easy for one of my sex and years to forget all her lessons of infancy all her habits and her natural diffidence and say openly what her heart feels  why not judith why shouldnt women as well as men deal fairly and honestly by their fellow creaturs i see no reason why you should not speak as plainly as myself when there is any thing raally important to be said  this indomitable diffidence which still prevented the young man from suspecting the truth would have completely discouraged the girl had not her whole soul as well as her whole heart been set upon making a desperate effort to rescue herself from a future that she dreaded with a horror as vivid as the distinctness with which she fancied she foresaw it this motive however raised her above all common considerations and she persevered even to her own surprise if not to her great confusion  i willi must deal as plainly with you as i would with poor dear hetty were that sweet child living she continued turning pale instead of blushing the high resolution by which she was prompted reversing the effect that such a procedure would ordinarily produce on one of her sex yes i will smother all other feelings in the one that is now uppermost you love the woods and the life that we pass here in the wilderness away from the dwellings and towns of the whites  as i loved my parents judith when they was living this very spot would be all creation to me could this war be fairly over once and the settlers kept at a distance  why quit it then it has no ownerat least none who can claim a better right than mine and that i freely give to you were it a kingdom deerslayer i think i should delight to say the same let us then return to it after we have seen the priest at the fort and never quit it again until god calls us away to that world where we shall find the spirits of my poor mother and sister  a long thoughtful pause succeeded judith here covered her face with both her hands after forcing herself to utter so plain a proposal and deerslayer musing equally in sorrow and surprise on the meaning of the language he had just heard at length the hunter broke the silence speaking in a tone that was softened to gentleness by his desire not to offend  you havent thought well of this judith he said no your feelins are awakened by all that has lately happened and believin yourself to be without kindred in the world you are in too great haste to find some to fill the places of them thats lost  were i living in a crowd of friends deerslayer i should still think as i now thinksay as i now say returned judith speaking with her hands still shading her lovely face  thank you galthank you from the bottom of my heart howsever i am not one to take advantage of a weak moment when youre forgetful of your own great advantages and fancy arth and all it holds is in this little canoe nonojudith twould be onginerous in me what youve offered can never come to pass  it all may be and that without leaving cause of repentance to any answered judith with an impetuosity of feeling and manner that at once unveiled her eyes we can cause the soldiers to leave our goods on the road till we return when they can easily be brought back to the house the lake will be no more visited by the enemy this war at least all your skins may be readily sold at the garrison there you can buy the few necessaries we shall want for i wish never to see the spot again and deerslayer added the girl smiling with a sweetness and nature that the young man found it hard to resist as a proof how wholly i am and wish to be yourshow completely i desire to be nothing but your wife the very first fire that we kindle after our return shall be lighted with the brocade dress and fed by every article i have that you may think unfit for the woman you wish to live with  ahs meyoure a winning and a lovely creatur judith yes you are all that and no one can deny it and speak truth these picturs are pleasant to the thoughts but they mightnt prove so happy as you now think em forget it all therefore and let us paddle after the sarpent and hist as if nothing had been said on the subject  judith was deeply mortified and what is more she was profoundly grieved still there was a steadiness and quiet in the manner of deerslayer that completely smothered her hopes and told her that for once her exceeding beauty had failed to excite the admiration and homage it was wont to receive women are said seldom to forgive those who slight their advances but this high spirited and impetuous girl entertained no shadow of resentment then or ever against the fair dealing and ingenuous hunter at the moment the prevailing feeling was the wish to be certain that there was no misunderstanding after another painful pause therefore she brought the matter to an issue by a question too direct to admit of equivocation  god forbid that we lay up regrets in after life through my want of sincerity now she said i hope we understand each other at least you will not accept me for a wife deerslayer  tis better for both that i shouldnt take advantage of your own forgetfulness judith we can never marry  you do not love mecannot find it in your heart perhaps to esteem me deerslayer  everything in the way of frindship juditheverything even to sarvices and life itself yes id risk as much for you at this moment as i would risk in behalf of hist and that is sayin as much as i can say of any darter of woman i do not think i feel towards eithermind i say either judithas if i wished to quit father and motherif father and mother was livin which howsever neither isbut if both was livin i do not feel towards any woman as if i wishd to quit em in order to cleave unto her  this is enough answered judith in a rebuked and smothered voice i understand all that you mean marry you cannot with loving and that love you do not feel for me make no answer if i am right for i shall understand your silence that will be painful enough of itself  deerslayer obeyed her and he made no reply for more than a minute the girl riveted her bright eyes on him as if to read his soul while he was playing with the water like a corrected school boy then judith herself dropped the end of her paddle and urged the canoe away from the spot with a movement as reluctant as the feelings which controlled it deerslayer quietly aided the effort however and they were soon on the trackless line taken by the delaware  in their way to the point not another syllable was exchanged between deerslayer and his fair companion as judith sat in the bow of the canoe her back was turned towards him else it is probable the expression of her countenance might have induced him to venture some soothing terms of friendship and regard contrary to what would have been expected resentment was still absent though the colour frequently changed from the deep flush of mortification to the paleness of disappointment sorrow deep heartfelt sorrow however was the predominant emotion and this was betrayed in a manner not to be mistaken  as neither labored hard at the paddle the ark had already arrived and the soldiers had disembarked before the canoe of the two loiterers reached the point chingachgook had preceded it and was already some distance in the wood at a spot where the two trails that to the garrison and that to the villages of the delawares separated the soldiers too had taken up their line of march first setting the ark adrift again with a reckless disregard of its fate all this judith saw but she heeded it not the glimmerglass had no longer any charms for her and when she put her foot on the strand she immediately proceeded on the trail of the soldiers without casting a single glance behind her even hist was passed unnoticed that modest young creature shrinking from the averted face of judith as if guilty herself of some wrongdoing  wait you here sarpent said deerslayer as he followed in the footsteps of the dejected beauty while passing his friend i will just see judith among her party and come and jine you  a hundred yards had hid the couple from those in front as well as those in their rear when judith turned and spoke  this will do deerslayer she said sadly i understand your kindness but shall not need it in a few minutes i shall reach the soldiers as you cannot go with me on the journey of life i do not wish you to go further on this but stopbefore we part i would ask you a single question and i require of you as you fear god and reverence the truth not to deceive me in your answer i know you do not love another and i can see but one reason why you cannot will not love me tell me then deerslayer the girl paused the words she was about to utter seeming to choke her then rallying all her resolution with a face that flushed and paled at every breath she drew she continued  tell me then deerslayer if anything light of me that henry march has said may not have influenced your feelings  truth was the deerslayers polar star he ever kept it in view and it was nearly impossible for him to avoid uttering it even when prudence demanded silence judith read his answer in his countenance and with a heart nearly broken by the consciousness of undue erring she signed to him an adieu and buried herself in the woods for some time deerslayer was irresolute as to his course but in the end he retraced his steps and joined the delaware that night the three camped on the head waters of their own river and the succeeding evening they entered the village of the tribe chingachgook and his betrothed in triumph their companion honored and admired but in a sorrow that it required months of activity to remove  the war that then had its rise was stirring and bloody the delaware chief rose among his people until his name was never mentioned without eulogiums while another uncas the last of his race was added to the long line of warriors who bore that distinguishing appellation as for the deerslayer under the sobriquet of hawkeye he made his fame spread far and near until the crack of his rifle became as terrible to the ears of the mingos as the thunders of the manitou his services were soon required by the officers of the crown and he especially attached himself in the field to one in particular with whose after life he had a close and important connection  fifteen years had passed away ere it was in the power of the deerslayer to revisit the glimmerglass a peace had intervened and it was on the eve of another and still more important war when he and his constant friend chingachgook were hastening to the forts to join their allies a stripling accompanied them for hist already slumbered beneath the pines of the delawares and the three survivors had now become inseparable they reached the lake just as the sun was setting here all was unchanged the river still rushed through its bower of trees the little rock was washing away by the slow action of the waves in the course of centuries the mountains stood in their native dress dark rich and mysterious while the sheet glistened in its solitude a beautiful gem of the forest  the following morning the youth discovered one of the canoes drifted on the shore in a state of decay a little labor put it in a state for service and they all embarked with a desire to examine the place all the points were passed and chingachgook pointed out to his son the spot where the hurons had first encamped and the point whence he had succeeded in stealing his bride here they even landed but all traces of the former visit had disappeared next they proceeded to the scene of the battle and there they found a few of the signs that linger around such localities wild beasts had disinterred many of the bodies and human bones were bleaching in the rains of summer uncas regarded all with reverence and pity though traditions were already rousing his young mind to the ambition and sternness of a warrior  from the point the canoe took its way toward the shoal where the remains of the castle were still visible a picturesque ruin the storms of winter had long since unroofed the house and decay had eaten into the logs all the fastenings were untouched but the seasons rioted in the place as if in mockery at the attempt to exclude them the palisades were rotting as were the piles and it was evident that a few more recurrences of winter a few more gales and tempests would sweep all into the lake and blot the building from the face of that magnificent solitude the graves could not be found either the elements had obliterated their traces or time had caused those who looked for them to forget their position  the ark was discovered stranded on the eastern shore where it had long before been driven with the prevalent northwest winds it lay on the sandy extremity of a long low point that is situated about two miles from the outlet and which is itself fast disappearing before the action of the elements the scow was filled with water the cabin unroofed and the logs were decaying some of its coarser furniture still remained and the heart of deerslayer beat quick as he found a ribbon of judiths fluttering from a log it recalled all her beauty and we may add all her failings although the girl had never touched his heart the hawkeye for so we ought now to call him still retained a kind and sincere interest in her welfare he tore away the ribbon and knotted it to the stock of killdeer which had been the gift of the girl herself  a few miles farther up the lake another of the canoes was discovered and on the point where the party finally landed were found those which had been left there upon the shore that in which the present navigation was made and the one discovered on the eastern shore had dropped through the decayed floor of the castle drifted past the falling palisades and had been thrown as waifs upon the beach  from all these signs it was probable the lake had not been visited since the occurrence of the final scene of our tale accident or tradition had rendered it again a spot sacred to nature the frequent wars and the feeble population of the colonies still confining the settlements within narrow boundaries chingachgook and his friend left the spot with melancholy feelings it had been the region of their first war path and it carried back the minds of both to scenes of tenderness as well as to hours of triumph they held their way towards the mohawk in silence however to rush into new adventures as stirring and as remarkable as those which had attended their opening careers on this lovely lake at a later day they returned to the place where the indian found a grave  time and circumstances have drawn an impenetrable mystery around all else connected with the hutters they lived erred died and are forgotten none connected have felt sufficient interest in the disgraced and disgracing to withdraw the veil and a century is about to erase even the recollection of their names the history of crime is ever revolting and it is fortunate that few love to dwell on its incidents the sins of the family have long since been arraigned at the judgment seat of god or are registered for the terrible settlement of the last great day  the same fate attended judith when hawkeye reached the garrison on the mohawk he enquired anxiously after that lovely but misguided creature none knew hereven her person was no longer remembered other officers had again and again succeeded the warleys and craigs and grahams though an old sergeant of the garrison who had lately come from england was enabled to tell our hero that sir robert warley lived on his paternal estates and that there was a lady of rare beauty in the lodge who had great influence over him though she did not bear his name whether this was judith relapsed into her early failing or some other victim of the soldiers hawkeye never knew nor would it be pleasant or profitable to inquire we live in a world of transgressions and selfishness and no pictures that represent us otherwise can be true though happily for human nature gleamings of that pure spirit in whose likeness man has been fashioned are to be seen relieving its deformities and mitigating if not excusing its crimes
