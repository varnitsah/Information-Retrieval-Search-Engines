same in mould and lineament carriage and form and outward semblances i trust thou art in noble mind the same  guido  oh tell me of my father i have lived but for this moment  moranzone  we must be

exit ascanio now tell me of my father sits down on a stone seat stood he tall i warrant he looked tall upon his horse his hair was black or perhaps a reddish gold like a red fire of gold  was his voice low the very bravest men have voices sometimes full of low music or a clarion was it that brake with terror all his enemies did he ride singly or with many squires and valiant gentlemen to serve his state for oftentimes methinks i feel my veins beat with the blood of kings  was he a king  moranzone  ay of all men he was the kingliest  guido  proudly  then when you saw my noble father last he was set high above the heads of men  moranzone  ay he was high above the heads of men walks over to guido and puts his hand upon his shoulder on a red scaffold with a butchers block set for his neck  guido  leaping up what dreadful man art thou that like a raven or the midnight owl comst with this awful message from the grave  moranzone  i am known here as the count moranzone lord of a barren castle on a rock with a few acres of unkindly land and six not thrifty servants  but i was one of parmas noblest princes more than that i was your fathers friend  guido  clasping his hand  tell me of him  moranzone  you are the son of that great duke lorenzo he was the prince of parma and the duke of all the fair domains of lombardy down to the gates of florence nay florence even was wont to pay him tribute   guido  come to his death  moranzone  you will hear that soon enough  being at war  o noble lion of war that would not suffer injustice done in italyhe led the very flower of chivalry against that foul adulterous lord of rimini giovanni malatestawhom god curse and was by him in treacherous ambush taken and like a villain or a lowborn knave was by him on the public scaffold murdered  guido  clutching his dagger  doth malatesta live  moranzone  no he is dead  guido  did you say dead  o too swift runner death couldst thou not wait for me a little space and i had done thy bidding  moranzone  clutching his wrist  thou canst do it the man who sold thy father is alive  guido  sold was my father sold  moranzone  ay trafficked for like a vile chattel for a price betrayed bartered and bargained for in privy market by one whom he had held his perfect friend one he had trusted one he had well loved one whom by ties of kindness he had bound   guido  and he lives who sold my father  moranzone  i will bring you to him  guido  so judas thou art living well i will make this world thy field of blood so buy it straightway for thou must hang there  moranzone  judas said you boy yes judas in his treachery but still he was more wise than judas was and held those thirty silver pieces not enough  guido  what got he for my fathers blood  moranzone  what got he why cities fiefs and principalities vineyards and lands  guido  of which he shall but keep six feet of ground to rot in  where is he this damned villain this foul devil where show me the man and come he cased in steel in complete panoply and pride of war ay guarded by a thousand menatarms yet i shall reach him through their spears and feel the last black drop of blood from his black heart crawl down my blade  show me the man i say and i will kill him  moranzone  coldly fool what revenge is there death is the common heritage of all and death comes best when it comes suddenly goes up close to guido your father was betrayed there is your cue for you shall sell the seller in his turn i will make you of his household you shall sit at the same board with him eat of his bread   guido  o bitter bread  moranzone  thy palate is too nice revenge will make it sweet  thou shalt o nights pledge him in wine drink from his cup and be his intimate so he will fawn on thee love thee and trust thee in all secret things if he bid thee be merry thou must laugh and if it be his humour to be sad thou shalt don sables  then when the time is ripe  guido clutches his sword nay nay i trust thee not your hot young blood undisciplined nature and too violent rage will never tarry for this great revenge but wreck itself on passion  guido  thou knowest me not tell me the man and i in everything will do thy bidding  moranzone  well when the time is ripe the victim trusting and the occasion sure i will by sudden secret messenger send thee a sign  guido  how shall i kill him tell me  moranzone  that night thou shalt creep into his private chamber but if he sleep see that thou wake him first and hold thy hand upon his throat ay that way then having told him of what blood thou art sprung from what father and for what revenge bid him to pray for mercy when he prays bid him to set a price upon his life and when he strips himself of all his gold tell him thou needest not gold and hast not mercy and do thy business straight away  swear to me thou wilt not kill him till i bid thee do it or else i go to mine own house and leave thee ignorant and thy father unavenged  guido  now by my fathers sword   moranzone  the common hangman brake that in sunder in the public square  guido  then by my fathers grave   moranzone  what grave what grave your noble father lieth in no grave i saw his dust strewn on the air his ashes whirled through the windy streets like common straws to plague a beggars eyesight and his head that gentle head set on the prison spike for the vile rabble in their insolence to shoot their tongues at  guido  was it so indeed then by my fathers spotless memory and by the shameful manner of his death and by the base betrayal by his friend for these at least remain by these i swear i will not lay my hand upon his life until you bid me thengod help his soul for he shall die as never dog died yet and now the sign what is it  moranzone  this dagger boy it was your fathers  guido  oh let me look at it i do remember now my reputed uncle that good old husbandman i left at home told me a cloak wrapped round me when a babe bare too such yellow leopards wrought in gold i like them best in steel as they are here they suit my purpose better  tell me sir have you no message from my father to me  moranzone  poor boy you never saw that noble father for when by his false friend he had been sold alone of all his gentlemen i escaped to bear the news to parma to the duchess  guido  speak to me of my mother  moranzone  when thy mother heard my black news she fell into a swoon and being with untimely travail seized  bare thee into the world before thy time and then her soul went heavenward to wait thy father at the gates of paradise  guido  a mother dead a father sold and bartered i seem to stand on some beleaguered wall and messenger comes after messenger with a new tale of terror give me breath mine ears are tired  moranzone  when thy mother died fearing our enemies i gave it out thou wert dead also and then privily conveyed thee to an ancient servitor who by perugia lived the rest thou knowest  guido  saw you my father afterwards  moranzone  ay once in mean attire like a vineyard dresser i stole to rimini  guido  taking his hand o generous heart  moranzone  one can buy everything in rimini and so i bought the gaolers when your father heard that a man child had been born to him his noble face lit up beneath his helm like a great fire seen far out at sea and taking my two hands he bade me guido to rear you worthy of him so i have reared you to revenge his death upon the friend who sold him  guido  thou hast done well i for my father thank thee and now his name  moranzone  how you remind me of him you have each gesture that your father had  guido  the traitors name  moranzone  thou wilt hear that anon the duke and other nobles at the court are coming hither  guido  what of that his name  moranzone  do they not seem a valiant company of honourable honest gentlemen  guido  his name milord  enter the duke of padua with count bardi maffio petrucci and other gentlemen of his court  moranzone  quickly the man to whom i kneel is he who sold your father mark me well  guido  clutches hit dagger the duke  moranzone  leave off that fingering of thy knife hast thou so soon forgotten kneels to the duke my noble lord  duke  welcome count moranzone tis some time since we have seen you here in padua we hunted near your castle yesterday  call you it castle that bleak house of yours wherein you sit amumbling oer your beads telling your vices like a good old man catches sight of guido and starts back who is that  moranzone  my sisters son your grace who being now of age to carry arms would for a season tarry at your court  duke  still looking at guido what is his name  moranzone  guido ferranti sir  duke  his city  moranzone  he is mantuan by birth  duke  advancing towards guido you have the eyes of one i used to know but he died childless  are you honest boy then be not spendthrift of your honesty but keep it to yourself in padua men think that honesty is ostentatious so it is not of the fashion  look at these lords  count bardi  aside here is some bitter arrow for us sure  duke  why every man among them has his price although to do them justice some of them are quite expensive  count bardi  aside there it comes indeed  duke  so be not honest eccentricity is not a thing should ever be encouraged although in this dull stupid age of ours the most eccentric thing a man can do is to have brains then the mob mocks at him and for the mob despise it as i do i hold its bubble praise and windy favours in such account that popularity is the one insult i have never suffered  maffio  aside  he has enough of hate if he needs that  duke  have prudence in your dealings with the world be not too hasty act on the second thought first impulses are generally good  guido  aside surely a toad sits on his lips and spills its venom there  duke  see thou hast enemies else will the world think very little of thee it is its test of power yet see thou showst a smiling mask of friendship to all men until thou hast them safely in thy grip then thou canst crush them  guido  aside o wise philosopher that for thyself dost dig so deep a grave  moranzone  to him dost thou mark his words  guido  oh be thou sure i do  duke  and be not overscrupulous clean hands with nothing in them make a sorry show if you would have the lions share of life you must wear the foxs skin  oh it will fit you it is a coat which fitteth every man  guido  your grace i shall remember  duke  that is well boy well i would not have about me shallow fools who with mean scruples weigh the gold of life and faltering paltering end by failure failure the only crime which i have not committed i would have men about me  as for conscience conscience is but the name which cowardice fleeing from battle scrawls upon its shield you understand me boy  guido  i do your grace and will in all things carry out the creed which you have taught me  maffio  i never heard your grace so much in the vein for preaching let the cardinal look to his laurels sir  duke  the cardinal men follow my creed and they gabble his i do not think much of the cardinal although he is a holy churchman and i quite admit his dulness  well sir from now we count you of our household he holds out his hand for guido to kiss  guido starts back in horror but at a gesture from count moranzone kneels and kisses it we will see that you are furnished with such equipage as doth befit your honour and our state  guido  i thank your grace most heartily  duke  tell me again what is your name  guido  guido ferranti sir  duke  and you are mantuan  look to your wives my lords when such a gallant comes to padua thou dost well to laugh count bardi i have noted how merry is that husband by whose hearth sits an uncomely wife  maffio  may it please your grace the wives of padua are above suspicion  duke  what are they so illfavoured  let us go this cardinal detains our pious duchess his sermon and his beard want cutting both will you come with us sir and hear a text from holy jerome  moranzone  bowing my liege there are some matters   duke  interrupting thou needst make no excuse for missing mass come gentlemen exit with his suite into cathedral  guido  after a pause so the duke sold my father i kissed his hand  moranzone  thou shalt do that many times  guido  must it be so  moranzone  ay thou hast sworn an oath  guido  that oath shall make me marble  moranzone  farewell boy thou wilt not see me till the time is ripe  guido  i pray thou comest quickly  moranzone  i will come when it is time be ready  guido  fear me not  moranzone  here is your friend see that you banish him both from your heart and padua  guido  from padua not from my heart  moranzone  nay from thy heart as well i will not leave thee till i see thee do it  guido  can i have no friend  moranzone  revenge shall be thy friend thou needst no other  guido  well then be it so enter ascanio cristofano  ascanio  come guido i have been beforehand with you in everything for i have drunk a flagon of wine eaten a pasty and kissed the maid who served it  why you look as melancholy as a schoolboy who cannot buy apples or a politician who cannot sell his vote  what news guido what news  guido  why that we two must part ascanio  ascanio  that would be news indeed but it is not true  guido  too true it is you must get hence ascanio and never look upon my face again  ascanio  no no indeed you do not know me guido tis true i am a common yeomans son nor versed in fashions of much courtesy but if you are nobly born cannot i be your serving man  i will tend you with more love than any hired servant  guido  clasping his hand ascanio sees moranzone looking at him and drops ascanios hand it cannot be  ascanio  what is it so with you i thought the friendship of the antique world was not yet dead but that the roman type might even in this poor and common age find counterparts of love then by this love which beats between us like a summer sea whatever lot has fallen to your hand may i not share it  guido  share it  ascanio  ay  guido  no no  ascanio  have you then come to some inheritance of lordly castle or of storedup gold  guido  bitterly ay i have come to my inheritance o bloody legacy and o murderous dole which like the thrifty miser must i hoard and to my own self keep and so i pray you let us part here  ascanio  what shall we never more sit hand in hand as we were wont to sit over some book of ancient chivalry stealing a truant holiday from school follow the huntsmen through the autumn woods and watch the falcons burst their tasselled jesses when the hare breaks from covert  guido  never more  ascanio  must i go hence without a word of love  guido  you must go hence and may love go with you  ascanio  you are unknightly and ungenerous  guido  unknightly and ungenerous if you will why should we waste more words about the matter let us part now  ascanio  have you no message guido  guido  none my whole past was but a schoolboys dream today my life begins  farewell  ascanio  farewell exit slowly  guido  now are you satisfied  have you not seen my dearest friend and my most loved companion thrust from me like a common kitchen knave oh that i did it  are you not satisfied  moranzone  ay i am satisfied  now i go hence do not forget the sign your fathers dagger and do the business when i send it to you  guido  be sure i shall  exit lord moranzone  guido  o thou eternal heaven if there is aught of nature in my soul of gentle pity or fond kindliness wither it up blast it bring it to nothing or if thou wilt not then will i myself cut pity with a sharp knife from my heart and strangle mercy in her sleep at night lest she speak to me  vengeance there i have it be thou my comrade and my bedfellow sit by my side ride to the chase with me when i am weary sing me pretty songs when i am light o heart make jest with me and when i dream whisper into my ear the dreadful secret of a fathers murder  did i say murder  draws his dagger listen thou terrible god thou god that punishest all broken oaths and bid some angel write this oath in fire that from this hour till my dear fathers murder in blood i have revenged i do forswear the noble ties of honourable friendship the noble joys of dear companionship affections bonds and loyal gratitude ay more from this same hour i do forswear all love of women and the barren thing which men call beauty  the organ peals in the cathedral and under a canopy of cloth of silver tissue borne by four pages in scarlet the duchess of padua comes down the steps as she passes across their eyes meet for a moment and as she leaves the stage she looks back at guido and the dagger falls from his hand oh who is that  a citizen  the duchess of padua  end of act i    act ii    scene  a state room in the ducal palace hung with tapestries representing the masque of venus a large door in the centre opens into a corridor of red marble through which one can see a view of padua a large canopy is set rc with three thrones one a little lower than the others the ceiling is made of long gilded beams furniture of the period chairs covered with gilt leather and buffets set with gold and silver plate and chests painted with mythological scenes  a number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down into the street below from the street comes the roar of a mob and cries of death to the duke after a little interval enter the duke very calmly he is leaning on the arm of guido ferranti with him enters also the lord cardinal the mob still shouting  duke  no my lord cardinal i weary of her why she is worse than ugly she is good  maffio  excitedly your grace there are two thousand people there who every moment grow more clamorous  duke  tut man they waste their strength upon their lungs people who shout so loud my lords do nothing the only men i fear are silent men a yell from the people you see lord cardinal how my people love me another yell  go petrucci and tell the captain of the guard below to clear the square  do you not hear me sir do what i bid you  exit petrucci  cardinal  i beseech your grace to listen to their grievances  duke  sitting on his throne ay the peaches are not so big this year as they were last i crave your pardon my lord cardinal i thought you spake of peaches a cheer from the people what is that  guido  rushes to the window the duchess has gone forth into the square and stands between the people and the guard and will not let them shoot  duke  the devil take her  guido  still at the window and followed by a dozen of the citizens has come into the palace  duke  starting up by saint james our duchess waxes bold  bardi  here comes the duchess  duke  shut that door there this morning air is cold they close the door on the corridor enter the duchess followed by a crowd of meanly dressed citizens  duchess  flinging herself upon her knees i do beseech your grace to give us audience  duke  what are these grievances  duchess  alas my lord such common things as neither you nor i nor any of these noble gentlemen have ever need at all to think about they say the bread the very bread they eat is made of sorry chaff  first citizen  ay so it is nothing but chaff  duke  and very good food too i give it to my horses  duchess  restraining herself they say the water set in the public cisterns for their use has through the breaking of the aqueduct to stagnant pools and muddy puddles turned  duke  they should drink wine water is quite unwholesome  second citizen  alack your grace the taxes which the customs take at the city gate are grown so high we cannot buy wine  duke  then you should bless the taxes which make you temperate  duchess  think while we sit in gorgeous pomp and state gaunt poverty creeps through their sunless lanes and with sharp knives cuts the warm throats of children stealthily and no word said  third citizen  ay marry that is true my little son died yesternight from hunger he was but six years old i am so poor i cannot bury him  duke  if you are poor are you not blessed in that  why poverty is one of the christian virtues turns to the cardinal is it not i know lord cardinal you have great revenues rich abbeylands and tithes and large estates for preaching voluntary poverty  duchess  nay but my lord the duke be generous while we sit here within a noble house with shaded porticoes against the sun and walls and roofs to keep the winter out there are many citizens of padua who in vile tenements live so full of holes that the chill rain the snow and the rude blast are tenants also with them others sleep under the arches of the public bridges all through the autumn nights till the wet mist stiffens their limbs and fevers come and so   duke  and so they go to abrahams bosom madam they should thank me for sending them to heaven if they are wretched here to the cardinal is it not said somewhere in holy writ that every man should be contented with that state of life god calls him to  why should i change their state or meddle with an allwise providence which has apportioned that some men should starve and others surfeit  i did not make the world  first citizen  he hath a hard heart  second citizen  nay be silent neighbour i think the cardinal will speak for us  cardinal  true it is christian to bear misery yet it is christian also to be kind and there seem many evils in this town which in your wisdom might your grace reform  first citizen  what is that word reform  what does it mean  second citizen  marry it means leaving things as they are i like it not  duke  reform lord cardinal did you say reform there is a man in germany called luther who would reform the holy catholic church have you not made him heretic and uttered anathema maranatha against him  cardinal  rising from his seat he would have led the sheep out of the fold we do but ask of you to feed the sheep  duke  when i have shorn their fleeces i may feed them as for these rebels  duchess entreats him  first citizen  that is a kind word he means to give us something  second citizen  is that so  duke  these ragged knaves who come before us here with mouths chockfull of treason  third citizen  good my lord fill up our mouths with bread well hold our tongues  duke  ye shall hold your tongues whether you starve or not my lords this age is so familiar grown that the low peasant hardly doffs his hat unless you beat him and the raw mechanic elbows the noble in the public streets to the citizens still as our gentle duchess has so prayed us and to refuse so beautiful a beggar were to lack both courtesy and love touching your grievances i promise this   first citizen  marry he will lighten the taxes  second citizen  or a dole of bread think you for each man  duke  that on next sunday the lord cardinal shall after holy mass preach you a sermon upon the beauty of obedience citizens murmur  first citizen  i faith that will not fill our stomachs  second citizen  a sermon is but a sorry sauce when you have nothing to eat with it  duchess  poor people you see i have no power with the duke but if you go into the court without my almoner shall from my private purse divide a hundred ducats mongst you all  first citizen  god save the duchess say i  second citizen  god save her  duchess  and every monday morn shall bread be set for those who lack it citizens applaud and go out  first citizen  going out why god save the duchess again  duke  calling him back come hither fellow what is your name  first citizen  dominick sir  duke  a good name  why were you called dominick  first citizen  scratching his head marry because i was born on st georges day  duke  a good reason here is a ducat for you will you not cry for me god save the duke  first citizen  feebly god save the duke  duke  nay louder fellow louder  first citizen  a little louder god save the duke  duke  more lustily fellow put more heart in it here is another ducat for you  first citizen  enthusiastically god save the duke  duke  mockingly why gentlemen this simple fellows love touches me much  to the citizen harshly go  exit citizen bowing this is the way my lords you can buy popularity nowadays oh we are nothing if not democratic to the duchess well madam you spread rebellion midst our citizens  duchess  my lord the poor have rights you cannot touch the right to pity and the right to mercy  duke  so so you argue with me  this is she the gentle duchess for whose hand i yielded three of the fairest towns in italy pisa and genoa and orvieto  duchess  promised my lord not yielded  in that matter brake you your word as ever  duke  you wrong us madam there were state reasons  duchess  what state reasons are there for breaking holy promises to a state  duke  there are wild boars at pisa in a forest close to the city  when i promised pisa unto your noble and most trusting father i had forgotten there was hunting there at genoa they say indeed i doubt them not that the red mullet runs larger in the harbour of that town than anywhere in italy turning to one of the court you my lord whose gluttonous appetite is your only god could satisfy our duchess on that point  duchess  and orvieto  duke  yawning i cannot now recall why i did not surrender orvieto according to the word of my contract maybe it was because i did not choose goes over to the duchess why look you madam you are here alone tis many a dusty league to your grey france and even there your father barely keeps a hundred ragged squires for his court what hope have you i say  which of these lords and noble gentlemen of padua stands by your side  duchess  there is not one  guido starts but restrains himself  duke  nor shall be while i am duke in padua  listen madam being mine own you shall do as i will and if it be my will you keep the house why then this palace shall your prison be and if it be my will you walk abroad why you shall take the air from morn to night  duchess  sir by what right   duke  madam my second duchess asked the same question once  her monument lies in the chapel of bartholomew wrought in red marble very beautiful guido your arm  come gentlemen let us go and spur our falcons for the midday chase bethink you madam you are here alone exit the duke leaning on guido with his court  duchess  looking after them the duke said rightly that i was alone deserted and dishonoured and defamed stood ever woman so alone indeed men when they woo us call us pretty children tell us we have not wit to make our lives and so they mar them for us  did i say woo we are their chattels and their common slaves less dear than the poor hound that licks their hand less fondled than the hawk upon their wrist woo did i say bought rather sold and bartered our very bodies being merchandise i know it is the general lot of women each miserably mated to some man wrecks her own life upon his selfishness that it is general makes it not less bitter i think i never heard a woman laugh laugh for pure merriment except one woman that was at night time in the public streets poor soul she walked with painted lips and wore the mask of pleasure  i would not laugh like her no death were better enter guido behind unobserved the duchess flings herself down before a picture of the madonna o mary mother with your sweet pale face bending between the little angel heads that hover round you have you no help for me mother of god have you no help for me  guido  i can endure no longer this is my love and i will speak to her lady am i a stranger to your prayers  duchess  rising none but the wretched needs my prayers my lord  guido  then must i need them lady  duchess  how is that does not the duke show thee sufficient honour  guido  your grace i lack no favours from the duke whom my soul loathes as i loathe wickedness but come to proffer on my bended knees my loyal service to thee unto death  duchess  alas  i am so fallen in estate i can but give thee a poor meed of thanks  guido  seizing her hand hast thou no love to give me the duchess starts and guido falls at her feet o dear saint if i have been too daring pardon me thy beauty sets my boyish blood aflame and when my reverent lips touch thy white hand each little nerve with such wild passion thrills that there is nothing which i would not do to gain thy love  leaps up bid me reach forth and pluck perilous honour from the lions jaws and i will wrestle with the nemean beast on the bare desert  fling to the cave of war a gaud a ribbon a dead flower something that once has touched thee and ill bring it back though all the hosts of christendom were there inviolate again ay more than this set me to scale the pallid whitefaced cliffs of mighty england and from that arrogant shield will i raze out the lilies of your france which england that sealion of the sea hath taken from her o dear beatrice drive me not from thy presence without thee the heavy minutes crawl with feet of lead but while i look upon thy loveliness the hours fly like winged mercuries and leave existence golden  duchess  i did not think i should be ever loved  do you indeed love me so much as now you say you do  guido  ask of the seabird if it loves the sea ask of the roses if they love the rain ask of the little lark that will not sing till day break if it loves to see the day and yet these are but empty images mere shadows of my love which is a fire so great that all the waters of the main can not avail to quench it  will you not speak  duchess  i hardly know what i should say to you  guido  will you not say you love me  duchess  is that my lesson must i say all at once  twere a good lesson if i did love you sir but if i do not what shall i say then  guido  if you do not love me say none the less you do for on your tongue falsehood for very shame would turn to truth  duchess  what if i do not speak at all  they say lovers are happiest when they are in doubt  guido  nay doubt would kill me and if i must die why let me die for joy and not for doubt oh tell me may i stay or must i go  duchess  i would not have you either stay or go for if you stay you steal my love from me and if you go you take my love away guido though all the morning stars could sing they could not tell the measure of my love i love you guido  guido  stretching out his hands oh do not cease at all i thought the nightingale sang but at night or if thou needst must cease then let my lips touch the sweet lips that can such music make  duchess  to touch my lips is not to touch my heart  guido  do you close that against me  duchess  alas my lord i have it not  the first day that i saw you i let you take my heart away from me unwilling thief that without meaning it did break into my fenced treasury and filch my jewel from it  o strange theft which made you richer though you knew it not and left me poorer and yet glad of it  guido  clasping her in his arms o love love love  nay sweet lift up your head let me unlock those little scarlet doors that shut in music let me dive for coral in your red lips and ill bear back a prize richer than all the gold the gryphon guards in rude armenia  duchess  you are my lord and what i have is yours and what i have not your fancy lends me like a prodigal spending its wealth on what is nothing worth kisses him  guido  methinks i am bold to look upon you thus the gentle violet hides beneath its leaf and is afraid to look at the great sun for fear of too much splendour but my eyes o daring eyes are grown so venturous that like fixed stars they stand gazing at you and surfeit sense with beauty  duchess  dear love i would you could look upon me ever for your eyes are polished mirrors and when i peer into those mirrors i can see myself and so i know my image lives in you  guido  taking her in his arms stand still thou hurrying orb in the high heavens and make this hour immortal  a pause  duchess  sit down here a little lower than me  yes just so sweet that i may run my fingers through your hair and see your face turn upwards like a flower to meet my kiss have you not sometimes noted when we unlock some longdisused room with heavy dust and soiling mildew filled where never foot of man has come for years and from the windows take the rusty bar and fling the broken shutters to the air and let the bright sun in how the good sun turns every grimy particle of dust into a little thing of dancing gold guido my heart is that longempty room but you have let love in and with its gold gilded all life  do you not think that love fills up the sum of life  guido  ay without love life is no better than the unhewn stone which in the quarry lies before the sculptor has set the god within it  without love life is as silent as the common reeds that through the marshes or by rivers grow and have no music in them  duchess  yet out of these the singer who is love will make a pipe and from them he draws music so i think love will bring music out of any life is that not true  guido  sweet women make it true there are men who paint pictures and carve statues paul of verona and the dyers son or their great rival who by the sea at venice has set gods little maid upon the stair white as her own white lily and as tall or raphael whose madonnas are divine because they are mothers merely yet i think women are the best artists of the world for they can take the common lives of men soiled with the moneygetting of our age and with love make them beautiful  duchess  ah dear i wish that you and i were very poor the poor who love each other are so rich  guido  tell me again you love me beatrice  duchess  fingering his collar how well this collar lies about your throat lord moranzone looks through the door from the corridor outside  guido  nay tell me that you love me  duchess  i remember that when i was a child in my dear france being at court at fontainebleau the king wore such a collar  guido  will you not say you love me  duchess  smiling he was a very royal man king francis yet he was not royal as you are why need i tell you guido that i love you takes his head in her hands and turns his face up to her do you not know that i am yours for ever body and soul kisses him and then suddenly catches sight of moranzone and leaps up oh what is that  moranzone disappears  guido  what love  duchess  methought i saw a face with eyes of flame look at us through the doorway  guido  nay twas nothing the passing shadow of the man on guard the duchess still stands looking at the window twas nothing sweet  duchess  ay what can harm us now who are in loves hand  i do not think id care though the vile world should with its lackey slander trample and tread upon my life why should i they say the common fieldflowers of the field have sweeter scent when they are trodden on than when they bloom alone and that some herbs which have no perfume on being bruised die with all arabia round them so it is with the young lives this dull world seeks to crush it does but bring the sweetness out of them and makes them lovelier often  and besides while we have love we have the best of life is it not so  guido  dear shall we play or sing i think that i could sing now  duchess  do not speak for there are times when all existences seem narrowed to one single ecstasy and passion sets a seal upon the lips  guido  oh with mine own lips let me break that seal you love me beatrice  duchess  ay is it not strange i should so love mine enemy  guido  who is he  duchess  why you  that with your shaft did pierce my heart poor heart that lived its little lonely life until it met your arrow  guido  ah dear love i am so wounded by that bolt myself that with untended wounds i lie adying unless you cure me dear physician  duchess  i would not have you cured for i am sick with the same malady  guido  oh how i love you see i must steal the cuckoos voice and tell the one tale over  duchess  tell no other tale for if that is the little cuckoos song the nightingale is hoarse and the loud lark has lost its music  guido  kiss me beatrice she takes his face in her hands and bends down and kisses him a loud knocking then comes at the door and guido leaps up enter a servant  servant  a package for you sir  guido  carelessly  ah give it to me  servant hands package wrapped in vermilion silk and exit as guido is about to open it the duchess comes up behind and in sport takes it from him  duchess  laughing now i will wager it is from some girl who would have you wear her favour i am so jealous i will not give up the least part in you but like a miser keep you to myself and spoil you perhaps in keeping  guido  it is nothing  duchess  nay it is from some girl  guido  you know tis not  duchess  turns her back and opens it now traitor tell me what does this sign mean a dagger with two leopards wrought in steel  guido  taking it from her  o god  duchess  ill from the window look and try if i cant see the porters livery who left it at the gate  i will not rest till i have learned your secret runs laughing into the corridor  guido  oh horrible had i so soon forgot my fathers death did i so soon let love into my heart and must i banish love and let in murder that beats and clamours at the outer gate ay that i must  have i not sworn an oath yet not tonight nay it must be tonight farewell then all the joy and light of life all dear recorded memories farewell farewell all love  could i with bloody hands fondle and paddle with her innocent hands could i with lips fresh from this butchery play with her lips  could i with murderous eyes look in those violet eyes whose purity would strike men blind and make each eyeball reel in night perpetual  no murder has set a barrier between us far too high for us to kiss across it  duchess  guido  guido  beatrice you must forget that name and banish me out of your life for ever  duchess  going towards him o dear love  guido  stepping back there lies a barrier between us two we dare not pass  duchess  i dare do anything so that you are beside me  guido  ah  there it is i cannot be beside you cannot breathe the air you breathe i cannot any more stand face to face with beauty which unnerves my shaking heart and makes my desperate hand fail of its purpose  let me go hence i pray forget you ever looked upon me  duchess  what with your hot kisses fresh upon my lips forget the vows of love you made to me  guido  i take them back  duchess  alas you cannot guido for they are part of nature now the air is tremulous with their music and outside the little birds sing sweeter for those vows  guido  there lies a barrier between us now which then i knew not or i had forgot  duchess  there is no barrier guido why i will go in poor attire and will follow you over the world  guido  wildly the worlds not wide enough to hold us two  farewell farewell for ever  duchess  calm and controlling her passion why did you come into my life at all then or in the desolate garden of my heart sow that white flower of love   guido  o beatrice  duchess  which now you would dig up uproot tear out though each small fibre doth so hold my heart that if you break one my heart breaks with it why did you come into my life  why open the secret wells of love i had sealed up why did you open them   guido  o god  duchess  clenching her hand and let the floodgates of my passion swell and burst till like the wave when rivers overflow that sweeps the forest and the farm away love in the splendid avalanche of its might swept my life with it  must i drop by drop gather these waters back and seal them up alas  each drop will be a tear and so will with its saltness make life very bitter  guido  i pray you speak no more for i must go forth from your life and love and make a way on which you cannot follow  duchess  i have heard that sailors dying of thirst upon a raft poor castaways upon a lonely sea dream of green fields and pleasant watercourses and then wake up with red thirst in their throats and die more miserably because sleep has cheated them  so they die cursing sleep for having sent them dreams  i will not curse you though i am cast away upon the sea which men call desolation  guido  o god god  duchess  but you will stay  listen i love you guido she waits a little is echo dead that when i say i love you there is no answer  guido  everything is dead save one thing only which shall die tonight  duchess  if you are going touch me not but go exit guido barrier  barrier why did he say there was a barrier there is no barrier between us two he lied to me and shall i for that reason loathe what i love and what i worshipped hate i think we women do not love like that for if i cut his image from my heart my heart would like a bleeding pilgrim follow that image through the world and call it back with little cries of love enter duke equipped for the chase with falconers and hounds  duke  madam you keep us waiting you keep my dogs waiting  duchess  i will not ride today  duke  how now whats this  duchess  my lord i cannot go  duke  what pale face do you dare to stand against me why i could set you on a sorry jade and lead you through the town till the low rabble you feed toss up their hats and mock at you  duchess  have you no word of kindness ever for me  duke  i hold you in the hollow of my hand and have no need on you to waste kind words  duchess  well i will go  duke  slapping his boot with his whip no i have changed my mind you will stay here and like a faithful wife watch from the window for our coming back were it not dreadful if some accident by chance should happen to your loving lord come gentlemen my hounds begin to chafe and i chafe too having a patient wife where is young guido  maffio  my liege i have not seen him for a full hour past  duke  it matters not i dare say i shall see him soon enough well madam you will sit at home and spin i do protest sirs the domestic virtues are often very beautiful in others  exit duke with his court  duchess  the stars have fought against me that is all and thus tonight when my lord lieth asleep will i fall upon my dagger and so cease my heart is such a stone nothing can reach it except the daggers edge  let it go there to find what name it carries  ay tonight death will divorce the duke and yet tonight he may die also he is very old why should he not die  yesterday his hand shook with a palsy  men have died from palsy and why not he  are there not fevers also agues and chills and other maladies most incident to old age no no he will not die he is too sinful honest men die before their proper time good men will die  men by whose side the duke in all the sick pollution of his life seems like a leper  women and children die but the duke will not die he is too sinful oh can it be there is some immortality in sin which virtue has not  and does the wicked man draw life from what to other men were death like poisonous plants that on corruption live no no i think god would not suffer that yet the duke will not die  he is too sinful but i will die alone and on this night grim death shall be my bridegroom and the tomb my secret house of pleasure  well what of that the worlds a graveyard and we each like coffins within us bear a skeleton enter lord moranzone all in black he passes across the back of the stage looking anxiously about  moranzone  where is guido i cannot find him anywhere  duchess  catches sight of him  o god twas thou who took my love away from me  moranzone  with a look of joy what has he left you  duchess  nay you know he has oh give him back to me give him back i say or i will tear your body limb from limb and to the common gibbet nail your head until the carrion crows have stripped it bare better you had crossed a hungry lioness before you came between me and my love with more pathos nay give him back you know not how i love him here by this chair he knelt a half hour since twas there he stood and there he looked at me this is the hand he kissed and these the ears into whose open portals he did pour a tale of love so musical that all the birds stopped singing  oh give him back to me  moranzone  he does not love you madam  duchess  may the plague wither the tongue that says so  give him back  moranzone  madam i tell you you will never see him neither tonight nor any other night  duchess  what is your name  moranzone  my name  revenge exit  duchess  revenge i think i never harmed a little child what should revenge do coming to my door it matters not for death is there already waiting with his dim torch to light my way tis true men hate thee death and yet i think thou wilt be kinder to me than my lover and so dispatch the messengers at once harry the lazy steeds of lingering day and let the night thy sister come instead and drape the world in mourning let the owl who is thy minister scream from his tower and wake the toad with hooting and the bat that is the slave of dim persephone wheel through the sombre air on wandering wing tear up the shrieking mandrakes from the earth and bid them make us music and tell the mole to dig deep down thy cold and narrow bed for i shall lie within thine arms tonight  end of act ii    act iii    scene  a large corridor in the ducal palace  a window lc looks out on a view of padua by moonlight  a staircase rc leads up to a door with a portiere of crimson velvet with the dukes arms embroidered in gold on it  on the lowest step of the staircase a figure draped in black is sitting  the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled with burning tow  thunder and lightning outside the time is night  enter guido through the window  guido  the wind is rising  how my ladder shook i thought that every gust would break the cords looks out at the city christ  what a night great thunder in the heavens and wild lightnings striking from pinnacle to pinnacle across the city till the dim houses seem to shudder and to shake as each new glare dashes adown the street passes across the stage to foot of staircase ah who art thou that sittest on the stair like unto death waiting a guilty soul  a pause canst thou not speak or has this storm laid palsy on thy tongue and chilled thy utterance the figure rises and takes off his mask  moranzone  guido ferranti thy murdered father laughs for joy tonight  guido  confusedly what art thou here  moranzone  ay waiting for your coming  guido  looking away from him i did not think to see you but am glad that you may know the thing i mean to do  moranzone  first i would have you know my welllaid plans listen  i have set horses at the gate which leads to parma  when you have done your business we will ride hence and by tomorrow night   guido  it cannot be  moranzone  nay but it shall  guido  listen lord moranzone i am resolved not to kill this man  moranzone  surely my ears are traitors speak again it cannot be but age has dulled my powers i am an old man now  what did you say you said that with that dagger in your belt you would avenge your fathers bloody murder did you not say that  guido  no my lord i said i was resolved not to kill the duke  moranzone  you said not that it is my senses mock me or else this midnight air oercharged with storm alters your message in the giving it  guido  nay you heard rightly ill not kill this man  moranzone  what of thine oath thou traitor what of thine oath  guido  i am resolved not to keep that oath  moranzone  what of thy murdered father  guido  dost thou think my father would be glad to see me coming this old mans blood still hot upon mine hands  moranzone  ay he would laugh for joy  guido  i do not think so there is better knowledge in the other world vengeance is gods let god himself revenge  moranzone  thou art gods minister of vengeance  guido  no god hath no minister but his own hand i will not kill this man  moranzone  why are you here if not to kill him then  guido  lord moranzone i purpose to ascend to the dukes chamber and as he lies asleep lay on his breast the dagger and this writing when he awakes then he will know who held him in his power and slew him not  this is the noblest vengeance which i can take  moranzone  you will not slay him  guido  no  moranzone  ignoble son of a noble father who sufferest this man who sold that father to live an hour  guido  twas thou that hindered me i would have killed him in the open square the day i saw him first  moranzone  it was not yet time now it is time and like some greenfaced girl thou pratest of forgiveness  guido  no revenge the right revenge my fathers son should take  moranzone  you are a coward take out the knife get to the dukes chamber and bring me back his heart upon the blade when he is dead then you can talk to me of noble vengeances  guido  upon thine honour and by the love thou bearest my fathers name dost thou think my father that great gentleman that generous soldier that most chivalrous lord would have crept at nighttime like a common thief and stabbed an old man sleeping in his bed however he had wronged him  tell me that  moranzone  after some hesitation you have sworn an oath see that you keep that oath boy do you think i do not know your secret your traffic with the duchess  guido  silence liar the very moon in heaven is not more chaste nor the white stars so pure  moranzone  and yet you love her weak fool to let love in upon your life save as a plaything  guido  you do well to talk within your veins old man the pulse of youth throbs with no ardour  your eyes full of rheum have against beauty closed their filmy doors and your clogged ears losing their natural sense have shut you from the music of the world you talk of love  you know not what it is  moranzone  oh in my time boy have i walked i the moon swore i would live on kisses and on blisses swore i would die for love and did not die wrote love bad verses ay and sung them badly like all true lovers  oh i have done the tricks i know the partings and the chamberings we are all animals at best and love is merely passion with a holy name  guido  now then i know you have not loved at all love is the sacrament of life it sets virtue where virtue was not cleanses men of all the vile pollutions of this world it is the fire which purges gold from dross it is the fan which winnows wheat from chaff it is the spring which in some wintry soil makes innocence to blossom like a rose the days are over when god walked with men but love which is his image holds his place when a man loves a woman then he knows gods secret and the secret of the world there is no house so lowly or so mean which if their hearts be pure who live in it love will not enter but if bloody murder knock at the palace gate and is let in love like a wounded thing creeps out and dies this is the punishment god sets on sin the wicked cannot love a groan comes from the dukes chamber ah  what is that do you not hear  twas nothing so i think that it is womans mission by their love to save the souls of men  and loving her my lady my white beatrice i begin to see a nobler and a holier vengeance in letting this man live than doth reside in bloody deeds o night stabs in the dark and young hands clutching at a palsied throat it was i think for loves sake that lord christ who was indeed himself incarnate love bade every man forgive his enemy  moranzone  sneeringly that was in palestine not padua and said for saints  i have to do with men  guido  it was for all time said  moranzone  and your white duchess what will she do to thank you  guido  alas i will not see her face again tis but twelve hours since i parted from her so suddenly and with such violent passion that she has shut her heart against me now no i will never see her  moranzone  what will you do  guido  after that i have laid the dagger there get hence tonight from padua  moranzone  and then  guido  i will take service with the doge at venice and bid him pack me straightway to the wars and there i will being now sick of life throw that poor life against some desperate spear a groan from the dukes chamber again did you not hear a voice  moranzone  i always hear from the dim confines of some sepulchre a voice that cries for vengeance  we waste time it will be morning soon are you resolved you will not kill the duke  guido  i am resolved  moranzone  o wretched father lying unavenged  guido  more wretched were thy son a murderer  moranzone  why what is life  guido  i do not know my lord i did not give it and i dare not take it  moranzone  i do not thank god often but i think i thank him now that i have got no son and you what bastard blood flows in your veins that when you have your enemy in your grasp you let him go  i would that i had left you with the dull hinds that reared you  guido  better perhaps that you had done so  may be better still id not been born to this distressful world  moranzone  farewell  guido  farewell  some day lord moranzone you will understand my vengeance  moranzone  never boy gets out of window and exit by rope ladder  guido  father i think thou knowest my resolve and with this nobler vengeance art content father i think in letting this man live that i am doing what thou wouldst have done father i know not if a human voice can pierce the iron gateway of the dead or if the dead are set in ignorance of what we do or do not for their sakes and yet i feel a presence in the air there is a shadow standing at my side and ghostly kisses seem to touch my lips and leave them holier  kneels down o father if tis thou canst thou not burst through the decrees of death and if corporeal semblance show thyself that i may touch thy hand no there is nothing  rises tis the night that cheats us with its phantoms and like a puppetmaster makes us think that things are real which are not  it grows late now must i to my business pulls out a letter from his doublet and reads it when he wakes and sees this letter and the dagger with it will he not have some loathing for his life repent perchance and lead a better life or will he mock because a young man spared his natural enemy  i do not care father it is thy bidding that i do thy bidding and the bidding of my love which teaches me to know thee as thou art ascends staircase stealthily and just as he reaches out his hand to draw back the curtain the duchess appears all in white  guido starts back  duchess  guido what do you here so late  guido  o white and spotless angel of my life sure thou hast come from heaven with a message that mercy is more noble than revenge  duchess  there is no barrier between us now  guido  none love nor shall be  duchess  i have seen to that  guido  tarry here for me  duchess  no you are not going you will not leave me as you did before  guido  i will return within a moments space but first i must repair to the dukes chamber and leave this letter and this dagger there that when he wakes   duchess  when who wakes  guido  why the duke  duchess  he will not wake again  guido  what is he dead  duchess  ay he is dead  guido  o god how wonderful are all thy secret ways  who would have said that on this very night when i had yielded into thy hands the vengeance that is thine thou with thy finger wouldst have touched the man and bade him come before thy judgment seat  duchess  i have just killed him  guido  in horror  oh  duchess  he was asleep come closer love and i will tell you all i had resolved to kill myself tonight about an hour ago i waked from sleep and took my dagger from beneath my pillow where i had hidden it to serve my need and drew it from the sheath and felt the edge and thought of you and how i loved you guido and turned to fall upon it when i marked the old man sleeping full of years and sin there lay he muttering curses in his sleep and as i looked upon his evil face suddenly like a flame there flashed across me there is the barrier which guido spoke of you said there lay a barrier between us what barrier but he  i hardly know what happened but a steaming mist of blood rose up between us two  guido  oh horrible  duchess  and then he groaned and then he groaned no more  i only heard the dripping of the blood upon the floor  guido  enough enough  duchess  will you not kiss me now do you remember saying that womens love turns men to angels well the love of man turns women into martyrs for its sake we do or suffer anything  guido  o god  duchess  will you not speak  guido  i cannot speak at all  duchess  let as not talk of this  let us go hence is not the barrier broken down between us what would you more  come it is almost morning puts her hand on guidos  guido  breaking from her o damned saint  o angel fresh from hell what bloody devil tempted thee to this that thou hast killed thy husband that is nothing  hell was already gaping for his soul  but thou hast murdered love and in its place hast set a horrible and bloodstained thing whose very breath breeds pestilence and plague and strangles love  duchess  in amazed wonder i did it all for you i would not have you do it had you willed it for i would keep you without blot or stain a thing unblemished unassailed untarnished men do not know what women do for love have i not wrecked my soul for your dear sake here and hereafter  guido  no do not touch me between us lies a thin red stream of blood i dare not look across it  when you stabbed him you stabbed love with a sharp knife to the heart we cannot meet again  duchess  wringing her hands for you  for you i did it all for you  have you forgotten you said there was a barrier between us that barrier lies now i the upper chamber upset overthrown beaten and battered down and will not part us ever  guido  no you mistook sin was the barrier you have raised it up crime was the barrier you have set it there the barrier was murder and your hand has builded it so high it shuts out heaven it shuts out god  duchess  i did it all for you you dare not leave me now  nay guido listen get horses ready we will fly tonight the past is a bad dream we will forget it before us lies the future  shall we not have sweet days of love beneath our vines and laugh  no no we will not laugh but when we weep well we will weep together i will serve you i will be very meek and very gentle you do not know me  guido  nay i know you now get hence i say out of my sight  duchess  pacing up and down o god how i have loved this man  guido  you never loved me had it been so love would have stayed your hand how could we sit together at loves table you have poured poison in the sacred wine and murder dips his fingers in the sop  duchess  throws herself on her knees then slay me now  i have spilt blood tonight you shall spill more so we go hand in hand to heaven or to hell  draw your sword guido quick let your soul go chambering in my heart it will but find its masters image there nay if you will not slay me with your sword bid me to fall upon this reeking knife and i will do it  guido  wresting knife from her give it to me i say o god your very hands are wet with blood this place is hell i cannot tarry here i pray you let me see your face no more  duchess  better for me i had not seen your face guido recoils  she seizes his hands as she kneels nay guido listen for a while until you came to padua i lived wretched indeed but with no murderous thought very submissive to a cruel lord very obedient to unjust commands  as pure i think as any gentle girl who now would turn in horror from my hands  stands up you came  ah  guido the first kindly words i ever heard since i had come from france were from your lips  well well that is no matter you came and in the passion of your eyes i read loves meaning everything you said touched my dumb soul to music so i loved you and yet i did not tell you of my love twas you who sought me out knelt at my feet as i kneel now at yours and with sweet vows kneels whose music seems to linger in my ears swore that you loved me and i trusted you i think there are many women in the world who would have tempted you to kill the man i did not yet i know that had i done so i had not been thus humbled in the dust stands up but you had loved me very faithfully after a pause approaches him timidly i do not think you understand me guido it was for your sake that i wrought this deed whose horror now chills my young blood to ice for your sake only  stretching out her arm will you not speak to me love me a little  in my girlish life i have been starved for love and kindliness has passed me by  guido  i dare not look at you you come to me with too pronounced a favour get to your tirewomen  duchess  ay there it is there speaks the man yet had you come to me with any heavy sin upon your soul some murder done for hire not for love why i had sat and watched at your bedside all through the nighttime lest remorse might come and pour his poisons in your ear and so keep you from sleeping  sure it is the guilty who being very wretched need love most  guido  there is no love where there is any guilt  duchess  no love where there is any guilt  o god how differently do we love from men there is many a woman here in padua some workmans wife or ruder artisans whose husband spends the wages of the week in a coarse revel or a tavern brawl and reeling home late on the saturday night finds his wife sitting by a fireless hearth trying to hush the child who cries for hunger and then sets to and beats his wife because the child is hungry and the fire black yet the wife loves him and will rise next day with some red bruise across a careworn face and sweep the house and do the common service and try and smile and only be too glad if he does not beat her a second time before her childthat is how women love a pause  guido says nothing i think you will not drive me from your side where have i got to go if you reject me  you for whose sake this hand has murdered life you for whose sake my soul has wrecked itself beyond all hope of pardon  guido  get thee gone the dead man is a ghost and our love too flits like a ghost about its desolate tomb and wanders through this charnel house and weeps that when you slew your lord you slew it also do you not see  duchess  i see when men love women they give them but a little of their lives but women when they love give everything i see that guido now  guido  away away and come not back till you have waked your dead  duchess  i would to god that i could wake the dead put vision in the glazed eves and give the tongue its natural utterance and bid the heart to beat again  that cannot be for what is done is done  and what is dead is dead for ever  the fire cannot warm him the winter cannot hurt him with its snows something has gone from him if you call him now he will not answer if you mock him now he will not laugh and if you stab him now he will not bleed i would that i could wake him o god put back the sun a little space and from the roll of time blot out tonight and bid it not have been  put back the sun and make me what i was an hour ago no no time will not stop for anything nor the sun stay its courses though repentance calling it back grow hoarse but you my love have you no word of pity even for me o guido guido will you not kiss me once drive me not to some desperate resolve women grow mad when they are treated thus will you not kiss me once  guido  holding up knife i will not kiss you until the blood grows dry upon this knife wildly  back to your dead  duchess  going up the stairs why then i will be gone and may you find more mercy than you showed to me tonight  guido  let me find mercy when i go at night and do foul

a man may die as well under that name as any other  lord justice  thou art not ignorant what dreadful charge men lay against thee here namely the treacherous murder of thy lord simone gesso duke of padua what dost thou say in answer  guido  i say nothing  lord justice  rising guido ferranti   moranzone  stepping from the crowd tarry my lord justice  lord justice  who art thou that bidst justice tarry sir  moranzone  so be it justice it can go its way but if it be not justice   lord justice  who is this  count bardi  a very noble gentleman and well known to the late duke  lord justice  sir thou art come in time to see the murder of the duke avenged there stands the man who did this heinous thing  moranzone  my lord i ask again what proof have ye  lord justice  holding up the dagger this dagger which from his bloodstained hands itself all blood last night the soldiers seized  what further proof need we indeed  moranzone  takes the danger and approaches the duchess saw i not such a dagger hang from your graces girdle yesterday the duchess shudders and makes no answer ah my lord justice may i speak a moment with this young man who in such peril stands  lord justice  ay willingly my lord and may you turn him to make a full avowal of his guilt lord moranzone goes over to guido who stands r and clutches him by the hand  moranzone  in a low voice she did it  nay i saw it in her eyes boy dost thou think ill let thy fathers son be by this woman butchered to his death her husband sold your father and the wife would sell the son in turn  guido  lord moranzone i alone did this thing  be satisfied my father is avenged  lord justice  doth he confess  guido  my lord i do confess that foul unnatural murder has been done  first citizen  why look at that  he has a pitiful heart and does not like murder they will let him go for that  lord justice  say you no more  guido  my lord i say this also that to spill human blood is deadly sin  second citizen  marry he should tell that to the headsman  tis a good sentiment  guido  lastly my lord i do entreat the court to give me leave to utter openly the dreadful secret of this mystery and to point out the very guilty one who with this dagger last night slew the duke  lord justice  thou hast leave to speak  duchess  rising i say he shall not speak what need have we of further evidence was he not taken in the house at night in guilts own bloody livery  lord justice  showing her the statute your grace can read the law  duchess  waiving book aside bethink you my lord justice is it not very like that such a one may in the presence of the people here utter some slanderous word against my lord against the city or the citys honour perchance against myself  lord justice  my liege the law  duchess  he shall not speak but with gags in his mouth shall climb the ladder to the bloody block  lord justice  the law my liege  duchess  we are not bound by law but with it we bind others  moranzone  my lord justice thou wilt not suffer this injustice here  lord justice  the court needs not thy voice lord moranzone madam it were a precedent most evil to wrest the law from its appointed course for though the cause be just yet anarchy might on this licence touch these golden scales and unjust causes unjust victories gain  count bardi  i do not think your grace can stay the law  duchess  ay it is well to preach and prate of law methinks my haughty lords of padua if ye are hurt in pocket or estate so much as makes your monstrous revenues less by the value of one ferry toll ye do not wait the tedious laws delay with such sweet patience as ye counsel me  count bardi  madam i think you wrong our nobles here  duchess  i think i wrong them not  which of you all finding a thief within his house at night with some poor chattel thrust into his rags will stop and parley with him do ye not give him unto the officer and his hook to be dragged gaolwards straightway and so now had ye been men finding this fellow here with my lords life still hot upon his hands ye would have haled him out into the court and struck his head off with an axe  guido  o god  duchess  speak my lord justice  lord justice  your grace it cannot be the laws of padua are most certain here and by those laws the common murderer even may with his own lips plead and make defence  duchess  this is no common murderer lord justice but a great outlaw and a most vile traitor taken in open arms against the state for he who slays the man who rules a state slays the state also widows every wife and makes each child an orphan and no less is to be held a public enemy than if he came with mighty ordonnance and all the spears of venice at his back to beat and batter at our city gates  nay is more dangerous to our commonwealth for walls and gates bastions and forts and things whose common elements are wood and stone may be raised up but who can raise again the ruined body of my murdered lord and bid it live and laugh  maffio  now by saint paul i do not think that they will let him speak  jeppo vitellozzo  there is much in this listen  duchess  wherefore now throw ashes on the head of padua with sable banners hang each silent street let every man be clad in solemn black but ere we turn to these sad rites of mourning let us bethink us of the desperate hand which wrought and brought this ruin on our state and straightway pack him to that narrow house where no voice is but with a little dust death fills right up the lying mouths of men  guido  unhand me knaves  i tell thee my lord justice thou mightst as well bid the untrammelled ocean the winter whirlwind or the alpine storm not roar their will as bid me hold my peace ay though ye put your knives into my throat each grim and gaping wound shall find a tongue and cry against you  lord justice  sir this violence avails you nothing for save the tribunal give thee a lawful right to open speech naught that thou sayest can be credited the duchess smiles and guido falls back with a gesture of despair madam myself and these wise justices will with your graces sanction now retire into another chamber to decide upon this difficult matter of the law and search the statutes and the precedents  duchess  go my lord justice search the statutes well nor let this brawling traitor have his way  moranzone  go my lord justice search thy conscience well nor let a man be sent to death unheard exit the lord justice and the judges  duchess  silence thou evil genius of my life thou comst between us two a second time this time my lord i think the turn is mine  guido  i shall not die till i have uttered voice  duchess  thou shalt die silent and thy secret with thee  guido  art thou that beatrice duchess of padua  duchess  i am what thou hast made me look at me well i am thy handiwork  maffio  see is she not like that white tigress which we saw at venice sent by some indian soldan to the doge  jeppo  hush she may hear thy chatter  headsman  my young fellow i do not know why thou shouldst care to speak seeing my axe is close upon thy neck and words of thine will never blunt its edge but if thou art so bent upon it why thou mightest plead unto the churchman yonder the common people call him kindly here indeed i know he has a kindly soul  guido  this man whose trade is death hath courtesies more than the others  headsman  why god love you sir ill do you your last service on this earth  guido  my good lord cardinal in a christian land with lord christs face of mercy looking down from the high seat of judgment shall a man die unabsolved unshrived  and if not so may i not tell this dreadful tale of sin if any sin there be upon my soul  duchess  thou dost but waste thy time  cardinal  alack my son i have no power with the secular arm my task begins when justice has been done to urge the wavering sinner to repent and to confess to holy churchs ear the dreadful secrets of a sinful mind  duchess  thou mayest speak to the confessional until thy lips grow weary of their tale but here thou shalt not speak  guido  my reverend father you bring me but cold comfort  cardinal  nay my son for the great power of our mother church ends not with this poor bubble of a world of which we are but dust as jerome saith for if the sinner doth repentant die our prayers and holy masses much avail to bring the guilty soul from purgatory  duchess  and when in purgatory thou seest my lord with that red star of blood upon his heart tell him i sent thee hither  guido  o dear god  moranzone  this is the woman is it whom you loved  cardinal  your grace is very cruel to this man  duchess  no more than he was cruel to her grace  cardinal  yet mercy is the sovereign right of princes  duchess  i got no mercy and i give it not he hath changed my heart into a heart of stone he hath sown rank nettles in a goodly field he hath poisoned the wells of pity in my breast he hath withered up all kindness at the root my life is as some famine murdered land whence all good things have perished utterly i am what he hath made me the duchess weeps  jeppo  is it not strange that she should so have loved the wicked duke  maffio  it is most strange when women love their lords and when they love them not it is most strange  jeppo  what a philosopher thou art petrucci  maffio  ay  i can bear the ills of other men which is philosophy  duchess  they tarry long these greybeards and their council bid them come bid them come quickly else i think my heart will beat itself to bursting  not indeed that i here care to live god knows my life is not so full of joy yet for all that i would not die companionless or go lonely to hell look my lord cardinal canst thou not see across my forehead here in scarlet letters writ the word revenge fetch me some water i will wash it off twas branded there last night but in the daytime i need not wear it need i my lord cardinal oh how it sears and burns into my brain give me a knife not that one but another and i will cut it out  cardinal  it is most natural to be incensed against the murderous hand that treacherously stabbed your sleeping lord  duchess  i would old cardinal i could burn that hand but it will burn hereafter  cardinal  nay the church ordains us to forgive our enemies  duchess  forgiveness what is that  i never got it they come at last  well my lord justice well enter the lord justice  lord justice  most gracious lady and our sovereign liege we have long pondered on the point at issue and much considered of your graces wisdom and never wisdom spake from fairer lips   duchess  proceed sir without compliment  lord justice  we find as your own grace did rightly signify that any citizen who by force or craft conspires against the person of the liege is ipso facto outlaw void of rights such as pertain to other citizens is traitor and a public enemy who may by any casual sword be slain without the slayers danger nay if brought into the presence of the tribunal must with dumb lips and silence reverent listen unto his welldeserved doom nor has the privilege of open speech  duchess  i thank thee my lord justice heartily i like your law  and now i pray dispatch this public outlaw to his righteous doom what is there more  lord justice  ay there is more your grace this man being alien born not paduan nor by allegiance bound unto the duke save such as common nature doth lay down hath though accused of treasons manifold whose slightest penalty is certain death yet still the right of public utterance before the people and the open court nay shall be much entreated by the court to make some formal pleading for his life lest his own city righteously incensed should with an unjust trial tax our state and wars spring up against the commonwealth so merciful are the laws of padua unto the stranger living in her gates  duchess  being of my lords household is he stranger here  lord justice  ay until seven years of service spent he cannot be a paduan citizen  guido  i thank thee my lord justice heartily i like your law  second citizen  i like no law at all were there no law thered be no lawbreakers so all men would be virtuous  first citizen  so they would tis a wise saying that and brings you far  tipstaff  ay to the gallows knave  duchess  is this the law  lord justice  it is the law most certainly my liege  duchess  show me the book  tis written in bloodred  jeppo  look at the duchess  duchess  thou accursed law i would that i could tear thee from the state as easy as i tear thee from this book tears out the page come here count bardi  are you honourable get a horse ready for me at my house for i must ride to venice instantly  bardi  to venice madam  duchess  not a word of this go go at once  exit count bardi a moment my lord justice if as thou sayest it this is the law  nay nay i doubt not that thou sayest right though right be wrong in such a case as this  may i not by the virtue of mine office adjourn this court until another day  lord justice  madam you cannot stay a trial for blood  duchess  i will not tarry then to hear this man rail with rude tongue against our sacred person come gentlemen  lord justice  my liege you cannot leave this court until the prisoner be purged or guilty of this dread offence  duchess  cannot lord justice  by what right do you set barriers in my path where i should go am i not duchess here in padua and the states regent  lord justice  for that reason madam being the fountainhead of life and death whence like a mighty river justice flows without thy presence justice is dried up and fails of purpose  thou must tarry here  duchess  what wilt thou keep me here against my will  lord justice  we pray thy will be not against the law  duchess  what if i force my way out of the court  lord justice  thou canst not force the court to give thee way  duchess  i will not tarry  rises from her seat  lord justice  is the usher here let him stand forth  usher comes forward thou knowest thy business sir the usher closes the doors of the court which are l and when the duchess and her retinue approach kneels down  usher  in all humility i beseech your grace turn not my duty to discourtesy nor make my unwelcome office an offence  duchess  is there no gentleman amongst you all to prick this prating fellow from our way  maffio  drawing his sword ay that will i  lord justice  count maffio have a care and you sir  to jeppo the first man who draws his sword upon the meanest officer of this court dies before nightfall  duchess  sirs put up your swords it is most meet that i should hear this man goes back to throne  moranzone  now hast thou got thy enemy in thy hand  lord justice  taking the timeglass up guido ferranti while the crumbling sand falls through this timeglass thou hast leave to speak this and no more  guido  it is enough my lord  lord justice  thou standest on the extreme verge of death see that thou speakest nothing but the truth naught else will serve thee  guido  if i speak it not then give my body to the headsman there  lord justice  turns the timeglass let there be silence while the prisoner speaks  tipstaff  silence in the court there  guido  my lords justices and reverent judges of this worthy court i hardly know where to begin my tale so strangely dreadful is this history first let me tell you of what birth i am i am the son of that good duke lorenzo who was with damned treachery done to death by a most wicked villain lately duke of this good town of padua  lord justice  have a care it will avail thee nought to mock this prince who now lies in his coffin  maffio  by saint james this is the duke of parmas rightful heir  jeppo  i always thought him noble  guido  i confess that with the purport of a just revenge a most just vengeance on a man of blood i entered the dukes household served his will sat at his board drank of his wine and was his intimate  so much i will confess and this too that i waited till he grew to give the fondest secrets of his life into my keeping till he fawned on me and trusted me in every private matter even as my noble father trusted him that for this thing i waited to the headsman  thou man of blood turn not thine axe on me before the time who knows if it be time for me to die is there no other neck in court but mine  lord justice  the sand within the timeglass flows apace come quickly to the murder of the duke  guido  i will be brief  last night at twelve o the clock by a strong rope i scaled the palace wall with purport to revenge my fathers murder  ay with that purport i confess my lord this much i will acknowledge and this also that as with stealthy feet i climbed the stair which led unto the chamber of the duke and reached my hand out for the scarlet cloth which shook and shivered in the gusty door lo the white moon that sailed in the great heaven flooded with silver light the darkened room night lit her candles for me and i saw the man i hated cursing in his sleep and thinking of a most dear father murdered sold to the scaffold bartered to the block i smote the treacherous villain to the heart with this same dagger which by chance i found within the chamber  duchess  rising from her seat oh  guido  hurriedly i killed the duke now my lord justice if i may crave a boon suffer me not to see another sun light up the misery of this loathsome world  lord justice  thy boon is granted thou shalt die tonight lead him away  come madam guido is led off as he goes the duchess stretches out her arms and rushes down the stage  duchess  guido  guido faints  tableau  end of act iv    act v    scene  a dungeon in the public prison of padua guido lies asleep on a pallet lc a table with a goblet on it is set lc five soldiers are drinking and playing dice in the corner on a stone table one of them has a lantern hung to his halbert a torch is set in the wall over guidos head  two grated windows behind one on each side of the door which is c look out into the passage the stage is rather dark  first soldier  throws dice sixes again good pietro  second soldier  i faith lieutenant i will play with thee no more  i will lose everything  third soldier  except thy wits thou art safe there  second soldier  ay ay he cannot take them from me  third soldier  no for thou hast no wits to give him  the soldiers  loudly ha ha ha  first soldier  silence  you will wake the prisoner he is asleep  second soldier  what matter  he will get sleep enough when he is buried  i warrant hed be glad if we could wake him when hes in the grave  third soldier  nay for when he wakes there it will be judgment day  second soldier  ay and he has done a grievous thing for look you to murder one of us who are but flesh and blood is a sin and to kill a duke goes being near against the law  first soldier  well well he was a wicked duke  second soldier  and so he should not have touched him if one meddles with wicked people one is like to be tainted with their wickedness  third soldier  ay that is true  how old is the prisoner  second soldier  old enough to do wrong and not old enough to be wise  first soldier  why then he might be any age  second soldier  they say the duchess wanted to pardon him  first soldier  is that so  second soldier  ay and did much entreat the lord justice but he would not  first soldier  i had thought pietro that the duchess was omnipotent  second soldier  true she is wellfavoured i know none so comely  the soldiers  ha ha ha  first soldier  i meant i had thought our duchess could do anything  second soldier  nay for he is now given over to the justices and they will see that justice be done they and stout hugh the headsman but when his head is off why then the duchess can pardon him if she likes there is no law against that  first soldier  i do not think that stout hugh as you call him will do the business for him after all  this guido is of gentle birth and so by the law can drink poison first if it so be his pleasure  third soldier  and if he does not drink it  first soldier  why then they will kill him knocking comes at the door  first soldier  see who that is third soldier goes over and looks through the wicket  third soldier  it is a woman

the door and the duchess masked and cloaked enters  duchess  to third soldier are you the officer on guard  first soldier  coming forward i am madam  duchess  i must see the prisoner alone  first soldier  i am afraid that is impossible  the duchess hands him a ring he looks at and returns it to her with a bow and makes a sign to the soldiers  stand without there  exeunt the soldiers  duchess  officer your men are somewhat rough  first soldier  they mean no harm  duchess  i shall be going back in a few minutes  as i pass through the corridor do not let them try and lift my mask  first

duchesss own ring  duchess  leave us  the soldier turns to go out  a moment sir  for what hour is     first soldier  at twelve oclock madam we have orders to lead him out but i dare say he wont wait for us hes more like to take a drink out of that poison yonder  men are afraid of the headsman  duchess  is that poison  first soldier  ay madam and very sure poison too  duchess  you may go sir  first soldier  by saint james a pretty hand  i wonder who she is  some woman who loved him perhaps  exit  duchess  taking her mark off  at last he can escape now in this cloak and vizard we are of a height almost  they will not know him as for myself what matter so that he does not curse me as he goes i care but little  i wonder will he curse me he has the right  it is eleven now they will not come till twelve goes over to the table so this is poison is it not strange that in this liquor here there lies the key to all philosophies takes the cup up it smells of poppies  i remember well that when i was a child in sicily i took the scarlet poppies from the corn and made a little wreath and my grave uncle don john of naples laughed  i did not know that they had power to stay the springs of life to make the pulse cease beating and to chill the blood in its own vessels till men come and with a hook hale the poor body out and throw it in a ditch  the body ay  what of the soul that goes to heaven or hell where will mine go takes the torch from the wall and goes over to the bed how peacefully here he sleeps like a young schoolboy tired out with play i would that i could sleep so peacefully but i have dreams  bending over him poor boy  what if i kissed him no no my lips would burn him like a fire he has had enough of love  still that white neck will scape the headsman  i have seen to that he will get hence from padua tonight and that is well  you are very wise lord justices and yet you are not half so wise as i am and that is well o god how i have loved you and what a bloody flower did love bear comes back to the table what if i drank these juices and so ceased were it not better than to wait till death come to my bed with all his serving men remorse disease old age and misery i wonder does one suffer much  i think that i am very young to die like this but so it must be  why why should i die he will escape tonight and so his blood will not be on my head  no i must die i have been guilty therefore i must die he loves me not and therefore i must die i would die happier if he would kiss me but he will not do that  i did not know him i thought he meant to sell me to the judge that is not strange we women never know our lovers till they leave us bell begins to toll thou vile bell that like a bloodhound from thy brazen throat callst for this mans life cease thou shalt not get it he stirsi must be quick   takes up cup o love love love i did not think that i would pledge thee thus drinks poison and sets the cup down on the table behind her  the noise wakens guido who starts up and does not see what she has done  there is silence for a minute each looking at the other i do not come to ask your pardon now seeing i know i stand beyond all pardon enough of that  i have already sir confessed my sin to the lords justices they would not listen to me  and some said i did invent a tale to save your life you have trafficked with me others said that women played with pity as with men others that grief for my slain lord and husband had robbed me of my wits  they would not hear me and when i sware it on the holy book they bade the doctor cure me  they are ten ten against one and they possess your life they call me duchess here in padua i do not know sir if i be the duchess i wrote your pardon and they would not take it they call it treason say i taught them that maybe i did  within an hour guido they will be here and drag you from the cell and bind your hands behind your back and bid you kneel at the block  i am before them there here is the signet ring of padua twill bring you safely through the men on guard there is my cloak and vizard they have orders not to be curious  when you pass the gate turn to the left and at the second bridge you will find horses waiting  by tomorrow you will be at venice safe  a pause do you not speak will you not even curse me ere you go  you have the right  a pause you do not understand there

not take the ring  guido  takes ring and kisses it ay gladly madam  duchess  and leave padua  guido  leave padua  duchess  but it must be tonight  guido  tonight it shall be  duchess  oh thank god for that  guido  so i can live life never seemed so sweet as at this moment  duchess  do not tarry guido there is my cloak  the horse is at the bridge the second bridge below the ferry house why do you tarry  can your ears not hear this dreadful bell whose every ringing stroke robs one brief minute from your boyish life go quickly  guido  ay he will come soon enough  duchess  who  guido  calmly why the headsman  duchess  no no  guido  only he can bring me out of padua  duchess  you dare not you dare not burden my oerburdened soul with two dead men  i think one is enough for when i stand before god face to face i would not have you with a scarlet thread around your white throat coming up behind to say i did it  guido  madam i wait  duchess  no no you cannot  you do not understand i have less power in padua tonight than any common woman they will kill you i saw the scaffold as i crossed the square already the low rabble throng about it with fearful jests and horrid merriment as though it were a morrisdancers platform and not deaths sable throne  o guido guido you must escape  guido  madam i tarry here  duchess  guido you shall not  it would be a thing so terrible that the amazed stars would fall from heaven and the palsied moon be in her sphere eclipsed and the great sun refuse to shine upon the unjust earth which saw thee die  guido  be sure i shall not stir  duchess  wringing her hands is one sin not enough but must it breed a second sin more horrible again than was the one that bare it  o god god seal up sins teeming womb and make it barren i will not have more blood upon my hand than i have now  guido  seizing her hand what am i fallen so low that i may not have leave to die for you  duchess  tearing her hand away die for meno my life is a vile thing thrown to the miry highways of this world you shall not die for me you shall not guido i am a guilty woman  guido  guiltylet those who know what a thing temptation is let those who have not walked as we have done in the red fire of passion those whose lives are dull and colourless in a word let those if any such there be who have not loved cast stones against you  as for me   duchess  alas  guido  falling at her feet you are my lady and you are my love o hair of gold o crimson lips o face made for the luring and the love of man incarnate image of pure loveliness worshipping thee i do forget the past worshipping thee my soul comes close to thine worshipping thee i seem to be a god and though they give my body to the block yet is my love eternal duchess puts her hands over her face  guido draws them down sweet lift up the trailing curtains that overhang your eyes that i may look into those eyes and tell you i love you never more than now when death thrusts his cold lips between us  beatrice i love you  have you no word left to say oh i can bear the executioner but not this silence  will you not say you love me speak but that word and death shall lose his sting but speak it not and fifty thousand deaths are in comparison mercy  oh you are cruel and do not love me  duchess  alas  i have no right for i have stained the innocent hands of love with spiltout blood  there is blood on the ground i set it there  guido  sweet it was not yourself it was some devil tempted you  duchess  rising suddenly no no we are each our own devil and we make this world our hell  guido  then let high paradise fall into tartarus for i shall make this world my heaven for a little space the sin was mine if any sin there was twas i who nurtured murder in my heart sweetened my meats seasoned my wine with it and in my fancy slew the accursed duke a hundred times a day  why had this man died half so often as i wished him to death had been stalking ever through the house and murder had not slept but you fond heart whose little eyes grew tender over a whipt hound you whom the little children laughed to see because you brought the sunlight where you passed you the white angel of gods purity this which men call your sin what was it  duchess  ay what was it  there are times it seems a dream an evil dream sent by an evil god and then i see the dead face in the coffin and know it is no dream but that my hand is red with blood and that my desperate soul striving to find some haven for its love from the wild tempest of this raging world has wrecked its bark upon the rocks of sin what was it said youmurder merely  nothing but murder horrible murder  guido  nay nay nay twas but the passionflower of your love that in one moment leapt to terrible life and in one moment bare this gory fruit which i had plucked in thought a thousand times my soul was murderous but my hand refused your hand wrought murder but your soul was pure and so i love you beatrice and let him who has no mercy for your stricken head lack mercy up in heaven  kiss me sweet tries to kiss her  duchess  no no your lips are pure and mine are soiled for guilt has been my paramour and sin lain in my bed  o guido if you love me get hence for every moment is a worm which gnaws your life away  nay sweet get hence and if in after time you think of me think of me as of one who loved you more than anything on earth think of me guido as of a woman merely one who tried to make her life a sacrifice to love and slew love in the trial  oh what is that the bell has stopped from ringing and i hear the feet of armed men upon the stair  guido  aside that is the signal for the guard to come  duchess  why has the bell stopped ringing  guido  if you must know that stops my life on this side of the grave but on the other we shall meet again  duchess  no no tis not too late  you must get hence the horse is by the bridge there is still time away away you must not tarry here noise of soldiers in the passage  a voice outside  room for the lord justice of padua the lord justice is seen through the grated window passing down the corridor preceded by men bearing torches  duchess  it is too late  a voice outside  room for the headsman  duchess  sinks down oh the headsman with his axe on his shoulder is seen passing the corridor followed by monks bearing candles  guido  farewell dear love for i must drink this poison i do not fear the headsman but i would die not on the lonely scaffold but here here in thine arms kissing thy mouth  farewell goes to the table and takes the goblet up  what art thou empty throws it to the ground o thou churlish gaoler even of poisons niggard  duchess  faintly blame him not  guido  o god you have not drunk it beatrice tell me you have not  duchess  were i to deny it there is a fire eating at my heart which would find utterance  guido  o treacherous love why have you not left a drop for me  duchess  no no it held but death enough for one  guido  is there no poison still upon your lips that i may draw it from them  duchess  why should you die you have not spilt blood and so need not die i have spilt blood and therefore i must die was it not said blood should be spilt for blood who said that  i forget  guido  tarry for me our souls will go together  duchess  nay you must live there are many other women in the world who will love you and not murder for your sake  guido  i love you only  duchess  you need not die for that  guido  ah if we die together love why then can we not lie together in one grave  duchess  a grave is but a narrow weddingbed  guido  it is enough for us  duchess  and they will strew it with a stark windingsheet and bitter herbs i think there are no roses in the grave or if there are they all are withered now since my lord went there  guido  ah dear beatrice your lips are roses that death cannot wither  duchess  nay if we lie together will not my lips fall into dust and your enamoured eyes shrivel to sightless sockets and the worms which are our groomsmen eat away your heart  guido  i do not care  death has no power on love and so by loves immortal sovereignty i will die with you  duchess  but the grave is black and the pit black so i must go before to light the candles for your coming hither no no i will not die i will not die love you are strong and young and very brave stand between me and the angel of death and wrestle with him for me thrusts guido in front of her with his back to the audience i will kiss you when you have thrown him  oh have you no cordial to stay the workings of this poison in me are there no rivers left in italy that you will not fetch me one cup of water to quench this fire  guido  o god  duchess  you did not tell me there was a drought in italy and no water nothing but fire  guido  o love  duchess  send for a leech not him who stanched my husband but another we have no time  send for a leech i say there is an antidote against each poison and he will sell it if we give him money tell him that i will give him padua for one short hour of life  i will not die oh i am sick to death no do not touch me this poison gnaws my heart  i did not know it was such pain to die  i thought that life had taken all the agonies to itself it seems it is not so  guido  o damned stars quench your vile cressetlights in tears and bid the moon your mistress shine no more tonight  duchess  guido why are we here  i think this room is poorly furnished for a marriage chamber let us get hence at once  where are the horses we should be on our way to venice now how cold the night is  we must ride faster the monks begin to chant outside music  it should be merrier but grief is of the fashion nowi know not why you must not weep  do we not love each other  that is enough  death what do you here you were not bidden to this table sir away we have no need of you  i tell you it was in wine i pledged you not in poison they lied who told you that i drank your poison it was spilt upon the ground like my lords blood you came too late  guido  sweet there is nothing there these things are only unreal shadows  duchess  death why do you tarry get to the upper chamber the cold meats of my husbands funeral feast are set for you this is a wedding feast you are out of place sir and besides tis summer we do not need these heavy fires now you scorch us oh i am burned up can you do nothing  water give me water or else more poison  no  i feel no pain  is it not curious i should feel no pain  and death has gone away i am glad of that i thought he meant to part us  tell me guido are you not sorry that you ever saw me  guido  i swear i would not have lived otherwise why in this dull and common world of ours men have died looking for such moments as this and have not found them  duchess  then you are not sorry how strange that seems  guido  what beatrice have i not stood face to face with beauty  that is enough for one mans life  why love i could be merry i have been often sadder at a feast but who were sad at such a feast as this when love and death are both our cupbearers we love and die together  duchess  oh i have been guilty beyond all women and indeed beyond all women punished  do you think  no that could not beoh do you think that love can wipe the bloody stain from off my hands pour balm into my wounds heal up my hurts and wash my scarlet sins as white as snow  for i have sinned  guido  they do not sin at all who sin for love  duchess  no i have sinned and yet perchance my sin will be forgiven me i have loved much  they kiss each other now for the first time in this act when suddenly the duchess leaps up in the dreadful spasm of death tears in agony at her dress and finally with face twisted and distorted with pain falls back dead in a chair  guido seizing her dagger from her belt kills himself and as he falls across her knees clutches at the cloak which is on the back of the chair and throws it entirely over her  there is a little pause  then down the passage comes the tramp of soldiers the door is opened and the lord justice the headsman and the guard enter and see this figure shrouded in black and guido lying dead across her  the lord justice rushes forward and drags the cloak off the duchess whose face is now the marble image of peace the sign of gods forgiveness  tableau  curtain
