89177185	colonel starbottles client   by bret harte     contents   colonel starbottles client  the postmistress of laurel run  a night at hays  johnsons old woman  the new assistant at pine clearing school  in a pioneer restaurant  a treasure of the galleon  out of a pioneers trunk  the ghosts of stukeley castle     colonel starbottles client   chapter i   it may be remembered that it was the habit of that gallant warhorse of the calaveras democracy colonel starbottle at the close of a political campaign to return to his original profession of the law perhaps it could not be called a peaceful retirement the same fierytongued eloquence and fullbreasted chivalry which had in turns thrilled and overawed freemen at the polls were no less fervid and embattled before a jury yet the colonel was counsel for two or three pastoral ditch companies and certain bucolic corporations and although he managed to import into the simplest question of contract more or less abuse of opposing counsel and occasionally mingled precedents of law with antecedents of his adversary his legal victories were seldom complicated by bloodshed he was only once shot at by a freehanded judge and twice assaulted by an oversensitive litigant nevertheless it was thought merely prudent while preparing the papers in the well known case of the arcadian shepherds association of tuolumne versus the kedron vine and fig tree growers of calaveras that the colonel should seek with a shotgun the seclusion of his partners law office in the sylvan outskirts of rough and ready for that complete rest and serious preoccupation which marysville could not afford  it was an exceptionally hot day the painted shingles of the plain wooden onestoried building in which the colonel sat were warped and blistering in the direct rays of the fierce untempered sun the tin sign bearing the dazzling legend starbottle and bungstarter attorneys and counselors glowed with an insufferable light the two pinetrees still left in the clearing around the house ineffective as shade seemed only to have absorbed the daylong heat through every scorched and crisp twig and fibre to radiate it again with the pungent smell of a slowly smouldering fire the air was motionless yet vibrating in the sunlight on distant shallows the halfdried river was flashing and intolerable  seated in a wooden armchair before a table covered with books and papers yet with that apparently haughty attitude towards it affected by gentlemen of abdominal fullness colonel starbottle supported himself with one hand grasping the arm of his chair and the other vigorously plying a huge palmleaf fan he was perspiring freely he had taken off his characteristic blue frockcoat waistcoat cravat and collar and stripped only to his ruffled shirt and white drill trousers presented the appearance from the opposite side of the table of having hastily risen to work in his nightgown a glass with a thin sediment of sugar and lemonpeel remaining in it stood near his elbow suddenly a black shadow fell on the staring uncarpeted hall it was that of a stranger who had just entered from the noiseless dust of the deserted road the colonel cast a rapid glance at his swordcane which lay on the table  but the stranger although sallow and moroselooking was evidently of pacific intent he paused on the threshold in a kind of surly embarrassment  i reckon this is colonel starbottle he said at last glancing gloomily round him as if the interview was not entirely of his own seeking well ive seen you often enough though you dont know me my names jo corbin i guess he added still discontentedly i have to consult you about something  corbin repeated the colonel in his jauntiest manner ah any relation to old maje corbin of nashville sir  no said the stranger briefly im from shelbyville  the major continued the colonel half closing his eyes as if to follow the major into the dreamy past the old major sir a matter of five or six years ago was one of my most intimate political friendsin fact sir my most intimate friend take a chyar  but the stranger had already taken one and during the colonels reminiscence had leaned forward with his eyes on the ground discontentedly swinging his soft hat between his legs did you know tom frisbee of yolo he asked abruptly  erno  nor even heard anything about frisbee nor what happened to him continued the man with aggrieved melancholy  in point of fact the colonel did not think that he had  nor anything about his being killed over at fresno said the stranger with a desponding implication that the interview after all was a failure  iferif you couldergive me a hint or two suggested the colonel blandly  there wasnt much said the stranger if you dont remember he paused then rising he gloomily dragged his chair slowly beside the table and taking up a paperweight examined it with heavy dissatisfaction you see he went on slowly i killed himit was a quoll he was my pardner but i reckon he must have drove me hard yes sir he added with aggrieved reflection i reckon he drove me hard  the colonel smiled courteously slightly expanding his chest under the homicidal relation as if having taken it in and made it a part of himself he was ready if necessary to become personally responsible for it then lifting his empty glass to the light he looked at it with half closed eyes in polite imitation of his companions examination of the paperweight and set it down again a casual spectator from the window might have imagined that the two were engaged in an amicable inventory of the furniture  and theeractual circumstances asked the colonel  oh it was fair enough fight theyll tell you that and so would he i reckonif he could he was ugly and bedevlin but i didnt care to quoll and give him the goby all the time he kept on followed me out of the shanty drew and fired twice ihe stopped and regarded his hat a moment as if it was a corroborating witnessii closed with himi had toit was my only chance and that ended itand with his own revolver i never drew mine  i see said the colonel nodding clearly justifiable and honorable as regards the code and you wish me to defend you  the strangers gloomy expression of astonishment now turned to blank hopelessness  i knew you didnt understand he said despairingly why all that was two years ago its all settled and done and gone the jury found for me at the inquest it aint that i want to see you about its something arising out of it  ah said the colonel affably a vendetta perhaps some friend or relation of his taken up the quarrel  the stranger looked abstractedly at starbottle you think a relation might or would feel in that sort of way  why blank it all sir said the colonel nothing is more common why in 52 one of my oldest friends doctor byrne of st jo the seventh in a line from old general byrne of st louis was killed sir by pinkey riggs seventh in a line from senator riggs of kentucky original cause sir something about a dd roasting ear or a blank persimmon in 1832 fortyseven men wiped out in twenty years fact sir  it aint that said the stranger moving hesitatingly in his chair if it was anything of that sort i wouldnt mindit might bring matters to a windup and i shouldnt have to come here and have this cursed talk with you  it was so evident that this frank and unaffected expression of some obscure disgust with his own present position had no other implication that the colonel did not except to it yet the man did not go on he stopped and seemed lost in sombre contemplation of his hat  the colonel leaned back in his chair fanned himself elegantly wiped his forehead with a large pongee handkerchief and looking at his companion whose shadowed abstraction seemed to render him impervious to the heat said  my dear mr corbin i perfectly understand you blank it all sir the temperature in this infernal hole is quite enough to render any confidential conversation between gentlemen upon delicate matters utterly impossible its almost as near hades sir as they make itas i trust you and i mr corbin will ever experience i propose continued the colonel with airy geniality some light change and refreshment the barkeeper of the magnolia iseri may say sir facile princeps in the concoction of mint juleps and there is a back room where i have occasionally conferred with political leaders at election time it is but a step sirin fact on main streetround the corner  the stranger looked up and then rose mechanically as the colonel resumed his coat and waistcoat but not his collar and cravat which lay limp and dejected among his papers then sheltering himself beneath a largebrimmed panama hat and hooking his cane on his arm he led the way fan in hand into the road tiptoeing in his tight polished boots through the red impalpable dust with his usual jaunty manner yet not without a profane suggestion of burning ploughshares the stranger strode in silence by his side in the burning sun impenetrable in his own morose shadow  but the magnolia was fragrant like its namesake with mint and herbal odors cool with sprinkled floors and sparkling with broken ice on its counters like dewdrops on white unfolded petalsand slightly soporific with the subdued murmur of droning loungers who were heavy with its sweets the gallant colonel nodded with confidential affability to the spotlessshirted barkeeper and then taking corbin by the arm fraternally conducted him into a small apartment in the rear of the barroom it was evidently used as the office of the proprietor and contained a plain desk table and chairs at the rear window nature not entirely evicted looked in with a few straggling buckeyes and a dusty myrtle over the body of a latelyfelled pinetree that flaunted from an upflung branch a still green spray as if it were a drooping banner lifted by a dead but rigid arm from the adjoining room the faint monotonous click of billiard balls languidly played came at intervals like the dry notes of cicale in the bushes  the barkeeper brought two glasses crowned with mint and diademed with broken ice the colonel took a long pull at his portion and leaned back in his chair with a bland gulp of satisfaction and dreamily patient eyes the stranger mechanically sipped the contents of his glass and then without having altered his reluctant expression drew from his breastpocket a number of old letters holding them displayed in his fingers like a difficult hand of cards and with something of the air of a dispirited player he began  you see about six months after this yer trouble i got this letter he picked out a well worn badly written missive and put it into colonel starbottles hands rising at the same time and leaning over him as he read you see she that writ it says as how she hadnt heard from her son for a long time but owing to his having spoken once about me she was emboldened to write and ask me if i knew what had gone of him he was pointing his finger at each line of the letter as he read it or rather seemed to translate it from memory with a sad familiarity now he continued in parenthesis you see this kind o got me i knew he had got relatives in kentucky i knew that all this trouble had been put in the paper with his name and mine but this here name of martha jeffcourt at the bottom didnt seem to jibe with it then i remembered that he had left a lot of letters in his trunk in the shanty and i looked em over and i found that his name was tom jeffcourt and that hed been passin under the name of frisbee all this time  perfectly natural and a frequent occurrence interposed the colonel cheerfully only last year i met an old friend whom well call stidger of new orleans at the union club frisco how are you stidger i said i havent seen you since we used to meetdriving over the shell road in 53 excuse me sir said he my name is not stidger its brown i looked him in the eye sir and saw him quiver then i must apologize to stidger i said for supposing him capable of changing his name he came to me an hour after all in a tremble for gods sake star he saidalways called me stardont go back on me but you know family affairsanother woman beautiful creature etc etcyes sir perfectly common but a blank mistake when a man once funks his own name hell turn tail on anything sorry for this man friezecoat or turncoat or whatevers his dd name but its so  the suggestion did not however seem to raise the strangers spirits or alter his manner his name was jeffcourt and this here was his mother he went on drearily and you see here she sayspointing to the letter againshes been expecting money from him and it dont come and shes mighty hard up and that gave me an idea i dont know he went on regarding the colonel with gloomy doubt as youll think it was much i dont know as you wouldnt call it a dd fool idea but i got it all the same he stopped hesitated and went on you see this man frisbee or jeffcourt was my pardner we were good friends up to the killing and then he drove me hard i think i told you he drove me harddidnt i well he did but the idea i got was this considerin i killed him after all and so to speak disappointed them i reckoned id take upon myself the care of that family and send em money every month  the colonel slightly straitened his cleanshaven mouth a kind of expiation or amercement by fine known to the mosaic roman and old english law gad sir the jews might have made you marry his widow or sister an old custom and i think supersededsir properly supersededby the alternative of ordeal by battle in the mediaeval times i dont myself fancy these pecuniary fashions of settling wrongsbut go on  i wrote her continued corbin that her son was dead but that he and me had some interests together in a claim and that i was very glad to know where to send her what would be his share every month i thought it no use to tell her i killed himmay be she might refuse to take it i sent her a hundred dollars every month since sometimes its been pretty hard sleddin to do it for i aint rich sometimes ive had to borrow the money but i reckoned that i was only paying for my share in this here business of his bein dead and i did it  and i understand you that this jeffcourt really had no interest in your claim  corbin looked at him in dull astonishment not a cent of course i thought i told you that but that werent his fault for he never had anything and owed me money in fact he added gloomily it was because i hadnt any more to give himhavin sold my watch for grubthat he quolled with me that day and up and called me a sneakin yankee hound i told you he drove me hard  the colonel coughed slightly and resumed his jaunty manner and theermother was of course grateful and satisfied  well nonot exactly he stopped again and took up his letters once more sorted and arranged them as if to play out his unfinished but hopeless hand and drawing out another laid it before the colonel you see this mrs jeffcourt after a time reckoned she ought to have more money than i sent her and wrote saying that she had always understood from her son he that never wrote but once a year remember that this claim of ours that she never knew of you know was paying much more than i sent herand she wanted a return of accounts and papers or shed write to some lawyer mighty quick well i reckoned that all this was naturally in the line of my trouble and i did manage to scrape together fifty dollars more for two months and sent it but that didnt seem to satisfy heras you see he dealt colonel starbottle another letter from his baleful hand with an unchanged face when i got thatwell i just up and told her the whole thing i sent her the account of the fight from the newspapers and told her as how her son was the frisbee that was my pardner and how he never had a cent in the worldbut how id got that idea to help her and was willing to carry it out as long as i could  did you keep a copy of that letter asked the colonel straitening his masklike mouth  no said corbin moodily what was the good i knowd shed got the letterand she didfor that is what she wrote back he laid another letter before the colonel who hastily read a few lines and then brought his fat white hand violently on the desk  why dn it all sir this is blackmail as infamous a case of threatening and chantage as i ever heard of  well said corbin dejectedly i dont know you see she allows that i murdered frisbee to get hold of his claim and that im trying to buy her off and that if i dont come down with twenty thousand dollars on the nail and notes for the rest shell prosecute me well mebbe the thing looks to her like thatmebbe you know ive got to shoulder that too perhaps its all in the same line  colonel starbottle for a moment regarded corbin critically in spite of his chivalrous attitude towards the homicidal faculty the colonel was not optimistic in regard to the baser pecuniary interests of his fellowman it was quite on the cards that his companion might have murdered his partner to get possession of the claim it was true that corbin had voluntarily assumed an unrecorded and hitherto unknown responsibility that had never been even suspected and was virtually selfimposed but that might have been the usual one unerring blunder of criminal sagacity and forethought it was equally true that he did not look or act like a mean murderer but that was nothing however there was no evidence of these reflections in the colonels face rather he suddenly beamed with an excess of politeness would youermind mr corbin whilst i am going over those letters again toerstep across to my officeanderbring me the copy of woods digest that lies on my table it will save some time  the stranger rose as if the service was part of his selfimposed trouble and as equally hopeless with the rest and taking his hat departed to execute the commission as soon as he had left the building colonel starbottle opened the door and mysteriously beckoned the barkeeper within  do you remember anything of the killing of a man named frisbee over in fresno three years ago  the barkeeper whistled meditatively three years agofrisbeefresnono yesbut that was only one of his names he was jack walker over here yesand by jove that feller that was here with you killed him darn my skin but i thought i recognized him  yes yes i know all that said the colonel impatiently but did frisbee have any property did he have any means of his own  property echoed the barkeeper with scornful incredulity property means the only property and means he ever had was the free lunches or drinks he took in at somebody elses expense why the only chance he ever had of earning a square meal was when that fellow that was with you just now took him up and made him his partner and the only way he could get rid of him was to kill him and i didnt think he had it in him rather a queer kind o chapgood deal of hayseed about him showed up at the inquest so glum and orkerd that if the boys hadnt made up their minds this yer frisbee orter been killedit might have gone hard with him  mr corbin said colonel starbottle with a pained but unmistakable hauteur and a singular elevation of his shirt frill as if it had become of its own accord erectile mr corbinereris the distant relative of old major corbin of nashvilleerone of my oldest political friends when mr corbinerreturns you can conduct him to me and if you please replenish the glasses  when the barkeeper respectfully showed mr corbin and woods digest into the room again the colonel was still beaming and apologetic  a thousand thanks sir but except to show you the law if you require ithardly necessary i haveerglanced over the womans letters again it would be better perhaps if you had kept copies of your ownbut still these tell the whole story and your own the claim is preposterous you have simply to drop the whole thing stop your remittances stop your correspondencepay no heed to any further letters and wait results you need fear nothing further sir i stake my professional reputation on it  the gloom of the stranger seemed only to increase as the colonel reached his triumphant conclusion  i reckoned youd say that he said slowly but it wont do i shall go on paying as far as i can its my trouble and ill see it through  but my dear sir consider gasped the colonel you are in the hands of an infamous harpy who is using her sons blood to extract money from you you have already paid a dozen times more than the life of that dd sneak was worth and more than thatthe longer you keep on paying you are helping to give color to their claim and estopping your own defense and gad sir youre making a precedent for this sort of thing you are offering a premium to widows and orphans a gentleman wont be able to exchange shots with another without making himself liable for damages i am willing to admit that your feelingsthough in my opinionerexaggerateddo you credit but i am satisfied that they are utterly misunderstoodsir  not by all of them said corbin darkly  eh returned the colonel quickly  there was another letter here which i didnt particularly point out to you said corbin taking up the letters again for i reckoned it wasnt evidence so to speak being from his cousin a girland calculated youd read it when i was out  the colonel coughed hastily i was in facterjust about to glance over it when you came in  it was written continued corbin selecting a letter more bethumbed than the others after the old woman had threatened me this here young woman allows that she is sorry that her aunt has to take money of me on account of her cousin being killed and she is still sorrier that she is so bitter against me she says she hadnt seen her cousin since he was a boy and used to play with her and that she finds it hard to believe that he should ever grow up to change his name and act so as to provoke anybody to lift a hand against him she says she supposed it must be something in that dreadful california that alters people and makes everybody so reckless i reckon her heads level there aint it  there was such a sudden and unexpected lightening of the mans face as he said it such a momentary relief to his persistent gloom that the colonel albeit inwardly dissenting from both letter and comment smiled condescendingly  shes no slouch of a scribe neither continued corbin animatedly read that  he handed his companion the letter pointing to a passage with his finger the colonel took it with i fear a somewhat lowered opinion of his client and a new theory of the case it was evident that this weak submission to the aunts conspiracy was only the result of a greater weakness for the niece colonel starbottle had a wholesome distrust of the sex as a business or political factor he began to look over the letter but was evidently slurring it with superficial politeness when corbin said  read it out loud  the colonel slightly lifted his shoulders fortified himself with another sip of the julep and leaning back oratorically began to readthe stranger leaning over him and following line by line with shining eyes   when i say i am sorry for you it is because i think it must be dreadful for you to be going round with the blood of a fellowcreature on your hands it must be awful for you in the stillness of the night season to hear the voice of the lord saying cain where is thy brother and you saying lord i have slayed him dead it must be awful for you when the pride of your wrath was surfitted and his dum senseless corps was before you not to know that it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord    it was no use for you to say i never heard that before remembering your teacher and parents yet verily i say unto you though your sins be as scarlet they shall be washed whiter than snow saith the lordisaiah i 18 and heart hath no sorrow that heaven cannot healmy hymn book 1st presbyterian church page 79 mr corbin i pity your feelins at the grave of my pore dear cousin knowing he is before his maker and you cant bring him back umpherervery goodvery good indeed said the colonel hastily refolding the letter very well meaning ander  go on said corbin over his shoulder you havent read all  ah true i perceive i overlooked something umum may god forgive you mr corbin as i do and make aunty think better of you for it was good what you tried to do for her and the fammely and ive always said it when she was raging round and wanting money of you i dont believe you meant to do it anyway owin to your kindness of heart to the ophanless and the widow since you did it anser this letter and dont mind what aunty says so no more at present fromyours very respectfully sally dows  p stheres been some troubel in our township and some fitin may the lord change ther hearts and make them as a little child for if you are still young you may grow up different i have writ a short prayer for you to say every night you can coppy it out and put it at the head of your bed it is this o lord make me sorry for having killed sarah dows cousin give me o lord that peace that the world cannot give and which fadeth not away for my yoke is heavy and my burden is harder than i can bear   the colonels deliberate voice stopped there was a silence in the room and the air seemed stifling the click of the billiard balls came distinctly through the partition from the other room then there was another click a stamp on the floor and a voice crying coarsely curse it allmissed again  to the strangers astonishment the colonel was on his feet in an instant gasping with inarticulate rage flinging the door open he confronted the startled barkeeper empurpled and stertorous  blank it all sir do you call this a saloon for gentlemen or a corral for swearing cattle or do you mean to say that the conversation of two gentlemen upon delicate professionalanderdomestic affairsis to be broken upon by the blank profanity of lowbred hounds over their picayune gambling take them my kyard sir choked the colonel who was always southern and dialectic in his excited as in his softest moments and tell them that colonel starbottle will nevah dyarken these doahs again  before the astonished barkeeper could reply the colonel had dashed back into the room clapped his hat on his head and seized his book letters and cane mr corbin he said with gasping dignity i will take these papahs and consult them again in my own officewhere if you will do me the honor sir to call at ten oclock tomorrow i will give you my opinion he strode out of the saloon beside the half awestricken halfamused yet all discreetly silent loungers followed by his wondering but gloomy client at the door they partedthe colonel tiptoeing towards his office as if dancing with rage the stranger darkly plodding through the stifling dust in the opposite direction with what might have been a faint suggestion to his counselor that the paths of the homicide did not lie beside the still cool waters   chapter ii   the house of captain masterton dows at pineville kentucky was a fine specimen of southern classical architecture being an exact copy of major fauquiers house in virginia which was in turn only a slight variation from a wellknown statesmans historical villa in alabama that everybody knew was designed from a famous greek temple on the piraeus not but that it shared this resemblance with the county court house and the odd fellows hall but the addition of training jessamine and cherokee rose to the columns of the portico and over the colonnade leading to its offices showed a certain domestic distinction and the sky line of its incongruously high roof was pleasantly broken against adjacent green pines butternut and darker cypress  a nearer approach showed the stuccoed gatepostswhose red brick core was revealed through the dropping plasteropening in a wall of halfrough stone halfwooden palisade equally covered with shining moss and parasitical vines which hid a tangled garden left to its own unkempt luxuriance yet there was a reminiscence of past formality and even pretentiousness in a wide boxbordered terrace and one or two stuccoed vases prematurely worn and timestained while several rare exotics had however thriven so unwisely and well in that stimulating soil as to lose their exclusive refinement and acquire a certain temporary vulgarity a few with the not uncommon enthusiasm of aliens had adopted certain native peculiarities with a zeal that far exceeded any indigenous performance but dominant through all was the continual suggestion of precocious fruition and premature decay that lingered like a sad perfume in the garden but made itself persistent if less poetical in the house  here the fluted wooden columns of the portico and colonnade seemed to have taken upon themselves a sodden and unwholesome age unknown to stone and mortar moss and creeper clung to paint that time had neither dried nor mellowed but left still glairy in its white consistency there were rusty red blotches around inflamed nailholes in the swollen wood as of punctures in living flesh along the entablature and cornices and in the dank gutters decay had taken the form of a mild deliquescence and the pillars were spotted as if nature had dropped over the too early ruin a few unclean tears the house itself was lifted upon a broad wooden foundation painted to imitate marble with such hopeless mendacity that the architect at the last moment had added a green border and the owner permitted a fallen board to remain off so as to allow a few privileged fowls to openly explore the interior when miss sally dows played the piano in the drawingroom she was at times accompanied by the uplifted voice of the sympathetic hounds who sought its quiet retreat in illhealth or low spirits and from whom she was separated only by an imperfectly carpeted floor of yawning seams the infant progeny of mammy judy an old nurse made this a hidingplace from domestic justice where they were eventually betrayed by subterranean giggling that had once or twice brought bashful confusion to the hearts of miss sallys admirers and mischievous security to that finished coquette herself  it was a pleasant september afternoon on possibly one of these occasions that miss sally sitting before the piano alternately striking a few notes with three pink fingers and glancing at her reflection in the polished rosewood surface of the lifted keyboard case was heard to utter this languid protest  quit that kind of talk chet unless you just admire to have every word of it repeated all over the county those little niggers of mammy judys are lying round somewhere and are mighty cute and sassy i tell you its nothin to me sure but miss hilda mightnt like to hear of it so soon after your particular attention to her at last nights pawty too  here a freshlooking young fellow of sixandtwenty leaning uneasily over the piano from the opposite side was heard to murmur that he didnt care what miss hilda heard nor the whole world for the matter of that but he added with a faint smile folks allow that you know how to play up sometimes and put on the loud pedal when you dont want mammys niggers to hear  indeed said the young lady demurely like this  she put out a distracting little foot clothed in the white stocking and cool black prunella slipper then de rigueur in the state and pressing it on the pedal began to drum vigorously on the keys in vain the amorous chet protested in a voice which the instrument drowned perceiving which the artful young lady opened her blue eyes mildly and said  i reckon it is so it does kind of prevent you hearing what you dont want to hear  you know well enough what i mean said the youth gloomily and that aint all that folks say they allow that youre doin a heap too much correspondence with that californian rough that killed tom jeffcourt over there  do they said the young lady with a slight curl of her pretty lip then perhaps they allow that if it wasnt for me he wouldnt be sending a hundred dollars a month to aunt martha  yes said the fatuous youth but they allow he killed tom for his money and they do say its mighty queer doins in yo writin religious letters to him and tom your own cousin  oh they tell those lies here do they but do they say anything about how when the same lies were told over in california the lawyer theyve got over there called colonel starbottlea southern man toogot up and just wrote to aunt martha that shed better quit that afore she got prosecuted they didnt tell you that did they mister chester brooks  but here the unfortunate brooks after the fashion of all jealous lovers deserted his allies for his fair enemy i dont cotton to what they say sally but you do write to him and i dont see what youve got to write aboutyou and him jule jeffcourt says that when you got religion at louisville during the revival you felt you had a call to write and save sinners and you did that as your trial and probation but that since you backslided and are worldly again and go to parties you just keep it up for foolin and flirtin she aint goin to weaken on the man that shot her brother just because hes got a gold mine anda mustache  she takes his money all the same said miss sally  she donther mother does she says if she was a man shed have blood for blood  my said miss sally in affected consternation its a wonder she dont apply to you to act for her  if it was my brother he killed id challenge him quick enough said chet flushing through his thin pink skin and light hair  marry her then and thatll make you one of the family i reckon miss hilda can bear it rejoined the young lady pertly  look here miss sally said the young fellow with a boyish despair that was not without a certain pathos in its implied inferiority i aint gifted like youi aint on yo level no how i cant pass yo on the road and so i reckon i must take yo dust as yo make it but there is one thing miss sally i want to tell you you know whats going on in this country youve heard your father say what the opinion of the best men is and whats likely to happen if the yanks force that nigger worshiper lincoln on the south you know that were drawing the line closer every day and spottin the men that aint sound take care miss sally you aint sellin us cheap to some northern abolitionist whod like to set marm judys little niggers to something worse than eavesdropping down there and mebbe teach em to kindle a fire underneath yo own flo  he had become quite dialectic in his appeal as if youthfully reverting to some accent of the nursery or as if he were exhorting her in some recognized shibboleth of a section miss sally rose and shut down the piano then leaning over it on her elbows her rounded little chin slightly elevated with languid impertinence and one saucy foot kicked backwards beyond the hem of her white cotton frock she said and let me tell you mister chester brooks that its just such godforsaken infant phenomenons as you who want to run the whole country that make all this fuss when you aint no more fit to be trusted with matches than judys children what do you know of mr jo corbin when you dont even know that hes from shelbyville and as good a suthner as you and if he hasnt got niggers its because they dont use them in his parts yor for all the world like one o mrs johnsons fancy bantams that aint quit of the shell afore they square off at their own mother my goodness sho shooo and suiting the action to the word the young lady still indolently even in her simulation swirled around caught her skirts at the side with each hand and lazily shaking them before her in the accepted feminine method of frightening chickens as she retreated backwards dropped them suddenly in a profound curtsey and swept out of the parlor  nevertheless as she entered the sittingroom she paused to listen then going to the window peeped through the slits of the venetian blind and saw her youthful admirer more dejected in the consciousness of his wasted efforts and useless attire mount his showy young horse as aimlessly spirited as himself and ride away miss sally did not regret this neither had she been entirely sincere in her defense of her mysterious correspondent but like many of her sex she was trying to keep up by the active stimulus of opposition an interest that she had begun to think if left to itself might wane she was conscious that her cousin julia although impertinent and illogical was right in considering her first epistolary advances to corbin as a youthful converts religious zeal but now that her girlish enthusiasm was spent and the revival itself had proved as fleeting an excitement as the old tournament of love and beauty which it had supplanted she preferred to believe that she enjoyed the fascinating impropriety because it was the actual result of her religious freedom perhaps she had a vague idea that corbins conversion would expiate her present preference for dress and dancing she had certainly never flirted with him they had never exchanged photographs there was not a passage in his letters that might not have been perused by her parentswhich i fear was probably one reason why she had never shown her correspondence and beyond the fact that this letterwriting gave her a certain importance in her own eyes and those of her companions it might really be stopped she even thought of writing at once to him that her parents objected to its further continuance but remembering that his usual monthly letter was now nearly due she concluded to wait until it came  it is to be feared that miss sally had little help in the way of family advice and that the moral administration of the dows household was as prematurely developed and as precociously exhausted as the estate and mansion themselves captain dows marriage with josephine jeffcourt the daughter of a poor white had been considered a mesalliance by his family and his own sister miranda dows had abandoned her brothers roof and refused to associate with the jeffcourts only returning to the house and an armed neutrality at the death of mrs dows a few years later she had taken charge of miss sally sending her to school at nashville until she was recalled by her father two years ago it may be imagined that miss sallys correspondence with jeffcourts murderer had afforded her a mixed satisfaction it was at first asserted that miss sallys forgiveness was really prompted by miss mirandy as a subtle sarcasm upon the family when however that forgiveness seemed to become a source of revenue to the impoverished jeffcourts her christian interference had declined  for this reason possibly the young girl did not seek her aunt in the bedroom the diningroom or the businessroom where miss miranda frequently assisted captain dows in the fatuous and prejudiced mismanagement of the house and property nor in any of the vacant guestrooms which in their early wreck of latterday mahogany and rosewood seemed to have been unoccupied for ages but went directly to her own room this was in the l a lately added wing that had escaped the gloomy architectural tyranny of the main building and gave miss sally light ventilation the freshness and spice of new pine boards and clean paper and a separate entrance and windows on a cool veranda all to herself intended as a concession to the young ladys traveled taste it was really a reversion to the finer simplicity of the pioneer  new as the apartment appeared to be it was old enough to contain the brief little records of her maidenhood the childish samplers and pictures the sporting epoch with its foxheads opossum and wildcat skins ridingwhip and the goshawk in a cage which miss sally believed could be trained as a falcon the religious interval of illustrated texts rock of ages cardboard crosses and the certificate of her membership with the daughters of sion at the head of her little bed down to the last decadence of frivolity shown in the beribboned guitar in the corner and the dance cards favors and rosettes military buttons dried bouquets and other love gages on the mantelpiece  the young girl opened a drawer of her table and took out a small packet of letters tied up with a green ribbon as she did so she heard the sound of hoofs in the rear courtyard this was presently followed by a step on the veranda and she opened the door to her father with the letters still in her hand there was neither the least embarrassment nor selfconsciousness in her manner  captain dows superficially remarkable only for a certain odd combination of high military stock and turnedover planters collar was slightly exalted by a sympathetic mingling of politics and mint julep at pineville court house i was passing by the postoffice at the cross roads last week dear he began cheerfully and i thought of you and reckoned it was about time that my pussy got one of her letters from her rich californian friendand sure enough there was one i clean forgot to give it to you then and only remembered it passing there today i didnt get to see if there was any golddust in it he continued with great archness and a fatherly pinch of her cheek though i suspect that isnt the kind of currency he sends to you  it is from mr corbin said miss sally taking it with a languid kind of doubt and only now paw i was just thinking that id sort of drop writing any more it makes a good deal of buzzing amongst the neighbors and i dont see much honey nor comb in it  eh said the captain apparently more astonished than delighted at his daughters prudence well child suit yourself its mighty mean though for i was just thinking of telling you that judge read is an old friend of this colonel starbottle who is your friends friend and lawyer and he says that colonel starbottle is with us and working for the cause out there and has got a list of all the sothern men in california that are sound and solid for the south read says he shouldnt wonder if hed make california wheel into line too  i dont see what thats got to do with mr corbin said the young girl impatiently flicking the still unopened letter against the packet in her hand  well said the captain with cheerful vagueness i thought it might interest youthats all and lounged judicially away  paw thinks said miss sally still standing in the doorway ostentatiously addressing her pet goshawk but with one eye following her retreating parent paw thinks that everybody is as keen bent on politics as he is theres where paw slips up jim  reentering the room scratching her little nose thoughtfully with the edge of mr corbins letter she went to the mantelpiece and picked up a small ivoryhandled dagger the gift of joyce masterton aged eighteen presented with certain verses addressed to a daughter of the south and cut open the envelope the first glance was at her own name and then at the signature there was no change in the formality it was dear miss sarah and yours respectfully jo corbin as usual she was still secure but her pretty brows contracted slightly as she read as follows   ive always allowed i should feel easier in my mind if i could ever get to see mrs jeffcourt and that may be she might feel easier in hers if i stood before her face to face even if she didnt forgive me at once it might do her good to get off what she had on her mind against me but as there wasnt any chance of her coming to me and it was out of the question my coming to her and still keeping up enough work in the mines to send her the regular money it couldnt be done but at last ive got a partner to run the machine when im away i shall be at shelbyville by the time this reaches you where i shall stay a day or two to give you time to break the news to mrs jeffcourt and then come on you will do this for me in your christian kindness miss dowswont you and if you could soften her mind so as to make it less hard for me i shall be grateful  p si forgot to say i have had him exhumedyou know who i meanand am bringing him with me in a patent metallic burial casketthe best that could be got in frisco and will see that he is properly buried in your own graveyard it seemed to me that it would be the best thing i could do and might work upon her feelingsas it has on mine dont you  j c   miss sally felt the tendrils of her fair hair stir with consternation the letter had arrived a week ago perhaps he was in pineville at that very moment she must go at once to the jeffcourtsit was only a mile distant perhaps she might be still in time but even then it was a terribly short notice for such a meeting yet she stopped to select her newest hat from the closet and to tie it with the largest of bows under her pretty chin and then skipped from the veranda into a green lane that ran beside the garden boundary there hidden by a hedge she dropped into a long swinging trot that even in her haste still kept the languid deliberation characteristic of her people until she had reached the road two or three hounds in the garden started joyously to follow her but she drove them back with a portentous frown and an illaimed stone and a suppressed voice yet in that backward glance she could see that her little eumenidesmammy judys childrenwere peering at her from below the wooden floor of the portico which they were grasping with outstretched arms and bowed shoulders as if they were black caryatides supportingas indeed their race had done for many a yearthe predoomed and decaying mansion of their master   chapter iii   happily miss sally thought more of her present mission than of the past errors of her people the faster she walked the more vividly she pictured the possible complications of this meeting she knew the dull mean nature of her aunt and the utter hopelessness of all appeal to anything but her selfish cupidity and saw in this fatuous essay of corbin only an aggravation of her worst instincts even the dead body of her son would not only whet her appetite for pecuniary vengeance but give it plausibility in the eyes of their emotional but ignorant neighbors she had still less to hope from julia jeffcourts more honest and human indignation but equally bigoted and prejudiced intelligence it is true they were only women and she ought to have no fear of that physical revenge which julia had spoken of but she reflected that miss jeffcourts unmistakable beauty and what was believed to be a truly southern spirit had gained her many admirers who might easily take her wrongs upon their shoulders if her father had only given her that letter before she might have stopped corbins coming at all she might even have met him in time to hurry him and her cousins provocative remains out of the country in the midst of these reflections she had to pass the little hillside cemetery it was a spot of great natural beauty cypressshadowed and luxuriant it was justly celebrated in pineville and but for its pretentious tombstones might have been peaceful and suggestive here she recognized a figure just turning from its gate it was julia jeffcourt  her first instinctthat she was too late and that her cousin had come to the cemetery to make some arrangements for the impending burialwas however quickly dissipated by the young girls manner  well sally dows you here whod have thought of seeing you today why chet brooks allowed that you danced every set last night and didnt get home till daylight and youyou that are going to show up at another party tonight too well i reckon i havent got that much ambition these times and out with your new bonnet too  there was a slight curl of her handsome lip as she looked at her cousin she was certainly a more beautiful girl than miss sally very tall dark and luminous of eye with a brunette pallor of complexion suggesting it was said that remote mixture of blood which was one of the unproven counts of miss mirandas indictment against her family miss sally smiled sweetly behind her big bow if you reckon to tie to everything that chet brooks says youll want lots of string and you wont be safe then you ought to have heard him run on about this one and that one and that other one not an hour ago in our parlor i had to pack him off saying he was even making judys niggers tired she stopped and added with polite languor i suppose theres no news up at yo house either everythings going on as usualandyou get yo california draft regularly  a good deal of the white of julias beautiful eyes showed as she turned indignantly on the speaker i wish cousin sally youd just let up talking to me about that money you know as well as i do that i allowed to maw i wouldnt take a cent of it from the first i might have had all the gowns and bonnetswith a look at miss sallys bowsi wanted from her she even offered to take me to st louis for a rigoutif id been willing to take blood money but id rather stick to this old sleazy mounin for tomshe gave a dramatic pluck at her faded black skirtthan flaunt round in white muslins and china silks at ten dollars a yard paid for by his murderer  you know blacks yo color alwaystaking in your height and complexion jule said miss sally demurely yet not without a feminine consciousness that it really did set off her cousins graceful figure to perfection but you cant keep up this gait always you know some day you might come upon this mr corbin  hed better not cross my path she said passionately  ive heard girls talk like that about a man and then get just green and yellow after him said miss sally critically but goodness me speaking of meeting people reminds me i clean forgot to stop at the stage office and see about bringing over the new overseer lucky i met you jule goodby dear come in tonight and well all go to the party together and with a little nod she ran off before her indignant cousin could frame a suitably crushing reply to her parthian insinuation  but at the stage office miss sally only wrote a few lines on a card put it in an envelope which she addressed to mr joseph corbin and then seating herself with easy carelessness on a long packingbox languidly summoned the proprietor  youre always on hand yourself at kirby station when the kyars come in to bring passengers to pineville mr sledge  yes miss  yo havent brought any strangers over lately  well last week squire farnham of green ridgeif he kin be called a strangeras used to live in the very house yo father  yes i know said miss sally impatiently but if an entire stranger comes to take a seat for pineville you ask him if thats his name handing the letter and give it to him if it is andmr sledgeits nobodys business butyours and mine  i understand miss sally with a slow paternal tolerating wink hell get it and nobody else sure  thank you i hope mrs sledge is getting round again  powfully miss sally  having thus as she hoped stopped the arrival of the unhappy corbin miss sally returned home to consider the best means of finally disposing of him she had insisted upon his stopping at kirby and holding no communication with the jeffcourts until he heard from her and had strongly pointed out the hopeless infelicity of his plan she dare not tell her aunt miranda knowing that she would be too happy to precipitate an interview that would terminate disastrously to both the jeffcourts and corbin she might have to take her father into her confidencea dreadful contingency  she was dressed for the evening party which was provincially early indeed it was scarcely past nine oclock when she had finished her toilet when there came a rap at her door it was one of mammy judys children  dey is a gemplum miss sally  yes yes said miss sally impatiently thinking only of her escort ill be there in a minute run away he can wait  and he said i was to guv yo dis yer continued the little negro with portentous gravity presenting a card  miss sally took it with a smile it was a plain card on which was written with a pencil in a hand she hurriedly recognized joseph corbin  miss sallys smile became hysterically rigid and pushing the boy aside with a little cry she darted along the veranda and entered the parlor from a side door and vestibule to her momentary relief she saw that her friends had not yet arrived a single figurea strangersrose as she entered  even in her consternation she had time to feel the added shock of disappointment she had always present in her mind an ideal picture of this man whom she had never seen or even heard described joseph corbin had been tall dark with flowing hair and long mustache he had flashing fiery eyes which were capable of being subdued by a single glance of gentlenessher own he was tempestuous quick and passionate but in quarrel would be led by a smile he was a combination of an italian brigand and a poker player whom she had once met on a mississippi steamboat he would wear a broadbrimmed soft hat a red shirt showing his massive throat and neckand high boots alas the man before her was of medium height with light closecut hair hollow cheeks that seemed to have been lately scraped with a razor and light gray troubled eyes a suit of cheap black ill fitting hastily acquired and provincial even for pineville painfully set off these imperfections to which a white cravat in a hopelessly tied bow was superadded a terrible idea that this combination of a country undertaker and an illpaid circuit preacher on probation was his best holiday tribute to her and not a funeral offering to mr jeffcourt took possession of her and when with feminine quickness she saw his eyes wander over her own fine clothes and festal figure and sink again upon the floor in a kind of hopeless disappointment equal to her own she felt ready to cry but the more terrible sound of laughter approaching the house from the garden recalled her her friends were coming  for heavens sake she broke out desperately didnt you get my note at the station telling you not to come  his face grew darker and then took up its look of hopeless resignation as if this last misfortune was only an accepted part of his greater trouble as he sat down again and to miss sallys horror listlessly swung his hat to and fro under his chair  no he said gloomily i didnt go to no station i walked here all the way from shelbyville i thought it might seem more like the square thing to her for me to do i sent him by express ahead in the box its been at the stage office all day  with a sickening conviction that she had been sitting on her cousins body while she wrote that illfated card the young girl managed to gasp out impatiently but you must goyesgo now at once dont talk now but go  i didnt come here he said rising with a kind of slow dignity to interfere with things i didnt kalkilate to see glancing again at her dress as the voices came nearer and that i aint in touch withbut to know if you think id better bring himor  he did not finish the sentence for the door had opened suddenly and a halfdozen laughing girls and their escorts burst into the room but among them a little haughty and still irritated from her last interview was her cousin julia jeffcourt erect and beautiful in a sombre silk  go repeated miss sally in an agonized whisper you must not be known here  but the attention of julia had been arrested by her cousins agitation and her eye fell on corbin where it was fixed with some fatal fascination that seemed in turn to enthrall and possess him also to miss sallys infinite dismay the others fell back and allowed these two black figures to stand out then to move towards each other with the same terrible magnetism they were so near she could not repeat her warning to him without the others hearing it and all hope died when corbin turning deliberately towards her with a grave gesture in the direction of julia said quietly  interduce me  miss sally hesitated and then gasped hastily miss jeffcourt  yer dont say my name tell her im joseph corbin of frisco california who killed her brother he stopped and turned towards her i came here to try and fix things againand ive brought him  in the wondering silence that ensued the others smiled vacantly breathlessly and expectantly until corbin advanced and held out his hand when julia jeffcourt drawing hers back to her bosom with the palms outward uttered an inarticulate cry andand spat in his face  with that act she found tonguereviling him the house that harbored him the insolence that presented him the insult that had been put upon her are you men she added passionately who stand here with the man before you that killed my brother and see him offer me his filthy villainous handand dare not strike him down  and they dared not violently blindly stupidly moved though all their instincts though they gathered hysterically around him there was something in his dull selfcontainment that was unassailable and awful for he wiped his face and breast with his handkerchief without a tremor and turned to them with even a suggestion of relief  shes right gentlemen he said gravely shes right it might have been otherwise i might have allowed that it might be otherwisebut shes right im a sothn man myself gentlemen and i reckon to understand what she has done i killed the only man that had a right to stand up for her and she has now to stand up for herself but if she wantsand you see she allows she wantsto pass that on to some of you or all of you im willing as many as you like and in what way you likei waive any chyce of weaponim ready gentlemen i came herewith himfor that purpose  perhaps it may have been his fateful resignation perhaps it may have been his exceeding readinessbut there was no response he sat down again and again swung his hat slowly and gloomily to and fro under his chair  ive got him in a box at the stage office he went on apparently to the carpet i had him dug up that i might bring him here and mebbe bury some of the trouble and difference along with his friends it might be he added with a slightly glowering upward glance as to an overruling but occasionally misdirecting providenceit might be from the way things are piling up on me that some one might have rung in another corpse instead o him but so far as i can judge allowin for the space of time and natral wear and tearits him  he rose slowly and moved towards the door in a silence that was as much the result of some conviction that any violent demonstration against him would be as grotesque and monstrous as the situation as of anything he had said even the flashing indignation of julia jeffcourt seemed to become suddenly as unnatural and incongruous as her brothers chief mourner himself and although she shrank from his passing figure she uttered no word chester brookss youthful emotions following the expression of miss sallys face lost themselves in a vague hysteric smile and the other gentlemen looked sheepish joseph corbin halted at the door  whatever he said turning to the company ye make up your mind to do about me i reckon yed better do it after the funeral im always ready but he what with being in a box and changing climate had better go first he paused and with a suggestion of delicacy in the momentary dropping of his eyelids addedfor reasons  he passed out through the door on to the portico and thence into the garden it was noticed at the time that the halfdozen hounds lingering there rushed after him with their usual noisy demonstrations but that they as suddenly stopped retreated violently to the security of the basement and there gave relief to their feelings in a succession of prolonged howls   chapter iv   it must not be supposed that miss sally did not feel some contrition over the ineffective part she had played in this last episode but joseph corbin had committed the unpardonable sin to a woman of destroying her own illogical ideas of him which was worse than if he had affronted the preconceived ideas of others in which case she might still defend him then too she was no longer religious and had no call to act as peacemaker nevertheless she resented julia jeffcourts insinuations bitterly and the cousins quarrelednot the first time in their intercourseand it was reserved for the latter to break the news of corbins arrival with the body to mrs jeffcourt  how this was done and what occurred at that interview has not been recorded but it was known the next day that while mrs jeffcourt accepted the body at corbins handsand it is presumed the funeral expenses alsohe was positively forbidden to appear either at the services at the house or at the church there had been some wild talk among the younger and many of the lower members of the community notably the poor nonslaveholding whites of tarring and feathering joseph corbin and riding him on a rail out of the town on the day of the funeral as a propitiatory sacrifice to the manes of thomas jeffcourt but it being pointed out by the undertaker that it might involve some uncertainty in the settlement of his bill together with some reasonable doubt of the thorough resignation of corbin whose previous momentary aberration in that respect they were celebrating the project was postponed until after the funeral and here an unlookedfor incident occurred  there was to be a political meeting at kirby on that day when certain distinguished southern leaders had gathered from the remoter southern states at the instigation of captain dows it was adjourned at the hour of the funeral to enable members to attend and it was even rumored to the great delight of pineville that a distinguished speaker or two might come over to improve the occasion with some slight allusion to the engrossing topic of southern rights this combined appeal to the domestic and political emotions of pineville was irresistible the second baptist church was crowded after the religious service there was a pause and judge reed stepping forward amid a breathless silence said that they were peculiarly honored by the unexpected presence in their midst of that famous son of the south colonel starbottle who had lately returned to his native soil from his adopted home in california every eye was fixed on the distinguished stranger as he rose  jaunty and gallant as ever femininely smoothfaced yet polished and high colored as a youthful mask pectorally expansive and unfolding the white petals of his waistcoat through the swollen lapels of his coat like a bursting magnolia bud colonel starbottle began the present associations were he might say singularly hallowed to him not only was pinevillea southern centrethe recognized nursery of southern chivalry southern beauty a stately inclination to the pew in which miss sally and julia jeffcourt sat southern intelligence and southern independence but it was the home of the lamented dead who had been like himself and another he should refer to later an adopted citizen of the golden state a seeker of the golden fleece a companion of jason it was the home fellowcitizens and friends of the sorrowing sister of the deceased a young lady whom he the speaker had as yet known only through the chivalrous blazon of her virtues and graces by her attendant knights a courteous wave towards the gallery where joyce masterton chester brooks calhoun bungstarter and the embattled youth generally of pineville became empurpled and idiotic it was the home of the afflicted widowed mother also personally unknown to him but with whom he might say he had hadererprofessional correspondence but it was not this alone that hallowed the occasion it was a sentiment that should speak in trumpetlike tones throughout the south in this uprising of an united section it was the forgetfulness of petty strife of family feud of personal wrongs in the claims of party it might not be known that he the speaker was professionally cognizant of one of these regrettableshould he say accidentsarising from the chivalrous challenge and equally chivalrous response of two fiery southern spirits to which they primarily owe their coming here that day and he should take it as his duty his solemn duty in that sacred edifice to proclaim to the world that in his knowledge as a professional manas a man of honor as a southerner as a gentleman that theercircumstances which three years ago led to the early demise of our lamented friend and brother reflected only the highest credit equally on both of the parties he said this on his own responsibilityin or out of this sacred edificeand in or out of that sacred edifice he was personally responsible and prepared to give the fullest satisfaction for it he was also aware that it might not be knownor understoodthat since that boyish episode the survivor had taken the place of the departed in the bereaved family and ministered to their needs with counsel andererpecuniary aid and had followed the body afoot across the continent that it might rest with its kindred dust he was aware that an unchristianhe would say but for that sacred edificea dastardly attempt had been made to impugn the survivors motivesto suggest an unseemly discord between him and the family but he the speaker would never forget the letter breathing with christian forgiveness and replete with angelic simplicity sent by a member of that family to his client which came under his professional eye here the professional eye for a moment lingered on the hysteric face of miss sally he did not envy the head or heart of a man who could peruse these linesof which the mere recollectionererchoked the utterance of even a professional man likeerhimselfwithout emotion and what my friends and fellowcitizens suddenly continued the colonel replacing his white handkerchief in his coattail was the reason why my client mr joseph corbinwhose delicacy keeps him from appearing among these mournerscomes here to bury all differences all animosities all petty passions because he is a son of the south because as a son of the south as the representative and a distant connection i believe of my old political friend major corbin of nashville he wishes here and everywhere at this momentous crisis to sink everything in the one allpervading allabsorbing one and indivisible unity of the south in its resistance to the northern usurper that my friends is the great the solemn the christian lesson of this most remarkable occasion in my professional political and social experience  whatever might have been the calmer opinion there was no doubt that the gallant colonel had changed the prevailing illogical emotion of pineville by the substitution of another equally illogical and miss sally was not surprised when her father touched by the colonels allusion to his daughters epistolary powers insisted upon bringing joseph corbin home with him and offering him the hospitality of the dows mansion although the stranger seemed to yield rather from the fact that the dows were relations of the jeffcourts than from any personal preference when he was fairly installed in one of the appropriately gloomy guest chambers miss sally set about the delayed work of reconciliationtheoretically accepted by her father and cynically tolerated by her aunt miranda but here a difficulty arose which she had not foreseen although corbin had evidently forgiven her defection on that memorable evening he had not apparently got over the revelation of her giddy worldliness and was resignedly apathetic and distrustful of her endeavors she was at first amused and then angry and her patience was exhausted when she discovered that he actually seemed more anxious to conciliate julia jeffcourt than her mother  but she spat in your face she said indignantly  thats so he replied gloomily but i reckoned you said something in one of your letters about turning the other cheek when you were smitten of course as you dont believe it now he added with his upward glance i suppose thats been played on me too  but here miss sallys spirit lazily rebelled  look here mr joseph jeremiah corbin she returned with languid impertinence if instead of cavortin round on yo knees trying to conciliate an old woman who never had a stroke of luck till you killed her son and a young girl who wont be above letting on afore you think it that your conciliatin her means sparkin her if instead of that foolishness youd turn your hand to trying to conciliate the folks here and keep em from going into that fools act of breaking up these united states if instead of digging up secondhand corpses thats already been put out of sight once youd set to work to try and prevent the folks about here from digging up their old cranks and their old whims and their old women fancies youd be doing something like a christian and a man whats yo bloodguiltinessid like to knowalongside of the bloodguiltiness of those fools who are just wild to rush into it led by such turkeycocks as yo friend colonel starbottle and youve been five years in californiaa free stateand thats all yo ve toted out of ita dead body there now dont sit there and swing yo hat under that chyar but rouse out and come along with me to the pawty if you can shake a foot and show miss pinkney and the gyrls yo fit for something mo than to skirmish round as a black japanned spittoon for julia jeffcourt it is not recorded that corbin accepted this cheerful invitation but for a few days afterwards he was more darkly observant of and respectful to miss sally strange indeed if he had not noticedalthough always in his resigned fashionthe dull green stagnation of the life around him or when not accepting it as part of his trouble he had not chafed at the arrested youth and senile childishness of the people stranger still if he had not at times been startled to hear the outgrown superstitions and follies of his youth voiced again by grownup men and perhaps strangest of all if he had not vaguely accepted it all as the hereditary curse of that barbarism under which he himself had survived and suffered  the reconciliation between himself and mrs jeffcourt was superficially effected so far as a daily visit by him to the house indicated it to the community but it was also known that julia was invariably absent on these occasions what happened at those interviews did not transpire but it may be surmised that mrs jeffcourt perhaps recognizing the fact that corbin was really giving her all that he had to give or possibly having some lurking fear of colonel starbottle was so far placated as to exhibit only the average ingratitude of her species towards a regular benefactor she consented to the erection of a small obelisk over her sons grave and permitted corbin to plant a few flowering shrubs which he daily visited and took care of it is said that on one of these pilgrimages he encountered miss julia apparently on the same errand who haughtily retired it was further alleged on the authority of one of mammy judys little niggers that those two black mourning figures had been seen at nightfall sitting opposite to each other at the head and foot of the grave and glowerin at one another like two hants but when it was asserted on the same authority that their voices had been later overheard uplifted in some vehement discussion over the grave of the impassive dead great curiosity was aroused being pressed by the eager miss sally to repeat some words or any words he had heard them say the little witness glibly replied marse linkum lincoln and the souf and so for the time shipwrecked his testimony but it was recalled six months afterwards it was then that a pleasant spring day brought madness and enthusiasm to a majority of pineville and bated breath and awe to a few and it was known with the tidings that the south had appealed to arms that among those who had first responded to the call was joseph corbin an alleged union man who had however volunteered to take that place in her ranks which might have been filled by the man he had killed and then people forgot all about him    a year passed it was the same place the old familiar outlines of home and garden and landscape but seen now in the choking breathlessness of haste in the fitful changing flashes of life and motion around it in intervals of sharp suspense or dazed bewilderment it seemed to be recognized no longer men who had known it all their lives hurrying to the front in compact masses scurrying to the rear in straggling line or opening their ranks to let artillery gallop by stared at it vaguely and clattered or scrambled on again the smoke of a masked battery in the woods struggled and writhed to free itself from the clinging treetops behind it and sank back into a gray encompassing cloud the dust thrown up by a column of passing horse poured over the wall in one long wave and whitened the garden with its ashes throughout the dim empty house one no longer heard the sound of cannon only a dull intermittent concussion was felt silently bringing flakes of plaster from the walls or sliding fragments of glass from the shattered windows a shell lifted from the ominous distance hung uncertain in the air and then descended swiftly through the roof the whole house dilated with flame for an instant smoke rolled slowly from the windows and even the desolate chimneys started into a hideous mockery of life and then all was still again at such awful intervals the sun shone out brightly touched the green of the still sleeping woods and the red and white of a flower in the garden and something in a gray uniform writhed out of the dust of the road staggered to the wall and died  a mile down this road growing more and more obscure with those rising and falling apparitions or the shapeless and rugged heaps terrible in their helpless inertia by hedge and fence arose the cemetery hill taken and retaken thrice that afternoon the dead above it far outnumbered the dead below and when at last the tide of battle swept around its base into the dull reverberating woods and it emerged from the smoke silenced and abandoned only a few stragglers remained one of them leaning on his musket was still gloomily facing the woods  joseph corbin said a low hurried voice  he started and glanced quickly at the tombs around him perhaps it was because he had been thinking of the deadbut the voice sounded like his yet it was only the sister who had glided pale and haggard from the thicket  they are coming through the woods she said quickly run or youll be taken why do you linger  you know why he said gloomily  yes but you have done yo duty you have done his work the task is finished now and yo free  he did not reply but remained gazing at the woods  joseph she said more gently laying her trembling hand on his arm joseph flyandtake me with you for i was wrong and i want you to forgive me i knew your heart was not in this and i ought not to have asked you josephlisten i never wanted to avenge myself nor him when i spat on your face i wanted to avenge myself on her i hated her because i thought she wanted to work upon you and use you for herself  your mother he said looking at her  no she said with widely opened eyes you know who i meanmiss sally  he looked at her wonderingly for a moment but quickly bent his head again in the direction of the road they are coming he said starting you must go this is no place for you stop its too late you cannot go now until they have passed come herecrouch down hereover this graveso  he almost forced herkneeling downupon the mound below the level of the shrubs and then ran quickly himself a few paces lower down the hill to a more exposed position she understood it he wished to attract attention to himself he was successfula few hurried shots followed from the road but struck above him  he clambered back quickly to where she was still crouching  they were the vedettes he said but they have fallen back on the main skirmish line and will be here in force in a moment gowhile you can she had not moved he tried to raise herher hat fell offhe saw blood oozing from where the vedettes bullet that had missed him had pierced her brain  and yet he saw in that pale dead face only the other face which he remembered now had been turned like this towards his own it was very strange and this was the end and this was his expiation he raised his own face humbly blindly despairingly to the inscrutable sky it looked back upon him from above as coldly as the dead face had from below  yet out of this he struck a faint idea that he voiced aloud in nearly the same words which he had used to colonel starbottle only three years ago it was with his own pistol too he said and took up his musket  he walked deliberately down the hill occasionally trying the stock of his musket in the loose earth and at last suddenly remained motionless in the attitude of leaning over it at the same moment there was a distant shout two thin parallel streams of blue and steel came issuing through the woods like a river appeared to join tumultuously in the open before the hill and out of the tumult a mounted officer called upon him to surrender  he did not reply  come down from there johnny reb i want to speak to you called a young corporal  he did not move  its time to go home johnny  no response  the officer who had been holding down his men with an unsworded but masterful hand raised it suddenly a dozen shots followed the men leaped forward and dashing corbin contemptuously aside streamed up the hill past him  but he had neither heard nor cared for they found he had already deliberately transfixed himself through the heart on his own bayonet     the postmistress of laurel run   chapter i   the mail stage had just passed laurel runso rapidly that the whirling cloud of dust dragged with it down the steep grade from the summit hung over the level long after the stage had vanished and then drifting away slowly sifted a red precipitate over the hot platform of the laurel run postoffice  out of this cloud presently emerged the neat figure of the postmistress with the mailbag which had been dexterously flung at her feet from the top of the passing vehicle a dozen loungers eagerly stretched out their hands to assist her but the warning its agin the rules boys for any but her to touch it from a bystander and a coquettish shake of the head from the postmistress herselfmuch more effective than any official interdictwithheld them the bag was not heavylaurel run was too recent a settlement to have attracted much correspondenceand the young woman having pounced upon her prey with a certain feline instinct dragged it not without difficulty behind the partitioned inclosure in the office and locked the door her pretty face momentarily visible through the window was slightly flushed with the exertion and the loose ends of her fair hair wet with perspiration curled themselves over her forehead into tantalizing little rings but the window shutter was quickly closed and this momentary but charming vision withdrawn from the waiting public  guvment oughter have more sense than to make a woman pick mailbags outer the road said jo simmons sympathetically taint in her days work anyhow guvmont oughter hand em over to her like a lady its rich enough and ugly enough  taint guvment its that stage companys airs and graces interrupted a newcomer they think it mighty fine to go beltin by makin everybody take their dust just because stoppin aint in their contract why if that expressman who chucked down the bag had any feelins for a ladybut he stopped here at the amused faces of his auditors  guess you dont know much o that expressmans feelins stranger said simmons grimly why you oughter see him just nussin that bag like a baby as he comes tearin down the grade and then rise up and sorter heave it to mrs baker ez if it was a fivedollar bokay his feelins for her why hes give himself so dead away to her that were looking for him to forget what hes doin next and just come sailin down hisself at her feet  meanwhile on the other side of the partition mrs baker had brushed the red dust from the padlocked bag and removed what seemed to be a supplementary package attached to it by a wire opening it she found a handsome scentbottle evidently a superadded gift from the devoted expressman this she put aside with a slight smile and the murmured word foolishness but when she had unlocked the bag even its sacred interior was also profaned by a covert parcel from the adjacent postmaster at burnt ridge containing a gold specimen brooch and some circus tickets it was laid aside with the other this also was vanity andpresumablyvexation of spirit  there were seventeen letters in all of which five were for herselfand yet the proportion was small that morning two of them were marked official business and were promptly put by with feminine discernment but in another compartment than that holding the presents then the shutter was opened and the task of delivery commenced  it was accompanied with a social peculiarity that had in time become a habit of laurel run as the young woman delivered the letters in turn to the men who were patiently drawn up in indian file she made that simple act a medium of privileged but limited conversation on special or general topicsgay or serious as the case might be or the temperament of the man suggested that it was almost always of a complimentary character on their part may be readily imagined but it was invariably characterized by an element of refined restraint and whether from some implied understanding or individual sense of honour it never passed the bounds of conventionality or a certain delicacy of respect the delivery was consequently more or less protracted but when each man had exchanged his three or four minutes conversation with the fair postmistressa conversation at times impeded by bashfulness or timidity on his part solely or restricted often to vague smilinghe resignedly made way for the next it was a formal levee mitigated by the informality of rustic tact great goodhumor and infinite patience and would have been amusing had it not always been terribly in earnest and at times touching for it was peculiar to the place and the epoch and indeed implied the whole history of mrs baker  she was the wife of john baker foreman of the last chance now for a year lying dead under half a mile of crushed and beatenin tunnel at burnt ridge there had been a sudden outcry from the depths at high hot noontide one day and john had rushed from his cabinhis young foolish flirting wife clinging to himto answer that despairing cry of his imprisoned men there was one exit that he alone knew which might be yet held open among falling walls and tottering timbers long enough to set them free for one moment only the strong man hesitated between her entreating arms and his brothers despairing cry but she rose suddenly with a pale face and said go john i will wait for you here he went the men were freedbut she had waited for him ever since  yet in the shock of the calamity and in the after struggles of that poverty which had come to the ruined camp she had scarcely changed but the men had although she was to all appearances the same giddy pretty betsy baker who had been so disturbing to the younger members they seemed to be no longer disturbed by her a certain subdued awe and respect as if the martyred spirit of john baker still held his arm around her appeared to have come upon them all they held their breath as this pretty woman whose brief mourning had not seemed to affect her cheerfulness or even playfulness of spirit passed before them but she stood by her cabin and the campthe only woman in a settlement of forty menduring the darkest hours of their fortune helping them to wash and cook and ministering to their domestic needs the sanctity of her cabin was however always kept as inviolable as if it had been his tomb no one exactly knew why for it was only a tacit instinct but even one or two who had not scrupled to pay court to betsy baker during john bakers life shrank from even a suggestion of familiarity towards the woman who had said that she would wait for him there  when brighter days came and the settlement had increased by one or two families and laggard capital had been hurried up to relieve the still beleaguered and lockedup wealth of burnt ridge the needs of the community and the claims of the widow of john baker were so well told in political quarters that the postoffice of laurel run was created expressly for her every man participated in the building of the pretty yet substantial edificethe only public building of laurel runthat stood in the dust of the great highway half a mile from the settlement there she was installed for certain hours of the day for she could not be prevailed upon to abandon johns cabin and here with all the added respect due to a public functionary she was secure in her privacy  but the blind devotion of laurel run to john bakers relict did not stop here in its zeal to assure the government authorities of the necessity for a postoffice and to secure a permanent competency to the postmistress there was much embarrassing extravagance during the first week the sale of stamps at laurel run postoffice was unprecedented in the annals of the department fancy prices were given for the first issue then they were bought wildly recklessly unprofitably and on all occasions complimentary congratulation at the little window invariably ended with and a dollars worth of stamps mrs baker it was felt to be supremely delicate to buy only the highest priced stamps without reference to their adequacy then mere quantity was sought then outgoing letters were all overpaid and stamped in outrageous proportion to their weight and even size the imbecility of this and its probable effect on the reputation of laurel run at the general postoffice being pointed out by mrs baker stamps were adopted as local currency and even for decorative purposes on mirrors and the walls of cabins everybody wrote letters with the result however that those sent were ludicrously and suspiciously in excess of those received to obviate this select parties made forced journeys to hickory hill the next postoffice with letters and circulars addressed to themselves at laurel run how long the extravagance would have continued is not known but it was not until it was rumored that in consequence of this excessive flow of business the department had concluded that a postmaster would be better fitted for the place that it abated and a compromise was effected with the general office by a permanent salary to the postmistress  such was the history of mrs baker who had just finished her afternoon levee nodded a smiling goodby to her last customer and closed her shutter again then she took up her own letters but before reading them glanced with a pretty impatience at the two official envelopes addressed to herself which she had shelved they were generally a lot of new rules or notifications or absurd questions which had nothing to do with laurel run and only bothered her and made her head ache and she had usually referred them to her admiring neighbor at hickory hill for explanation who had generally returned them to her with the brief indorsement purp stuff dont bother or hog wash let it slide she remembered now that he had not returned the last two with knitted brows and a slight pout she put aside her private correspondence and tore open the first one it referred with official curtness to an unanswered communication of the previous week and was compelled to remind her of rule 47 again those horrid rules she opened the other the frown deepened on her brow and became fixed  it was a summary of certain valuable money letters that had miscarried on the route and of which they had given her previous information for a moment her cheeks blazed how dare they what did they mean her waybills and register were always right she knew the names of every man woman and child in her district no such names as those borne by the missing letters had ever existed at laurel run no such addresses had ever been sent from laurel run postoffice it was a mean insinuation she would send in her resignation at once she would get the boys to write an insulting letter to senator slocumbmrs baker had the feminine idea of government as a purely personal institutionand she would find out who it was that had put them up to this prying crawling impudence it was probably that walleyed old wife of the postmaster at heavy tree crossing who was jealous of her remind her of their previous unanswered communication indeed where was that communication anyway she remembered she had sent it to her admirer at hickory hill odd that he hadnt answered it of course he knew about this meannesscould he too have dared to suspect her the thought turned her crimson again he stanton green was an old laurel runner a friend of johns a little triflin and presoomin but still an old loyal pioneer of the camp why hadnt he spoke up  there was the soft muffled fall of a horses hoof in the thick dust of the highway the jingle of dismounting spurs and a firm tread on the platform no doubt one of the boys returning for a few supplemental remarks under the feeble pretense of forgotten stamps it had been done before and she had resented it as cayotin round but now she was eager to pour out her wrongs to the first comer she had her hand impulsively on the door of the partition when she stopped with a new sense of her impaired dignity could she confess this to her worshipers but here the door opened in her very face and a stranger entered  he was a man of fifty compactly and strongly built a squarelycut goatee slightly streaked with gray fell straight from his thinlipped but handsome mouth his eyes were dark humorous yet searching but the distinctive quality that struck mrs baker was the blending of urban ease with frontier frankness he was evidently a man who had seen cities and knew countries as well and while he was dressed with the comfortable simplicity of a californian mounted traveler her inexperienced but feminine eye detected the keynote of his respectability in the carefullytied bow of his cravat the sierrean throat was apt to be open free and unfettered  goodmorning mrs baker he said pleasantly with his hat already in his hand im harry home of san francisco as he spoke his eye swept approvingly over the neat inclosure the primlytied papers and wellkept pigeonholes the pot of flowers on her desk her chinasilk mantle and killing little chip hat and ribbons hanging against the wall thence to her own pink flushed face bright blue eyes tendriled clinging hair and thenfell upon the leathern mailbag still lying across the table here it became fixed on the unfortunate wire of the amorous expressman that yet remained hanging from the brass wards of the lock and he reached his hand toward it  but little mrs baker was before him and had seized it in her arms she had been too preoccupied and bewildered to resent his first intrusion behind the partition but this last familiarity with her sacred official propertyalbeit emptycapped the climax of her wrongs  how dare you touch it she said indignantly how dare you come in here who are you anyway go outside at once  the stranger fell back with an amused deprecatory gesture and a long silent laugh im afraid you dont know me after all he said pleasantly im harry home the department agent from the san francisco office my note of advice no 201 with my name on the envelope seems to have miscarried too  even in her fright and astonishment it flashed upon mrs baker that she had sent that notice too to hickory hill but with it all the feminine secretive instinct within her was now thoroughly aroused and she kept silent  i ought to have explained he went on smilingly but you are quite right mrs baker he added nodding towards the bag as far as you knew i had no business to go near it glad to see you know how to defend uncle sams property so well i was only a bit puzzled to know pointing to the wire if that thing was on the bag when it was delivered to you  mrs baker saw no reason to conceal the truth after all this official was a man like the others and it was just as well that he should understand her power its only the expressmans foolishness she said with a slightly coquettish toss of her head he thinks it smart to tie some nonsense on that bag with the wire when he flings it down  mr home with his eyes on her pretty face seemed to think it a not inhuman or unpardonable folly as long as he doesnt meddle with the inside of the bag i suppose you must put up with it he said laughingly a dreadful recollection that the hickory hill postmaster had used the inside of the bag to convey his foolishness came across her it would never do to confess it now her face must have shown some agitation for the official resumed with a halfpaternal halfreassuring air but enough of this now mrs baker to come to my business here briefly then it doesnt concern you in the least except so far as it may relieve you and some others whom the department knows equally well from a certain responsibility and perhaps anxiety we are pretty well posted down there in all that concerns laurel run and i think with a slight bow weve known all about you and john baker my only business here is to take your place tonight in receiving the omnibus way bag that you know arrives here at 930 doesnt it  yes sir said mrs baker hurriedly but it never has anything for us exceptshe caught herself up quickly with a stammer as she remembered the sighing greens occasional offerings except a notification from hickory hill postoffice it leaves there she went on with an affectation of precision at half past eight exactly and its about an hours runseven miles by road  exactly said mr home well i will receive the bag open it and dispatch it again you can if you choose take a holiday  but said mrs baker as she remembered that laurel run always made a point of attending her evening levee on account of the superior leisure it offered there are the people who come for letters you know  i thought you said there were no letters at that time said mr home quickly  nobutbutwith a slight hysterical stammer the boys come all the same  oh said mr home dryly  ando lordbut here the spectacle of the possible discomfiture of laurel run at meeting the bearded face of mr home instead of her own smooth cheeks at the window combined with her nervous excitement overcame her so that throwing her little frilled apron over her head she gave way to a paroxym of hysterical laughter mr home waited with amused toleration for it to stop and when she had recovered resumed now i should like to refer an instant to my first communication to you have you got it handy  mrs bakers face fell no i sent it over to mr green of hickory hill for information  what  terrified at the sudden seriousness of the mans voice she managed to gasp out however that after her usual habit she had not opened the official letters but had sent them to her more experienced colleague for advice and information that she never could understand them herselfthey made her head ache and interfered with her other dutiesbut he understood them and sent her word what to do remembering also his usual style of indorsement she grew red again  and what did he say  nothing he didnt return them  naturally said mr home with a peculiar expression after a few moments silent stroking of his beard he suddenly faced the frightened woman  you oblige me mrs baker to speak more frankly to you than i had intended you haveunwittingly i believegiven information to a man whom the government suspects of peculation you have without knowing it warned the postmaster at hickory hill that he is suspected and as you might have frustrated our plans for tracing a series of embezzlements to their proper source you will see that you might have also done great wrong to yourself as his only neighbor and the next responsible person in plain words we have traced the disappearance of money letters to a point when it lies between these two offices now i have not the least hesitation in telling you that we do not suspect laurel run and never have suspected it even the result of your thoughtless act although it warned him confirms our suspicion of his guilt as to the warning it has failed or he has grown reckless for another letter has been missed since tonight however will settle all doubt in the matter when i open that bag in this office tonight and do not find a certain decoy letter in it which was last checked at heavy tree crossing i shall know that it remains in greens possession at hickory hill  she was sitting back in her chair white and breathless he glanced at her kindly and then took up his hat come mrs baker dont let this worry you as i told you at first you have nothing to fear even your thoughtlessness and ignorance of rules have contributed to show your own innocence nobody will ever be the wiser for this we do not advertise our affairs in the department not a soul but yourself knows the real cause of my visit here i will leave you here alone for a while so as to divert any suspicion you will come as usual this evening and be seen by your friends i will only be here when the bag arrives to open it goodby mrs baker its a nasty bit of business but its all in the days work ive seen worse and thank god youre out of it  she heard his footsteps retreat into the outer office and die out of the platform the jingle of his spurs and the hollow beat of his horses hoofs that seemed to find a dull echo in her own heart and she was alone  the room was very hot and very quiet she could hear the warping and creaking of the shingles under the relaxing of the nearly level sunbeams the office clock struck seven in the breathless silence that followed a woodpecker took up his interrupted work on the roof and seemed to beat out monotonously on her ear the last words of the stranger stanton greena thief stanton green one of the boys john had helped out of the falling tunnel stanton green whose old mother in the states still wrote letters to him at laurel run in a few hours to be a disgraced and ruined man forever she remembered now as a thoughtless woman remembers tales of his extravagance and fast living of which she had taken no heed and with a sense of shame of presents sent her that she now clearly saw must have been far beyond his means what would the boys say what would john have said ah what would john have done  she started suddenly to her feet white and cold as on that day that she had parted from john baker before the tunnel she put on her hat and mantle and going to that little iron safe that stood in the corner unlocked it and took out its entire contents of gold and silver she had reached the door when another idea seized her and opening her desk she collected her stamps to the last sheet and hurriedly rolled them up under her cape then with a glance at the clock and a rapid survey of the road from the platform she slipped from it and seemed to be swallowed up in the waiting woods beyond   chapter ii   once within the friendly shadows of the long belt of pines mrs baker kept them until she had left the limited settlement of laurel run far to the right and came upon an open slope of burnt ridge where she knew jo simmons mustang blue lightning would be quietly feeding she had often ridden him before and when she had detached the fiftyfoot reata from his headstall he permitted her the further recognized familiarity of twining her fingers in his bluish mane and climbing on his back the toolshed of burnt ridge tunnel where jos saddle and bridle always hung was but a canter farther on she reached it unperceived andanother trick of the old daysquickly extemporized a sidesaddle from simmons mexican tree with its high cantle and horn bow and the aid of a blanket then leaping to her seat she rapidly threw off her mantle tied it by its sleeves around her waist tucked it under one knee and let it fall over her horses flanks by this time blue lightning was also struck with a flash of equine recollection and pricked up his ears mrs baker uttered a little chirping cry which he remembered and the next moment they were both careering over the ridge  the trail that she had taken though precipitate difficult and dangerous in places was a clear gain of two miles on the stage road there was less chance of her being followed or meeting any one the greater canyons were already in shadow the pines on the farther ridges were separating their masses and showing individual silhouettes against the sky but the air was still warm and the cool breath of night as she well knew it had not yet begun to flow down the mountain the lower range of burnt ridge was still uneclipsed by the creeping shadow of the mountain ahead of her without a watch but with this familiar and slowly changing dial spread out before her she knew the time to a minute heavy tree hill a lesser height in the distance was already wiped out by that shadowy index fingerhalf past seven the stage would be at hickory hill just before half past eight she ought to anticipate it if possibleit would stay ten minutes to change horsesshe must arrive before it left  there was a good twomile level before the rise of the next range now blue lightning all you know and that was muchfor with the little chip hat and fluttering ribbons well bent down over the bluish mane and the streaming gauze of her mantle almost level with the horses back she swept down across the long tableland like a skimming bluejay a few more birdlike dips up and down the undulations and then came the long cruel ascent of the divide  acrid with perspiration caking with dust slithering in the slippery impalpable powder of the road groggily staggering in a red dusty dream coughing snorting headtossing becoming suddenly dejected with slouching haunch and limp legs on easy slopes or wildly spasmodic and agile on sharp acclivities blue lightning began to have ideas and recollections ah she was a devil for a larkthis lightlyclinging caressing blarneying cooing creatureup there he remembered her now ha very well then hoopla and suddenly leaping out like a rabbit bucking trotting hard ambling lightly loping on three legs and recreating himselfas only a california mustang couldthe invincible blue lightning at last stood triumphantly upon the summit the evening star had just pricked itself through the golden mist of the horizon lineeight oclock she could do it now but here suddenly her first hesitation seized her she knew her horse she knew the trail she knew herselfbut did she know the man to whom she was riding a cold chill crept over her and then she shivered in a sudden blast it was night at last swooping down from the now invisible sierras and possessing all it touched but it was only one long descent to hickory hill now and she swept down securely on its wings halfpast eight the lights of the settlement were just ahead of herbut so too were the two lamps of the waiting stage before the postoffice and hotel  happily the lounging crowd were gathered around the hotel and she slipped into the postoffice from the rear unperceived as she stepped behind the partition its only occupanta goodlooking young fellow with a reddish mustacheturned towards her with a flush of delighted surprise but it changed at the sight of the white determined face and the brilliant eyes that had never looked once towards him but were fixed upon a large bag whose yawning mouth was still open and propped up beside his desk  where is the through money letter that came in that bag she said quickly  whatdoyoumean he stammered with a face that had suddenly grown whiter than her own  i mean that its a decoy checked at heavy tree crossing and that mr home of san francisco is now waiting at my office to know if you have taken it  the laugh and lie that he had at first tried to summon to mouth and lips never reached them for under the spell of her rigid truthful face he turned almost mechanically to his desk and took out a package  good god youve opened it already she cried pointing to the broken seal  the expression on her face more than anything she had said convinced him that she knew all he stammered under the new alarm that her despairing tone suggested yesi was owing some billsthe collector was waiting here for the money and i took something from the packet but i was going to make it up by next maili swear it  how much have you taken  only a trifle i  how much  a hundred dollars  she dragged the money she had brought from laurel run from her pocket and counting out the sum replaced it in the open package he ran quickly to get the sealing wax but she motioned him away as she dropped the package back into the mailbag no as long as the money is found in the bag the package may have been broken accidentally now burst open one or two of those other packages a littleso she took out a packet of letters and bruised their official wrappings under her little foot until the tape fastening was loosened now give me something heavy she caught up a brass twopound weight and in the same feverish but collected haste wrapped it in paper sealed it stamped it and addressing it in a large printed hand to herself at laurel hill dropped it in the bag then she closed it and locked it he would have assisted her but she again waved him away send for the expressman and keep yourself out of the way for a moment she said curtly  an attitude of weak admiration and foolish passion had taken the place of his former tremulous fear he obeyed excitedly but without a word mrs baker wiped her moist forehead and parched lips and shook out her skirt well might the young expressman start at the unexpected revelation of those sparkling eyes and that demurely smiling mouth at the little window  mrs baker  she put her finger quickly to her lips and threw a world of unutterable and enigmatical meaning into her mischievous face  theres a big san francisco swell takin my place at laurel tonight charley  yes maam  and its a pity that the omnibus way bag happened to get such a shaking up and banging round already coming here  eh  i say continued mrs baker with great gravity and dancing eyes that it would be just awful if that keerful city clerk found things kinder mixed up inside when he comes to open it i wouldnt give him trouble for the world charley  no maam it aint like you  so youll be particularly careful on my account  mrs baker said charley with infinite gravity if that bag should tumble off a dozen times between this and laurel hill ill hop down and pick it up myself  thank you shake  they shook hands gravely across the windowledge  and you aint going down with us mrs baker  of course not it wouldnt dofor i aint heredont you see  of course  she handed him the bag through the door he took it carefully but in spite of his great precaution fell over it twice on his way to the road where from certain exclamations and shouts it seemed that a like miserable mischance attended its elevation to the boot then mrs baker came back into the office and as the wheels rolled away threw herself into a chair and inconsistently gave way for the first time to an outburst of tears then her hand was grasped suddenly and she found green on his knees before her she started to her feet  dont move he said with weak hysteric passion but listen to me for gods sake i am ruined i know even though you have just saved me from detection and disgrace i have been mada fool to do what i have done i know but you do not know allyou do not know why i did ityou cannot think of the temptation that has driven me to it listen mrs baker i have been striving to get money honestly dishonestlyany way to look well in your eyesto make myself worthy of youto make myself rich and to be able to offer you a home and take you away from laurel run it was all for you it was all for love of you betsy my darling listen to me  in the fury outraged sensibility indignation and infinite disgust that filled her little body at that moment she should have been large imperious goddesslike and commanding but god is at times ironical with suffering womanhood she could only writhe her hand from his grasp with childish contortions she could only glare at him with eyes that were prettily and piquantly brilliant she could only slap at his detaining hand with a plump and velvety palm and when she found her voice it was high falsetto and all she could say was leave me be looney or ill scream  he rose with a weak confused laugh half of miserable affectation and half of real anger and shame  what did you come riding over here for then what did you take all this risk for why did you rush over here to share my disgracefor you are as much mixed up with this now as i amif you didnt calculate to share everything else with me what did you come here for then if not for me  what did i come here for said mrs baker with every drop of red blood gone from her cheek and trembling lip whatdidicome here for welli came here for john bakers sake john baker who stood between you and death at burnt ridge as i stand between you and damnation at laurel run mr green yes john baker lying under half of burnt ridge but more to me this day than any living man crawling over itininoh fatal climaxin a month o sundays what did i come here for i came here as john bakers livin wife to carry on dead john bakers work yes dirty work this time may be mr green but his work and for him onlyprecious thats what i came here for thats what i live for thats what im waiting forto be up to him and his work always thats mebetsy baker  she walked up and down rapidly tying her chip hat under her chin again then she stopped and taking her chamois purse from her pocket laid it sharply on the desk  stanton green dont be a fool rise up out of this and be a man again take enough out o that bag to pay what you owe govment send in your resignation and keep the rest to start you in an honest life elsewhere but light out o hickory hill afore this time tomorrow  she pulled her mantle from the wall and opened the door  you are going he said bitterly  yes either she could not hold seriousness long in her capricious little fancy or with feminine tact she sought to make the parting less difficult for him for she broke into a dazzling smile yes im goin to run blue lightning agin charley and that way bag back to laurel run and break the record    it is said that she did perhaps owing to the fact that the grade of the return journey to laurel run was in her favor and that she could avoid the long circuitous ascent to the summit taken by the stage or that owing to the extraordinary difficulties in the carriage of the way bagwhich had to be twice rescued from under the wheels of the stageshe entered the laurel run postoffice as the coach leaders came trotting up the hill mr home was already on the platform  youll have to ballast your next way bag boss said charley gravely as it escaped his clutches once more in the dust of the road or youll have to make a new contract with the company weve lost ten minutes in five miles over that bucking thing  home did not reply but quickly dragged his prize into the office scarcely noticing mrs baker who stood beside him pale and breathless as the bolt of the bag was drawn revealing its chaotic interior mrs baker gave a little sigh home glanced quickly at her emptied the bag upon the floor and picked up the broken and halffilled money parcel then he collected the scattered coins and counted them its all right mrs baker he said gravely hes safe this time  im so glad said little mrs baker with a hypocritical gasp  so am i returned home with increasing gravity as he took the coin for from all i have gathered this afternoon it seems he was an old pioneer of laurel run a friend of your husbands and i think more fool than knave he was silent for a moment clicking the coins against each other then he said carelessly did he get quite away mrs baker  im sure i dont know what youre talking about said mrs baker with a lofty air of dignity but a somewhat debasing color i dont see why i should know anything about it or why he should go away at all  well said mr home laying his hand gently on the widows shoulder well you see it might have occurred to his friends that the coins were marked that is no doubt the reason why he would take their good advice and go but as i said before mrs baker youre all right whatever happensthe government stands by you     a night at hays   chapter i   it was difficult to say if hays farmhouse or hays as it was familiarly called looked any more bleak and cheerless that winter afternoon than it usually did in the strong summer sunshine painted a cold merciless white with scant projections for shadows a roof of whitepine shingles bleached lighter through sun and wind and covered with low whitecapped chimneys it looked even more stark and chilly than the drifts which had climbed its low roadside fence and yet seemed hopeless of gaining a foothold on the glancing walls or slippery windswept roof the storm which had already heaped the hollows of the road with snow hurled its finelygranulated flakes against the building but they were whirled along the gutters and ridges and disappeared in smokelike puffs across the icy roof the granite outcrop in the hilly field beyond had long ago whitened and vanished the dwarf firs and larches which had at first taken uncouth shapes in the drift blended vaguely together and then merged into an unbroken formless wave but the gaunt angles and rigid outlines of the building remained sharp and unchanged it would seem as if the rigors of winter had only accented their hardness as the fierceness of summer had previously made them intolerable  it was believed that some of this unyielding grimness attached to hays himself certain it is that neither hardship nor prosperity had touched his character years ago his emigrant team had broken down in this wild but wooded defile of the sierras and he had been forced to a winter encampment with only a rude logcabin for shelter on the very verge of the promised land unable to enter it himself he was nevertheless able to assist the betterequipped teams that followed him with wood and water and a coarse forage gathered from a sheltered slope of wild oats this was the beginning of a rude supply station which afterwards became so profitable that when spring came and hays team were sufficiently recruited to follow the flood of immigrating goldseekers to the placers and valleys there seemed no occasion for it his fortune had been already found in the belt of arable slope behind the wooded defile and in the miraculously located coign of vantage on what was now the great highway of travel and the only oasis and first relief of the weary journey the breaking down of his own team at that spot had not only been the salvation of those who found at hays the means of prosecuting the last part of their pilgrimage but later provided the equipment of returning teams  the first two years of this experience had not been without hardship and danger he had been raided by indians and besieged for three days in his stockaded cabin he had been invested by wintry drifts of twenty feet of snow cut off equally from incoming teams from the pass and the valley below during the second year his wife had joined him with four children but whether the enforced separation had dulled her conjugal affection or whether she was tempted by a natural feminine longing for the land of promise beyond she sought it one morning with a fascinating teamster leaving her two sons and two daughters behind her two years later the elder of the daughters followed the mothers example with such maidenly discretion however as to forbear compromising herself by any previous matrimonial formality whatever from that day hays had no further personal intercourse with the valley below he put up a hotel a mile away from the farmhouse that he might not have to dispense hospitality to his customers nor accept their near companionship always a severe presbyterian and an uncompromising deacon of a farscattered and scanty community who occasionally held their service in one of his barns he grew more rigid sectarian and narrow day by day he was feared and although neither respected nor loved his domination and endurance were accepted a grim landlord hard creditor closefisted patron and a smileless neighbor who neither gambled nor drank old hays as he was called while yet scarce fifty had few acquaintances and fewer friends there were those who believed that his domestic infelicities were the result of his unsympathetic nature it never occurred to any one but himself probably that they might have been the cause in those sierran altitudes as elsewhere the belief in original sinpopularly known as pure cussednessdominated and overbore any consideration of passive impelling circumstances or temptation unless they had been actively demonstrated with a revolver the passive expression of harshness suspicion distrust and moroseness was looked upon as inherent wickedness  the storm raged violently as hays emerged from the last of a long range of outbuildings and sheds and crossed the open space between him and the farmhouse before he had reached the porch with its scant shelter he had floundered through a snowdrift and faced the full fury of the storm but the snow seemed to have glanced from his hard angular figure as it had from his roofridge for when he entered the narrow hallway his pilot jacket was unmarked except where a narrow line of powdered flakes outlined the seams as if worn to the right was an apartment half office half sittingroom furnished with a dark and chilly iron safe a sofa and chairs covered with black and coldly shining horsehair here hays not only removed his upper coat but his under one also and drawing a chair before the fire sat down in his shirtsleeves it was his usual rustic pioneer habit and might have been some lingering reminiscence of certain remote ancestors to whom clothes were an impediment he was warming his hands and placidly ignoring his gaunt arms in their thinlyclad hickory sleeves when a young girl of eighteen sauntered half perfunctorily half inquisitively into the room it was his only remaining daughter already elected by circumstances to a dry household virginity her somewhat large features sallow complexion and tasteless unattractive dress did not obviously suggest a sacrifice since her sisters departure she had taken sole charge of her fathers domestic affairs and the few rude servants he employed with a certain inherited following of his own moods and methods to the neighbors she was known as miss haysa dubious respect that in a community of familiar sallies mamies pussies was grimly prophetic yet she rejoiced in the oriental appellation of zuleika to this it is needless to add that it was impossible to conceive any one who looked more decidedly western  ye kin put some things in my carpet bag agin the time the sled comes round said her father meditatively without looking up  then youre not coming back tonight asked the girl curiously whats goin on at the summit father  i am he said grimly you dont reckon i kalkilate to stop thar im going on as far as horseleys to close up that contract afore the weather changes  i kinder allowed it was funny youd go to the hotel tonight theres a dance there those two wetherbee girls and mamie harris passed up the road an hour ago on a woodsled nigh blown to pieces and sittin up in the snow like skeert white rabbits  hays brow darkened heavily  let em go he said in a hard voice that the fire did not seem to have softened let em go for all the good their foolparents will ever get outer them or the herd of wayside cattle theyve let them loose among  i reckon they havent much to do at home or are hard put for company to travel six miles in the snow to show off their prinkin to a lot of idle louts shiny with bears grease and scented up with doctors stuff added the girl shrugging her shoulders with a touch of her fathers mood and manner  perhaps it struck hays at that moment that her attitude was somewhat monstrous and unnatural for one still young and presumably like other girls for after glancing at her under his heavy brows he said in a gentler tone  never you mind zuly when your brother jack comes home hell know whats what and have all the proper new york ways and style its nigh on three years now that hes had the best training dr dawsons academy could givesayin nothing of the powful christian example of one of the best preachers in the states they maynt have worldly ungodly fandangoes where he is and riotous livin and scarlet abominations but ive been told that theyve tea circles and assemblies and harmony concerts of young folksand dancinyes fine square dancin under control no i aint stinted him in anythin you kin remember that zuleika when you hear any more gossip and backbitin about your fathers meanness i aint spared no money for him  i reckon not said the girl a little sharply why theres that draft fur two hundred and fifty dollars that kem only last week from the doctors fur extras  yes replied hays with a slight knitting of the brows the doctor mout hev writ more particklers but parsons aint allus business men i reckon these here extrys were to push jack along in the term as the doctor knew i wanted him back here in the spring now that his brother has got to be too stiffnecked and selfopinionated to do his fathers work it seemed from this that there had been a quarrel between hays and his eldest son who conducted his branch business at sacramento and who had in a passion threatened to set up a rival establishment to his fathers and it was also evident from the manner of the girl that she was by no means a strong partisan of her father in the quarrel  youd better find out first how all the schoolin and trainin of jacks is goin to jibe with the ranch and if he aint been eddicated out of all knowledge of station business or keer for it new york aint hays ranch and these yer assemblies and harmony doins and their airs and graces may put him out of conceit with our plain ways i reckon ye didnt take that to mind when youve been hustlin round payin two hundred and fifty dollar drafts for jack and quollin with bijah i aint sayin nothin father only mebbe if bijah had had drafts and extrys flourished around him a little more mebbe hed have been more polite and not so rough spoken mebbe she continued with a little laugh even id be a little more in the style to suit master jack when he comes ef i had three hundred dollars worth of convent schoolin like mamie harris  yes and youd have only made yourself fair game for evry schemin lazy sport or counterjumper along the road from this to sacramento responded hays savagely  zuleika laughed again constrainedly but in a way that might have suggested that this dreadful contingency was still one that it was possible to contemplate without entire consternation as she moved slowly towards the door she stopped with her hand on the lock and said tentatively i reckon you wont be wantin any supper before you go youre almost sure to be offered suthin up at horseleys while if i have to cook you up suthin now and still have the mens regular supper to get at seven it makes all the expense of an extra meal  hays hesitated he would have preferred his supper now and had his daughter pressed him would have accepted it but economy which was one of zuleikas inherited instincts vaguely appearing to him to be a virtue interchangeable with chastity and abstemiousness was certainly to be encouraged in a young girl it hardly seems possible that with an eye single to the integrity of the larder she could ever look kindly on the blandishments of his sex or indeed be exposed to them he said simply dont cook for me and resumed his attitude before the fire as the girl left the room  as he sat there grim and immovable as one of the battered firedogs before him the wind in the chimney seemed to carry on a deepthroated dejected and confidential conversation with him but really had very little to reveal there were no haunting reminiscences of his married life in this room which he had always occupied in preference to the company or sittingroom beyond there were no familiar shadows of the past lurking in its corners to pervade his reverie when he did reflect which was seldom there was always in his mind a vague idea of a central injustice to which he had been subjected that was to be avoided by circuitous movement to be hidden by work but never to be surmounted and tonight he was going out in the storm which he could understand and fight as he had often done before and he was going to drive a bargain with a man like himself and get the better of him if he could as he had done before and another day would be gone and that central injustice which he could not understand would be circumvented and he would still be holding his own in the world and the god of israel whom he believed in and who was a hard but conscientious providence something like himself would assist him perhaps some day to the understanding of this same vague injustice which he was for some strange reason permitting but never more unrelenting and unsparing of others than when under conviction of sin himself and never more harsh and unforgiving than when fresh from the contemplation of the divine mercy he still sat there grimly holding his hand to a warmth that never seemed to get nearer his heart than that when his daughter reentered the room with his carpetbag  to rise put on his coat and overcoat secure a fur cap on his head by a woolen comforter covering his ears and twined round his throat and to rigidly offer a square and weatherbeaten cheek to his daughters dusty kiss did not apparently suggest any lingering or hesitation the sled was at the door which for a tumultuous moment opened on the storm and the white vision of a horse kneedeep in a drift and then closed behind him zuleika shot the bolt brushed some flakes of the invading snow from the mat and after frugally raking down the fire on the hearth her father had just quitted retired through the long passage to the kitchen and her domestic supervision  it was a few hours later supper had long past the hands had one by one returned to their quarters under the roof or in the adjacent lofts and zuleika and the two maids had at last abandoned the kitchen for their bedrooms beyond zuleika herself by the light of a solitary candle had entered the office and had dropped meditatively into a chair as she slowly raked the warm ashes over the still smouldering fire the barking of dogs had momentarily attracted her attention but it had suddenly ceased it was followed however by a more startling incidenta slight movement outside and an attempt to raise the window  she was not frightened perhaps there was little for her to fear it was known that hays kept no money in the house the safe was only used for securities and contracts and there were half a dozen men within call it was therefore only her usual active burning curiosity for novel incident that made her run to the window and peer out but it was with a spontaneous cry of astonishment she turned and darted to the front door and opened it to the muffled figure of a young man  jack saints alive why of all things she gasped incoherently  he stopped her with an impatient gesture and a hand that prevented her from closing the door again  dad aint here he asked quickly  no  whenll he be back  not tonight  good he said turning to the door again she could see a motionless horse and sleigh in the road with a woman holding the reins  he beckoned to the woman who drove to the door and jumped out tall handsome and audacious she looked at zuleika with a quick laugh of confidence as at some recognized absurdity  go in there said the young man opening the door of the office ill come back in a minute  as she entered still smiling as if taking part in some humorous but risky situation he turned quickly to zuleika and said in a low voice where can we talk  the girl held out her hand and glided hurriedly through the passage until she reached a door which she opened by the light of a dying fire he could see it was her bedroom lighting a candle on the mantel she looked eagerly in his face as he threw aside his muffler and opened his coat it disclosed a spare youthful figure and a thin weak face that a budding mustache only seemed to make still more immature for an instant brother and sister gazed at each other astonishment on her part nervous impatience on his apparently repressed any demonstration of family affection yet when she was about to speak he stopped her roughly  there now dont talk i know what youre goin to saycould say it myself if i wanted toand its no use well then here i am you saw her well shes my wifeweve been married three months yes my wife married three months ago im here because i ran away from schoolthat is i havent been there for the last three months i came out with her last steamer we went up to the summit hotel last nightwhere they didnt know meuntil we could see how the land lay before popping down on dad i happened to learn that he was out tonight and i brought her down here to have a talk we can go back again before he comes you know unless  but interrupted the girl with sudden practicality you say you aint been at doctor dawsons for three months why only last week he drew on dad for two hundred and fifty dollars for your extras  he glanced around him and then arranged his necktie in the glass above the mantel with a nervous laugh  oh that i fixed that up and got the money for it in new york to pay our passage with its all right you know   chapter ii   the girl stood looking at the ingenious forger with an odd breathless smile it was difficult to determine however if gratified curiosity were not its most dominant expression  and youve got a wifeand thats her she resumed  yes  where did you first meet her who is she  shes an actressmighty popular in friscoi mean new york lot o chaps tried to get heri cut em out for all dads trying to keep me at dawsonsi aint such a fool eh  nevertheless as he stood there stroking his fair mustache his astuteness did not seem to impress his sister to enthusiastic assent yet she did not relax her breathless inquisitive smile as she went on  and what are you going to do about dad  he turned upon her querulously  well thats what i want to talk about  youll catch it she said impressively but here her brothers nervousness broke out into a weak impotent fury it was evident too that in spite of its apparent spontaneous irritation its intent was studied catch it would he oh yes well shed see whod catch it not him no hed had enough of this meanness and wanted it ended he wasnt a woman to be treated like his sisterlike their motherlike their brother if it came to that for he knew how he was to be brought back to take bijahs place in the spring hed heard the whole story no he was going to stand up for his rightshe was going to be treated as the son of a man who was worth half a million ought to be treated he wasnt going to be skimped while his father was wallowing in money that he didnt know what to do withmoney that by rights ought to have been given to their mother and their sister why even the law wouldnt permit such meannessif he was dead no hed come back with lottie his wife to show his father that there was one of the family that couldnt be fooled and bullied and wouldnt put up with it any longer there was going to be a fair division of the property and his sister annies property and herszuleikastoo if shed have the pluck to speak up for herself all this and much more he said yet even while his small fury was genuine and characteristic there was such an evident incongruity between himself and his speech that it seemed to fit him loosely and in a measure flapped in his gestures like anothers garment zuleika who had exhibited neither disgust nor sympathy with his rebellion but had rather appeared to enjoy it as a novel domestic performance the morality of which devolved solely upon the performer retained her curious smile and then a knock at the door startled them  it was the strangerslightly apologetic and still humorous but firm and selfconfident withal she was sorry to interrupt their family council but the fire was going out where she sat and she would like a cup of tea or some refreshment she did not look at jack but completely ignoring him addressed herself to zuleika with what seemed to be a direct challenge in that feminine eyegrapple there was a quick instinctive and final struggle between the two women the stranger triumphed zuleikas vacant smile changed to one of submission and then equally ignoring her brother in this double defeat she hastened to the kitchen to do the visitors bidding the woman closed the door behind her and took zuleikas place before the fire  well she said in a halfcontemptuous toleration  well said jack in an equally illdisguised discontent but an evident desire to placate the woman before him its all right you know ive had my say itll come right lottie youll see  the woman smiled again and glanced around the bare walls of the room  and i suppose she said drily when it comes right im to take the place of your sister in the charge of this workhouse and succeed to the keys of that safe in the other room  itll come all right i tell you you can fix things up here any way youll like when we get the old man straight said jack with the iteration of feebleness and as to that safe ive seen it chock full of securities  itll hold one less tonight she said looking at the fire  what are you talking about he asked in querulous suspicion  she drew a paper from her pocket  its that draft of yours that you were crazy enough to sign dawsons name to it was lying out there on the desk i reckon it isnt a thing you care to have kept as evidence even by your father  she held it in the flames until it was consumed  by jove your head is level lottie he said with an admiration that was not however without a weak reserve of suspicion  no it isnt or i wouldnt be here she said curtly then she added as if dismissing the subject well what did you tell her  oh i said i met you in new york you see i thought she might think it queer if she knew i only met you in san francisco three weeks ago of course i said we were married  she looked at him with weary astonishment  and of course whether things go right or not shell find out that ive got a husband living that i never met you in new york but on the steamer and that youve lied i dont see the use of it you said you were going to tell the whole thing squarely and say the truth and thats why i came to help you  yes but dont you see hang it all he stammered in the irritation of weak confusion i had to tell her something father wont dare to tell her the truth no more than he will the neighbors hell hush it up you bet and when we get this thing fixed youll go and get your divorce you know and well be married privately on the square  he looked so vague so immature yet so fatuously selfconfident that the woman extended her hand with a laugh and tapped him on the back as she might have patted a dog then she disappeared to follow zuleika in the kitchen  when the two women returned together they were evidently on the best of terms so much so that the man with the easy reaction of a shallow nature became sanguine and exalted even to an ostentatious exhibition of those new york graces on which the paternal hays had set such store he complacently explained the methods by which he had deceived dr dawson how he had himself written a letter from his father commanding him to return to take his brothers place and how he had shown it to the doctor and been three months in san francisco looking for work and assisting lottie at the theatre until a conviction of the righteousness of his cause perhaps combined with the fact that they were also short of money and she had no engagement impelled him to his present heroic step all of which zuleika listened to with childish interest but superior appreciation of his companion the fact that this woman was an actress an abomination vaguely alluded to by her father as being even more mysteriously wicked than her sister and mother and correspondingly exciting as offering a possible permanent relief to the monotony of her home life seemed to excuse her brothers weakness she was almost ready to become his partisanafter she had seen her father  they had talked largely of their plans they had settled small details of the future and the arrangement of the property they had agreed that zuleika should be relieved of her household drudgery and sent to a fashionable school in san francisco with a music teacher and a dressmaker they had discussed everything but the precise manner in which the revelation should be conveyed to hays there was still plenty of time for that for he would not return until tomorrow at noon and it was already tacitly understood that the vehicle of transmission should be a letter from the summit hotel the possible contingency of a sudden outburst of human passion not entirely controlled by religious feeling was to be guarded against  they were sitting comfortably before the replenished fire the wind was still moaning in the chimney when suddenly in a lull of the storm the sound of sleighbells seemed to fill the room it was followed by a voice from without and with a hysterical cry zuleika started to her feet the same breathless smile with which she had greeted her brother an hour ago was upon her lips as she gasped  lord save usbut its dad come back  i grieve to say that here the doughty redresser of domestic wrongs and retriever of the family honor lapsed whitefaced in his chair idealess and tremulous it was his frailer companion who rose to the occasion and even partly dragged him with her go back to the hotel she said quickly and take the sled with youyou are not fit to face him now but he does not know me and i will stay to the staring zuleika i am a stranger stopped by a broken sleigh on my way to the hotel leave the rest to me now clear out both of you ill let him in  she looked so confident selfcontained and superior that the thought of opposition never entered their minds and as an impatient rapping rose from the door they let her with a halfimpatient halflaughing gesture drive them before her from the room when they had disappeared in the distance she turned to the front door unbolted and opened it hays blundered in out of the snow with a muttered exclamation and then as the light from the open office door revealed a stranger started and fell back  miss hays is busy said the woman quietly i am afraid on my account but my sleigh broke down on the way to the hotel and i was forced to get out here i suppose this is mr hays  a strange womanby her dress and appearance a very worldlingand even braver in looks and apparel than many he had seen in the citiesseemed in spite of all his precautions to have fallen short of the hotel and been precipitated upon him yet under the influence of some odd abstraction he was affected by it less than he could have believed he even achieved a rude bow as he bolted the door and ushered her into the office more than that he found himself explaining to the fair trespasser the reasons of his return to his own home for like a direct man he had a consciousness of some inconsistency in his returnor in the circumstances that induced a change of plans which might conscientiously require an explanation  you see maam a rather singular thing happened to me after i passed the summit three times i lost the track got off it somehow and found myself traveling in a circle the third time when i struck my own tracks again i concluded id just follow them back here i suppose i might have got the road again by tryin and fightin the snowbut thers some things not worth the fightin this was a matter of business and after all maam business aint everythin is it  he was evidently in some unusual mood the mood that with certain reticent natures often compels them to make their brief confidences to utter strangers rather than impart them to those intimate friends who might remind them of their weakness she agreed with him pleasantly but not so obviously as to excite suspicion and you preferred to let your business go and come back to the comfort of your own home and family  the comfort of my home and family he repeated in a dry deliberate voice well i reckon i aint been tempted much by that that isnt what i meant but he went back to the phrase repeating it grimly as if it were some mandatory text the comfort of my own home and family well satan hasnt set that trap for my feet yet maam no ye saw my daughter well thats all my family ye see this room thats all my home my wife ran away from me my daughter cleared out too my eldest son as was with me here has quolled with me and reckons to set up a rival business agin me no he said still more meditatively and deliberately it wasnt to come back to the comforts of my own home and family that i faced round on heavy tree hill i reckon  as the woman for certain reasons had no desire to check this auspicious and unlooked for confidence she waited patiently hays remained silent for an instant warming his hands before the fire and then looked up interrogatively  a professor of religion maam or under conviction  not exactly said the lady smiling  excuse me but in spite of your fine clothes i reckoned you had a serious look just now a reader of scripture may be  i know the bible  you remember when the angel with the flamin sword appeared unto saul on the road to damascus  yes  it mout hev been suthin in that style that stopped me he said slowly and tentatively though natrally i didnt see anything and only had the queer feelin it might hev been that shied my mare off the track  but saul was up to some wickedness wasnt he said the lady smilingly while you were simply going somewhere on business  yes said hays thoughtfully but my business might hev seemed like persecution i dont mind tellin you what it was if youd care to listen but mebbe youre tired mebbe you want to retire you know he went on with a sudden hospitable outburst you neednt be in any hurry to go we kin take care of you here tonight and itll cost you nothin and ill send you on with my sleigh in the mornin peraps youd like suthin to eata cup of teaorill call zuleika and he rose with an expression of awkward courtesy  but the lady albeit with a selfsatisfied sparkle in her dark eyes here carelessly assured him that zuleika had already given her refreshment and indeed was at that moment preparing her own room for her she begged he would not interrupt his interesting story  hays looked relieved  well i reckon i wont call her for what i was goin to say aint exackly the sort o thin for an innocent simple sort o thing like her to heari mean he interrupted himself hastilythat folks of more experience of the world like you and me dont mind speakin ofim sorter takin it for granted that youre a married woman maam  the lady who had regarded him with a sudden rigidity here relaxed her expression and nodded  well continued hays resuming his place by the fire you see this yer man i was goin to see lives about four miles beyond the summit on a ranch that furnishes most of the hay for the stock that side of the divide hes bin holdin off his next years contracts with me hopin to make better terms from the prospects of a late spring and higher prices he held his head mighty high and talked big of waitin his own time i happened to know he couldnt do it  he put his hands on his knees and stared at the fire and then went on  ye see this man had had crosses and family trials he had a wife that left him to jine a lot of bally dancers and painted women in the frisco playhouses when he was livin in the southern country youll say that was like my own caseand mebbe that was why it came to him to tell me about itbut the difference betwixt him and me was that instead of restin unto the lord and findin him and pluckin out the eye that offended him cordin to scripter as i did he followed after her tryin to get her back until findin that wasnt no use he took a big disgust and came up here to hide hisself where there wasnt no playhouse nor playactors and no wimmen but injin squaws he preempted the land and natrally there bein no one ez cared to live there but himself he had it all his own way made it pay and as i was sayin before held his head high for prices wellyou aint gettin tired maam  no said the lady resting her cheek on her hand and gazing on the fire its all very interesting and so odd that you two men with nearly the same experiences should be neighbors  say buyer and seller maam not neighborsat least scriptoorilynor friends wellnow this is where the speshal providence comes inonly this afternoon jim briggs hearin me speak of horseleys offishness  whose offishness asked the lady  horseleys offishnesshorseleys the name of the man im talkin about well hearin that he says you hold on hays and hell climb down that wife of his has left the stagegot sick of itand is driftin round in frisco with some fellow when horseley gets to hear that you cant keep him herehell settle up sell out and realize on everything hes got to go after her aginyou bet thats what briggs said well thats what sent me up to horseleys tonightto get there drop the news and then pin him down to that contract  it looked like a good stroke of business and a fair one said the lady in an odd voice it was so odd that hays looked up but she had somewhat altered her position and was gazing at the ceiling and with her hand to her face seemed to have just recovered from a slight yawn at which he hesitated with a new and timid sense of politeness  youre gettin tired maam  oh dear no she said in the same voice but clearing her throat with a little cough and why didnt you see this mr horseley after all oh i forgotyou said you changed your mind from something youd heard  he had turned his eyes to the fire again but without noticing as he did so that she slowly moved her face still half hidden by her hand towards him and was watching him intently  no he said slowly nothin i heard somethin i felt it mout hev been that that set me off the track it kem to me all of a sudden that he might be sittin thar calm and peaceful like ez i might be here hevin forgot all about her and his trouble and here was me goin to drop down upon him and start it all fresh agin it looked a little like persecutionyes like persecution i got rid of it sayin to myself it was business but id got off the road meantime and had to find it again and whenever i got back to the track and was pointed for his house it all seemed to come back on me and set me off agin when that had happened three times i turned round and started for home  and do you mean to say said the lady with a discordant laugh that you believe because you didnt go there and break the news that nobody else will that he wont hear of it from the first man he meets  he dont meet any one up where he lives and only briggs and myself know it and ill see that briggs dont tell but it was mighty queer this whole thing comin upon me suddenlywasnt it  very queer replied the lady forwith the same metallic laughyou dont seem to be given to this kind of weakness with your own family  if there was any doubt as to the sarcastic suggestion of her voice there certainly could be none in the wicked glitter of her eyes fixed upon his face under her shading hand but haply he seemed unconscious of both and even accepted her statement without an ulterior significance  yes he said communingly to the glaring embers of the hearth it must have been a special revelation  there was something so fatuous and oneidead in his attitude and expression so monstrously inconsistent and inadequate to what was going on around him and so hopelessly stupidif a mere simulationthat the angry suspicion that he was acting a part slowly faded from her eyes and a hysterical smile began to twitch her set lips she still gazed at him the wind howled drearily in the chimney all that was economic grim and cheerless in the room seemed to gather as flitting shadows around that central figure suddenly she arose with such a quick rustling of her skirts that he lifted his eyes with a start for she was standing immediately before him her hands behind her her handsome audacious face bent smilingly forward and her bold brilliant eyes within a foot of his own  now mr hays do you want to know what this warning or special revelation of yours really meant well it had nothing whatever to do with that man on the summit no the whole interest gist and meaning of it was simply this that you should turn round and come straight back here andshe drew back and made him an exaggerated theatrical curtseyhave the supreme pleasure of making my acquaintance that was all and now as youve had it in five minutes i must be off youve offered me already your horse and sleigh to go to the summit i accept it and go goodby  he knew nothing of a womans coquettish humor he knew still less of that mimic stage from which her present voice gesture and expression were borrowed he had no knowledge of the burlesque emotions which that voice gesture and expression were supposed to portray and finally and fatally he was unable to detect the feminine hysteric jar and discord that underlay it all he thought it was strong characteristic and real and accepted it literally he rose  ef you allow you cant stay why ill go and get the horse i reckon he aint bin put up yet  do please  he grimly resumed his coat and hat and disappeared through the passage into the kitchen whence a moment later zuleika came flying  well what has happened she said eagerly  its all right said the woman quickly though he knows nothing yet but ive got things fixed generally so that hell be quite ready to have it broken to him by this time tomorrow but dont you say anything till ive seen jack and you hear from him remember  she spoke rapidly her cheeks were quite glowing from some sudden energy so were zuleikas with the excitement of curiosity presently the sound of sleighbells again filled the room it was hays leading the horse and sleigh to the door beneath a sky now starlit and crisp under a northeast wind the fair stranger cast a significant glance at zuleika and whispered hurriedly you know he must not come with me you must keep him here  she ran to the door muffled and hooded leaped into the sleigh and gathered up the reins  but you cannot go alone said hays with awkward courtesy i was kalkilatin  youre too tired to go out again dad broke in zuleikas voice quickly you aint fit youre all gray and krinkly now like as when you had one of your last spells shell send the sleigh back tomorrow  i can find my way said the lady briskly theres only one turn off i believe and that  leads to the stage station three miles west you neednt be afraid of gettin off on that for youll likely see the down stage crossin your road ez soon ez you get clear of the ranch  goodnight said the lady an arc of white spray sprang before the forward runner and the sleigh vanished in the road  father and daughter returned to the office  you didnt get to know her dad did ye queried zuleika  no responded hays gravely except to see she wasnt no backwoods or mountaineering sort now theres the kind of woman zuly as knows her own mind and yours too that a man like your brother jack oughter pick out when he marries  zuleikas face beamed behind her father you aint goin to sit up any longer dad she said as she noticed him resume his seat by the fire its gettin late and you look mighty tuckered out with your nights work  do you know what she said zuly returned her father after a pause which turned out to have been a long silent laugh  no  she said he repeated slowly that she reckoned i came back here tonight to have the pleasure of her acquaintance he brought his two hands heavily down upon his knees rubbing them down deliberately towards his ankles and leaning forward with his face to the fire and a longsustained smile of complete though tardy appreciation  he was still in this attitude when zuleika left him the wind crooned over him confidentially but he still sat there given up apparently to some posthumous enjoyment of his visitors departing witticism  it was scarcely daylight when zuleika while dressing heard a quick tapping upon her shutter she opened it to the scared and bewildered face of her brother  what happened with her and father last night he said hoarsely  nothingwhy  read that it was brought to me half an hour ago by a man in dads sleigh from the stage station  he handed her a crumpled note with trembling fingers she took it and read  the games up and im out of it take my advice and clear out of it too until you can come back in better shape dont be such a fool as to try and follow me your father isnt one and thats where youve slipped up  he shall pay for it whatever hes done said her brother with an access of wild passion where is he  why jack you wouldnt dare to see him now  wouldnt i he turned and ran convulsed with passion before the windows towards the front of the house zuleika slipped out of her bedroom and ran to her fathers room he was not there already she could hear her brother hammering frantically against the locked front door  the door of the office was partly open her father was still there asleep yes for he had apparently sunk forward before the cold hearth but the hands that he had always been trying to warm were colder than the hearth or ashes and he himself never again spoke nor stirred    it was deemed providential by the neighbors that his youngest and favorite son alarmed by news of his fathers failing health had arrived from the atlantic states just at the last moment but it was thought singular that after the division of the property he entirely abandoned the ranch and that even pending the division his beautiful but fastidious eastern bride declined to visit it with her husband     johnsons old woman   it was growing dark and the sonora trail was becoming more indistinct before me at every step the difficulty had increased over the grassy slope where the overflow from some smaller watercourse above had worn a number of diverging gullies so like the trail as to be undistinguishable from it unable to determine which was the right one i threw the reins over the mules neck and resolved to trust to that superior animals sagacity of which i had heard so much but i had not taken into account the equally wellknown weaknesses of sex and species and chu chu had already shown uncontrollable signs of wanting her own way without a moments hesitation feeling the relaxed bridle she lay down and rolled over  in this perplexity the sound of horses hoofs ringing out of the rocky canyon beyond was a relief even if momentarily embarrassing an instant afterwards a horse and rider appeared cantering round the hill on what was evidently the lost trail and pulled up as i succeeded in forcing chu chu to her legs again  is that the trail from sonora i asked  yes but with a critical glance at the mule i reckon you aint going thar tonight  why not  its a matter of eighteen miles and most of it a blind trail through the woods after you take the valley  is it worse than this  whats the matter with this trail ye aint expecting a racecourse or a shell road over the foothillsare ye  no is there any hotel where i can stop  nary  nor any house  no  thank you goodnight  he had already passed on when he halted again and turned in his saddle look yer just a spell over yon canyon yell find a patch o buckeyes turn to the right and yell see a trail thatll take ye to a shanty you ask if its johnsons  whos johnson  i am you aint lookin for vanderbilt or god almighty up here are you well then you hark to me will you you say to my old woman to give you supper and a shakedown somewhar tonight say i sent you so long  he was gone before i could accept or decline an extraordinary noise proceeded from chu chu not unlike a suppressed chuckle i looked sharply at her she coughed affectedly and with her head and neck stretched to their greatest length appeared to contemplate her neat little off fore shoe with admiring abstraction but as soon as i had mounted she set off abruptly crossed the rocky canyon apparently sighted the patch of buckeyes of her own volition and without the slightest hesitation found the trail to the right and in half an hour stood before the shanty  it was a log cabin with an additional leanto of the same material roofed with bark and on the other side a larger and more ambitious extension built of rough unplaned and unpainted redwood boards lightly shingled the leanto was evidently used as a kitchen and the central cabin as a livingroom the barking of a dog as i approached called four children of different sizes to the open door where already an enterprising baby was feebly essaying to crawl over a bar of wood laid across the threshold to restrain it  is this johnsons house  my remark was really addressed to the eldest a boy of apparently nine or ten but i felt that my attention was unduly fascinated by the baby who at that moment had toppled over the bar and was calmly eyeing me upside down while silently and heroically suffocating in its petticoats the boy disappeared without replying but presently returned with a taller girl of fourteen or fifteen i was struck with the way that as she reached the door she passed her hands rapidly over the heads of the others as if counting them picked up the baby reversed it shook out its clothes and returned it to the inside without even looking at it the act was evidently automatic and habitual  i repeated my question timidly  yes it was johnsons but he had just gone to kings mills i replied hurriedly that i knew itthat i had met him beyond the canyon as i had lost my way and couldnt get to sonora tonight he had been good enough to say that i might stay there until morning my voice was slightly raised for the benefit of mr johnsons old woman who i had no doubt was inspecting me furtively from some corner  the girl drew the children away except the boy to him she said simply show the stranger whar to stake out his mule dolphus and disappeared in the extension without another word i followed my little guide who was perhaps more actively curious but equally unresponsive to my various questions he simply returned a smile of exasperating vacuity but he never took his eager eyes from me and i was satisfied that not a detail of my appearance escaped him leading the way behind the house to a little wood whose only clearing had been effected by decay or storm he stood silently apart while i picketed chu chu neither offering to assist me nor opposing any interruption to my survey of the locality there was no trace of human cultivation in the surroundings of the cabin the wilderness still trod sharply on the heels of the pioneers fresh footprints and even seemed to obliterate them for a few yards around the actual dwelling there was an unsavory fringe of civilization in the shape of castoff clothes empty bottles and tin cans and the adjacent thorn and elder bushes blossomed unwholesomely with bits of torn white paper and bleaching dishcloths this hideous circle never widened nature always appeared to roll back the intruding debris no bird nor beast carried it away no animal ever forced the uncleanly barrier civilization remained grimly trenched in its own exuvia the old terrifying girdle of fire around the hunters camp was not more deterring to curious night prowlers than this coarse and accidental outwork  when i regained the cabin i found it empty the doors of the leanto and extension closed but there was a stool set before a rude table upon which smoked a tin cup of coffee a tin dish of hot saleratus biscuit and a plate of fried beef there was something odd and depressing in this silent exclusion of my presence had johnsons old woman from some dark post of observation taken a dislike to my appearance or was this churlish withdrawal a peculiarity of sierran hospitality or was mrs johnson young and pretty and hidden under the restricting ban of johnsons jealousy or was she a deformed cripple or even a bedridden crone from the extension at times came a murmur of voices but never the accents of adult womanhood the gathering darkness relieved only by a dull glow from the smouldering logs in the adobe chimney added to my loneliness in the circumstances i knew i ought to have put aside the repast and given myself up to gloomy and pessimistic reflection but nature is often inconsistent and in that keen mountain air i grieve to say my physical and moral condition was not in that perfect accord always indicated by romancers i had an appetite and i gratified it dyspepsia and ethical reflections might come later i ate the saleratus biscuit cheerfully and was meditatively finishing my coffee when a gurgling sound from the rafters above attracted my attention i looked up under the overhang of the bark roof three pairs of round eyes were fixed upon me they belonged to the children i had previously seen who in the attitude of raphaels cherubs had evidently been deeply interested spectators of my repast as our eyes met an inarticulate giggle escaped the lips of the youngest  i never could understand why the shy amusement of children over their elders is not accepted as philosophically by its object as when it proceeds from an equal we fondly believe that when jones or brown laughs at us it is from malice ignorance or a desire to show his superiority but there is always a haunting suspicion in our minds that these little critics really see something in us to laugh at i however smiled affably in return ignoring any possible grotesqueness in my manner of eating in private  come here johnny i said blandly  the two elder ones a girl and a boy disappeared instantly as if the crowning joke of this remark was too much for them from a scraping and kicking against the log wall i judged that they had quickly dropped to the ground outside the younger one the giggler remained fascinated but ready to fly at a moments warning  come here johnny boy i repeated gently i want you to go to your mother please and tell her  but here the child who had been working its face convulsively suddenly uttered a lugubrious howl and disappeared also i ran to the front door and looked out in time to see the tallest girl who had received me walking away with it under her arm pushing the boy ahead of her and looking back over her shoulder not unlike a youthful shebear conducting her cubs from danger she disappeared at the end of the extension where there was evidently another door  it was very extraordinary it was not strange that i turned back to the cabin with a chagrin and mortification which for a moment made me entertain the wild idea of saddling chu chu and shaking the dust of that taciturn house from my feet but the ridiculousness of such an act to say nothing of its ingratitude as quickly presented itself to me johnson had offered me only food and shelter i could have claimed no more from the inn i had asked him to direct me to i did not reenter the house but lighting my last cigar began to walk gloomily up and down the trail with the outcoming of the stars it had grown lighter through a wind opening in the trees i could see the heavy bulk of the opposite mountain and beyond it a superior crest defined by a red line of forest fire which however cast no reflection on the surrounding earth or sky faint woodland currents of air still warm from the afternoon sun stirred the leaves around me with longdrawn aromatic breaths but these in time gave way to the steady sierran night wind sweeping down from the higher summits and rocking the tops of the tallest pines yet leaving the tranquillity of the dark lower aisles unshaken it was very quiet there was no cry nor call of beast or bird in the darkness the long rustle of the treetops sounded as faint as the faroff wash of distant seas nor did the resemblance cease there the closeset files of the pines and cedars stretching in illimitable ranks to the horizon were filled with the immeasurable loneliness of an ocean shore in this vast silence i began to think i understood the taciturnity of the dwellers in the solitary cabin  when i returned however i was surprised to find the tallest girl standing by the door as i approached she retreated before me and pointing to the corner where a common cot bed had been evidently just put up said ye can turn in thar only yell have to rouse out early when dolphus does the chores and was turning towards the extension again when i stopped her almost appealingly  one moment please can i see your mother  she stopped and looked at me with a singular expression then she said sharply  you know fust rate shes dead  she was turning away again but i think she must have seen my concern in my face for she hesitated but i said quickly i certainly understood your father that is mr johnson i added interrogatively to say thatthat i was to speak toi didnt like to repeat the exact phrasehis wife  i dont know what he was playin ye for she said shortly mar has been dead morn a year  but i persisted is there no grownup woman here  no  then who takes care of you and the children  i do  yourself and your fathereh  dad aint here two days running and then ony to sleep  and you take the entire charge of the house  yes and the log tallies  the log tallies  yes keep count and measure the logs that go by the slide  it flashed upon me that i had passed the slide or declivity on the hillside where logs were slipped down into the valley and i inferred that johnsons business was cutting timber for the mill  but youre rather young for all this work i suggested  im goin on sixteen she said gravely  indeed for the matter of that she might have been any age her face on which sunburn took the place of complexion was already hard and set but on a nearer view i was struck with the fact that her eyes which were not large were almost indistinguishable from the presence of the most singular eyelashes i had ever seen intensely black intensely thick and even tangled in their profusion they bristled rather than fringed her eyelids obliterating everything but the shining black pupils beneath which were like certain lustrous hairy mountain berries it was this woodland suggestion that seemed to uncannily connect her with the locality i went on playfully  thats not very oldbut tell medoes your father or did your father ever speak of you as his old woman  she nodded then you thought i was mar she said smiling  it was such a relief to see her worn face relax its expression of pathetic gravityalthough this operation quite buried her eyes in their black thickest hedge againthat i continued cheerfully it wasnt much of a mistake considering all you do for the house and family  then you didnt tell billy to go and be dead in the ground with mar as he lows you did she said half suspiciously yet trembling on the edge of a smile  no i had not but i admitted that my asking him to go to his mother might have been open to this dismal construction by a sensitive infant mind she seemed mollified and again turned to go  goodnight missyou know your father didnt tell me your real name i said  karline  goodnight miss karline  i held out my hand  she looked at it and then at me through her intricate eyelashes then she struck it aside briskly but not unkindly said quit foolin now as she might have said to one of the children and disappeared through the inner door not knowing whether to be amused or indignant i remained silent a moment then i took a turn outside in the increasing darkness listened to the now hurrying wind over the treetops reentered the cabin closed the door and went to bed  but not to sleep perhaps the responsibility towards these solitary children which johnson had so lightly shaken off devolved upon me as i lay there for i found myself imagining a dozen emergencies of their unprotected state with which the elder girl could scarcely grapple there was little to fear from depredatory man or beastdesperadoes of the mountain trail never stooped to ignoble burglary bear or panther seldom approached a cabinbut there was the chance of sudden illness fire the accidents that beset childhood to say nothing of the narrowing moral and mental effect of their isolation at that tender age it was scandalous in johnson to leave them alone  in the silence i found i could hear quite distinctly the sound of their voices in the extension and it was evident that caroline was putting them to bed suddenly a voice was upliftedher own she began to sing and the others to join her it was the repetition of a single verse of a wellknown lugubrious negro melody all the world am sad and dreary wailed caroline in a high headnote everywhere i roam oh darkieth lisped the younger girl in response how my heart growth weary far from the old folkth at hoome this was repeated two or three times before the others seemed to get the full swing of it and then the lines rose and fell sadly and monotonously in the darkness i dont know why but i at once got the impression that those motherless little creatures were under a vague belief that their performance was devotional and was really filling the place of an evening hymn a brief and indistinct kind of recitation followed by a dead silence broken only by the slow creaking of new timber as if the house were stretching itself to sleep too confirmed my impression then all became quiet again  but i was more wide awake than before finally i rose dressed myself and dragging my stool to the fire took a book from my knapsack and by the light of a guttering candle which i discovered in a bottle in the corner of the hearth began to read presently i fell into a doze how long i slept i could not tell for it seemed to me that a dreamy consciousness of a dog barking at last forced itself upon me so strongly that i awoke the barking appeared to come from behind the cabin in the direction of the clearing where i had tethered chu chu i opened the door hurriedly ran round the cabin towards the hollow and was almost at once met by the bulk of the frightened chu chu plunging out of the darkness towards me kept only in check by her reata in the hand of a blanketed shape slowly advancing with a gun over its shoulder out of the hollow before i had time to recover from my astonishment i was thrown into greater confusion by recognizing the shape as none other than caroline  without the least embarrassment or even selfconsciousness of her appearance she tossed the end of the reata to me with the curtest explanation as she passed by some prowling bear or catamount had frightened the mule i had better tether it before the cabin away from the wind  but i thought wild beasts never came so near i said quickly  mule meats mighty temptin said the girl sententiously and passed on i wanted to thank her i wanted to say how sorry i was that she had been disturbed i wanted to compliment her on her quiet midnight courage and yet warn her against recklessness i wanted to know whether she had been accustomed to such alarms and if the gun she carried was really a necessity but i could only respect her reticence and i was turning away when i was struck by a more inexplicable spectacle as she neared the end of the extension i distinctly saw the tall figure of a man moving with a certain diffidence and hesitation that did not however suggest any intention of concealment among the trees the girl apparently saw him at the same moment and slightly slackened her pace not more than a dozen feet separated them he said something that was inaudible to my earsbut whether from his hesitation or the distance i could not determine there was no such uncertainty in her reply however which was given in her usual curt fashion all right you can trapse along home now and turn in  she turned the corner of the extension and disappeared the tall figure of the man wavered hesitatingly for a moment and then vanished also but i was too much excited by curiosity to accept this unsatisfactory conclusion and hastily picketing chu chu a few rods from the front door i ran after him with an instinctive feeling that he had not gone far i was right a few paces distant he had halted in the same dubious lingering way hallo i said  he turned towards me in the like awkward fashion but with neither astonishment nor concern  come up and take a drink with me before you go i said if youre not in a hurry im alone here and since i have turned out i dont see why we mightnt have a smoke and a talk together  i dursnt  i looked up at the six feet of strength before me and repeated wonderingly dare not  she wouldnt like it he made a movement with his right shoulder towards the extension  who  miss karline  nonsense i said she isnt in the cabinyou wont see her come along he hesitated although from what i could discern of his bearded face it was weakly smiling  come  he obeyed following me not unlike chu chu i fancied with the same sense of superior size and strength and a slight whitening of the eye as if ready to shy at any moment at the door he backed then he entered sideways i noticed that he cleared the doorway at the top and the sides only by a hairs breadth  by the light of the fire i could see that in spite of his full first growth of beard he was youngeven younger than myselfand that he was by no means badlooking as he still showed signs of retreating at any moment i took my flask and tobacco from my saddlebags handed them to him pointed to the stool and sat down myself upon the bed  you live near here  yes he said a little abstractedly as if listening for some interruption at ten mile crossing  why thats two miles away  i reckon  then you dont live hereon the clearing  no i blong to the mill at ten mile  you were on your way home  no he hesitated looking at his pipe i kinder meander round here at this time when johnsons away to see if everythings goin straight  i seeyoure a friend of the family  deed no he stopped laughed looked confused and added apparently to his pipe that is a sorter friend not much shehe lowered his voice as if that potential personality filled the whole cabinwouldnt like it  then at night when johnsons away you do sentry duty round the house  yes sentry dooty thats ithe seemed impressed with the suggestionthats it sentry dooty youve struck it pardner  and how often is johnson away  bout two or three times a week on an average  but miss caroline appears to be able to take care of herself she has no fear  fear fear wasnt hangin round when she was born he paused no sir did ye ever look into them eyes  i hadnt on account of the lashes but i didnt care to say this and only nodded  there aint the created thing livin or dead that she cant stand straight up to and look at  i wondered if he had fancied she experienced any difficulty in standing up before that innocently goodhumored face but i could not resist saying  then i dont see the use of your walking four miles to look after her  i was sorry for it the next minute for he seemed to have awkwardly broken his pipe and had to bend down for a long time afterwards to laboriously pick up the smallest fragments of it at last he said cautiously  ye noticed them bits o flannin round the chillerns throats  i remembered that i had but was uncertain whether it was intended as a preventive of cold or a childs idea of decoration i nodded  thats their trouble one night when old johnson had been off for three days to coulterville i was prowling round here and i didnt git to see no one though there was a light burnin in the shanty all night the next night i was here againthe same light twinklin but no one about i reckoned that was mighty queer and i jess crep up to the house an listened i heard suthin like a little cough oncet in a while and at times suthin like a little moan i didnt durst to sing out for i knew she wouldnt like it but whistled keerless like to let the chillern know i was there but it didnt seem to take i was jess goin off whendarn my skinif i didnt come across the bucket of water id fetched up from the spring that mornin standin there full and never taken in when i saw that i reckoned id jess wade in anyhow and i knocked pooty soon the door was half opened and i saw her eyes blazin at me like them coals then she lowed id better git up and git and shet the door to then i lowed she might tell me what was upthrough the door then she said through the door as how the chillern lay all sick with that hossdistemper diphthery then she lowed shed use a doctor ef id fetch him then she lowed again id better take the baby that hadnt ketched it yet along with me and leave it where it was safe then she passed out the baby through the door all wrapped up in a blankit like a papoose and you bet i made tracks with it i knowed thar wasnt no good going to the mill so i let out for whites four miles beyond whar there was whites old mother i told her how things were pointin and she lent me a hoss and i jess rounded on doctor green at mountain jims and had him back here afore sunup and then i heard she wiltedregularly played out you seefor she had it all along wuss than the lot and never let on or whimpered  it was well you persisted in seeing her that night i said watching the rapt expression of his face he looked up quickly became conscious of my scrutiny and dropped his eyes again smiled feebly and drawing a circle in the ashes with the broken pipestem said  but she didnt like it though  i suggested a little warmly that if she allowed her father to leave her alone at night with delicate children she had no right to choose who should assist her in an emergency it struck me afterwards that this was not very complimentary to him and i added hastily that i wondered if she expected some young lady to be passing along the trail at midnight but this reminded me of johnsons style of argument and i stopped  yes he said meekly and ef she didnt keer enough for herself and her brothers and sisters she orter remember them beazeley chillern  beazeley children i repeated wonderingly  yes them two little ones the size of mirandy theyre beazeleys  who is beazeley and what are his children doing here  beazeley up and died at the mill and she bedevilled her father to let her take his two young uns here  you dont mean to say that with her other work shes taking care of other peoples children too  yes and eddicatin them  educating them  yes teachin them to read and write and do sums one of our loggers ketched her at it when she was keepin tally  we were both silent for some moments  i suppose you know johnson i said finally  not much  but you call here at other times than when youre helping her  never been in the house before  he looked slowly around him as he spoke raising his eyes to the bare rafters above and drawing a few long breaths as if he were inhaling the aura of some unseen presence he appeared so perfectly gratified and contented and i was so impressed with this humble and silent absorption of the sacred interior that i felt vaguely conscious that any interruption of it was a profanation and i sat still gazing at the dying fire presently he arose stretched out his hand shook mine warmly said i reckon ill meander along took another long breath this time secretly as if conscious of my eyes and then slouched sideways out of the house into the darkness again where he seemed suddenly to attain his full height and so looming disappeared i shut the door went to bed and slept soundly  so soundly that when i awoke the sun was streaming on my bed from the open door on the table before me my breakfast was already laid when i had dressed and eaten it struck by the silence i went to the door and looked out dolphus was holding chu chu by the reata a few paces from the cabin  wheres caroline i asked  he pointed to the woods and said over yon keeping tally  did she leave any message  said i was to git your mule for you  anything else  yes said you was to go  i went but not until i had scrawled a few words of thanks on a leaf of my notebook which i wrapped about my last spanish dollar addressed it to miss johnson and laid it upon the table    it was more than a year later that in the barroom of the mariposa hotel a hand was laid upon my sleeve i looked up it was johnson  he drew from his pocket a spanish dollar i reckoned he said cheerfully id run again ye somewhar some time my old woman told me to give ye that when i did and say that she didnt keep no hotel but she allowed shed keep the letter and has spelled it out to the chillern  here was the opportunity i had longed for to touch johnsons pride and affection in the brave but unprotected girl i want to talk to you about miss johnson i said eagerly  i reckon so he said with an exasperating smile most fellers do but she aint miss johnson no more shes married  not to that big chap over from ten mile mills i said breathlessly  whats the matter with him said johnson ye didnt expect her to marry a nobleman did ye  i said i didnt see why she shouldntand believed that she had     the new assistant at pine clearing school   chapter i   the schoolmistress of pine clearing was taking a last look around her schoolroom before leaving it for the day she might have done so with pride for the schoolroom was considered a marvel of architectural elegance by the citizens and even to the ordinary observer was a pretty villalike structure with an open cupola and overhanging roof of diamondshaped shingles and a deep elizabethan porch but it was the monument of a fierce struggle between a newer civilization and a barbarism of the old days which had resulted in the clearing away of the pinesand a few other things as incongruous to the new life and far less innocent though no less sincere it had cost the community fifteen thousand dollars and the lives of two of its citizens  happily there was no stain of this on the clean white walls the beautifullywritten gilt texts or the shining blackboard that had offered no record which could not be daily wiped away and certainly the last person in the world to suggest any reminiscences of its belligerent foundation was the person of the schoolmistress mature thin precisenot pretty enough to have excited homeric feuds nor yet so plain as to preclude certain soothing gracesshe was the widow of a poor congregational minister and had been expressly imported from san francisco to squarely mark the issue between the regenerate and unregenerate life lowvoiced gentlewomanly with the pallor of illhealth perhaps unduly accented by her mourning which was still cut modishly enough to show off her spare but good figure she was supposed to represent the model of pious scholastic refinement the oppositionsullen in ditches and at the doors of saloons or in the fields truculent as their own cattlenevertheless had lowered their crests and buttoned their coats over their revolutionary red shirts when she went by  as she was stepping from the threshold she was suddenly confronted by a brisk businesslooking man who was about to enter just in time to catch you mrs martin he said hurriedly then quickly correcting his manifest familiarity he added i mean i took the liberty of running in here on my way to the stage office that matter you spoke of is all arranged i talked it over with the other trustees wrote to sam barstow and hes agreeable and has sent somebody up and he rapidly consulted his watch he ought to be here now and im on my way to meet him with the other trustees  mrs martin who at once recognized her visitor as the chairman of the school board received the abrupt information with the slight tremulousness faint increase of color and hurried breathing of a nervous woman  but she said it was only a suggestion of mine mr sperry i really have no right to aski had no idea  its all right maamnever you mind we put the case square to barstow we allowed that the school was getting too large for you to tacklei mean you know to superintend singlehanded and that these pike county boys theyre running in on us are a little too big and sassy for a lady like you to lasso and throw downi mean to sorter controldont you see but bless you sam barstow saw it all in a minit he just jumped at it ive got his letter herehold onhe hastily produced a letter from his pocket glanced ever it suddenly closed it again with embarrassed quickness yet not so quickly but that the womans quicker eyes were caught and nervously fascinated by the expression im dd in a large business handand said in awkward haste no matter about reading it nowkeep you too longbut hes agreed all right you know must go nowtheyll be waiting only i thought id drop in apassin to keep you posted and taking off his hat he began to back from the porch  isisthis gentleman who is to assist meaa mature professional manor agraduate hesitated mrs martin with a faint smile  dont really knowi reckon sammr barstowfixed that all right must really go now and still holding his hat in his hand as a polite compromise for his undignified haste he fairly ran off  arrived at the stage office he found the two other trustees awaiting him and the still more tardy stagecoach one a large smoothfaced portly man was the presbyterian minister the other of thinner and more serious aspect was a large millowner  i presume said the rev mr peaseley slowly that as our good brother barstow in the urgency of the occasion has to some extent anticipated our functions in engaging this assistant he isaasatisfied with his capacity  sam knows what hes about said the millowner cheerfully and as hes regularly buckled down to the work here and will go his bottom dollar on it you can safely leave things to him  he certainly has exhibited great zeal said the reverend gentleman patronizingly  zeal echoed sperry enthusiastically zeal why he runs pine clearing as he runs his bank and his express company in sacramento and hes as well posted as if he were here all the time why look here he nudged the millowner secretly and as the ministers back was momentarily turned pulled out the letter he had avoided reading to mrs martin and pointed to a paragraph ill be dd said the writer but ill have peace and quietness at pine clearing if i have to wipe out or make over the whole pike county gang draw on me for a piano if you think mrs martin can work it but dont say anything to peaseley first or hell want it changed for a harmonium and that lets us in for psalmsinging till you cant rest mind i dont object to church influenceits a good holdbut you must run it with other things equal and not let it run you ive got the schoolhouse insured for thirty thousand dollarsspecial rates too  the millowner smiled sams head is level but he added he dont say much about the new assistant hes sending  only here he says i reckon the man i send will do all round for pike county has its claims as well as boston  what does that mean asked the millowner  i reckon he means he dont want pine clearing to get too hightoned any more than he wants it too low down hes mighty square in his averagesis sam  here speculation was stopped by the rapid oncoming of the stagecoach in all the impotent fury of a belated arrival had to go round by montezuma to let off jack hill curtly explained the driver as he swung himself from the box and entered the hotel barroom in company with the new expressman who had evidently taken hills place on the boxseat autocratically indifferent to further inquiry he called out cheerfully come along boys and hear this yer last new yarn about sam barstowits the biggest thing out and in another moment the waiting crowd with glasses in their hands were eagerly listening to the repetition of the yarn from the new expressman to the apparent exclusion of other matters mundane and practical  thus debarred from information the three trustees could only watch the passengers as they descended and try to identify their expected stranger but in vain the bulk of the passengers they already knew the others were ordinary miners and laborers there was no indication of the new assistant among them pending further inquiry they were obliged to wait the conclusion of the expressmans humorous recital this was evidently a performance of some artistic merit depending upon a capital imitation of an irishman a german jew and another voice which was universally recognized and applauded as being sams style all over but for the presence of the minister sperry and the millowner would have joined the enthusiastic auditors and inwardly regretted the respectable obligations of their official position  when the storyteller had concluded amidst a general call for more drinks sperry approached the driver the latter recognizing him turned to his companion carelessly said heres one of em and was going away when sperry stopped him  we were expecting a young man  yes said the driver impatiently and there he is i reckon  we dont mean the new expressman said the minister smiling blandly but a young man who  that aint no new expressman returned the driver in scornful deprecation of his interlocutors ignorance he only took hills place from montezuma hes the new kid reviver and polisher for that university youre runnin here i sayyou fellers oughter get him to tell you that story of sam barstow and the chinaman itd limber you fellers up to hear it  i fear theres some extraordinary mistake here said mr peaseley with a chilling christian smile  not a bit of it hes got a letter from sam for one of ye yere charleywhats your name com yere yeres all yer three bosses waiting for ye  and the supposed expressman and late narrator of amusing stories came forward and presented his credentials as the assistant teacher of pine clearing   chapter ii   even the practical mr sperry was taken aback the young man before him was squarely built with broad shoulders and a certain air of muscular activity but his face although goodhumored was remarkable for offering not the slightest indication of studious preoccupation or mental training a large mouth light blue eyes a square jaw the other features being indistinctivewere immobile as a maskexcept that unlike a mask they seemed to actually reflect the vacuity of the mood within instead of concealing it but as he saluted the trustees they each had the same feeling that even this expression was imported and not instinctive his face was cleanshaven and his hair cut so short as to suggest that a wig of some kind was necessary to give it characteristic or even ordinary human semblance his manner selfassured yet lacking reality and his dress of respectable cut and material yet worn as if it did not belong to him completed a picture as unlike a student or schoolmaster as could be possibly conceived  yet there was the letter in mr peaseleys hands from barstow introducing mr charles twing as the first assistant teacher in the pine clearing free academy  the three men looked hopelessly at each other an air of fatigued righteousness and a desire to be spiritually at rest from other trials pervaded mr peaseley whether or not the young man felt the evident objection he had raised he assumed a careless position with his back and elbows against the bar but even the attitude was clearly not his own  are you personally known to mr barstow asked sperry with a slight business asperity  yes  that isyou are quite well acquainted with him  if youd heard me gag his style a minute ago so that everybody here knew who it was youd say so  mr peaseleys eyes sought the ceiling and rested on the hanging lamp as if nothing short of direct providential interference could meet the occasion yet as the eyes of his brother trustees were bent on him expectantly he nerved himself to say something  i suppose mrmr twing you have properly understood the greati may say very grave intellectual and moral responsibilities of the work you seek to undertakeand the necessity of supporting it by example by practice by personal influence both in the school and out of it sir i presume sir you feel that you are fully competent to undertake this  i reckon he does  who does  sam barstow or he wouldnt have selected me i presume with the slightest possible and almost instinctive imitation of the reverend gentlemans manner his head is considered level  mr peaseley withdrew his eyes from the ceiling i have he said to his companions with a pained smile an important choir meeting to attend this afternoon i fear i must be excused as he moved towards the door the others formally following him until out of the strangers hearing he added i wash my hands of this after so wanton and unseemly an exhibition of utter incompetency and even of understanding of the trust imposed upon himupon usmy conscience forbids me to interfere further but the real arbiter in this matter will bethank heaventhe mistress herself you have only to confront her at once with this man her decision will be speedy and final for even mr barstow will not dare to force so outrageous a character upon a delicate refined woman in a familiar and confidential capacity  thats so said sperry eagerly shell settle it and of course added the millowner that will leave us out of any difficulty with sam  the two men returned to the hapless stranger relieved yet constrained by the sacrifice to which they felt they were leading him it would be necessary they said to introduce him to his principal mrs martin at once they might still find her at the schoolhouse distant but a few steps they said little else the stranger keeping up an ostentatious whistling and becoming more and more incongruous they thought as they neared the pretty schoolhouse here they did find mrs martin who had naturally lingered after the interview with sperry  she came forward to meet them with the nervous shyness and slightly fastidious hesitation that was her nature they saw or fancied they saw the same surprise and disappointment they had themselves experienced pass over her sensitive face as she looked at him they felt that their vulgar charge appeared still more outrageous by contrast with this delicate woman and her pretty refined surroundings but they saw that he enjoyed it and was evenif such a word could be applied to so selfconscious a manmore at ease in her presence  i reckon you and me will pull together very well maam he said confidently  they looked to see her turn her back upon him faint or burst out crying but she did neither and only gazed at him quietly  its a mighty pretty place youve got hereand i like it and if we cant run it i dont know who can only just let me know what you want maam and you can count on me every time  to their profound consternation mrs martin smiled faintly  it rests with you only mrs martin said sperry quickly and significantly its your say you know youre the only one to be considered or consulted here  only just say what you want me to do continued twing apparently ignoring the trustees pick out the style of job give me a hint or two how to work it or what youd think would be the proper gag to fetch em and im there maam it may be new at first but ill get at the business of it quick enough  mrs martin smiledthis time quite perceptiblywith the least little color in her cheeks and eyes then youve had no experience in teaching she said  well no  you are not a graduate of any college  not much  the two trustees looked at each other even mr peaseley had not conceived such a damning revelation  well said mrs martin slowly perhaps mr twing had better come early tomorrow morning and begin  begin gasped mr sperry in breathless astonishment  certainly said mrs martin in timid explanation if he is new to the work the sooner the better  mr sperry could only gaze blankly at his brother official had they heard aright was this the recklessness of nervous excitement in a woman of delicate health or had the impostor cast some glamour upon her or was she frightened of sam barstow and afraid to reject his candidate the last thought was an inspiration he drew her quickly aside one moment mrs martin you said to me an hour ago that you didnt intend to have asked mr barstow to send you an assistant i hope that merely because he has done so you dont feel obliged to accept this man against your better judgment  oh no said mrs martin quietly  the case seemed hopeless and sperry had the miserable conviction that by having insisted upon mrs martins judgment being final they had estopped their own right to object but how could they have foreseen her extraordinary taste he however roused himself for a last appeal  mrs martin he said in a lower voice i ought to tell you that the reverend mr peaseley strongly doubts the competency of that young man  didnt mr barstow make a selection at your request asked mrs martin with a faint little nervous cough  yesbut  then his competency only concerns meand i dont see what mr peaseley has to say about it  could he believe his senses there was a decided flush in the womans pale face and the first note of independence and asperity in her voice  that night in the privacy of his conjugal chamber mr sperry relieved his mind to another of the enigmatical sexthe stout southwestern partner of his joys and troubles but the result was equally unsatisfactory well abner said the lady i never could see for all your mens praises of mrs martin what that feller can see in her to like   chapter iii   mrs martin was early at the schoolhouse the next morning yet not so early but that she discovered that the new assistant had been there before her this was shown in some rearrangement of the school seats and benches they were placed so as to form a horseshoe before her desk and at the further extremity of this semicircle was a chair evidently for himself she was a little nettled at his premature action although admitting the utility of the change but she was still more annoyed at his absence at such a moment it was nearly the school hour when he appeared to her surprise marshaling a file of some of the smaller children whom he had evidently picked up en route and who were to her greater surprise apparently on the best of terms with him thought id better rake em in introduce myself to em and get em to know me before school begins excuse me he went on hastily but ive a lot more coming up and id better make myself square with them outside but mrs martin had apparently developed a certain degree of stiffness since their evenings interview  it seems to me quite as important mr twing she said drily that you should first learn some of your own duties which i came here early to teach you  not at all he said cheerfully today i take my seat as ive arranged it you see over there with them and watch em go through the motions one rehearsals enough for me at the same time i can chip in if necessary and before she could reply he was out of the schoolhouse again hailing the newcomers this was done with apparently such delight to the children and with some evidently imported expression into his smooth masklike face that mrs martin had to content herself with watching him with equal curiosity she was turning away with a sudden sense of forgotten dignity when a shout of joyous childish laughter attracted her attention to the window the new assistant with half a dozen small children on his square shoulders walking with bent back and every simulation of advanced senility was evidently personating with the assistance of astonishingly distorted features the ogre of a christmas pantomime as his eye caught hers the expression vanished the masklike face returned he set the children down and moved away and when school began although he marshaled them triumphantly to the very doorwith what contortion of face or simulation of character she was unable to guessafter he had entered the schoolroom and taken his seat every vestige of his previous facial aberration was gone and only his usual stolidity remained in vain as mrs martin expected the hundred delighted little eyes before her dwelt at first eagerly and hopefully upon his face but as she had not expected recognizing from the blankness of his demeanor that the previous performance was intended for them exclusively the same eager eyes were presently dropped again upon their books in simple imitation as if he were one of themselves mrs martin breathed freely and lessons began  yet she was nervously conscious meanwhile of a more illomened occurrence this was the nonarrival of several of her oldest pupils notably the refractory and incorrigible pike county contingent to whom sperry had alluded for the past few days they had hovered on the verge of active insubordination and had indulged in vague mutterings which she had resolutely determined not to hear it was therefore with some inward trepidations not entirely relieved by twings presence that she saw the three mackinnons and the two hardees slouch into the school a full hour after the lessons had begun they did not even excuse themselves but were proceeding with a surly and ostentatious defiance to their seats when mrs martin was obliged to look up andas the eldest hardee filed before herto demand an explanation the culprit addresseda dull heavylooking youth of nineteenhesitated with an air of mingled doggedness and sheepishness and then without replying nudged his companion it was evidently a preconcerted signal of rebellion for the boy nudged stopped and turning a more intelligent but equally dissatisfied face upon the schoolmistress began determinedly  wots our excuse for coming an hour late well we aint got none we dont call it an hour latewe dont we call it the right time we call it the right time for our lessons for we dont allow to come here to sing hymns with babbies we dont want to know where oh where are the hebrew children they aint nothin to us americans and we dont want any more daniels in the lions den played off on us we have enough of em in sundayschool we aint hankerin much for grammar and dictionary hogwash and we dont want no boston parts o speech rung in on us the first thing in the monin we aint bostonwere pike countywe are we reckon to do our sums and our figgerin and our sale and barter and our interest tables and weights and measures when the time comes and our geograffy when its on and our readin and writin and the american constitution in reglar hours and then we calkilate to git up and git afore the potry and the boston airs and graces come round thats our rights and what our fathers pay school taxes for and we want em  he stopped looking less towards the schoolmistress than to his companions for whom perhaps after the schoolboy fashion this attitude was taken mrs martin sat quite white and selfcontained with her eyes fixed on the frayed rim of the rebels straw hat which he still kept on his head then she said quietly  take off your hat sir  the boy did not move  he cant said a voice cheerfully  it was the new assistant the whole school faced rapidly towards him the rebel leader and his followers who had not noticed him before stared at the interrupter who did not however seem to exhibit any of the authority of office but rather the comment and criticism of one of themselves wot you mean asked the boy indignantly  i mean you cant take off your hat because youve got some things stowed away in it you dont want seen said twing with an immovable face  wot things exclaimed the boy angrily then suddenly recollecting himself he added go along you cant fool me think youll make me take off my hatdont you  well said twing advancing to the side of the rebel look here then with a dexterous movement and a slight struggle from the boy he lifted the hat a halfdozen apples a birds nest two birds eggs and a fluttering halffledged bird fell from it a wave of delight and astonishment ran along the benches a blank look of hopeless bewilderment settled upon the boys face and the gravity of the situation disappeared forever in the irrepressible burst of laughter in which even his brother rebels joined the smallest child who had been halffrightened halffascinated by the bold bad heroic attitude of the mutineer was quick to see the ridiculousness of that figure crowned with cheap schoolboy plunder the eloquent protest of his wrongs was lost in the ludicrous appearance of the protester even mrs martin felt that nothing she could say at that moment could lift the rebellion into seriousness again but twing was evidently not satisfied  beg mrs martins pardon and say you were foolin with the boys he said in a low voice  the discomfited rebel hesitated  say it or ill show what youve got in your pockets said twing in a terribly significant aside  the boy mumbled an apology to mrs martin scrambled in a blank hopeless way to his seat and the brief rebellion ignominiously ended but two things struck mrs martin as peculiar she overheard the culprit say with bated breath and evident sincerity to his comrades hadnt nothing in my hat anyway and one of the infant class was heard to complain in a deeplyinjured way that the birds nest was his and had been stoled from his desk and there still remained the fact for which twings undoubted fascination over the children had somewhat prepared herthat at recess the malcontentsone and allseemed to have forgiven the man who had overcome them and gathered round him with unmistakable interest all this however did not blind her to the serious intent of the rebellion or of twings unaccountable assumption of her prerogative while he was still romping with the children she called him in  i must remind you she said with a slight nervous asperity that this outrageous conduct of tom hardee was evidently deliberated and prepared by the others and cannot end in this way  he looked at her with a face so exasperatingly expressionless that she could have slapped it as if it had belonged to one of the older scholars and saidbut it has ended its a dead frost  i dont know what you mean and i must remind you also that in this school we neither teach nor learn slang  his immobile face changed for an instant to a look of such decided admiration that she felt her color rise but he wiped his expression away with his hand as if it had been some artificial makeup and said awkwardly but earnestly  excuse mewont you but look here mrs martin i found out early this morning when i was squaring myself with the other children that there was this row hangin onin fact that there was a sort of idea that pike county wasnt having a fair showexcuse mein the running of the school and that peaseley and barstow were a little too much on in every scene in fact you see it was just what tom said  this is insufferable said mrs martin her eyes growing darker as her cheeks grew red they shall go home to their parents and tell them from me  that theyre all mistakenexcuse mebut thats just what theyre goin to do i tell you mrs martin their little games bustedi beg pardonbut its all over youll have no more trouble with them  and you think that just because you found tom had something in his hat and exposed him said mrs martin scornfully  tom hadnt anything in his hat said twing wiping his mouth slowly  nothing repeated mrs martin  no  but i saw you take the things out  that was only a trick he had nothing except what i had up my sleeve and forced on him he knew it and that frightened him and made him look like a fool and so bursted up his conspiracy theres nothin boys are more afraid of than ridicule or the man or boy that make em ridiculous  i wont ask you if you call this fair to the boy mr twing said mrs martin hotly but is this your idea of discipline  i call it fair because tom knew it was some kind of a trick and wasnt deceived i call it discipline if it made him do what was right afterwards and makes him afraid or unwilling to do anything to offend me or you again he likes me none the worse for giving him a chance of being laughed out of a thing instead of being driven out of it and he added with awkward earnestness if youll just leave all this to me and only consider me here to take this sort of work which aint a ladysoff your hands well just strike our own line between the peaseleys and pike countyand run this school in spite of both  a little mollified a good deal puzzled and perhaps more influenced by the mans manner than she had imagined mrs martin said nothing but let the day pass without dismissing the offenders and on returning home that evening she was considerably surprised to receive her landladys extravagant congratulations on the advent of her new assistant and they do say mrs martin continued that lady enthusiastically that your just setting your foot down square on that peaseley and that barstow both of emand choosing your own assistant yourselfa plain young fellow with no frills and fancies but one that you could set about making all the changes you like was just the biggest thing you ever did for pine clearing  andtheyconsider him quitecompetent said mrs martin with timid color and hesitating audacity  competent you ask my johnny  nevertheless mrs martin was somewhat formally early at the schoolhouse the next morning perhaps she said with an odd mixture of dignity and timidity wed better before school commences go over the lessons for the day  i have he said quickly i told you one rehearsal was enough for me  you mean you have looked over them  got em by heart letter perfect want to hear me listen  she did he had actually committed to memory and without a lapse the entire text of rules questions answers and examples of the lessons for the day   chapter iv   before a month had passed mr twings success was secure and established so were a few of the changes he had quietly instituted the devotional singing and scripture reading which had excited the discontent of the pike county children and their parents was not discontinued but half an hour before recess was given up to some secular choruses patriotic or topical in which the little ones under twings really wonderful practical tuition exhibited such quick and pleasing proficiency that a certain negro minstrel campmeeting song attained sufficient popularity to be lifted by general accord to promotion to the devotional exercises where it eventually ousted the objectionable hebrew children on the question of melody alone grammar was still taught at pine clearing school in spite of the hardees and mackinnons but twing had managed to import into the cognate exercises of recitation a wonderful degree of enthusiasm and excellence dialectical pike county that had refused to recognize the governing powers of the nominative case nevertheless came out strong in classical elocution and tom hardee who had delivered his ungrammatical protest on behalf of pike county was no less strong if more elegant in his impeachment of warren hastings as edmund burke with the equal sanction of his parents the trustees sperry and jackson had marveled but were glad enough to accept the popular verdictonly mr peaseley still retained an attitude of martyrlike forbearance and fatigued toleration towards the new assistant and his changes as to mrs martin she seemed to accept the work of mr twing after his own definition of itas of a masculine quality illsuited to a ladys tastes and inclinations but it was noticeable that while she had at first repelled any criticism of him whatever she had lately been given to explaining his position to her friends and had spoken of him with somewhat labored and ostentatious patronage yet when they were alone together she frankly found him very amusing and his presumption and vulgarity so clearly unintentional that it no longer offended her they were good friends without having any confidences beyond the duties of the school she had asked no further explanation of the fact that he had been selected by mr barstow without reference to any special antecedent training what his actual antecedents were she had never cared to know nor he apparently to reveal that he had been engaged in some other occupations of superior or inferior quality would not have been remarkable in a community where the principal lawyer had been a soldier and the miller a doctor the fact that he admired her was plain enough to her that it pleased her but carried with it no ulterior thought or responsibility might have been equally clear to others perhaps it was so to him  howbeit this easy mutual intercourse was one day interrupted by what seemed a trifling incident the piano which mr barstow had promised duly made its appearance in the schoolhouse to the delight of the scholars and the gentle satisfaction of mrs martin who in addition to the rudimentary musical instruction of the younger girls occasionally played upon it herself in a prim refined and conscientious fashion to this when she was alone after school hours she sometimes added a faint colorless voice of limited range and gentlewomanly expression it was on one of these occasions that twing becoming an accidental auditor of this chaste sad piping was not only permitted to remain to hear the end of a love song of strictly guarded passion in the subjunctive mood but at the close was invited to try his handa quick if not a cultivated oneat the instrument he did so like her he added his voice like hers it was a love song but there the similitude ended negro in dialect illiterate in construction idiotic in passion and presumably addressed to the rose of alabama in the very extravagance of its childish infatuation it might have been a mockery of the schoolmistresss song but for one tremendous fact in unrestrained feeling pathetic yearning and exquisite tenderness of expression it was unmistakably and appallingly personal and sincere it was true the lips spoken of were lubly the eyes alluded to were like lightenin bugs but from the voice and gestures of the singer mrs martin confusedly felt that they were intended for hers and even the refrain that she dressed so neat and looked so sweet was glaringly allusive to her own modish mourning alternately flushing and paling with a hysteric smile hovering round her small reserved mouth the unfortunate gentlewoman was fain to turn to the window to keep her countenance until it was concluded she did not ask him to repeat it nor did she again subject herself to this palpable serenade but a few days afterwards as she was idly striking the keys in the interval of a music lesson one of her little pupils broke out why mrs martin if yo aint a pickin out that powful pretty tune that mr twing sings  nevertheless when twing a week or two later suggested that he might sing the same song as a solo at a certain performance to be given by the school children in aid of a local charity she drily intimated that it was hardly of a character to suit the entertainment but she added more gently you recite so well why not give a recitation  he looked at her with questioning and troubled eyesthe one expression he seemed to have lately acquired but that would be in public therell be a lot of people there he said doubtfully  a little amused at this first apparent sign of a want of confidence in himself she said with a reassuring smile so much the betteryou do it really too well to have it thrown away entirely on children  do you wish it he said suddenly  somewhat confused but more irritated by his abruptness she replied why not but when the day came and before a crowded audience in which there was a fair sprinkling of strangers she regretted her rash suggestion for when the pupils had gone through certain calisthenic exercisesadmirably taught and arranged by himand spoken their pieces he arose and fixing his eyes on her began othellos defense before the duke and council here as on the previous occasion she felt herself personally alluded to in his account of his wooing desdemona for some occult reason vicariously appeared for her in the unwarrantable picture of his passion and to this was added the absurd consciousness which she could not put aside that the audience following with enthusiasm his really strong declamation was also following his suggestion and adopting it yet she was also conscious and as she thought as inconsistently of being pleased and even proud of his success at the conclusion the applause was general and a voice added with husky admiration and familiarity  brayvo johnny walker  twings face became suddenly white as a pierrot mask there was a dead silence in which the voice continued give us sugar in the gourd johnny  a few hisses and cries of hush put him out followed mrs martin raised her eyes quickly to where her assistant had stood bowing his thanks a moment before he was gone  more concerned than she cared to confess vaguely fearful that she was in some way connected with his abrupt withdrawal and perhaps a little remorseful that she had allowed her personal feelings to interfere with her frank recognition of his triumph she turned back to the schoolroom after the little performers and their audience had departed in the hope that he might return it was getting late the nearly level rays of the sun were lying on the empty benches at the lower end of the room but the desk where she sat with its lid raised was in deep shadow suddenly she heard his voice in a rear hall but it was accompanied by anothersthe same voice which had interrupted the applause before she could either withdraw or make herself known the two men had entered the room and were passing slowly through it she understood at once that twing had slipped out into a janitors room in the rear where he had evidently forced an interview and explanation from his interrupter and now had been waiting for the audience to disperse before emerging by the front door they had evidently overlooked her in the shadow  but said the stranger as if following an aggrieved line of apology if barstow knew who you were and what youd done and still thought you good enough to rastle round here and square up them pike county fellers and them kidswhat in thunder do you care if the others do find you out as long as barstow sticks to you  ive told you why dick returned twing gloomily  oh the schoolmaam  yes shes a saint an angel more than thatshes a lady dick to the tip of her fingers who knows nothing of the world outside a parsons study she took me on trustwithout a wordwhen the trustees hung back and stared shes never asked me about myself and now when she knows who and what i have beenshell loathe me  but look here jim said the stranger anxiously ill say its all a lie ill come here and apologize to you afore her and say i took you for somebody else ill  its too late said twing moodily  and whatll you do  leave here  they had reached the door together to mrs martins terror as the stranger passed out twing instead of following him as she expected said goodnight and gloomily reentered the schoolroom here he paused a moment and then throwing himself on one of the benches dropped his head upon a desk with his face buried in his handslike a very schoolboy  what passed through mrs martins mind i know not for a moment she sat erect and rigid at her desk then she slipped quietly down and softly as one of the last shadows cast by the dying sun glided across the floor to where he sat  mrs martin he said starting to his feet  i have heard all she said faintly i couldnt help it i was here when you came in but i want to tell you that i am content to know you only as you seem to beas i have always found you herestrong and loyal to a duty laid upon you by those who had a full knowledge of all you had been  did you do you know what i have been  mrs martin looked frightened trembled a moment and recovering herself with an effort said gently i know nothing of your past  nothing he repeated with a mirthless attempt at laughter and a quick breath not that ive been aamountebank a variety actora clown you know for the amusement of the lowest at twentyfive cents a ticket that im johnny walker the song and dance manthe allround manselected by mr barstow to teach these boors a lesson as to what they wanted  she looked at him a momenttimidly yet thoughtfully then you are an actora person who simulates what he does not feel  yes  and all the time you have been here you have been acting the schoolmasterplaying a partforfor mr barstow  yes  always  yes  the color came softly to her face again and her voice was very low and when you sang to me that day and when you looked at meas you didan hour or two agowhile you were entertainingyou wereonlyacting  mr twings answer was not known but it must have been a full and complete one for it was quite dark when he left the schoolroomnot for the last timewith its mistress on his arm     in a pioneer restaurant   chapter i   there was probably no earthly reason why the poco mas o menos club of san francisco should have ever existed or why its five harmless indistinctive members should not have met and dined together as ordinary individuals still less was there any justification for the gratuitous opinion which obtained that it was bold bad and brilliant looking back upon it over a quarter of a century and half a globe i confess i cannot recall a single witticism audacity or humorous characteristic that belonged to it yet there was no doubt that we were thought to be extremely critical and satirical and i am inclined to think we honestly believed it to take our seats on wednesdays and saturdays at a specially reserved table at the restaurant we patronized to be conscious of being observed by the other guests and of our waiter confidentially imparting our fame to strangers behind the shakenout folds of a napkin and of knowing that the faintest indication of merriment from our table thrilled the other guests with anticipatory smiles was i am firmly convinced all that we ever did to justify our reputations nor strictly speaking were we remarkable as individuals an assistant editor a lawyer a young army quartermaster a bank clerk and a mining secretarywe could not separately challenge any special social or literary distinction yet i am satisfied that the very name of our cluba common spanish colloquialism literally meaning a little more or less and adopted in californian slang to express an unknown quantitywas supposed to be replete with deep and convulsing humor  my impression is that our extravagant reputation and indeed our continued existence as a club was due solely to the proprietor of the restaurant and two of his waiters and that we were actually run by them when the suggestion of our meeting regularly there was first broached to the proprietora german of slow but deep emotionshe received it with a so of such impressive satisfaction that it might have been the beginning of our vainglory from that moment he became at once our patron and our devoted slave to linger near our table once or twice during dinner with an air of respectful vacuityas of one who knew himself too well to be guilty of the presumption of attempting to understand our brilliancyto wear a certain parental pride and unconsciousness in our fame and yet to never go further in seeming to comprehend it than to obligingly translate the name of the club as a leedle more and nod quide so muchwas to him sufficient happiness that he ever experienced any business profit from the custom of the club or its advertisement may be greatly doubted on the contrary that a few plain customers nettled at our selfsatisfaction might have resented his favoritism seemed more probable equally vague disinterested and loyal was the attachment of the two waitersone an italian faintly reminiscent of better days and possibly superior extraction the other a rough but kindly western man who might have taken this menial position from temporary stress of circumstances yet who continued in it from sheer dominance of habit and some feebleness of will they both vied with each other to please us it may have been they considered their attendance upon a reputed intellectual company less degrading than ministering to the purely animal and silent wants of the average customers it may have been that they were attracted by our general youthfulness indeed i am inclined to think that they themselves were much more distinctive and interesting than any members of the club and it is to introduce them that i venture to recall so much of its history  a few months after our advent at the restaurant one evening joe tallant the mining secretary one of our liveliest members was observed to be awkward and distrait during dinner forgetting even to offer the usual gratuity to the italian waiter who handed him his hat although he stared at him with an imbecile smile as we chanced to leave the restaurant together i was rallying him upon his abstraction when to my surprise he said gravely look here one of two things has got to happen either we must change our restaurant or im going to resign  why  well to make matters clear im obliged to tell you something that in our business we usually keep a secret about three weeks ago i had a notice to transfer twenty feet of gold hill to a fellow named tournelli well tournelli happened to call for it himself and who the devil do you suppose tournelli was why our italian waiter i was regularly startled and so was he but business is business so i passed him over the stock and said nothingnor did heneither there nor here day before yesterday he had thirty feet more transferred to him and sold out  well i said impatiently  well repeated tallant indignantly gold hills worth six hundred dollars a foot thats eighteen thousand dollars cash and a man whos good enough for that much money is too good to wait upon me fancy a man who could pay my whole years salary with five feet of stock slinging hash to me fancy you tipping him with a quarter  but if he dont mind itand prefers to continue a waiterwhy should you care and were not supposed to know  thats just it groaned tallant thats just where the sell comes in think how he must chuckle over us no sir theres nothing aristocratic about me but by thunder if i cant eat my dinner and feel i am as good as the man who waits on me ill resign from the club  after endeavoring to point out to him the folly of such a proceeding i finally suggested that we should take the other members of our club into our confidence and abide by their decision to which he agreed but to his chagrin the others far from participating in his delicacy seemed to enjoy tournellis unexpected wealth with a vicarious satisfaction and increase of dignity as if we were personally responsible for it although it had been unanimously agreed that we should make no allusions jocose or serious to him nor betray any knowledge of it before him i am afraid our attitude at the next dinner was singularly artificial a nervous expectancy when he approached us and a certain restraint during his presence a disposition to check any discussion of shares or strikes in mining lest he should think it personal an avoidance of unnecessary or trifling orders and a singular patience in awaiting their execution when given a vague hovering between sympathetic respect and the other extreme of indifferent bluntness in our requests tended i think to make that meal far from exhilarating indeed the unusual depression affected the unfortunate cause of it who added to our confusion by increased solicitude of service andas if fearful of some fault or having incurred our disfavorby a deprecatory and exaggerated humility that in our sensitive state seemed like the keenest irony at last evidently interpreting our constraint before him into a desire to be alone he retired to the door of a distant pantry whence he surveyed us with dark and sorrowful southern eyes tallant who in this general embarrassment had been imperfectly served and had eaten nothing here felt his grievance reach its climax and in a sudden outbreak of recklessness he roared out hi waiteryou tournelli he may he added turning darkly to us buy up enough stock to control the board and dismiss me but by thunder if it costs me my place im going to have some more chicken  it was probably this sensitiveness that kept us from questioning him even indirectly and perhaps led us into the wildest surmises he was acting secretly for a brotherhood or society of waiters he was a silent partner of his german employer he was a disguised italian stockbroker gaining points from the unguarded conversation of operating customers he was a political refugee with capital he was a fugitive sicilian bandit investing his illgotten gains in california he was a dissipated young nobleman following some amorous intrigue across the ocean and acting as his own figaro or leporello i think a majority of us favored the latter hypothesis possibly because we were young and his appearance gave it color his thin black mustaches and dark eyes we felt were tuscan and aristocratic at least they were like the baritone who played those parts and he ought to know yet nothing could be more exemplary and fastidious than his conduct towards the few lady frequenters of the poodle dog restaurant who i regret to say were not puritanically reserved or conventual in manner  but an unexpected circumstance presently changed and divided our interest it was alleged by clay the assistant editor that entering the restaurant one evening he saw the back and tails of a coat that seemed familiar to him halffilling a doorway leading to the restaurant kitchen it was unmistakably the figure of one of our club membersthe young lawyerjack manners but what was he doing there while the editor was still gazing after him he suddenly disappeared as if some one had warned him that he was observed as he did not reappear when tournelli entered from the kitchen a few moments later the editor called him and asked for his fellowmember to his surprise the italian answered with every appearance of truthfulness that he had not seen mr manners at all the editor was staggered but as he chanced some hours later to meet manners he playfully rallied him on his mysterious conference with the italian manners replied briefly that he had had no interview whatever with tournelli and changed the subject quickly the mysteryas we persisted in believing itwas heightened when another member deposed that he had seen tom the western waiter coming from mannerss office as manners had volunteered no information of this we felt that we could not without indelicacy ask him if tom was a client or a messenger from tournelli the only result was that our club dinner was even more constrained than before not only was tom now invested with a dark importance but it was evident that the harmony of the club was destroyed by these singular secret relations of two of its members with their employes  it chanced that one morning arriving from a delayed journey i dropped into the restaurant it was that slack hour between the lingering breakfast and coming luncheon when the tables are partly stripped and unknown doors opened for ventilation reveal the distant kitchen and a mingled flavor of cold coffeegrounds and lukewarm soups hangs heavy on the air to this cheerlessness was added a gusty rain without that filmed the panes of the windows and doors and veiled from the passerby the usual tempting display of snowy cloths and china  as i seemed to be the only customer at that hour i selected a table by the window for distraction tom had taken my order the other waiters including tournelli were absent with the exception of a solitary german who in the interlude of perfunctory trifling with the casters gazed at me with that abstracted irresponsibility which one waiter assumes towards anothers customer even the proprietor had deserted his desk at the counter it seemed to be a favorable opportunity to get some information from tom  but he anticipated me when he had dealt a certain number of dishes around me as if they were cards and he was telling my fortune he leaned over the table and said with interrogating confidence  i reckon you call that mr manners of yours a good lawyer  we were very loyal to each other in the club and i replied with youthful enthusiasm that he was considered one of the most promising at the bar and remembering tournelli i added confidently that whoever engaged him to look after their property interests had secured a treasure  but is he good in criminal casesbefore a police court for instance continued tom  i believedi dont know on what groundsthat manners was good in insurance and admiralty law and that he looked upon criminal practice as low but i answered brisklythough a trifle startledthat as a criminal lawyer he was perfect  he could advise a man who had a row hanging on how to steer clear of being up for murdereh  i trusted with a desperate attempt at jocosity that neither he nor tournelli had been doing anything to require mannerss services in that way  it would be too late then said tom coolly and anybody could tell a man what he ought to have done or how to make the best of what he had done but the smart thing in a lawyer would be to give a chap points beforehand and sorter tell him how far he could go and yet keep inside the law how he might goad a fellow to draw on him and then plug himeh  i looked up quickly there was nothing in his ordinary goodhumored but not very strong face to suggest that he himself was the subject of this hypothetical case if he were speaking for tournelli the italian certainly was not to be congratulated on his ambassadors prudence and above all manners was to be warned of the interpretation which might be put upon his counsels and disseminated thus publicly as i was thinking what to say he moved away but suddenly returned again  what made you think tournelli had been up to anything he asked sharply  nothing i answered i only thought you and he being friends  you mean were both waiters in the same restaurant well i dont know him any better than i know that chap over there pointing to the other waiter hes a greaser or an italian and i reckon goes with his kind  why had we not thought of this before nothing would be more natural than that the rich and imperious tournelli should be exclusive and have no confidences with his enforced associates and it was evident that tom had noticed it and was jealous  i suppose hes rather a swell isnt he i suggested tentatively  a faint smile passed over toms face it was partly cynical and partly suggestive of that amused toleration of our youthful credulity which seemed to be a part of that discomposing patronage that everybody extended to the club as he said nothing i continued encouragingly  because a mans a waiter it doesnt follow that hes always been one or always will be  no said tom abstractedly but its about as good as anything else to lie low and wait on but here two customers entered and he turned to them leaving me in doubt whether to accept this as a verbal pleasantry or an admission only one thing seemed plain i had certainly gained no information and only added a darker mystery to his conference with manners which i determined i should ask manners to explain  i finished my meal in solitude the rain was still beating drearily against the windows with an occasional accession of impulse that seemed like human impatience vague figures under dripping umbrellas that hid their faces as if in premeditated disguise hurried from the main thoroughfare a woman in a hooded waterproof like a domino a mexican in a black serape might have been stage conspirators hastening to a rendezvous the cavernous chill and odor which i had before noted as coming from some sarcophagus of larder or oven where funeral baked meats might have been kept in stock began to oppress me the hollow and fictitious domesticity of this common board had never before seemed so hopelessly displayed and tom the waiter his napkin twisted in his hand and his face turned with a sudden dark abstraction towards the window appeared to be really lying low and waiting for something outside his avocation   chapter ii   the fact that tom did not happen to be on duty at the next club dinner gave me an opportunity to repeat his mysterious remark to manners and to jokingly warn that rising young lawyer against the indiscretion of vague counsel manners however only shrugged his shoulders i dont know what he meant he said carelessly but since he chooses to talk of his own affairs publicly i dont mind saying that they are neither very weighty nor very dangerous its only the old story the usual matrimonial infidelities that are mixed up with the californian emigration he leaves the regular wife behindfairly or unfairly i cant say she gets tired waiting after the usual style and elopes with somebody else the western penelope isnt built for waiting but she seems to have converted some of his property into cash when she skipped from st louis and thats where his chief concern comes in thats what he wanted to see me for thats why he inveigled me into that infernal pantry of his one day to show me a plan of his property as if that was any good  he paused disgustedly we all felt i think that tom was some kind of an impostor claiming the sympathies of the club on false pretenses nevertheless the quartermaster said then you didnt do anything for himgive him any advice eh  no for the propertys as much hers as his and he hasnt got a divorce and as its doubtful whether he didnt desert her first he cant get one he was surprised he added with a grim smile when i told him that he was obliged to support her and was even liable for her debts but people who are always talking of invoking the law know nothing about it we were surprised too although manners was always convincing us in some cheerful but discomposing way that we were all daily and hourly in our simplest acts making ourself responsible for all sorts of liabilities and actions and even generally preparing ourselves for arrest and imprisonment the quartermaster continued lazily  then you didnt give him any points about shooting  no he doesnt even know the man she went off with it was eighteen months ago and i dont believe hed even know her again if he met her but if he isnt much of a client we shall miss him tonight as a waiter for the place is getting full and there are not enough to serve  the restaurant was indeed unusually crowded that evening the more so that the private rooms above being early occupied some dinner parties and exclusive couples had been obliged to content themselves with the public dining saloon a small table nearest us usually left vacant to insure a certain seclusion to the club was arranged with a deprecatory apology from the proprietor for one of those couples a man and woman the man was a wellknown speculatorcool yet reckless and pleasureloving the woman goodlooking picturesquely attractive selfconscious and selfpossessed our propinquity was evidently neither novel nor discomposing as she settled her skirts in her place her bright dark eyes swept our table with a frank almost childish familiarity the younger members of the club quite unconsciously pulled up their collars and settled their neckties the elders as unconsciously raised their voices slightly and somewhat arranged their sentences alas the simplicity and unaffectedness of the club were again invaded  suddenly there was a crash the breaking of glass and an exclamation tournelli no doubt disorganized by the unusual hurry on his way to our table had dropped his tray impartially distributed a plate of asparagus over an adjoining table and flushed and nervous yet with an affectation of studied calmness was pouring the sauce into the young quartermasters plate in spite of his languid protests at any other time we would have laughed but there was something in the exaggerated agitation of the italian that checked our mirth why should he be so upset by a trifling accident he could afford to pay for the breakage he would laugh at dismissal was it the sensitiveness of a refined nature orhe was young and goodlookingwas he disconcerted by the fact that our handsome neighbor had witnessed his awkwardness but she was not laughing and as far as i could see was intently regarding the bill of fare  waiter called her companion hailing tournelli here the italian with a face now distinctly white leaned over the table adjusting the glasses but did not reply  waiter repeated the stranger sharply tournellis face twitched then became set as a mask but he did not move the stranger leaned forward and pulled his apron from behind tournelli started with flashing eyes and turned swiftly round but the quartermasters hand had closed on his wrist  thats my knife tournelli  the knife dropped from the italians fingers  better see what he wants it may not be that said the young officer coolly but kindly  tournelli turned impatiently towards the stranger we alone had witnessed this incident and were watching him breathlessly yet what bade fair a moment ago to be a tragedy seemed now to halt grotesquely for tournelli throwing open his linen jacket with a melodramatic gesture tapped his breast and with flashing eyes and suppressed accents said sare you wantah me looki am herre  the speculator leaned back in his chair in goodhumored astonishment the ladys black eyes without looking at tournelli glanced backward round the room and slipped along our table with halfdefiant unconcern and then she uttered a short hysterical laugh  ah ze ladymadameze signoraehshe wantah me continued tournelli leaning on the table with compressed fingers and glaring at her perhaps she wantah tournellieh  well you might bring some with the soup blandly replied her escort who seemed to enjoy the italians excitement as a national eccentricity but hurry up and set the table will you  then followed on the authority of the editor who understood italian a singular scene secure apparently in his belief that his language was generally uncomprehended tournelli brought a decanter and setting it on the table said traitress in an intense whisper this was followed by the cruets which he put down with the exclamation perjured fiend two glasses placed on either side of her carried the word apostate to her ear and three knives and forks rattling more than was necessary and laid crosswise before her plate were accompanied with tremble wanton then as he pulled the tablecloth straight and ostentatiously concealed a winestain with a clean napkin scarcely whiter than his lips he articulated under his breath let him beware he goes not hence alive i will slice his craven heartthusand thou shalt see it he turned quickly to a side table and brought back a spoon and this is why i have not found you another spoon for this you have disappeared a purely perfunctory polishing of her fork for him bah an equally unnecessary wiping of her glass blood of godmore wipingit will end yesgeneral wiping and a final flourish over the whole table with a napkini go but at the door i shall await you both  she had not spoken yet nor even lifted her eyes when she did so however she raised them level with his showed all her white teeththey were small and cruellookingand said smilingly in his own dialect  thief  tournelli halted rigid  youre talking his lingo eh said her escort goodhumoredly  yes  welltell him to bustle around and be a little livelier with the dinner wont you this is only skirmishing  you hear she continued to tournelli in a perfectly even voice or shall it be a policeman and a charge of stealing  stealing gasped tournelli you say stealing  yesten thousand dollars you are well disguised here my little fellow it is a good businessyours keep it while you can  i think he would have sprung upon her there and then but that the quartermaster who was nearest him and had been intently watching his face made a scarcely perceptible movement as if ready to anticipate him he caught the officers eye caught i think in ours the revelation that he had been understood drew back with a sidelong sinuous movement and disappeared in the passage to the kitchen  i believe we all breathed more freely although the situation was still full enough of impending possibilities to prevent peaceful enjoyment of our dinner as the editor finished his hurried translation it was suggested that we ought to warn the unsuspecting escort of tournellis threats but it was pointed out that this would be betraying the woman and that jo hays her companion was fully able to take care of himself besides said the editor aggrievedly you fellows only think of yourselves and you dont understand the first principles of journalism do you suppose im going to do anything to spoil a halfcolumn of leaded brevier copyfrom an eyewitness too no its a square enough fight as it stands we must look out for the woman and not let tournelli get an unfair drop on hays that is if the whole thing isnt a bluff  but the italian did not return whether he had incontinently fled or was nursing his wrath in the kitchen or already fulfilling his threat of waiting on the pavement outside the restaurant we could not guess another waiter appeared with the dinners they had ordered a momentary thrill of excitement passed over us at the possibility that tournelli had poisoned their soup but it presently lapsed as we saw the couple partaking of it comfortably and chatting with apparent unconcern was the scene we had just witnessed only a piece of southern exaggeration was the woman a creature devoid of nerves or feeling of any kind or was she simply a consummate actress yet she was clearly not acting for in the intervals of conversation and even while talking her dark eyes wandered carelessly around the room with the easy selfconfidence of a pretty woman we were beginning to talk of something else when the editor said suddenly in a suppressed voice  hullo whats the matter now  the woman had risen and was hurriedly throwing her cloak over her shoulders but it was her face that was now ashen and agitated and we could see that her hands were trembling her escort was assisting her but was evidently as astonished as ourselves perhaps he suggested hopefully if you wait a minute it will pass off  no no she gasped still hurriedly wrestling with her cloak dont you see im suffocating herei want air you can follow she began to move off her face turned fixedly in the direction of the door we instinctively looked thereperhaps for tournelli there was no one nevertheless the editor and quartermaster had halfrisen from their seats  helloo said manners suddenly theres tom just come in call him  tom evidently recalled from his brief furlough by the proprietor on account of the press of custom had just made his appearance from the kitchen  tom wheres tournelli asked the lawyer hurriedly but following the retreating woman with his eyes  skipped they say somebody insulted him said tom curtly  you didnt see him hanging round outside eh swearing vengeance asked the editor  no said tom scornfully  the woman had reached the door and darted out of it as her escort paused a moment at the counter to throw down a coin yet in that moment she had hurried before him through the passage into the street i turned breathlessly to the window for an instant her face white as a phantoms appeared pressed rigidly against the heavy plateglass her eyes staring with a horrible fascination back into the roomi even imagined at us perhaps as it was evident that tournelli was not with her she fancied he was still here perhaps she had mistaken tom for him however her escort quickly rejoined her their shadows passed the window togetherthey were gone  then a pistolshot broke the quiet of the street  the editor and quartermaster rose and ran to the door manners rose also but lingered long enough to whisper to me dont lose sight of tom and followed them but to my momentary surprise no one else moved i had forgotten in the previous excitement that in those days a pistolshot was not unusual enough to attract attention a few raised their heads at the sound of running feet on the pavement and the flitting of black shadows past the windows tom had not stirred but napkin in hand and eyes fixed on vacancy was standing as i had seen him once before in an attitude of listless expectation  in a few minutes manners returned i thought he glanced oddly at tom who was still lingering in attendance and i even fancied he talked to us ostentatiously for his benefit yes it was a row of tournellis he was waiting at the corner had rushed at hays with a knife but had been met with a derringershot through his hat the lady who it seems was only a chance steamer acquaintance of hays thought the attack must have been meant for her as she had recognized in the italian a man who had stolen from her divorced husband in the states two years ago and was a fugitive from justice at least that was the explanation given by hays for the woman had fainted and been driven off to her hotel by the quartermaster and tournelli had escaped but the editor was on his track you didnt notice that lady tom did you  tom came out of an abstracted study and said no she had her back to me all the time  manners regarded him steadily for a moment without speaking but in a way that i could not help thinking was much more embarrassing to the bystanders than to him when we rose to leave as he placed his usual gratuity into toms hand he said carelessly you might drop into my office tomorrow if you have anything to tell me  i havent said tom quietly  then i may have something to tell you  tom nodded and turned away to his duties the mining secretary and myself could scarcely wait to reach the street before we turned eagerly on manners  well  well the woman you saw was toms runaway wife and tournelli the man she ran away with  and tom knew it  cant say  and you mean to say that all this while tom never suspected him and even did not recognize her just now  manners lifted his hat and passed his fingers through his hair meditatively ask me something easier gentlemen     a treasure of the galleon   her fathers house was nearly a mile from the sea but the breath of it was always strong at the windows and doors in the early morning and when there were heavy southwesters blowing in the winter the wind brought the sharp sting of sand to her cheek and the rain an odd taste of salt to her lips on this particular december afternoon however as she stood in the doorway it seemed to be singularly calm the southwest trades blew but faintly and scarcely broke the crests of the long pacific swell that lazily rose and fell on the beach which only a slanting copse of scruboak and willow hid from the cottage nevertheless she knew this leaguelong strip of shining sand much better it is to be feared than the scanty flowergarden arid and stunted by its contiguity it had been her playground when she first came there a motherless girl of twelve and she had helped her father gather its scattered driftwoodas the fortunes of the millers were not above accepting these occasional offerings of their lordly neighbor  i wouldnt go far today jenny said her father as the girl stepped from the threshold i dont trust the weather at this season and besides you had better be looking over your wardrobe for the christmas eve party at sol catlins  why father you dont intend to go to that mans said the girl looking up with a troubled face  lawyer miller as he was called by his few neighbors looked slightly embarrassed why not he asked in a faintly irritated tone  why not why father you know how vulgar and conceited he ishow everybody here truckles to him  very likely hes a very superior man of his kinda kind they understand here tooa great trapper hunter and pioneer  but i dont believe in his trapping hunting and pioneering said the girl petulantly i believe its all as hollow and boisterous as himself its no more real or what one thinks it should be than he is and he dares to patronize youyou father an educated man and a gentleman  say rather an unsuccessful lawyer who was fool enough to believe that buying a ranch could make him a farmer returned her father but half jestingly i only wish i was as good at my trade as he is  but you never liked himyou always used to ignore him youve changed fathershe stopped suddenly for her recollection of her fathers quiet superiority and easy independence when he first came there was in such marked contrast to his late careless and weak concession to the rude life around them that she felt a pang of vague degradation which she feared her voice might betray  very well do as you like he replied with affected carelessness only i thought as we cannot afford to go elsewhere this christmas it might be well for us to take what we could find here  take what we could find here it was so unlike himhe who had always been so strong in preserving their little domestic refinements in their rude surroundings that their poverty had never seemed mean nor their seclusion ignoble she turned away to conceal her indignant color she could share the household work with a squaw and chinaman she could fetch wood and water catlin had patronizingly seen her doing it but to dance to his vulgar pipingnever  she was not long in reaching the sands that now lay before her warm sweetscented from short beach grass stretching to a dim rocky promontory and absolutely untrod by any foot but her own it was this virginity of seclusion that had been charming to her girlhood fenced in between the impenetrable hedge of scruboaks on the one side and the lifting green walls of breakers tipped with chevaux de frise of white foam on the other she had known a perfect security for her sports and fancies that had captivated her townbred instincts and native fastidiousness a few whitewinged seabirds as proud reserved and maidenlike as herself had been her only companions and it was now the custodian of her secreta secret as innocent and childlike as her previous youthful fanciesbut still a secret known only to herself  one day she had come upon the rotting ribs of a wreck on the beach its distance from the tide line its position and its deep imbedding of sand showed that it was of ancient origin an omnivorous reader of all that pertained to the history of california jenny had in fancy often sailed the seas in one of those mysterious treasureships that had skirted the coast in bygone days and she at once settled in her mind that her discovery was none other than a castaway philippine galleon partly from her reserve and partly from a suddenly conceived plan she determined to keep its existence unknown to her father as careful inquiry on her part had found it was equally unknown to the neighbors for this shy imaginative young girl of eighteen had convinced herself that it might still contain a part of its old treasure she would dig for it herself without telling anybody if she failed no one would know it if she were successful she would surprise her father and perhaps retrieve their fortune by less vulgar means than their present toil thanks to the secluded locality and the fact that she was known to spend her leisure moments in wandering there she could work without suspicion secretly conveying a shovel and a few tools to the spot the next day she set about her prodigious task as the upper works were gone and the galleon not large in three weeks working an hour or two each day she had made a deep excavation in the stern she had found many curious thingsthe flotsam and jetsam of previous stormsbut as yet it is perhaps needless to say not the treasure  today she was filled with the vague hope of making her discovery before christmas day to have been able to take her father something on that dayif only a few old coinsthe fruit of her own unsuspected labor and intuitionnot the result of vulgar barter or menial wagewould have been complete happiness it was perhaps a somewhat visionary expectation for an educated girl of eighteen but i am writing of a young californian girl who had lived in the fierce glamour of treasurehunting and in whose sensitive individuality some of its subtle poison had been instilled howbeit today she found nothing she was sadly hiding her pick and shovel as was her custom when she discovered the fresh track of an alien foot in the sand robinson crusoe was not more astounded at the savage footprint than jenny miller at this damning proof of the invasion of her sacred territory the footprints came from and returned to the copse of shrubs some one might have seen her at work  but a singular change in the weather overlooked in her excitement here forced itself upon her a light film over sea and sky lifted only by fitful gusts of wind seemed to have suddenly thickened until it became an opaque vault narrowing in circumference as the wind increased the promontory behind her disappeared as if swallowed up the distance before her seemed to contract the ocean at her side the color of dull pewter vanished in a sheet of slanting rain and by the time she reached the house half running half carried along by the quartering force of the wind a full gale was blowing  it blew all the evening reaching a climax and fury at past midnight that was remembered for many years along that coast in the midst of it they heard the booming of cannon and then the voices of neighbors in the road there was said the voices a big steamer ashore just afore the house they dressed quickly and ran out  hugging the edge of the copse to breathe and evade the fury of the wind they struggled to the sands at first looking out to sea the girl saw nothing but foam but following the direction of a neighbors arm for in that wild tumult man alone seemed speechless she saw directly before her so close upon her that she could have thrown a pebble on board the high bows of a ship indeed its very nearness gave her the feeling that it was already saved and its occasional heavy roll to leeward drunken helpless ludicrous but never awful brought a hysteric laugh to her lips but when a livid blue light lit in the swinging top showed a number of black objects clinging to bulwarks and rigging and the sea with languid heavy cruelty pushing rather than beating them away one by one she knew that death was there  the neighbors her father with the others had been running hopelessly to and fro or cowering in groups against the copse when suddenly they uttered a crytheir firstof joyful welcome and with that shout the man she most despised and hated sol catlin mounted on a calico mustang as outrageous and bizarre as himself dashed among them  in another moment what had been fear bewilderment and hesitation was changed to courage confidence and action the men pressed eagerly around him and as eagerly dispersed under his quick command galloping at his heels was a team with the whaleboat brought from the river miles away he was here there and everywhere catching the line thrown by the rocket from the ship marshaling the men to haul it in answering the hail from those on board above the tempest pervading everything and everybody with the fury of the storm loud imperious domineering selfasserting allsufficient and successful and when the boat was launched the last mighty impulse came from his shoulder he rode at the helm into the first hanging wall of foam erect and triumphant dazzled bewildered crying and laughing she hated him more than ever  the boat made three trips bringing off with the aid of the hawser all but the sailors she had seen perish before her own eyes the passengersthey were fewthe captain and officers found refuge in her fathers house and were loud in their praises of sol catlin but in that grateful chorus a single gloomy voice arose the voice of a wealthy and troubled passenger i will give he said five thousand dollars to the man who brings me a box of securities i left in my stateroom every eye turned instinctively to sol he answered only those of jennys say ten thousand and if the dodblasted hulk holds together two hours longer ill do it dn me you hear me my names sol catlin and when i say a thing by gd i do it jennys disgust here reached its climax the hero of a night of undoubted energy and courage had blotted it out in a single moment of native vanity and vulgar avarice  he was gone not only two hours but daylight had come and they were eagerly seeking him when he returned among them dripping andemptyhanded he had reached the ship he said with another found the box and trusted himself alone with it to the sea but in the surf he had to abandon it to save himself it had perhaps drifted ashore and might be found for himself he abandoned his claim to the reward had he looked abashed or mortified jenny felt that she might have relented but the braggart was as allsatisfied as confident and boastful as ever nevertheless as his eye seemed to seek hers she was constrained in mere politeness to add her own to her fathers condolences i suppose she hesitated in passing him that this is a mere nothing to you after all that you did last night that was really great and unselfish  were you never disappointed miss he said with exasperating abruptness  a quick consciousness of her own thankless labor on the galleon and a terrible idea that he might have some suspicion of and perhaps the least suggestion that she might have been disappointed in him brought a faint color to her cheek but she replied with dignity  i really couldnt say but certainly she added with a newfound pertness you dont look it  nor do you miss was his idiotic answer  a few hours later alarmed at what she had heard of the inroads of the sea which had risen higher than ever known to the oldest settler and perhaps mindful of yesterdays footprints she sought her old secluded haunt the wreck was still there but the sea had reached it the excavation between its gaunt ribs was filled with drift and the seaweed carried there by the surges and entrapped in its meshes and there too caught as in a net lay the wooden box of securities sol catlin had abandoned to the sea  this is the story as it was told to me the singularity of coincidences has challenged some speculation jenny insisted at the time upon sharing the full reward with catlin but local critics have pointed out that from subsequent events this proved nothing for she had married him     out of a pioneers trunk   it was a slightly cynical but fairly goodhumored crowd that had gathered before a warehouse on long wharf in san francisco one afternoon in the summer of 51 although the occasion was an auction the bidders chances more than usually hazardous and the season and locality famous for reckless speculation there was scarcely any excitement among the bystanders and a lazy halfhumorous curiosity seemed to have taken the place of any zeal for gain  it was an auction of unclaimed trunks and boxesthe personal luggage of early emigrantswhich had been left on storage in hulk or warehouse at san francisco while the owner was seeking his fortune in the mines the difficulty and expense of transport often obliging the goldseeker to make part of his journey on foot restricted him to the smallest impedimenta and that of a kind not often found in the luggage of ordinary civilization as a consequence during the emigration of 49 he was apt on landing to avail himself of the invitation usually displayed on some of the doors of the rude hostelries on the shore rest for the weary and storage for trunks in a majority of cases he never returned to claim his stored property enforced absence protracted equally by good or evil fortune accumulated the high storage charges until they usually far exceeded the actual value of the goods sickness further emigration or death also reduced the number of possible claimants and that more wonderful human frailtyabsolute forgetfulness of deposited possessionscombined together to leave the bulk of the property in the custodians hands under an understood agreement they were always sold at public auction after a given time although the contents of some of the trunks were exposed it was found more in keeping with the public sentiment to sell the trunks locked and unopened the element of curiosity was kept up from time to time by the incautious disclosures of the lucky or unlucky purchaser and general bidding thus encouragedexcept when the speculator with the true gambling instinct gave no indication in his face of what was drawn in this lottery generally however some suggestion in the exterior of the trunk a label or initials some conjectural knowledge of its former owner or the idea that he might be secretly present in the hope of getting his property back for less than the accumulated dues kept up the bidding and interest  a modestlooking wellworn portmanteau had been just put up at a small opening bid when harry flint joined the crowd the young man had arrived a week before at san francisco friendless and penniless and had been forced to part with his own effects to procure necessary food and lodging while looking for an employment in the irony of fate that morning the proprietors of a drygoods store struck with his good looks and manners had offered him a situation if he could make himself more presentable to their fair clients harry flint was gazing half abstractedly half hopelessly at the portmanteau without noticing the auctioneers persuasive challenge in his abstraction he was not aware that the auctioneers assistant was also looking at him curiously and that possibly his dejected and halfclad appearance had excited the attention of one of the cynical bystanders who was exchanging a few words with the assistant he was however recalled to himself a moment later when the portmanteau was knocked down at fifteen dollars and considerably startled when the assistant placed it at his feet with a grim smile thats your property fowler and i reckon you look as if you wanted it back bad  buttheres some mistake stammered flint i didnt bid  no but tom flynn did for you you see i spotted you from the first and told flynn i reckoned you were one of those chaps who came back from the mines dead broke and he up and bought your things for youlike a square man thats flynns style if he is a gambler  but persisted flint this never was my property my name isnt fowler and i never left anything here  the assistant looked at him with a grim halfcredulous halfscornful smile have it your own way he said but i oughter tell ye old man that im the warehouse clerk and i remember you im here for that purpose but as that thar valise is bought and paid for by somebody else and given to you its nothing more to me take it or leave it  the ridiculousness of quarreling over the mere form of his good fortune here struck flint and as his abrupt benefactor had as abruptly disappeared he hurried off with his prize reaching his cheap lodginghouse he examined its contents as he had surmised it contained a full suit of clothing of the better sort and suitable to his urban needs there were a few articles of jewelry which he put religiously aside there were some letters which seemed to be of a purely business character there were a few daguerreotypes of pretty faces one of which was singularly fascinating to him but there was another of a young man which startled him with its marvelous resemblance to himself in a flash of intelligence he understood it all now it was the likeness of the former owner of the trunk for whom the assistant had actually mistaken him he glanced hurriedly at the envelopes of the letters they were addressed to shelby fowler the name by which the assistant had just called him the mystery was plain now and for the present he could fairly accept his good luck and trust to later fortune to justify himself  transformed in his new garb he left his lodgings to present himself once more to his possible employer his way led past one of the large gambling saloons it was yet too early to find the drygoods trader disengaged perhaps the consciousness of more decent civilized garb emboldened him to mingle more freely with strangers and he entered the saloon he was scarcely abreast of one of the faro tables when a man suddenly leaped up with an oath and discharged a revolver full in his face the shot missed before his unknown assailant could fire again the astonished flint had closed with him and instinctively clutched the weapon a brief but violent struggle ensued flint felt his strength failing him when suddenly a look of astonishment came into the furious eyes of his adversary and the mans grasp mechanically relaxed the halffreed pistol thrown upwards by this movement was accidentally discharged point blank into his temples and he fell dead no one in the crowd had stirred or interfered  youve done for australian pete this time mr fowler said a voice at his elbow he turned gaspingly and recognized his strange benefactor flynn i call you all to witness gentlemen continued the gambler turning dictatorially to the crowd that this man was first attacked and was unarmed he lifted flints limp and empty hands and then pointed to the dead man who was still grasping the weapon come he caught the halfparalyzed arm of flint and dragged him into the street  but stammered the horrified flint as he was borne along what does it all mean what made that man attack me  i reckon it was a case of shooting on sight mr fowler but he missed it by not waiting to see if you were armed it wasnt the square thing and youre all right with the crowd now whatever he might have had agin you  but protested the unhappy flint i never laid eyes on the man before and my name isnt fowler  flynn halted and dragged him in a door way who the devil are you he asked roughly  briefly passionately almost hysterically flint told him his scant story an odd expression came over the gamblers face  look here he said abruptly i have passed my word to the crowd yonder that you are a deadbroke miner called fowler i allowed that you might have had some row with that sydney duck australian pete in the mines that satisfied them if i go back now and say its a lie that your name aint fowler and you never knew who pete was theyll jest pass you over to the police to deal with you and wash their hands of it altogether you may prove to the police who you are and how that d clerk mistook you but it will give you trouble and who is there here who knows who you really are  no one said flint with sudden hopelessness  and you say youre an orphan and aint got any relations livin that youre beholden to  no one  then take my advice and be fowler and stick to it be fowler until fowler turns up and thanks you for it for youve saved fowlers life as pete would never have funked and lost his grit over fowler as he did with you and youve a right to his name  he stopped and the same odd superstitious look came into his dark eyes  dont you see what all that means well ill tell you youre in the biggest streak of luck a man ever had youve got the cards in your own hand they spell fowler play fowler first last and all the time goodnight and good luck mr fowler  the next mornings journal contained an account of the justifiable killing of the notorious desperado and exconvict australian pete by a courageous young miner by the name of fowler an act of firmness and daring said the pioneer which will go far to counteract the terrorism produced by those lawless ruffians  in his new suit of clothes and with this paper in his hand flint sought the drygoods proprietorthe latter was satisfied and convinced that morning harry flint began his career as salesman and as shelby fowler   from that day shelby fowlers career was one of uninterrupted prosperity within the year he became a partner the same miraculous fortune followed other ventures later he was mill owner mine owner bank directora millionaire he was popular the reputation of his brief achievement over the desperado kept him secure from the attack of envy and rivalry he never was confronted by the real fowler there was no danger of exposure by othersthe one custodian of his secret tom flynn died in nevada the year following he had quite forgotten his youthful past and even the more recent lucky portmanteau remembered nothing perhaps but the pretty face of the daguerreotype that had fascinated him there seemed to be no reason why he should not live and die as shelby fowler  his business a year later took him to europe he was entering a train at one of the great railway stations of london when the porter who had just deposited his portmanteau in a compartment reappeared at the window followed by a young lady in mourning  beg pardon sir but i handed you the wrong portmanteau that belongs to this young lady this is yours  flint glanced at the portmanteau on the seat before him it certainly was not his although it bore the initials s f he was mechanically handing it back to the porter when his eyes fell on the young ladys face for an instant he stood petrified it was the face of the daguerreotype i beg pardon he stammered but are these your initials she hesitated perhaps it was the abruptness of the question but he saw she looked confused  no a friends  she disappeared into another carriage but from that moment harry flint knew that he had no other aim in life but to follow this clue and the beautiful girl who had dropped it he bribed the guard at the next station and discovered that she was going to york on their arrival he was ready on the platform to respectfully assist her a few words disclosed the fact that she was a fellowcountrywoman although residing in england and at present on her way to join some friends at harrogate her name was west at the mention of his he again fancied she looked disturbed  they met again and again the informality of his introduction was overlooked by her friends as his assumed name was already respectably and responsibly known beyond california he thought no more of his future he was in love he even dared to think it might be returned but he felt he had no right to seek that knowledge until he had told her his real name and how he came to assume anothers he did so alonescarcely a month after their first meeting to his alarm she burst into a flood of tears and showed an agitation that seemed far beyond any apparent cause when she had partly recovered she said in a low frightened voice  you are bearing my brothers name but it was a name that the unhappy boy had so shamefully disgraced in australia that he abandoned it and as he lay upon his deathbed the last act of his wasted life was to write an imploring letter begging me to change mine too for the infamous companion of his crime who had first tempted then betrayed him had possession of all his papers and letters many of them from me and was threatening to bring them to our virginia home and expose him to our neighbors maddened by desperation the miserable boy twice attempted the life of the scoundrel and might have added that blood guiltiness to his other sins had he lived i did change my name to my mothers maiden one left the country and have lived here to escape the revelations of that desperado should he fulfill his threat  in a flash of recollection flint remembered the startled look that had come into his assailants eye after they had clinched it was the same man who had too late realized that his antagonist was not fowler thank god you are forever safe from any exposure from that man he said gravely and the name of fowler has never been known in san francisco save in all respect and honor it is for you to take backfearlessly and alone  she didbut not alone for she shared it with her husband     the ghosts of stukeley castle   there should have been snow on the ground to make the picture seasonable and complete but the western barbarian had lived long enough in england to know that except in the pages of a holiday supplement this was rarely the accompaniment of a christmas landscape and he cheerfully accepted on the 24th of december the background of a low brooding sky on which the delicate tracery of leafless sprays and blacker chevaux de frise of pine was faintly etched as a consistent setting to the turrets and peacefully stacked chimneys of stukeley castle yet even in this disastrous eclipse of color and distance the harmonious outlines of the long gray irregular pile seemed to him as wonderful as ever it still dominated the whole landscape and as he had often fancied carried this subjection even to the human beings who had created it lived in it but which it seemed to have in some dull senile way dozed over and forgotten he vividly recalled the previous sunshine of an autumnal house party within its walls where some descendants of its old castellans encountered in long galleries or at the very door of their bedrooms looked as alien to the house as the barbarian himself  for the rest it may be found described in the local guidebooks with a view of its south front west front and great quadrangle it was alleged to be based on an encampment of the romansthat highly apocryphal race who seemed to have spent their time in getting up picnics on tessellated pavements where after hilariously emptying their pockets of their loose coin and throwing round their dishes they instantly built a road to escape by leaving no other record of their existence stow and dugdale had recorded the date when a norman favorite obtained the royal license to embattle it it had done duty on christmas cards with the questionable snow already referred to laid on thickly in crystal it had been lovingly portrayed by a fair countrywomanthe vivacious correspondent of the east machias sentinelin a combination of the most delightful feminine disregard of facts with the highest feminine respect for titles it was rich in a real and spiritual estate of tapestries paintings armor legends and ghosts everything the poet could wish for and indeed some things that decent prose might have possibly wished out of it were there  yet from the day that it had been forcibly seized by a parliamentary general until more recently when it had passed by the no less desperate conveyance of marriage into the hands of a friendly nobleman known to the western barbarian it had been supposed to suggest something or other more remarkable than itself few spectators said the guidebook even the most unimpassioned can stand in the courtyard and gaze upon those historic walls without feeling a thrill of awe etc the western barbarian had stood there gazed and felt no thrill the privileged guest said the grave historian passing in review the lineaments of the illustrious owners of stukeley as he slowly paces the sombre gallery must be conscious of emotions of no ordinary character etc etc the barbarian had been conscious of no such emotions and it was for this reason and believing he might experience them if left there in solitude with no distracting or extraneous humanity around him it had been agreed between him and the friendly nobleman who had fine barbarian instincts that as hethe friendly noblemanand his family were to spend their holidays abroad the barbarian should be allowed on the eve and day of christmas to stay at stukeley alone but added his host youll find it beastly lonely and although ive told the housekeeper to look after youyoud better go over to dine at audley friars where theres a big party and they know you and it will be a deuced deal more amusing anderi sayyou knowyoure really not looking out for ghosts and that sort of thing are you you know you fellows dont believe in themover there and the barbarian assuring him that this was a part of his deficient emotions it was settled then and there that he should come and that was why on the 24th of december the barbarian found himself gazing hopefully on the landscape with his portmanteau at his feet as he drove up the avenue  the ravens did not croak ominously from the battlements as he entered and the housekeeper although neither stately nor tall nor full of reminiscences of his late lordship the present earls father was very sensible and practical the barbarian could of course have his choice of roomsbutshe had thoughtremembering his tastes the last time that the long blue room exactly the long lowarched room with the faded blue tapestry looking upon the gallerycapital he had always liked that room from purely negative evidence he had every reason to believe that it was the one formidablelooking room in england that queen elizabeth had not slept in  when the footman had laid out his clothes and his step grew fainter along the passage until it was suddenly swallowed up with the closing of a red baize door in the turret staircase like a trap in an oubliette the whole building seemed to sink back into repose quiet it certainly was but not more so he remembered than when the chambers on either side were filled with guests and floating voices in the corridor were lost in those allabsorbing walls so far certainly this was no new experience it was past four he waited for the shadows to gather light thickened beyond his windows gradually the outflanking wall and part of a projecting terrace crumbled away in the darkness as if night were slowly reducing the castle the figures on the tapestry in his room stood out faintly the gallery seen through his open door barred with black spaces between the mullioned windows presently became obliterated as if invaded by a dull smoke from without but nothing moved nothing glimmered really this might become in time very stupid  he was startled however while dressing to see from his windows that the great banqueting hall was illuminated but on coming down was amused to find his dinner served on a small table in its oaken solitude lit by the large electric chandelierfor stukeley castle under its present lord had all the modern improvementsshining on the tattered banners and glancing mail above him it was evidently the housekeepers reading of some written suggestion of her noble master the barbarian in a flash of instinct imagined the passage  humor him as a harmless lunatic the plate is quite safe  declining the further offer of an illumination of the picture gallery grand drawingroom ballroom and chapel a few hours later he found himself wandering in the corridor with a single candle and a growing conviction of the hopelessness of his experiment the castle had as yet yielded to him nothing that he had not seen before in the distraction of company and the garishness of day it was becoming a trifle monotonous yet fineexceedingly and now that a change of wind had lifted the fog and the full moon shone on the lower half of the pictures of the gallery starting into the most artificial simulation of life a number of van dyke legs farthingales and fingers that would have deceived nobody it seemed gracious gentle and innocent beyond expression wandering down the gallery conscious of being more like a ghost than any of the painted figures and that they might reasonably object to him he wished he could meet the original of one of those pictured gallants and secretly compare his fingers with the copy he remembered an embroidered pair of gloves in a cabinet and a suit of armor on the wall that in measurement did not seem to bear out the delicacy of the one nor the majesty of the other it occurred to him also to satisfy a yearning he had once felt to try on a certain breastplate and steel cap that hung over an oaken settle it will be perceived that he was getting a good deal bored for thus caparisoned he listlessly and as will be seen imprudently allowed himself to sink back into a very modern chair and give way to a dreamy cogitation  what possible interest could the dead have in anything that was here admitting that they had any and that it was not the living whom the barbarian had always found most inclined to haunt the past would not a ghost of any decided convictions object to such a collection as his descendant had gathered in this gallery yonder idiot in silk and steel had blunderingly and cruelly persecuted his kinsman in leather and steel only a few panels distant would they care to meet here and if their human weaknesses had died with them what would bring them here at all and if not themwho then he stopped short the door at the lower end of the gallery had opened not stealthily not noiselessly but in an ordinary fashion and a number of figures dressed in the habiliments of a bygone age came trooping in they did not glide in nor float in but trampled in awkwardly clumsily and unfamiliarly gaping about them as they walked at the head was apparently a steward in a kind of livery who stopped once or twice and seemed to be pointing out and explaining certain objects in the room a flash of indignant intelligence filled the brain of the barbarian it seemed absurdimpossiblebut it was true it was a holiday excursion party of ghosts being shown over stukeley castle by a ghostly cicerone and as his measured monotonous voice rose on the christmas morning air it could be heard that he was actually showing off not the antiquities of the castle but the modern improvements  this ere gossipsthe barbarian instantly detected the fallacy of all the socalled mediaeval jargon he had readis the helectric bell which does away with our hold hordinary orn blowin and the hattendant waitin in the all for the usual without there who waits which all of us was accustomed to in mortal flesh you hobserve this button i press it so and it instantly rings a bell in the kitchen all and shows in fair letters the name of this ere galleryas we will see later

a hoarse cry of astonishment from the assemblage the barbarian felt an awful thrill as this searching insufferable light of the nineteenth century streamed suddenly upon the upturned vacanteyed and dull faces of those sightseers of the past but there was no responsive gleam in their eyes  it be the sun gasped an old woman in a gray cloak  toime to rouse out myryan and make the foire said the mediaeval arry the custodian smiled with superior toleration  but what do ee want o my old lanthorne asked a yellowjerkined stable boy pointing to an oldfashioned horned lantern tempus edward iii with this brave loight  you know said the custodian with condescending familiarity these mortals worship what they call curios and the antique and is lordship gave a matter of fifty pounds for that same lanthern thats what the modern folk come ere to seelike as ye  oive an old threelegged stool in whitechapel oill let his lordship ave cheapfor five quid suggested the humorist  the prentice wight knows not that he speaks truly for ere is a braver jest than is good folks wilt please ye to examine yon coffer pointing to an oaken chest  tis but poor stuff marry said maudlin  tis a cofferthe same being made in wardour street last yearis lordship gave one hundred pounds for it look at these wouldbe wormholesbut they were made with an auger marry we know what wormholes are  a ghastly grin spread over the faces of the spectral assembly as they gathered around the chest with silent laughter  wilt walk ere and see the phonograph in the libry made by hedison an hamerican which bottles up the voice and preserves it fresh for a hundred years tis a rare new fancy  rot said arry then turning to the giggling maudlin he whispered saw it las toime is lordship got a piece o moy moind that oi

mistresses as you were wont said maudlin to the cicerone twas a rare show last timethe modish silk gowns and farthingales in the closets  but there be no company this christmas said the custodian and is lordship does not entertain unless it be the new fool is lordship sent down ere today who has been mopin and moonin in the corridors as is ever the way of these wittol creatures when they are not heeded he was ere in a rare motley of his own choosing with which he thinks to raise a laugh a moment ago ye see him notnot avin the gift that belongs by right to my dread office tis a weird privilege i haveand may not be imparted to otherssave  save what good man steward prithee speak said marian earnestly  tis ever a shillin extra  there was no response a few of the more bashful ghosts thrust their hands in their pockets and looked awkwardly another way the barbarian felt a momentary relief followed by a slight pang of mortified vanity he was a little afraid of them the price was an extortion certainly but surely he was worth the extra shilling  he has brought but little braveries of attire into the castle continued the cicerone but i ave something ere which was found on the top of his portmanteau i wot ye know not the use of this to the barbarians intense indignation the cicerone produced from under his his the barbarians own opera hat marry what should be this read me this riddle to itand unyoke  a dozen vacant guesses were made as the showman held it aloft then with a conjurors gesture he suddenly placed his thumbs within the rim released the spring and extended the hat the assembly laughed again silently as before  tis a hat said the cicerone with a superior air  nay said maudlin give it here she took it curiously examined it and then with a sudden coquettish movement lifted it towards her own coifed head as if to try it on the cicerone suddenly sprang forward with a despairing gesture to prevent her and here the barbarian was conscious of a more startling revelation how and why he could not tell but he knew that the putting on of that article of his own dress would affect the young girl as the assumption of the steel cap and corselet had evidently affected him and that he would instantly become as visible to her as she and her companions had been to him he attempted to rise but was too late she had evaded the cicerone by ducking and facing in the direction of the barbarian clapped the hat on her head he saw the swift light of consciousness of astonishment of sudden fear spring into her eyes she shrieked he started struggled and awoke  but what was this he was alone in the moonlit gallery certainly the ghastly figures in their outlandish garb were gone he was awake and in his senses but in this first flash of real consciousness he could have sworn that something remained something terrorstricken and retreating even then before himsomething of the world modernand even as he gazed vanishing through the gallery door with the material flash and rustle of silk  he walked quietly to the door it was open ah no doubt he had forgotten to shut it fast a current of air or a sudden draught had opened it that noise had awakened him more than that remembering the lightning flash of dream consciousness it had been the cause of his dream yet for a few moments he listened attentively  what might have been the dull reverberation of a closing door in the direction of the housekeepers room on the lower story was all he heard he smiled for even that natural as it might be was less distinct and real than his absurd vision  nevertheless the next afternoon he concluded to walk over to audley friars for his christmas dinner its hospitable master greeted him cordially  but do you know my dear fellow he said when they were alone for a moment if you hadnt come by yourself id have sent over there for you the fact is that a wrote to us that you were down at stukeley alone ghosthunting or something of that sort and im afraid it leaked out among the young people of our party two of our girlsi shant tell you whichstole over there last night to give you a start of some kind they didnt see you at all but by jove it seems they got the biggest kind of a fright themselves for they declare that something dreadful in armor you know was sitting in the gallery awfully good joke wasnt it of course you didnt see anythingdid you  no said the barbarian discreetly
