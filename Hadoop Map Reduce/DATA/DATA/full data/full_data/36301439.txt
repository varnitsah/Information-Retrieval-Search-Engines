youre a poet poet laureate        and representative of all the race      although tis true that you turned out a tory at        last yours has lately been a common case      and now my epic renegade what are ye at        with all the lakers in and out of place      a nest of tuneful persons to my eye      like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye       which pye being opened they began to sing        this old song and new simile holds good      a dainty dish to set before the king        or regent who admires such kind of food      and coleridge too has lately taken wing        but like a hawk encumbered with his hood      explaining metaphysics to the nation      i wish he would explain his explanation       you bob are rather insolent you know        at being disappointed in your wish      to supersede all warblers here below        and be the only blackbird in the dish      and then you overstrain yourself or so        and tumble downward like the flying fish      gasping on deck because you soar too high      bob and fall for lack of moisture quite a dry bob       and wordsworth in a rather long excursion        i think the quarto holds five hundred pages      has given a sample from the vasty version        of his new system to perplex the sages      tis poetry at least by his assertion        and may appear so when the dog star rages      and he who understands it would be able      to add a story to the tower of babel       you gentlemen by dint of long seclusion        from better company have kept your own      at keswick and through still continued fusion        of one anothers minds at last have grown      to deem as a most logical conclusion        that poesy has wreaths for you alone      there is a narrowness in such a notion      which makes me wish youd change your lakes for ocean       i would not imitate the petty thought        nor coin my selflove to so base a vice      for all the glory your conversion brought        since gold alone should not have been its price      you have your salary wast for that you wrought        and wordsworth has his place in the excise      youre shabby fellowstruebut poets still      and duly seated on the immortal hill       your bays may hide the baldness of your brows        perhaps some virtuous blushes let them go      to you i envy neither fruit nor boughs        and for the fame you would engross below      the field is universal and allows        scope to all such as feel the inherent glow      scott rogers campbell moore and crabbe will try      gainst you the question with posterity       for me who wandering with pedestrian muses        contend not with you on the winged steed      i wish your fate may yield ye when she chooses        the fame you envy and the skill you need      and recollect a poet nothing loses        in giving to his brethren their full meed      of merit and complaint of present days      is not the certain path to future praise       he that reserves his laurels for posterity        who does not often claim the bright reversion      has generally no great crop to spare it he        being only injured by his own assertion      and although here and there some glorious rarity        arise like titan from the seas immersion      the major part of such appellants go      togod knows wherefor no one else can know       if fallen in evil days on evil tongues        milton appealed to the avenger time      if time the avenger execrates his wrongs        and makes the word miltonic mean sublime      he deigned not to belie his soul in songs        nor turn his very talent to a crime      he did not loathe the sire to laud the son      but closed the tyranthater he begun       thinkst thou could he the blind old man arise        like samuel from the grave to freeze once more      the blood of monarchs with his prophecies         or be alive againagain all hoar      with time and trials and those helpless eyes        and heartless daughtersworn and pale and poor      would he adore a sultan he obey      the intellectual eunuch castlereagh       coldblooded smoothfaced placid miscreant        dabbling its sleek young hands in erins gore      and thus for wider carnage taught to pant        transferred to gorge upon a sister shore      the vulgarest tool that tyranny could want        with just enough of talent and no more      to lengthen fetters by another fixed      and offer poison long already mixed       an orator of such set trash of phrase        ineffably legitimately vile      that even its grossest flatterers dare not praise        nor foesall nationscondescend to smile      not even a sprightly blunders spark can blaze        from that ixion grindstones ceaseless toil      that turns and turns to give the world a notion      of endless torments and perpetual motion       a bungler even in its disgusting trade        and botching patching leaving still behind      something of which its masters are afraid        states to be curbed and thoughts to be confined      conspiracy or congress to be made        cobbling at manacles for all mankind      a tinkering slavemaker who mends old chains      with god and mans abhorrence for its gains       if we may judge of matter by the mind      emasculated to the marrow it      hath but two objects how to serve and bind      deeming the chain it wears even men may fit      eutropius of its many masters blind      to worth as freedom wisdom as to wit      fearless because no feeling dwells in ice      its very courage stagnates to a vice       where shall i turn me not to view its bonds        for i will never feel them italy      thy late reviving roman soul desponds        beneath the lie this statething breathed oer thee      thy clanking chain and erins yet green wounds        have voices tongues to cry aloud for me      europe has slaves allies kings armies still      and southey lives to sing them very ill       meantime sir laureate i proceed to dedicate        in honest simple verse this song to you      and if in flattering strains i do not predicate        tis that i still retain my buff and blue      my politics as yet are all to educate        apostasys so fashionable too      to keep one creeds a task grown quite      herculean is it not so my tory ultrajulian     canto the first       i want a hero an uncommon want        when every year and month sends forth a new one      till after cloying the gazettes with cant        the age discovers he is not the true one      of such as these i should not care to vaunt        i ll therefore take our ancient friend don juan      we all have seen him in the pantomime      sent to the devil somewhat ere his time       vernon the butcher cumberland wolfe hawke        prince ferdinand granby burgoyne keppel howe      evil and good have had their tithe of talk        and filld their sign posts then like wellesley now      each in their turn like banquos

of the military set      exceedingly remarkable at times      but not at all adapted to my rhymes       nelson was once britannias god of war        and still should be so but the tide is turnd      there s no more to be said of trafalgar        t is with our hero quietly inurnd      because the army s grown more popular        at which the naval people are concernd      besides the prince is all for the landservice      forgetting duncan nelson howe and jervis       brave men were living before agamemnon        and since exceeding valorous and sage      a good deal like him too though quite the same none        but then they shone not on the poets page      and so have been forgotteni condemn none        but cant find any in the present age      fit for my poem that is for my new one      so as i said i ll take my friend don juan       most epic poets plunge in medias res        horace makes this the heroic turnpike road      and then your hero tells wheneer you please        what went beforeby way of episode      while seated after dinner at his ease        beside his mistress in some soft abode      palace or garden paradise or cavern      which serves the happy couple for a tavern       that is the usual method but not mine        my way is to begin with the beginning      the regularity of my design        forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning      and therefore i shall open with a line        although it cost me half an hour in spinning      narrating somewhat of don juans father      and also of his mother if you d rather       in seville was he born a pleasant city        famous for oranges and womenhe      who has not seen it will be much to pity        so says the proverband i quite agree      of all the spanish towns is none more pretty        cadiz perhapsbut that you soon may see      don juans parents lived beside the river      a noble stream and calld the guadalquivir       his fathers name was josedon of course        a true hidalgo free from every stain      of moor or hebrew blood he traced his source        through the most gothic gentlemen of spain      a better cavalier neer mounted horse        or being mounted eer got down again      than jose who begot our hero who      begotbut that s to comewell to renew       his mother was a learned lady famed        for every branch of every science known      in every christian language ever named        with virtues equalld by her wit alone      she made the cleverest people quite ashamed        and even the good with inward envy groan      finding themselves so very much exceeded      in their own way by all the things that she did       her memory was a mine she knew by heart        all calderon and greater part of lope      so that if any actor missd his part        she could have served him for the prompters copy      for her feinagles were an useless art        and he himself obliged to shut up shophe      could never make a memory so fine as      that which adornd the brain of donna inez       her favourite science was the mathematical        her noblest virtue was her magnanimity      her wit she sometimes tried at wit was attic all        her serious sayings darkend to sublimity      in short in all things she was fairly what i call        a prodigyher morning dress was dimity      her evening silk or in the summer muslin      and other stuffs with which i wont stay puzzling       she knew the latinthat is the lords prayer        and greekthe alphabeti m nearly sure      she read some french romances here and there        although her mode of speaking was not pure      for native spanish she had no great care        at least her conversation was obscure      her thoughts were theorems her words a problem      as if she deemd that mystery would ennoble em       she liked the english and the hebrew tongue        and said there was analogy between em      she proved it somehow out of sacred song        but i must leave the proofs to those who ve seen em      but this i heard her say and cant be wrong        and all may think which way their judgments lean em      t is strangethe hebrew noun which means i am      the english always use to govern dn       some women use their tonguesshe lookd a lecture        each eye a sermon and her brow a homily      an allinall sufficient selfdirector        like the lamented late sir samuel romilly      the laws expounder and the states corrector        whose suicide was almost an anomaly      one sad example more that all is vanity      the jury brought their verdict in insanity       in short she was a walking calculation        miss edgeworths novels stepping from their covers      or mrs trimmers books on education        or coelebs wife set out in quest of lovers      moralitys prim personification        in which not envys self a flaw discovers      to others share let female errors fall      for she had not even onethe worst of all       o she was perfect past all parallel        of any modern female saints comparison      so far above the cunning powers of hell        her guardian angel had given up his garrison      even her minutest motions went as well        as those of the best timepiece made by harrison      in virtues nothing earthly could surpass her      save thine incomparable oil macassar       perfect she was but as perfection is        insipid in this naughty world of ours      where our first parents never learnd to kiss        till they were exiled from their earlier bowers      where all was peace and innocence and bliss        i wonder how they got through the twelve hours      don jose like a lineal son of eve      went plucking various fruit without her leave       he was a mortal of the careless kind        with no great love for learning or the learnd      who chose to go whereer he had a mind        and never dreamd his lady was concernd      the world as usual wickedly inclined        to see a kingdom or a house oerturnd      whisperd he had a mistress some said two      but for domestic quarrels one will do       now donna inez had with all her merit        a great opinion of her own good qualities      neglect indeed requires a saint to bear it        and such indeed she was in her moralities      but then she had a devil of a spirit        and sometimes mixd up fancies with realities      and let few opportunities escape      of getting her liege lord into a scrape       this was an easy matter with a man        oft in the wrong and never on his guard      and even the wisest do the best they can        have moments hours and days so unprepared      that you might brain them with their ladys fan        and sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard      and fans turn into falchions in fair hands      and why and wherefore no one understands       t is pity learned virgins ever wed        with persons of no sort of education      or gentlemen who though well born and bred        grow tired of scientific conversation      i dont choose to say much upon this head        i m a plain man and in a single station      butoh ye lords of ladies intellectual      inform us truly have they not henpeckd you all       don jose and his lady quarrelldwhy        not any of the many could divine      though several thousand people chose to try        t was surely no concern of theirs nor mine      i loathe that low vicecuriosity        but if there s anything in which i shine      t is in arranging all my friends affairs      not having of my own domestic cares       and so i interfered and with the best        intentions but their treatment was not kind      i think the foolish people were possessd        for neither of them could i ever find      although their porter afterwards confessd        but that s no matter and the worst s behind      for little juan oer me threw down stairs      a pail of housemaids water unawares       a little curlyheaded goodfornothing        and mischiefmaking monkey from his birth      his parents neer agreed except in doting        upon the most unquiet imp on earth      instead of quarrelling had they been but both in        their senses they d have sent young master forth      to school or had him soundly whippd at home      to teach him manners for the time to come       don jose and the donna inez led        for some time an unhappy sort of life      wishing each other not divorced but dead        they lived respectably as man and wife      their conduct was exceedingly wellbred        and gave no outward signs of inward strife      until at length the smotherd fire broke out      and put the business past all kind of doubt       for inez calld some druggists and physicians        and tried to prove her loving lord was mad      but as he had some lucid intermissions        she next decided he was only bad      yet when they askd her for her depositions        no sort of explanation could be had      save that her duty both to man and god      required this conductwhich seemd very odd       she kept a journal where his faults were noted        and opend certain trunks of books and letters      all which might if occasion served be quoted        and then she had all seville for abettors      besides her good old grandmother who doted        the hearers of her case became repeaters      then advocates inquisitors and judges      some for amusement others for old grudges       and then this best and weakest woman bore        with such serenity her husbands woes      just as the spartan ladies did of yore        who saw their spouses killd and nobly chose      never to say a word about them more        calmly she heard each calumny that rose      and saw his agonies with such sublimity      that all the world exclaimd what magnanimity       no doubt this patience when the world is damning us        is philosophic in our former friends      t is also pleasant to be deemd magnanimous        the more so in obtaining our own ends      and what the lawyers call a malus animus        conduct like this by no means comprehends      revenge in person s certainly no virtue      but then t is not my fault if others hurt you       and if your quarrels should rip up old stories        and help them with a lie or two additional      i m not to blame as you well knowno more is        any one elsethey were become traditional      besides their resurrection aids our glories        by contrast which is what we just were wishing all      and science profits by this resurrection      dead scandals form good subjects for dissection       their friends had tried at reconciliation        then their relations who made matters worse      t were hard to tell upon a like occasion        to whom it may be best to have recourse      i cant say much for friend or yet relation        the lawyers did their utmost for divorce      but scarce a fee was paid on either side      before unluckily don jose died       he died and most unluckily because        according to all hints i could collect      from counsel learned in those kinds of laws        although their talk s obscure and circumspect      his death contrived to spoil a charming cause        a thousand pities also with respect      to public feeling which on this occasion      was manifested in a great sensation       but ah he died and buried with him lay        the public feeling and the lawyers fees      his house was sold his servants sent away        a jew took one of his two mistresses      a priest the otherat least so they say        i askd the doctors after his disease      he died of the slow fever calld the tertian      and left his widow to her own aversion       yet jose was an honourable man        that i must say who knew him very well      therefore his frailties i ll no further scan        indeed there were not many more to tell      and if his passions now and then outran        discretion and were not so peaceable      as numas who was also named pompilius      he had been ill brought up and was born bilious       whateer might be his worthlessness or worth        poor fellow he had many things to wound him      let s ownsince it can do no good on earth        it was a trying moment that which found him      standing alone beside his desolate hearth        where all his household gods lay shiverd round him      no choice was left his feelings or his pride      save death or doctors commonsso he died       dying intestate juan was sole heir        to a chancery suit and messuages and lands      which with a long minority and care        promised to turn out well in proper hands      inez became sole guardian which was fair        and answerd but to natures just demands      an only son left with an only mother      is brought up much more wisely than another       sagest of women even of widows she        resolved that juan should be quite a paragon      and worthy of the noblest pedigree        his sire was of castile his dam from aragon      then for accomplishments of chivalry        in case our lord the king should go to war again      he learnd the arts of riding fencing gunnery      and how to scale a fortressor a nunnery       but that which donna inez most desired        and saw into herself each day before all      the learned tutors whom for him she hired        was that his breeding should be strictly moral      much into all his studies she inquired        and so they were submitted first to her all      arts sciences no branch was made a mystery      to juans eyes excepting natural history       the languages especially the dead        the sciences and most of all the abstruse      the arts at least all such as could be said        to be the most remote from common use      in all these he was much and deeply read        but not a page of any thing that s loose      or hints continuation of the species      was ever sufferd lest he should grow vicious       his classic studies made a little puzzle        because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses      who in the earlier ages raised a bustle        but never put on pantaloons or bodices      his reverend tutors had at times a tussle        and for their aeneids iliads and odysseys      were forced to make an odd sort of apology      for donna inez dreaded the mythology       ovid s a rake as half his verses show him        anacreons morals are a still worse sample      catullus scarcely has a decent poem        i dont think sapphos ode a good example      although longinus tells us there is no hymn        where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample      but virgils songs are pure except that horrid one      beginning with formosum pastor corydon       lucretius irreligion is too strong        for early stomachs to prove wholesome food      i cant help thinking juvenal was wrong        although no doubt his real intent was good      for speaking out so plainly in his song        so much indeed as to be downright rude      and then what proper person can be partial      to all those nauseous epigrams of martial       juan was taught from out the best edition        expurgated by learned men who place      judiciously from out the schoolboys vision        the grosser parts but fearful to deface      too much their modest bard by this omission        and pitying sore his mutilated case      they only add them all in an appendix      which saves in fact the trouble of an index       for there we have them all at one fell swoop        instead of being scatterd through the pages      they stand forth marshalld in a handsome troop        to meet the ingenuous youth of future ages      till some less rigid editor shall stoop        to call them back into their separate cages      instead of standing staring all together      like garden godsand not so decent either       the missal too it was the family missal        was ornamented in a sort of way      which ancient massbooks often are and this all        kinds of grotesques illumined and how they      who saw those figures on the margin kiss all        could turn their optics to the text and pray      is more than i knowbut don juans mother      kept this herself and gave her son another       sermons he read and lectures he endured        and homilies and lives of all the saints      to jerome and to chrysostom inured        he did not take such studies for restraints      but how faith is acquired and then ensured        so well not one of the aforesaid paints      as saint augustine in his fine confessions      which make the reader envy his transgressions       this too was a seald book to little juan        i cant but say that his mamma was right      if such an education was the true one        she scarcely trusted him from out her sight      her maids were old and if she took a new one        you might be sure she was a perfect fright      she did this during even her husbands life      i recommend as much to every wife       young juan waxd in goodliness and grace        at six a charming child and at eleven      with all the promise of as fine a face        as eer to mans maturer growth was given      he studied steadily and grew apace        and seemd at least in the right road to heaven      for half his days were passd at church the other      between his tutors confessor and mother       at six i said he was a charming child        at twelve he was a fine but quiet boy      although in infancy a little wild        they tamed him down amongst them to destroy      his natural spirit not in vain they toild        at least it seemd so and his mothers joy      was to declare how sage and still and steady      her young philosopher was grown already       i had my doubts perhaps i have them still        but what i say is neither here nor there      i knew his father well and have some skill        in characterbut it would not be fair      from sire to son to augur good or ill        he and his wife were an illsorted pair      but scandal s my aversioni protest      against all evil speaking even in jest       for my part i say nothingnothingbut        this i will saymy reasons are my own      that if i had an only son to put        to school as god be praised that i have none      t is not with donna inez i would shut        him up to learn his catechism alone      nonoi d send him out betimes to college      for there it was i pickd up my own knowledge       for there one learnst is not for me to boast        though i acquiredbut i pass over that      as well as all the greek i since have lost        i say that there s the placebut verbum sat      i think i pickd up too as well as most        knowledge of mattersbut no matter what      i never marriedbut i think i know      that sons should not be educated so       young juan now was sixteen years of age        tall handsome slender but well knit he seemd      active though not so sprightly as a page        and everybody but his mother deemd      him almost man but she flew in a rage        and bit her lips for else she might have screamd      if any said so for to be precocious      was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious       amongst her numerous acquaintance all        selected for discretion and devotion      there was the donna julia whom to call        pretty were but to give a feeble notion      of many charms in her as natural        as sweetness to the flower or salt to ocean      her zone to venus or his bow to cupid      but this last simile is trite and stupid       the darkness of her oriental eye        accorded with her moorish origin      her blood was not all spanish by the by        in spain you know this is a sort of sin      when proud granada fell and forced to fly        boabdil wept of donna julias kin      some went to africa some stayd in spain      her greatgreatgrandmamma chose to remain       she married i forget the pedigree        with an hidalgo who transmitted down      his blood less noble than such blood should be        at such alliances his sires would frown      in that point so precise in each degree        that they bred in and in as might be shown      marrying their cousinsnay their aunts and nieces      which always spoils the breed if it increases       this heathenish cross restored the breed again        ruind its blood but much improved its flesh      for from a root the ugliest in old spain        sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh      the sons no more were short the daughters plain        but there s a rumour which i fain would hush      t is said that donna julias grandmamma      produced her don more heirs at love than law       however this might be the race went on        improving still through every generation      until it centred in an only son        who left an only daughter my narration      may have suggested that this single one        could be but julia whom on this occasion      i shall have much to speak about and she      was married charming chaste and twentythree       her eye i m very fond of handsome eyes        was large and dark suppressing half its fire      until she spoke then through its soft disguise        flashd an expression more of pride than ire      and love than either and there would arise        a something in them which was not desire      but would have been perhaps but for the soul      which struggled through and chastend down the whole       her glossy hair was clusterd oer a brow        bright with intelligence and fair and smooth      her eyebrows shape was like th aerial bow        her cheek all purple with the beam of youth      mounting at times to a transparent glow        as if her veins ran lightning she in sooth      possessd an air and grace by no means common      her stature talli hate a dumpy woman       wedded she was some years and to a man        of fifty and such husbands are in plenty      and yet i think instead of such a one        t were better to have two of fiveandtwenty      especially in countries near the sun        and now i think on t mi vien in mente      ladies even of the most uneasy virtue      prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty       t is a sad thing i cannot choose but say        and all the fault of that indecent sun      who cannot leave alone our helpless clay        but will keep baking broiling burning on      that howsoever people fast and pray        the flesh is frail and so the soul undone      what men call gallantry and gods adultery      is much more common where the climate s sultry       happy the nations of the moral north        where all is virtue and the winter season      sends sin without a rag on shivering forth        t was snow that brought st anthony to reason      where juries cast up what a wife is worth        by laying whateer sum in mulct they please on      the lover who must pay a handsome price      because it is a marketable vice       alfonso was the name of julias lord        a man well looking for his years and who      was neither much beloved nor yet abhorrd        they lived together as most people do      suffering each others foibles by accord        and not exactly either one or two      yet he was jealous though he did not show it      for jealousy dislikes the world to know it       julia wasyet i never could see why        with donna inez quite a favourite friend      between their tastes there was small sympathy        for not a line had julia ever pennd      some people whisper but no doubt they lie        for malice still imputes some private end      that inez had ere don alfonsos marriage      forgot with him her very prudent carriage       and that still keeping up the old connection        which time had lately renderd much more chaste      she took his lady also in affection        and certainly this course was much the best      she flatterd julia with her sage protection        and complimented don alfonsos taste      and if she could not who can silence scandal      at least she left it a more slender handle       i cant tell whether julia saw the affair        with other peoples eyes or if her own      discoveries made but none could be aware        of this at least no symptom eer was shown      perhaps she did not know or did not care        indifferent from the first or callous grown      i m really puzzled what to think or say      she kept her counsel in so close a way       juan she saw and as a pretty child        caressd him oftensuch a thing might be      quite innocently done and harmless styled        when she had twenty years and thirteen he      but i am not so sure i should have smiled        when he was sixteen julia twentythree      these few short years make wondrous alterations      particularly amongst sunburnt nations       whateer the cause might be they had become        changed for the dame grew distant the youth shy      their looks cast down their greetings almost dumb        and much embarrassment in either eye      there surely will be little doubt with some        that donna julia knew the reason why      but as for juan he had no more notion      than he who never saw the sea of ocean       yet julias very coldness still was kind        and tremulously gentle her small hand      withdrew itself from his but left behind        a little pressure thrilling and so bland      and slight so very slight that to the mind        t was but a doubt but neer magicians wand      wrought change with all armidas fairy art      like what this light touch left on juans heart       and if she met him though she smiled no more        she lookd a sadness sweeter than her smile      as if her heart had deeper thoughts in store        she must not own but cherishd more the while      for that compression in its burning core        even innocence itself has many a wile      and will not dare to trust itself with truth      and love is taught hypocrisy from youth       but passion most dissembles yet betrays        even by its darkness as the blackest sky      foretells the heaviest tempest it displays        its workings through the vainly guarded eye      and in whatever aspect it arrays        itself t is still the same hypocrisy      coldness or anger even disdain or hate      are masks it often wears and still too late       then there were sighs the deeper for suppression        and stolen glances sweeter for the theft      and burning blushes though for no transgression        tremblings when met and restlessness when left      all these are little preludes to possession        of which young passion cannot be bereft      and merely tend to show how greatly love is      embarrassd at first starting with a novice       poor julias heart was in an awkward state        she felt it going and resolved to make      the noblest efforts for herself and mate        for honours prides religions virtues sake      her resolutions were most truly great        and almost might have made a tarquin quake      she prayd the virgin mary for her grace      as being the best judge of a ladys case       she vowd she never would see juan more        and next day paid a visit to his mother      and lookd extremely at the opening door        which by the virgins grace let in another      grateful she was and yet a little sore        again it opens it can be no other      t is surely juan nowno i m afraid      that night the virgin was no further prayd       she now determined that a virtuous woman        should rather face and overcome temptation      that flight was base and dastardly and no man        should ever give her heart the least sensation      that is to say a thought beyond the common        preference that we must feel upon occasion      for people who are pleasanter than others      but then they only seem so many brothers       and even if by chanceand who can tell        the devil s so very slyshe should discover      that all within was not so very well        and if still free that such or such a lover      might please perhaps a virtuous wife can quell        such thoughts and be the better when they re over      and if the man should ask t is but denial      i recommend young ladies to make trial       and then there are such things as love divine        bright and immaculate unmixd and pure      such as the angels think so very fine        and matrons who would be no less secure      platonic perfect just such love as mine        thus julia saidand thought so to be sure      and so i d have her think were i the man      on whom her reveries celestial ran       such love is innocent and may exist        between young persons without any danger      a hand may first and then a lip be kist        for my part to such doings i m a stranger      but hear these freedoms form the utmost list        of all oer which such love may be a ranger      if people go beyond t is quite a crime      but not my faulti tell them all in time       love then but love within its proper limits        was julias innocent determination      in young don juans favour and to him its        exertion might be useful on occasion      and lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its        ethereal lustre with what sweet persuasion      he might be taught by love and her together      i really dont know what nor julia either       fraught with this fine intention and well fenced        in mail of proofher purity of soul      she for the future of her strength convinced        and that her honour was a rock or mole      exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed        with any kind of troublesome control      but whether julia to the task was equal      is that which must be mentiond in the sequel       her plan she deemd both innocent and feasible        and surely with a stripling of sixteen      not scandals fangs could fix on much that s seizable        or if they did so satisfied to mean      nothing but what was good her breast was peaceable        a quiet conscience makes one so serene      christians have burnt each other quite persuaded      that all the apostles would have done as they did       and if in the mean time her husband died        but heaven forbid that such a thought should cross      her brain though in a dream and then she sighd        never could she survive that common loss      but just suppose that moment should betide        i only say suppose itinter nos      this should be entre nous for julia thought      in french but then the rhyme would go for naught       i only say suppose this supposition        juan being then grown up to mans estate      would fully suit a widow of condition        even seven years hence it would not be too late      and in the interim to pursue this vision        the mischief after all could not be great      for he would learn the rudiments of love      i mean the seraph way of those above       so much for julia now we ll turn to juan        poor little fellow he had no idea      of his own case and never hit the true one        in feelings quick as ovids miss medea      he puzzled over what he found a new one        but not as yet imagined it could be      thing quite in course and not at all alarming      which with a little patience might grow charming       silent and pensive idle restless slow        his home deserted for the lonely wood      tormented with a wound he could not know        his like all deep grief plunged in solitude      i m fond myself of solitude or so        but then i beg it may be understood      by solitude i mean a sultans not      a hermits with a haram for a grot       oh love in such a wilderness as this        where transport and security entwine      here is the empire of thy perfect bliss        and here thou art a god indeed divine      the bard i quote from does not sing amiss        with the exception of the second line      for that same twining transport and security      are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity       the poet meant no doubt and thus appeals        to the good sense and senses of mankind      the very thing which every body feels        as all have found on trial or may find      that no one likes to be disturbd at meals        or lovei wont say more about entwined      or transport as we knew all that before      but beg security will bolt the door       young juan wanderd by the glassy brooks        thinking unutterable things he threw      himself at length within the leafy nooks        where the wild branch of the cork forest grew      there poets find materials for their books        and every now and then we read them through      so that their plan and prosody are eligible      unless like wordsworth they prove unintelligible       he juan and not wordsworth so pursued        his selfcommunion with his own high soul      until his mighty heart in its great mood        had mitigated part though not the whole      of its disease he did the best he could        with things not very subject to control       and turnd without perceiving his condition      like coleridge into a metaphysician       he thought about himself and the whole earth        of man the wonderful and of the stars      and how the deuce they ever could have birth        and then he thought of earthquakes and of wars      how many miles the moon might have in girth        of airballoons and of the many bars      to perfect knowledge of the boundless skies      and then he thought of donna julias eyes       in thoughts like these true wisdom may discern        longings sublime and aspirations high      which some are born with but the most part learn        to plague themselves withal they know not why      t was strange that one so young should thus concern        his brain about the action of the sky      if you think t was philosophy that this did      i cant help thinking puberty assisted       he pored upon the leaves and on the flowers        and heard a voice in all the winds and then      he thought of woodnymphs and immortal bowers        and how the goddesses came down to men      he missd the pathway he forgot the hours        and when he lookd upon his watch again      he found how much old time had been a winner      he also found that he had lost his dinner       sometimes he turnd to gaze upon his book        boscan or garcilassoby the wind      even as the page is rustled while we look        so by the poesy of his own mind      over the mystic leaf his soul was shook        as if t were one whereon magicians bind      their spells and give them to the passing gale      according to some good old womans tale       thus would he while his lonely hours away        dissatisfied nor knowing what he wanted      nor glowing reverie nor poets lay        could yield his spirit that for which it panted      a bosom whereon he his head might lay        and hear the heart beat with the love it granted      withseveral other things which i forget      or which at least i need not mention yet       those lonely walks and lengthening reveries        could not escape the gentle julias eyes      she saw that juan was not at his ease        but that which chiefly may and must surprise      is that the donna inez did not tease        her only son with question or surmise      whether it was she did not see or would not      or like all very clever people could not       this may seem strange but yet t is very common        for instancegentlemen whose ladies take      leave to oerstep the written rights of woman        and break thewhich commandment is t they break      i have forgot the number and think no man        should rashly quote for fear of a mistake      i say when these same gentlemen are jealous      they make some blunder which their ladies tell us       a real husband always is suspicious        but still no less suspects in the wrong place      jealous of some one who had no such wishes        or pandering blindly to his own disgrace      by harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious        the last indeed s infallibly the case      and when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly      he wonders at their vice and not his folly       thus parents also are at times shortsighted        though watchful as the lynx they neer discover      the while the wicked world beholds delighted        young hopefuls mistress or miss fannys lover      till some confounded escapade has blighted        the plan of twenty years and all is over      and then the mother cries the father swears      and wonders why the devil he got heirs       but inez was so anxious and so clear        of sight that i must think on this occasion      she had some other motive much more near        for leaving juan to this new temptation      but what that motive was i shant say here        perhaps to finish juans education      perhaps to open don alfonsos eyes      in case he thought his wife too great a prize       it was upon a day a summers day        summers indeed a very dangerous season      and so is spring about the end of may        the sun no doubt is the prevailing reason      but whatsoeer the cause is one may say        and stand convicted of more truth than treason      that there are months which nature grows more merry in      march has its hares and may must have its heroine       t was on a summers daythe sixth of june        i like to be particular in dates      not only of the age and year but moon        they are a sort of posthouse where the fates      change horses making history change its tune        then spur away oer empires and oer states      leaving at last not much besides chronology      excepting the postobits of theology       t was on the sixth of june about the hour        of halfpast sixperhaps still nearer seven      when julia sate within as pretty a bower        as eer held houri in that heathenish heaven      described by mahomet and anacreon moore        to whom the lyre and laurels have been given      with all the trophies of triumphant song      he won them well and may he wear them long       she sate but not alone i know not well        how this same interview had taken place      and even if i knew i should not tell        people should hold their tongues in any case      no matter how or why the thing befell        but there were she and juan face to face      when two such faces are so t would be wise      but very difficult to shut their eyes       how beautiful she lookd her conscious heart        glowd in her cheek and yet she felt no wrong      o love how perfect is thy mystic art        strengthening the weak and trampling on the strong      how selfdeceitful is the sagest part        of mortals whom thy lure hath led along      the precipice she stood on was immense      so was her creed in her own innocence       she thought of her own strength and juans youth        and of the folly of all prudish fears      victorious virtue and domestic truth        and then of don alfonsos fifty years      i wish these last had not occurrd in sooth        because that number rarely much endears      and through all climes the snowy and the sunny      sounds ill in love whateer it may in money       when people say ive told you fifty times        they mean to scold and very often do      when poets say ive written fifty rhymes        they make you dread that they ll recite them too      in gangs of fifty thieves commit their crimes        at fifty love for love is rare t is true      but then no doubt it equally as true is      a good deal may be bought for fifty louis       julia had honour virtue truth and love        for don alfonso and she inly swore      by all the vows below to powers above        she never would disgrace the ring she wore      nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove        and while she ponderd this besides much more      one hand on juans carelessly was thrown      quite by mistakeshe thought it was her own       unconsciously she leand upon the other        which playd within the tangles of her hair      and to contend with thoughts she could not smother        she seemd by the distraction of her air      t was surely very wrong in juans mother        to leave together this imprudent pair      she who for many years had watchd her son so      i m very certain mine would not have done so       the hand which still held juans by degrees        gently but palpably confirmd its grasp      as if it said detain me if you please        yet there s no doubt she only meant to clasp      his fingers with a pure platonic squeeze        she would have shrunk as from a toad or asp      had she imagined such a thing could rouse      a feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse       i cannot know what juan thought of this        but what he did is much what you would do      his young lip thankd it with a grateful kiss        and then abashd at its own joy withdrew      in deep despair lest he had done amiss        love is so very timid when t is new      she blushd and frownd not but she strove to speak      and held her tongue her voice was grown so weak       the sun set and up rose the yellow moon        the devil s in the moon for mischief they      who calld her chaste methinks began too soon        their nomenclature there is not a day      the longest not the twentyfirst of june        sees half the business in a wicked way      on which three single hours of moonshine smile      and then she looks so modest all the while       there is a dangerous silence in that hour        a stillness which leaves room for the full soul      to open all itself without the power        of calling wholly back its selfcontrol      the silver light which hallowing tree and tower        sheds beauty and deep softness oer the whole      breathes also to the heart and oer it throws      a loving languor which is not repose       and julia sate with juan half embraced        and half retiring from the glowing arm      which trembled like the bosom where t was placed        yet still she must have thought there was no harm      or else t were easy to withdraw her waist        but then the situation had its charm      and thengod knows what nexti cant go on      i m almost sorry that i eer begun       o plato plato you have paved the way        with your confounded fantasies to more      immoral conduct by the fancied sway        your system feigns oer the controulless core      of human hearts than all the long array        of poets and romancersyou re a bore      a charlatan a coxcomband have been      at best no better than a gobetween       and julias voice was lost except in sighs        until too late for useful conversation      the tears were gushing from her gentle eyes        i wish indeed they had not had occasion      but who alas can love and then be wise        not that remorse did not oppose temptation      a little still she strove and much repented      and whispering i will neer consentconsented       t is said that xerxes offerd a reward        to those who could invent him a new pleasure      methinks the requisition s rather hard        and must have cost his majesty a treasure      for my part i m a moderateminded bard        fond of a little love which i call leisure      i care not for new pleasures as the old      are quite enough for me so they but hold       o pleasure you are indeed a pleasant thing        although one must be damnd for you no doubt      i make a resolution every spring        of reformation ere the year run out      but somehow this my vestal vow takes wing        yet still i trust it may be kept throughout      i m very sorry very much ashamed      and mean next winter to be quite reclaimd       here my chaste

    t was in november when fine days are few        and the far mountains wax a little hoary      and clap a white cape on their mantles blue        and the sea dashes round the promontory      and the loud breaker boils against the rock      and sober suns must set at five oclock       t was as the watchmen say a cloudy night        no moon no stars the wind was low or loud      by gusts and many a sparkling hearth was bright        with the piled wood round which the family crowd      there s something cheerful in that sort of light        even as a summer sky s without a cloud      i m fond of fire and crickets and all that      a lobster salad and champagne and chat       t was midnightdonna julia was in bed        sleeping most probablywhen at her door      arose a clatter might awake the dead        if they had never been awoke before      and that they have been so we all have read        and are to be so at the least once more      the door was fastend but with voice and fist      first knocks were heard then madammadamhist       for gods sake madammadamhere s my master        with more than half the city at his back      was ever heard of such a curst disaster        t is not my faulti kept good watchalack      do pray undo the bolt a little faster        they re on the stair just now and in a crack      will all be here perhaps he yet may fly      surely the window s not so very high       by this time don alfonso was arrived        with torches friends and servants in great number      the major part of them had long been wived        and therefore paused not to disturb the slumber      of any wicked woman who contrived        by stealth her husbands temples to encumber      examples of this kind are so contagious      were one not punishd all would be outrageous       i cant tell how or why or what suspicion        could enter into don alfonsos head      but for a cavalier of his condition        it surely was exceedingly illbred      without a word of previous admonition        to hold a levee round his ladys bed      and summon lackeys armd with fire and sword      to prove himself the thing he most abhorrd       poor donna julia starting as from sleep        mindthat i do not sayshe had not slept      began at once to scream and yawn and weep        her maid antonia who was an adept      contrived to fling the bedclothes in a heap        as if she had just now from out them crept      i cant tell why she should take all this trouble      to prove her mistress had been sleeping double       but julia mistress and antonia maid        appeard like two poor harmless women who      of goblins but still more of men afraid        had thought one man might be deterrd by two      and therefore side by side were gently laid        until the hours of absence should run through      and truant husband should return and say      my dear i was the first who came away       now julia found at length a voice and cried        in heavens name don alfonso what d ye mean      has madness seized you would that i had died        ere such a monsters victim i had been      what may this midnight violence betide        a sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen      dare you suspect me whom the thought would kill      search then the roomalfonso said i will       he searchd they searchd and rummaged everywhere        closet and clothes press chest and windowseat      and found much linen lace and several pair        of stockings slippers brushes combs complete      with other articles of ladies fair        to keep them beautiful or leave them neat      arras they prickd and curtains with their swords      and wounded several shutters and some boards       under the bed they searchd and there they found        no matter whatit was not that they sought      they opend windows gazing if the ground        had signs or footmarks but the earth said nought      and then they stared each others faces round        t is odd not one of all these seekers thought      and seems to me almost a sort of blunder      of looking in the bed as well as under       during this inquisition julias tongue        was not asleepyes search and search she cried      insult on insult heap and wrong on wrong        it was for this that i became a bride      for this in silence i have sufferd long        a husband like alfonso at my side      but now i ll bear no more nor here remain      if there be law or lawyers in all spain       yes don alfonso husband now no more        if ever you indeed deserved the name      is t worthy of your yearsyou have threescore        fifty or sixty it is all the same      is t wise or fitting causeless to explore        for facts against a virtuous womans fame      ungrateful perjured barbarous don alfonso      how dare you think your lady would go on so       is it for this i have disdaind to hold        the common privileges of my sex      that i have chosen a confessor so old        and deaf that any other it would vex      and never once he has had cause to scold        but found my very innocence perplex      so much he always doubted i was married      how sorry you will be when i ve miscarried       was it for this that no cortejo eer        i yet have chosen from out the youth of seville      is it for this i scarce went anywhere        except to bullfights mass play rout and revel      is it for this whateer my suitors were        i favord nonenay was almost uncivil      is it for this that general count oreilly      who took algiers declares i used him vilely       did not the italian musico cazzani        sing at my heart six months at least in vain      did not his countryman count corniani        call me the only virtuous wife in spain      were

forbearance not to beat        me also since the time so opportune is      o valiant man with sword drawn and cockd trigger      now tell me dont you cut a pretty figure       was it for this you took your sudden journey        under pretence of business indispensable      with that sublime of rascals your attorney        whom i see standing there and looking sensible      of having playd the fool though both i spurn he        deserves the worst his conduct s less defensible      because no doubt t was for his dirty fee      and not from any love to you nor me       if he comes here to take a deposition        by all means let the gentleman proceed      you ve made the apartment in a fit condition        there s pen and ink for you sir when you need      let every thing be noted with precision        i would not you for nothing should be feed      but as my maid s undrest pray turn your spies out      oh sobbd antonia i could tear their eyes out       there is the closet there the

would be too old for slaughter      or for so young a husbands jealous fears        antonia let me have a glass of water      i am ashamed of having shed these tears        they are unworthy of my fathers daughter      my mother dreamd not in my natal hour      that i should fall into a monsters power       perhaps t is of antonia you are jealous        you saw that she was sleeping by my side      when you broke in upon us with your fellows        look where you pleasewe ve nothing sir to hide      only another time i trust you ll tell us        or for the sake of decency abide      a moment at the door that we may be      drest to receive so much good company       and now sir i have done and say no more        the little i have said may serve to show      the guileless heart in silence may grieve oer        the wrongs to whose exposure it is slow      i leave you to your conscience as before        t will one day ask you why you used me so      god grant you feel not then the bitterest grief      antonia where s my pockethandkerchief       she ceased and turnd upon her pillow pale        she lay her dark eyes flashing through their tears      like skies that rain and lighten as a veil        waved and oershading her wan cheek appears      her streaming hair the black curls strive but fail        to hide the glossy shoulder which uprears      its snow through allher soft lips lie apart      and louder than her breathing beats her heart       the senhor don alfonso stood confused        antonia bustled round the ransackd room      and turning up her nose with looks abused        her master and his myrmidons of whom      not one except the attorney was amused        he like achates faithful to the tomb      so there were quarrels cared not for the cause      knowing they must be settled by the laws       with prying snubnose and small eyes he stood        following antonias motions here and there      with much suspicion in his attitude        for reputations he had little care      so that a suit or action were made good        small pity had he for the young and fair      and neer believed in negatives till these      were proved by competent false witnesses       but don alfonso stood with downcast looks        and truth to say he made a foolish figure      when after searching in five hundred nooks        and treating a young wife with so much rigour      he gaind no point except some selfrebukes        added to those his lady with such vigour      had pourd upon him for the last halfhour      quick thick and heavyas a thundershower       at first he tried to hammer an excuse        to which the sole reply was tears and sobs      and indications of hysterics whose        prologue is always certain throes and throbs      gasps and whatever else the owners choose        alfonso saw his wife and thought of jobs      he saw too in perspective her relations      and then he tried to muster all his patience       he stood in act to speak or rather stammer        but sage antonia cut him short before      the anvil of his speech received the hammer        with pray sir leave the room and say no more      or madam diesalfonso mutterd dn her        but nothing else the time of words was oer      he cast a rueful look or two and did      he knew not wherefore that which he was bid       with him retired his posse comitatus        the attorney last who lingerd near the door      reluctantly still tarrying there as late as        antonia let himnot a little sore      at this most strange and unexplaind hiatus        in don alfonsos facts which just now wore      an awkward look as he revolved the case      the door was fastend in his legal face       no sooner was it bolted thanoh shame        o sin oh sorrow and oh womankind      how can you do such things and keep your fame        unless this world and t other too be blind      nothing so dear as an unfilchd good name        but to proceedfor there is more behind      with much heartfelt reluctance be it said      young juan slippd halfsmotherd from the bed       he had been hidi dont pretend to say        how nor can i indeed describe the where      young slender and packd easily he lay        no doubt in little compass round or square      but pity him i neither must nor may        his suffocation by that pretty pair      t were better sure to die so than be shut      with maudlin clarence in his malmsey butt       and secondly i pity not because        he had no business to commit a sin      forbid by heavenly fined by human laws        at least t was rather early to begin      but at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws        so much as when we call our old debts in      at sixty years and draw the accompts of evil      and find a deuced balance with the devil       of his position i can give no notion        t is written in the hebrew chronicle      how the physicians leaving pill and potion        prescribed by way of blister a young belle      when old king davids blood grew dull in motion        and that the medicine answerd very well      perhaps t was in a different way applied      for david lived but juan nearly died       what s to be done alfonso will be back        the moment he has sent his fools away      antonias skill was put upon the rack        but no device could be brought into play      and how to parry the renewd attack        besides it wanted but few hours of day      antonia puzzled julia did not speak      but pressd her bloodless lip to juans cheek       he turnd his lip to hers and with his hand        calld back the tangles of her wandering hair      even then their love they could not all command        and half forgot their danger and despair      antonias patience now was at a stand        come come t is no time now for fooling there      she whisperd in great wrathi must deposit      this pretty gentleman within the closet       pray keep your nonsense for some luckier night        who can have put my master in this mood      what will become on ti m in such a fright        the devil s in the urchin and no good      is this a time for giggling this a plight        why dont you know that it may end in blood      you ll lose your life and i shall lose my place      my mistress all for that halfgirlish face       had it but been for a stout cavalier        of twentyfive or thirty come make haste      but for a child what piece of work is here        i really madam wonder at your taste      come sir get inmy master must be near        there for the present at the least hes fast      and if we can but till the morning keep      our counseljuan mind you must not sleep       now don alfonso entering but alone        closed the oration of the trusty maid      she loiterd and he told her to be gone        an order somewhat sullenly obeyd      however present remedy was none        and no great good seemd answerd if she stayd      regarding both with slow and sidelong view      she snuffd the candle curtsied and withdrew       alfonso paused a minutethen begun        some strange excuses for his late proceeding      he would not justify what he had done        to say the best it was extreme illbreeding      but there were ample reasons for it none        of which he specified in this his pleading      his speech was a fine sample on the whole      of rhetoric which the learnd call rigmarole       julia said nought though all the while there rose        a ready answer which at once enables      a matron who her husbands foible knows        by a few timely words to turn the tables      which if it does not silence still must pose        even if it should comprise a pack of fables      t is to retort with firmness and when he      suspects with one do you reproach with three       julia in fact had tolerable grounds        alfonsos loves with inez were well known      but whether t was that ones own guilt confounds        but that cant be as has been often shown      a lady with apologies abounds        it might be that her silence sprang alone      from delicacy to don juans ear      to whom she knew his mothers fame was dear       there might be one more motive which makes two        alfonso neer to juan had alluded      mentiond his jealousy but never who        had been the happy lover he concluded      conceald amongst his premises t is true        his mind the more oer this its mystery brooded      to speak of inez now were one may say      like throwing juan in alfonsos way       a hint in tender cases is enough        silence is best besides there is a tact      that modern phrase appears to me sad stuff        but it will serve to keep my verse compact      which keeps when pushd by questions rather rough        a lady always distant from the fact      the charming creatures lie with such a grace      there s nothing so becoming to the face       they blush and we believe them at least i        have always done so t is of no great use      in any case attempting a reply        for then their eloquence grows quite profuse      and when at length they re out of breath they sigh        and cast their languid eyes down and let loose      a tear or two and then we make it up      and thenand thenand thensit down and sup       alfonso closed his speech and beggd her pardon        which julia half withheld and then half granted      and laid conditions he thought very hard on        denying several little things he wanted      he stood like adam lingering near his garden        with useless penitence perplexd and haunted      beseeching she no further would refuse      when lo he stumbled oer a pair of shoes       a pair of shoeswhat then not much if they        are such as fit with ladies feet but these      no one can tell how much i grieve to say        were masculine to see them and to seize      was but a moments actah welladay        my teeth begin to chatter my veins freeze      alfonso first examined well their fashion      and then flew out into another passion       he left the room for his relinquishd sword        and julia instant to the closet flew      fly juan fly for heavens sakenot a word        the door is openyou may yet slip through      the passage you so often have explored        here is the gardenkeyflyflyadieu      hastehaste i hear alfonsos hurrying feet      day has not brokethere s no one in the street       none can say that this was not good advice        the only mischief was it came too late      of all experience t is the usual price        a sort of incometax laid on by fate      juan had reachd the roomdoor in a trice        and might have done so by the gardengate      but met alfonso in his dressinggown      who threatend deathso juan knockd him down       dire was the scuffle and out went the light        antonia cried out rape and julia fire      but not a servant stirrd to aid the fight        alfonso pommelld to his hearts desire      swore lustily hed be revenged this night        and juan too blasphemed an octave higher      his blood was up though young he was a tartar      and not at all disposed to prove a martyr       alfonsos sword had droppd ere he could draw it        and they continued battling hand to hand      for juan very luckily neer saw it        his temper not being under great command      if at that moment he had chanced to claw it        alfonsos days had not been in the land      much longerthink of husbands lovers lives      and how ye may be doubly widowswives       alfonso grappled to detain the foe        and juan throttled him to get away      and blood t was from the nose began to flow        at last as they more faintly wrestling lay      juan contrived to give an awkward blow        and then his only garment quite gave way      he fled like joseph leaving it but there      i doubt all likeness ends between the pair       lights came at length and

handsome supernatural scenery       there s only one slight difference between        me and my epic brethren gone before      and here the advantage is my own i ween        not that i have not several merits more      but this will more peculiarly be seen        they so embellish that t is quite a bore      their labyrinth of fables to thread through      whereas this story s actually true       if any person doubt it i appeal        to history tradition and to facts      to newspapers whose truth all know and feel        to plays in five and operas in three acts      all these confirm my statement a good deal        but that which more completely faith exacts      is that myself and several now in seville      saw juans last elopement with the devil       if ever i should

before they re hurt        then that they ll read it oer again and say      but doubtless nobody will be so pert        that this is not a moral tale though gay      besides in canto twelfth i mean to

to cadiz only to embark      to stay there had not answerd her intent        but whywe leave the reader in the dark      t was for a voyage that the young man was meant        as if a spanish ship were noahs ark      to wean him from the wickedness of earth      and send him like a dove of promise forth       don juan bade his valet pack his things        according to direction then received      a lecture and some money for four springs        he was to travel and though inez grieved      as every kind of parting has its stings        she hoped he would improveperhaps believed      a letter too she gave he never read it      of good adviceand two or three of credit       in the mean time to pass her hours away        brave inez now set up a sunday school      for naughty children who would rather play        like truant rogues the devil or the fool      infants of three years old were taught that day        dunces were whipt or set upon a stool      the great success of juans education      spurrd her to teach another generation       juan embarkdthe ship got under way        the wind was fair the water passing rough      a devil of a sea rolls in that bay        as i who ve crossd it oft know well enough      and standing upon deck the dashing spray        flies in ones face and makes it weathertough      and there he stood to take and take again      his firstperhaps his lastfarewell of spain       i cant but say it is an awkward sight        to see ones native land receding through      the growing waters it unmans one quite        especially when life is rather new      i recollect great britains coast looks white        but almost every other country s blue      when gazing on them mystified by distance      we enter on our nautical existence       so juan stood bewilderd on the deck        the wind sung cordage straind and sailors swore      and the ship creakd the town became a speck        from which away so fair and fast they bore      the best of remedies is a beefsteak        against seasickness try it sir before      you sneer and i assure you this is true      for i have found it answerso may you       don juan stood and gazing from the stern        beheld his native spain receding far      first partings form a lesson hard to learn        even nations feel this when they go to war      there is a sort of unexprest concern        a kind of shock that sets ones heart ajar      at leaving even the most unpleasant people      and places one keeps looking at the steeple       but juan had got many things to leave        his mother and a mistress and no wife      so that he had much better cause to grieve        than many persons more advanced in life      and if we now and then a sigh must heave        at quitting even those we quit in strife      no doubt we weep for those the heart endears      that is till deeper griefs congeal our tears       so juan wept as wept the captive jews        by babels waters still remembering sion      i d weepbut mine is not a weeping muse        and such light griefs are not a thing to die on      young men should travel if but to amuse        themselves and the next time their servants tie on      behind their carriages their new portmanteau      perhaps it may be lined with this my canto       and juan wept and much he sighd and thought        while his salt tears droppd into the salt sea      sweets to the sweet i like so much to quote        you must excuse this extract t is where she      the queen of denmark for ophelia brought        flowers to the grave and sobbing often he      reflected on his present situation      and seriously resolved on reformation       farewell my spain a long farewell he cried        perhaps i may revisit thee no more      but die as many an exiled heart hath died        of its own thirst to see again thy shore      farewell where guadalquivirs waters glide        farewell my mother and since all is oer      farewell too dearest juliahere he drew      her letter out again and read it through       and oh if eer i should forget i swear        but that s impossible and cannot be      sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air        sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea      than i resign thine image oh my fair        or think of any thing excepting thee      a mind diseased no remedy can physic      here the ship gave a lurch and he

chilling heaviness of heart        or rather stomach which alas attends      beyond the best apothecarys art        the loss of love the treachery of friends      or death of those we dote on when a part        of us dies with them as each fond hope ends      no doubt he would have been much more pathetic      but the sea acted as a strong emetic i       love s a capricious power i ve known it

vulgar illnesses dont like to meet      nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh      nor inflammations redden his blind eye       but worst of all is nausea or a pain        about the lower region of the bowels      love who heroically breathes a vein        shrinks from the application of hot towels      and purgatives are dangerous to his reign        seasickness death his love was perfect how else      could juans passion while the billows roar      resist his stomach neer at sea before       the ship calld the most holy trinidada        was steering duly for the port leghorn      for there the spanish family moncada        were settled long ere juans sire was born      they were relations and for them he had a        letter of introduction which the morn      of his departure had been sent him by      his spanish friends for those in italy       his suite consisted of three servants and        a tutor the licentiate pedrillo      who several languages did understand        but now lay sick and speechless on his pillow      and rocking in his hammock longd for land        his headache being increased by every billow      and the waves oozing through the porthole made      his berth a little damp and him afraid       t was not without some reason for the wind        increased at night until it blew a gale      and though t was not much to a naval mind        some landsmen would have lookd a little pale      for sailors are in fact a different kind        at sunset they began to take in sail      for the sky showd it would come on to blow      and carry away perhaps a mast or so       at one oclock the wind with sudden shift        threw the ship right into the trough of the sea      which struck her aft and made an awkward rift        started the sternpost also shatterd the      whole of her sternframe and ere she could lift        herself from out her present jeopardy      the rudder tore away t was time to sound      the pumps and there were four feet water found       one gang of people instantly was put        upon the pumps and the remainder set      to get up part of the cargo and what not        but they could not come at the leak as yet      at last they did get at it really but        still their salvation was an even bet      the water rushd through in a way quite puzzling      while they thrust sheets shirts jackets bales of muslin       into the opening but all such ingredients        would have been vain and they must have gone down      despite of all their efforts and expedients        but for the pumps i m glad to make them known      to all the brother tars who may have need hence        for fifty tons of water were upthrown      by them per hour and they had all been undone      but for the maker mr mann of london       as day advanced the weather seemd to abate        and then the leak they reckond to reduce      and keep the ship afloat though three feet yet        kept two hand and one chainpump still in use      the wind blew fresh again as it grew late        a squall came on and while some guns broke loose      a gustwhich all descriptive power transcends      laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends       there she lay motionless and seemd upset        the water left the hold and washd the decks      and made a scene men do not soon forget        for they remember battles fires and wrecks      or any other thing that brings regret        or breaks their hopes or hearts or heads or necks      thus drownings are much talkd of by the divers      and swimmers who may chance to be survivors       immediately the masts were cut away        both main and mizen first the mizen went      the mainmast followd but the ship still lay        like a mere log and baffled our intent      foremast and bowsprit were cut down and they        eased her at last although we never meant      to part with all till every hope was blighted      and then with violence the old ship righted       it may be easily supposed while this        was going on some people were unquiet      that passengers would find it much amiss        to lose their lives as well as spoil their diet      that even the able seaman deeming his        days nearly oer might be disposed to riot      as upon such occasions tars will ask      for grog and sometimes drink rum from the cask       there s nought no doubt so much the spirit calms        as rum and true religion thus it was      some plunderd some drank spirits some sung psalms        the high wind made the treble and as bas      the hoarse harsh waves kept time fright cured the qualms        of all the luckless landsmens seasick maws      strange sounds of wailing blasphemy devotion      clamourd in chorus to the roaring ocean       perhaps more mischief had been done but for        our juan who with sense beyond his years      got to the spiritroom and stood before        it with a pair of pistols and their fears      as if death were more dreadful by his door        of fire than water spite of oaths and tears      kept still aloof the crew who ere they sunk      thought it would be becoming to die drunk       give us more grog they cried for it will be        all one an hour hence juan answerd no      t is true that death awaits both you and me        but let us die like men not sink below      like brutesand thus his dangerous post kept he        and none liked to anticipate the blow      and even pedrillo his most reverend tutor      was for some rum a disappointed suitor       the good old gentleman was quite aghast        and made a loud and pious lamentation      repented all his sins and made a last        irrevocable vow of reformation      nothing should tempt him more this peril past        to quit his academic occupation      in cloisters of the classic salamanca      to follow juans wake like sancho panca       but now there came a flash of hope once more        day broke and the wind lulld the masts were gone      the leak increased shoals round her but no shore        the vessel swam yet still she held her own      they tried the pumps again and though before        their desperate efforts seemd all useless grown      a glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale      the stronger pumpd the weaker thrummd a sail       under the vessels keel the sail was past        and for the moment it had some effect      but with a leak and not a stick of mast        nor rag of canvas what could they expect      but still t is best to struggle to the last        t is never too late to be wholly wreckd      and though t is true that man can only die once      t is not so pleasant in the gulf of lyons       there winds and waves had hurld them and from thence        without their will they carried them away      for they were forced with steering to dispense        and never had as yet a quiet day      on which they might repose or even commence        a jurymast or rudder or could say      the ship would swim an hour which by good luck      still swamthough not exactly like a duck       the wind in fact perhaps was rather less        but the ship labourd so they scarce could hope      to weather out much longer the distress        was also great with which they had to cope      for want of water and their solid mess        was scant enough in vain the telescope      was usednor sail nor shore appeard in sight      nought but the heavy sea and coming night       again the weather threatendagain blew        a gale and in the fore and after hold      water appeard yet though the people knew        all this the most were patient and some bold      until the chains and leathers were worn through        of all our pumpsa wreck complete she rolld      at mercy of the waves whose mercies are      like human beings during civil war       then came the carpenter at last with tears        in his rough eyes and told the captain he      could do no more he was a man in years        and long had voyaged through many a stormy sea      and if he wept at length they were not fears        that made his eyelids as a womans be      but he poor fellow had a wife and children      two things for dying people quite bewildering       the ship was evidently settling now        fast by the head and all distinction gone      some went to prayers again and made a vow        of candles to their saintsbut there were none      to pay them with and some lookd oer the bow        some hoisted out the boats and there was one      that beggd pedrillo for an absolution      who told him to be damndin his confusion       some lashd them in their hammocks some put on        their best clothes as if going to a fair      some cursed the day on which they saw the sun        and gnashd their teeth and howling tore their hair      and others went on as they had begun        getting the boats out being well aware      that a tight boat will live in a rough sea      unless with breakers close beneath her lee       the worst of all was that in their condition        having been several days in great distress      t was difficult to get out such provision        as now might render their long suffering less      men even when dying dislike inanition        their stock was damaged by the weathers stress      two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter      were all that could be thrown into the cutter       but in the longboat they contrived to stow        some pounds of bread though injured by the wet      water a twentygallon cask or so        six flasks of wine and they contrived to get      a portion of their beef up from below        and with a piece of pork moreover met      but scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon      then there was rum eight gallons in a puncheon       the other boats the yawl and pinnace had        been stove in the beginning of the gale      and the longboats condition was but bad        as there were but two blankets for a sail      and one oar for a mast which a young lad        threw in by good luck over the ships rail      and two boats could not hold far less be stored      to save one half the people then on board       t was twilight and the sunless day went down        over the waste of waters like a veil      which if withdrawn would but disclose the frown        of one whose hate is maskd but to assail      thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown        and grimly darkled oer the faces pale      and the dim desolate deep twelve days had fear      been their familiar and now death was here       some trial had been making at a raft        with little hope in such a rolling sea      a sort of thing at which one would have laughd        if any laughter at such times could be      unless with people who too much have quaffd        and have a kind of wild and horrid glee      half epileptical and half hysterical      their preservation would have been a miracle       at halfpast eight oclock booms hencoops spars        and all things for a chance had been cast loose      that still could keep afloat the struggling tars        for yet they strove although of no great use      there was no light in heaven but a few stars        the boats put off oercrowded with their crews      she gave a heel and then a lurch to port      and going down head foremostsunk in short       then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell        then shriekd the timid and stood still the brave      then some leapd overboard with dreadful yell        as eager to anticipate their grave      and the sea yawnd around her like a hell        and down she suckd with her the whirling wave      like one who grapples with his enemy      and strives to strangle him before he die       and first one universal shriek there rushd        louder than the loud ocean like a crash      of echoing thunder and then all was hushd        save the wild wind and the remorseless dash      of billows but at intervals there gushd        accompanied with a convulsive splash      a solitary shriek the bubbling cry      of some strong swimmer in his agony       the boats as stated had got off before        and in them crowded several of the crew      and yet their present hope was hardly more        than what it had been for so strong it blew      there was slight chance of reaching any shore        and then they were too many though so few      nine in the cutter thirty in the boat      were counted in them when they got afloat       all the rest perishd near two hundred souls        had left their bodies and what s worse alas      when over catholics the ocean rolls        they must wait several weeks before a mass      takes off one peck of purgatorial coals        because till people know what s come to pass      they wont lay out their money on the dead      it costs three francs for every mass that s said       juan got into the longboat and there        contrived to help pedrillo to a place      it seemd as if they had exchanged their care        for juan wore the magisterial face      which courage gives while poor pedrillos pair        of eyes were crying for their owners case      battista though a name calld shortly tita      was lost by getting at some aquavita       pedro his valet too he tried to save        but the same cause conducive to his loss      left him so drunk he jumpd into the wave        as oer the cutters edge he tried to cross      and so he found a wineandwatery grave        they could not rescue him although so close      because the sea ran higher every minute      and for the boatthe crew kept crowding in it       a small old spanielwhich had been don joses        his fathers whom he loved as ye may think      for on such things the memory reposes        with tendernessstood howling on the brink      knowing dogs have such intellectual noses        no doubt the vessel was about to sink      and juan caught him up and ere he steppd      off threw him in then after him he leapd       he also stuffd his money where he could        about his person and pedrillos too      who let him do in fact whateer he would        not knowing what himself to say or do      as every rising wave his dread renewd        but juan trusting they might still get through      and deeming there were remedies for any ill      thus reembarkd his tutor and his spaniel       t was a rough night and blew so stiffly yet        that the sail was becalmd between the seas      though on the waves high top too much to set        they dared not take it in for all the breeze      each sea curld oer the stern and kept them wet        and made them bale without a moments ease      so that themselves as well as hopes were dampd      and the poor little cutter quickly swampd       nine souls more went in her the longboat still        kept above water with an oar for mast      two blankets stitchd together answering ill        instead of sail were to the oar made fast      though every wave rolld menacing to fill        and present peril all before surpassd      they grieved for those who perishd with the cutter      and also for the biscuitcasks and butter       the sun rose red and fiery a sure sign        of the continuance of the gale to run      before the sea until it should grow fine        was all that for the present could be done      a few teaspoonfuls of their rum and wine        were served out to the people who begun      to faint and damaged bread wet through the bags      and most of them had little clothes but rags       they counted thirty crowded in a space        which left scarce room for motion or exertion      they did their best to modify their case        one half sate up though numbd with the immersion      while tother half were laid down in their place        at watch and watch thus shivering like the tertian      ague in its cold fit they filld their boat      with nothing but the sky for a great coat       t is very certain the desire of life        prolongs it this is obvious to physicians      when patients neither plagued with friends nor wife        survive through very desperate conditions      because they still can hope nor shines the knife        nor shears of atropos before their visions      despair of all recovery spoils longevity      and makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity       t is said that persons living on annuities        are longer lived than othersgod knows why      unless to plague the grantorsyet so true it is        that some i really think do never die      of any creditors the worst a jew it is        and that s their mode of furnishing supply      in my young days they lent me cash that way      which i found very troublesome to pay       t is thus with people in an open boat        they live upon the love of life and bear      more than can be believed or even thought        and stand like rocks the tempests wear and tear      and hardship still has been the sailors lot        since noahs ark went cruising here and there      she had a curious crew as well as cargo      like the first old greek privateer the argo       but man is a carnivorous production        and must have meals at least one meal a day      he cannot live like woodcocks upon suction        but like the shark and tiger must have prey      although his anatomical construction        bears vegetables in a grumbling way      your labouring people think beyond all question      beef veal and mutton better for digestion       and thus it was with this our hapless crew        for on the third day there came on a calm      and though at first their strength it might renew        and lying on their weariness like balm      lulld them like turtles sleeping on the blue        of ocean when they woke they felt a qualm      and fell all ravenously on their provision      instead of hoarding it with due precision       the consequence was easily foreseen        they ate up all they had and drank their wine      in spite of all remonstrances and then        on what in fact next day were they to dine      they hoped the wind would rise these foolish men        and carry them to shore these hopes were fine      but as they had but one oar and that brittle      it would have been more wise to save their victual       the fourth day came but not a breath of air        and ocean slumberd like an unweand child      the fifth day and their boat lay floating there        the sea and sky were blue and clear and mild      with their one oar i wish they had had a pair        what could they do and hungers rage grew wild      so juans spaniel spite of his entreating      was killd and portiond out for present eating       on the sixth day they fed upon his hide        and juan who had still refused because      the creature was his fathers dog that died        now feeling all the vulture in his jaws      with some remorse received though first denied        as a great favour one of the forepaws      which he divided with pedrillo who      devourd it longing for the other too       the seventh day and no windthe burning sun        blisterd and scorchd and stagnant on the sea      they lay like carcasses and hope was none        save in the breeze that came not savagely      they glared upon each otherall was done        water and wine and foodand you might see      the longings of the cannibal arise      although they spoke not in their wolfish eyes       at length one whisperd his companion who        whisperd another and thus it went round      and then into a hoarser murmur grew        an ominous and wild and desperate sound      and when his comrades thought each sufferer knew        t was but his own suppressd till now he found      and out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood      and who should die to be his fellows food       but ere they came to this they that day shared        some leathern caps and what remaind of shoes      and then they lookd around them and despaird        and none to be the sacrifice would choose      at length the lots were torn up and prepared        but of materials that much shock the muse      having no paper for the want of better      they took by force from juan julias letter       the lots were made and markd and mixd and handed        in silent horror and their distribution      lulld even the savage hunger which demanded        like the promethean vulture this pollution      none in particular had sought or plannd it        t was nature gnawd them to this resolution      by which none were permitted to be neuter      and the lot fell on juans luckless tutor       he but requested to be bled to death        the surgeon had his instruments and bled      pedrillo and so gently ebbd his breath        you hardly could perceive when he was dead      he died as born a catholic in faith        like most in the belief in which they re bred      and first a little crucifix he kissd      and then held out his jugular and wrist       the surgeon as there was no other fee        had his first choice of morsels for his pains      but being thirstiest at the moment he        preferrd a draught from the fastflowing veins      part was divided part thrown in the sea        and such things as the entrails and the brains      regaled two sharks who followd oer the billow      the sailors ate the rest of poor pedrillo       the sailors ate him all save three or four        who were not quite so fond of animal food      to these was added juan who before        refusing his own spaniel hardly could      feel now his appetite increased much more        t was not to be expected that he should      even in extremity of their disaster      dine with them on his pastor and his master       t was better that he did not for in fact        the consequence was awful in the extreme      for they who were most ravenous in the act        went raging madlord how they did blaspheme      and foam and roll with strange convulsions rackd        drinking salt water like a mountainstream      tearing and grinning howling screeching swearing      and with hyaenalaughter died despairing       their numbers were much thinnd by this infliction        and all the rest were thin enough heaven knows      and some of them had lost their recollection        happier than they who still perceived their woes      but others ponderd on a new dissection        as if not warnd sufficiently by those      who had already perishd suffering madly      for having used their appetites so sadly       and next they thought upon the masters mate        as fattest but he saved himself because      besides being much averse from such a fate        there were some other reasons the first was      he had been rather indisposed of late        and that which chiefly proved his saving clause      was a small present made to him at cadiz      by general subscription of the ladies       of poor pedrillo something still remaind        but was used sparinglysome were afraid      and others still their appetites constraind        or but at times a little supper made      all except juan who throughout abstaind        chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead      at length they caught two boobies and a noddy      and then they left off eating the dead body       and if pedrillos fate should shocking be        remember ugolino condescends      to eat the head of his archenemy        the moment after he politely ends      his tale if foes be food in hell at sea        t is surely fair to dine upon our friends      when shipwrecks short allowance grows too scanty      without being much more horrible than dante       and the same night there fell a shower of rain        for which their mouths gaped like the cracks of earth      when dried to summer dust till taught by pain        men really know not what good water s worth      if you had been in turkey or in spain        or with a famishd boatscrew had your berth      or in the desert heard the camels bell      you d wish yourself where truth isin a well       it pourd down torrents but they were no richer        until they found a ragged piece of sheet      which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher        and when they deemd its moisture was complete      they wrung it out and though a thirsty ditcher        might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet      as a full pot of porter to their thinking      they neer till now had known the joys of drinking       and their baked lips with many a bloody crack        suckd in the moisture which like nectar streamd      their throats were ovens their swoln tongues were black        as the rich mans in hell who vainly screamd      to beg the beggar who could not rain back        a drop of dew when every drop had seemd      to taste of heavenif this be true indeed      some christians have a comfortable creed       there were two fathers in this ghastly crew        and with them their two sons of whom the one      was more robust and hardy to the view        but he died early and when he was gone      his nearest messmate told his sire who threw        one glance at him and said heavens will be done      i can do nothing and he saw him thrown      into the deep without a tear or groan       the other father had a weaklier child        of a soft cheek and aspect delicate      but the boy bore up long and with a mild        and patient spirit held aloof his fate      little he said and now and then he smiled        as if to win a part from off the weight      he saw increasing on his fathers heart      with the deep deadly thought that they must part       and oer him bent his sire and never raised        his eyes from off his face but wiped the foam      from his pale lips and ever on him gazed        and when the wishdfor shower at length was come      and the boys eyes which the dull film half glazed        brightend and for a moment seemd to roam      he squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain      into his dying childs mouthbut in vain       the boy expiredthe father held the clay        and lookd upon it long and when at last      death left no doubt and the dead burthen lay        stiff on his heart and pulse and hope were past      he watchd it wistfully until away        t was borne by the rude wave wherein t was cast      then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering      and gave no sign of life save his limbs quivering       now overhead a rainbow bursting through        the scattering clouds shone spanning the dark sea      resting its bright base on the quivering blue        and all within its arch appeard to be      clearer than that without and its wide hue        waxd broad and waving like a banner free      then changed like to a bow that s bent and then      forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreckd men       it changed of course a heavenly chameleon        the airy child of vapour and the sun      brought forth in purple cradled in vermilion        baptized in molten gold and swathed in dun      glittering like crescents oer a turks pavilion        and blending every colour into one      just like a black eye in a recent scuffle      for sometimes we must box without the muffle       our shipwreckd seamen thought it a good omen        it is as well to think so now and then      t was an old custom of the greek and roman        and may become of great advantage when      folks are discouraged and most surely no men        had greater need to nerve themselves again      than these and so this rainbow lookd like hope      quite a celestial kaleidoscope       about this time a beautiful white bird        webfooted not unlike a dove in size      and plumage probably it might have errd        upon its course passd oft before their eyes      and tried to perch although it saw and heard        the men within the boat and in this guise      it came and went and flutterd round them till      night fell this seemd a better omen still       but in this case i also must remark        t was well this bird of promise did not perch      because the tackle of our shatterd bark        was not so safe for roosting as a church      and had it been the dove from noahs ark        returning there from her successful search      which in their way that moment chanced to fall      they would have eat her olivebranch and all       with twilight it again came on to blow        but not with violence the stars shone out      the boat made way yet now they were so low        they knew not where nor what they were about      some fancied they saw land and some said no        the frequent fogbanks gave them cause to doubt      some swore that they heard breakers others guns      and all mistook about the latter once       as morning broke the light wind died away        when he who had the watch sung out and swore      if t was not land that rose with the suns ray        he wishd that land he never might see more      and the rest rubbd their eyes and saw a bay        or thought they saw and shaped their course for shore      for shore it was and gradually grew      distinct and high and palpable to view       and then of these some part burst into tears        and others looking with a stupid stare      could not yet separate their hopes from fears        and seemd as if they had no further care      while a few prayd the first time for some years        and at the bottom of the boat three were      asleep they shook them by the hand and head      and tried to awaken them but found them dead       the day before fast sleeping on the water        they found a turtle of the hawksbill kind      and by good fortune gliding softly caught her        which yielded a days life and to their mind      proved even still a more nutritious matter        because it left encouragement behind      they thought that in such perils more than chance      had sent them this for their deliverance       the land appeard a high and rocky coast        and higher grew the mountains as they drew      set by a current toward it they were lost        in various conjectures for none knew      to what part of the earth they had been tost        so changeable had been the winds that blew      some thought it was mount aetna some the highlands      of candia cyprus rhodes or other islands       meantime the current with a rising gale        still set them onwards to the welcome shore      like charons bark of spectres dull and pale        their living freight was now reduced to four      and three dead whom their strength could not avail        to heave into the deep with those before      though the two sharks still followd them and dashd      the spray into their faces as they splashd       famine despair cold thirst and heat had done        their work on them by turns and thinnd them to      such things a mother had not known her son        amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew      by night chilld by day scorchd thus one by one        they perishd until witherd to these few      but chiefly by a species of selfslaughter      in washing down pedrillo with salt water       as they drew nigh the land which now was seen        unequal in its aspect here and there      they felt the freshness of its growing green        that waved in foresttops and smoothd the air      and fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen        from glistening waves and skies so hot and bare      lovely seemd any object that should sweep      away the vast salt dread eternal deep       the shore lookd wild without a trace of man        and girt by formidable waves but they      were mad for land and thus their course they ran        though right ahead the roaring breakers lay      a reef between them also now began        to show its boiling surf and bounding spray      but finding no place for their landing better      they ran the boat for shoreand overset her       but in his native stream the guadalquivir        juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont      and having learnt to swim in that sweet river        had often turnd the art to some account      a better swimmer you could scarce see ever        he could perhaps have passd the hellespont      as once a feat on which ourselves we prided      leander mr ekenhead and i did       so here though faint emaciated and stark        he buoyd his boyish limbs and strove to ply      with the quick wave and gain ere it was dark        the beach which lay before him high and dry      the greatest danger here was from a shark        that carried off his neighbour by the thigh      as for the other two they could not swim      so nobody arrived on shore but him       nor yet had he arrived but for the oar        which providentially for him was washd      just as his feeble arms could strike no more        and the hard wave oerwhelmd him as t was dashd      within his grasp he clung to it and sore        the waters beat while he thereto was lashd      at last with swimming wading scrambling he      rolld on the beach halfsenseless from the sea       there breathless with his digging nails he clung        fast to the sand lest the returning wave      from whose reluctant roar his life he wrung        should suck him back to her insatiate grave      and there he lay full length where he was flung        before the entrance of a cliffworn cave      with just enough of life to feel its pain      and deem that it was saved perhaps in vain       with slow and staggering effort he arose        but sunk again upon his bleeding knee      and quivering hand and then he lookd for those        who long had been his mates upon the sea      but none of them appeard to share his woes        save one a corpse from out the famishd three      who died two days before and now had found      an unknown barren beach for burial ground       and as he gazed his dizzy brain spun fast        and down he sunk and as he sunk the sand      swam round and round and all his senses passd        he fell upon his side and his stretchd hand      droopd dripping on the oar their jurymast        and like a witherd lily on the land      his slender frame and pallid aspect lay      as fair a thing as eer was formd of clay       how long in his damp trance young juan lay        he knew not for the earth was gone for him      and time had nothing more of night nor day        for his congealing blood and senses dim      and how this heavy faintness passd away        he knew not till each painful pulse and limb      and tingling vein seemd throbbing back to life      for death though vanquishd still retired with strife       his eyes he opend shut again unclosed        for all was doubt and dizziness he thought      he still was in the boat and had but dozed        and felt again with his despair oerwrought      and wishd it death in which he had reposed        and then once more his feelings back were brought      and slowly by his swimming eyes was seen      a lovely female face of seventeen       t was bending dose oer his and the small mouth        seemd almost prying into his for breath      and chafing him the soft warm hand of youth        recalld his answering spirits back from death      and bathing his chill temples tried to soothe        each pulse to animation till beneath      its gentle touch and trembling care a sigh      to these kind efforts made a low reply       then was the cordial pourd and mantle flung        around his scarceclad limbs and the fair arm      raised higher the faint head which oer it hung        and her transparent cheek all pure and warm      pillowd his deathlike forehead then she wrung        his dewy curls long drenchd by every storm      and watchd with eagerness each throb that drew      a sigh from his heaved bosomand hers too       and lifting him with care into the cave        the gentle girl and her attendantone      young yet her elder and of brow less grave        and more robust of figurethen begun      to kindle fire and as the new flames gave        light to the rocks that roofd them which the sun      had never seen the maid or whatsoeer      she was appeard distinct and tall and fair       her brow was overhung with coins of gold        that sparkled oer the auburn of her hair      her clustering hair whose longer locks were rolld        in braids behind and though her stature were      even of the highest for a female mould        they nearly reachd her heel and in her air      there was a something which bespoke command      as one who was a lady in the land       her hair i said was auburn but her eyes        were black as death their lashes the same hue      of downcast length in whose silk shadow lies        deepest attraction for when to the view      forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies        neer with such force the swiftest arrow flew      t is as the snake late coild who pours his length      and hurls at once his venom and his strength       her brow was white and low her cheeks pure dye        like twilight rosy still with the set sun      short upper lipsweet lips that make us sigh        ever to have seen such for she was one      fit for the model of a statuary        a race of mere impostors when all s done      i ve seen much finer women ripe and real      than all the nonsense of their stone ideal       i ll tell you why i say so for t is just        one should not rail without a decent cause      there was an irish lady to whose bust        i neer saw justice done and yet she was      a frequent model and if eer she must        yield to stern time and natures wrinkling laws      they will destroy a face which mortal thought      neer compassd nor less mortal chisel wrought       and such was she the lady of the cave        her dress was very different from the spanish      simpler and yet of colours not so grave        for as you know the spanish women banish      bright hues when out of doors and yet while wave        around them what i hope will never vanish      the basquina and the mantilla they      seem at the same time mystical and gay       but with our damsel this was not the case        her dress was manycolourd finely spun      her locks curld negligently round her face        but through them gold and gems profusely shone      her girdle sparkled and the richest lace        flowd in her veil and many a precious stone      flashd on her little hand but what was shocking      her small snow feet had slippers but no stocking       the other females dress was not unlike        but of inferior materials she      had not so many ornaments to strike        her hair had silver only bound to be      her dowry and her veil in form alike        was coarser and her air though firm less free      her hair was thicker but less long her eyes      as black but quicker and of smaller size       and these two tended him and cheerd him both        with food and raiment and those soft attentions      which are as i must own of female growth        and have ten thousand delicate inventions      they made a most superior mess of broth        a thing which poesy but seldom mentions      but the best dish that eer was cookd since homers      achilles ordered dinner for new comers       i ll tell you who they were this female pair        lest they should seem princesses in disguise      besides i hate all mystery and that air        of claptrap which your recent poets prize      and so in short the girls they really were        they shall appear before your curious eyes      mistress and maid the first was only daughter      of an old man who lived upon the water       a fisherman he had been in his youth        and still a sort of fisherman was he      but other speculations were in sooth        added to his connection with the sea      perhaps not so respectable in truth        a little smuggling and some piracy      left him at last the sole of many masters      of an illgotten million of piastres       a fisher therefore was hethough of men        like peter the apostleand he fishd      for wandering merchantvessels now and then        and sometimes caught as many as he wishd      the cargoes he confiscated and gain        he sought in the slavemarket too and dishd      full many a morsel for that turkish trade      by which no doubt a good deal may be made       he was a greek and on his isle had built        one of the wild and smaller cyclades      a very handsome house from out his guilt        and there he lived exceedingly at ease      heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt        a sad old fellow was he if you please      but this i know it was a spacious building      full of barbaric carving paint and gilding       he had an only daughter calld haidee        the greatest heiress of the eastern isles      besides so very beautiful was she        her dowry was as nothing to her smiles      still in her teens and like a lovely tree        she grew to womanhood and between whiles      rejected several suitors just to learn      how to accept a better in his turn       and walking out upon the beach below        the cliff towards sunset on that day she found      insensiblenot dead but nearly so        don juan almost famishd and half drownd      but being naked she was shockd you know        yet deemd herself in common pity bound      as far as in her lay to take him in      a stranger dying with so white a skin       but taking him into her fathers house        was not exactly the best way to save      but like conveying to the cat the mouse        or people in a trance into their grave      because the good old man had so much nous        unlike the honest arab thieves so brave      he would have hospitably cured the stranger      and sold him instantly when out of danger       and therefore with her maid she thought it best        a virgin always on her maid relies      to place him in the cave for present rest        and when at last he opend his black eyes      their charity increased about their guest        and their compassion grew to such a size      it opend half the turnpikegates to heaven      st paul says t is the toll which must be given       they made a firebut such a fire as they        upon the moment could contrive with such      materials as were cast up round the bay        some broken planks and oars that to the touch      were nearly tinder since so long they lay        a mast was almost crumbled to a crutch      but by gods grace here wrecks were in such plenty      that there was fuel to have furnishd twenty       he had a bed of furs and a pelisse        for haidee stripped her sables off to make      his couch and that he might be more at ease        and warm in case by chance he should awake      they also gave a petticoat apiece        she and her maidand promised by daybreak      to pay him a fresh visit with a dish      for breakfast of eggs coffee bread and fish       and thus they left him to his lone repose        juan slept like a top or like the dead      who sleep at last perhaps god only knows        just for the present and in his lulld head      not even a vision of his former woes        throbbd in accursed dreams which sometimes spread      unwelcome visions of our former years      till the eye cheated opens thick with tears       young juan slept all dreamlessbut the maid        who smoothd his pillow as she left the den      lookd back upon him and a moment stayd        and turnd believing that he calld again      he slumberd yet she thought at least she said        the heart will slip even as the tongue and pen      he had pronounced her namebut she forgot      that at this moment juan knew it not       and pensive to her fathers house she went        enjoining silence strict to zoe who      better than her knew what in fact she meant        she being wiser by a year or two      a year or two s an age when rightly spent        and zoe spent hers as most women do      in gaining all that useful sort of knowledge      which is acquired in natures good old college       the morn broke and found juan slumbering still        fast in his cave and nothing clashd upon      his rest the rushing of the neighbouring rill        and the young beams of the excluded sun      troubled him not and he might sleep his fill        and need he had of slumber yet for none      had sufferd morehis hardships were comparative      to those related in my granddads narrative       not so haidee she sadly tossd and tumbled        and started from her sleep and turning oer      dreamd of a thousand wrecks oer which she stumbled        and handsome corpses strewd upon the shore      and woke her maid so early that she grumbled        and calld her fathers old slaves up who swore      in several oathsarmenian turk and greek      they knew not what to think of such a freak       but up she got and up she made them get        with some pretence about the sun that makes      sweet skies just when he rises or is set        and t is no doubt a sight to see when breaks      bright phoebus while the mountains still are wet        with mist and every bird with him awakes      and night is flung off like a mourning suit      worn for a husbandor some other brute       i say the sun is a most glorious sight        i ve seen him rise full oft indeed of late      i have sat up on purpose all the night        which hastens as physicians say ones fate      and so all ye who would be in the right        in health and purse begin your day to date      from daybreak and when coffind at fourscore      engrave upon the plate you rose at four       and haidee met the morning face to face        her own was freshest though a feverish flush      had dyed it with the headlong blood whose race        from heart to cheek is curbd into a blush      like to a torrent which a mountains base        that overpowers some alpine rivers rush      checks to a lake whose waves in circles spread      or the red seabut the sea is not red       and down the cliff the island virgin came        and near the cave her quick light footsteps drew      while the sun smiled on her with his first flame        and young aurora kissd her lips with dew      taking her for a sister just the same        mistake you would have made on seeing the two      although the mortal quite as fresh and fair      had all the advantage too of not being air       and when into the cavern haidee steppd        all timidly yet rapidly she saw      that like an infant juan sweetly slept        and then she stoppd and stood as if in awe      for sleep is awful and on tiptoe crept        and wrapt him closer lest the air too raw      should reach his blood then oer him still as death      bent with hushd lips that drank his scarcedrawn breath       and thus like to an angel oer the dying        who die in righteousness she leand and there      all tranquilly the shipwreckd boy was lying        as oer him the calm and stirless air      but zoe the meantime some eggs was frying        since after all no doubt the youthful pair      must breakfastand betimes lest they should ask it      she drew out her provision from the basket       she knew that the best feelings must have victual        and that a shipwreckd youth would hungry be      besides being less in love she yawnd a little        and felt her veins chilld by the neighbouring sea      and so she cookd their breakfast to a tittle        i cant say that she gave them any tea      but there were eggs fruit coffee bread fish honey      with scio wineand all for love not money       and zoe when the eggs were ready and        the coffee made would fain have wakend juan      but haidee stoppd her with her quick small hand        and without word a sign her finger drew on      her lip which zoe needs must understand        and the first breakfast spoilt prepared a new one      because her mistress would not let her break      that sleep which seemd as it would neer awake       for still he lay and on his thin worn cheek        a purple hectic playd like dying day      on the snowtops of distant hills the streak        of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay      where the blue veins lookd shadowy shrunk and weak        and his black curls were dewy with the spray      which weighd upon them yet all damp and salt      mixd with the stony vapours of the vault       and she bent oer him and he lay beneath        hushd as the babe upon its mothers breast      droopd as the willow when no winds can breathe        lulld like the depth of ocean when at rest      fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath        soft as the callow cygnet in its nest      in short he was a very pretty fellow      although his woes had turnd him rather yellow       he woke and gazed and would have slept again        but the fair face which met his eyes forbade      those eyes to close though weariness and pain        had further sleep a further pleasure made      for womans face was never formd in vain        for juan so that even when he prayd      he turnd from grisly saints and martyrs hairy      to the sweet portraits of the virgin mary       and thus upon his elbow he arose        and lookd upon the lady in whose cheek      the pale contended with the purple rose        as with an effort she began to speak      her eyes were eloquent her words would pose        although she told him in good modern greek      with an ionian accent low and sweet      that he was faint and must not talk but eat       now juan could not understand a word        being no grecian but he had an ear      and her voice was the warble of a bird        so soft so sweet so delicately clear      that finer simpler music neer was heard        the sort of sound we echo with a tear      without knowing whyan overpowering tone      whence melody descends as from a throne       and juan gazed as one who is awoke        by a distant organ doubting if he be      not yet a dreamer till the spell is broke        by the watchman or some such reality      or by ones early valets cursed knock        at least it is a heavy sound to me      who like a morning slumberfor the night      shows stars and women in a better light       and juan too was helpd out from his dream        or sleep or whatsoer it was by feeling      a most prodigious appetite the steam        of zoes cookery no doubt was stealing      upon his senses and the kindling beam        of the new fire which zoe kept up kneeling      to stir her viands made him quite awake      and long for food but chiefly a beefsteak       but beef is rare within these oxless isles        goats flesh there is no doubt and kid and mutton      and when a holiday upon them smiles        a joint upon their barbarous spits they put on      but this occurs but seldom between whiles        for some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on      others are fair and fertile among which      this though not large was one of the most rich       i say that beef is rare and cant help thinking        that the old fable of the minotaur      from which our modern morals rightly shrinking        condemn the royal ladys taste who wore      a cows shape for a maskwas only sinking        the allegory a mere type no more      that pasiphae promoted breeding cattle      to make the cretans bloodier in battle       for we all know that english people are        fed upon beefi wont say much of beer      because t is liquor only and being far        from this my subject has no business here      we know too they very fond of war        a pleasurelike all pleasuresrather dear      so were the cretansfrom which i infer      that beef and battles both were owing to her       but to resume the languid juan raised        his head upon his elbow and he saw      a sight on which he had not lately gazed        as all his latter meals had been quite raw      three or four things for which the lord he praised        and feeling still the famishd vulture gnaw      he fell upon whateer was offerd like      a priest a shark an alderman or pike       he ate and he was well supplied and she        who watchd him like a mother would have fed      him past all bounds because she smiled to see        such appetite in one she had deemd dead      but zoe being older than haidee        knew by tradition for she neer had read      that famishd people must be slowly nurst      and fed by spoonfuls else they always burst       and so she took the liberty to state        rather by deeds than words because the case      was urgent that the gentleman whose fate        had made her mistress quit her bed to trace      the seashore at this hour must leave his plate        unless he wishd to die upon the place      she snatchd it and refused another morsel      saying he had gorged enough to make a horse ill       next theyhe being naked save a tatterd        pair of scarce decent trowserswent to work      and in the fire his recent rags they scatterd        and dressd him for the present like a turk      or greekthat is although it not much matterd        omitting turban slippers pistols dirk      they furnishd him entire except some stitches      with a clean shirt and very spacious breeches       and then fair haidee tried her tongue at speaking        but not a word could juan comprehend      although he listend so that the young greek in        her earnestness would neer have made an end      and as he interrupted not went eking        her speech out to her protege and friend      till pausing at the last her breath to take      she saw he did not understand romaic       and then she had recourse to nods and signs        and smiles and sparkles of the speaking eye      and read the only book she could the lines        of his fair face and found by sympathy      the answer eloquent where soul shines        and darts in one quick glance a long reply      and thus in every look she saw exprest      a world of words and things at which she guessd       and now by dint of fingers and of eyes        and words repeated after her he took      a lesson in her tongue but by surmise        no doubt less of her language than her look      as he who studies fervently the skies        turns oftener to the stars than to his book      thus juan learnd his alpha beta better      from haidees glance than any graven letter       t is pleasing to be schoold in a strange tongue        by female lips and eyesthat is i mean      when both the teacher and the taught are young        as was the case at least where i have been      they smile so when one s right and when one s wrong        they smile still more and then there intervene      pressure of hands perhaps even a chaste kiss      i learnd the little that i know by this       that is some words of spanish turk and greek        italian not at all having no teachers      much english i cannot pretend to speak        learning that language chiefly from its preachers      barrow south tillotson whom every week        i study also blair the highest reachers      of eloquence in piety and prose      i hate your poets so read none of those       as for the ladies i have nought to say        a wanderer from the british world of fashion      where i like other dogs have had my day        like other men too may have had my passion      but that like other things has passd away        and all her fools whom i could lay the lash on      foes friends men women now are nought to me      but dreams of what has been no more to be       return we to don juan he begun        to hear new words and to repeat them but      some feelings universal as the sun        were such as could not in his breast be shut      more than within the bosom of a nun        he was in loveas you would be no doubt      with a young benefactressso was she      just in the way we very often see       and every day by daybreakrather early        for juan who was somewhat fond of rest      she came into the cave but it was merely        to see her bird reposing in his nest      and she would softly stir his locks so curly        without disturbing her yet slumbering guest      breathing all gently oer his cheek and mouth      as oer a bed of roses the sweet south       and every morn his colour freshlier came        and every day helpd on his convalescence      t was well because health in the human frame        is pleasant besides being true loves essence      for health and idleness to passions flame        are oil and gunpowder and some good lessons      are also learnt from ceres and from bacchus      without whom venus will not long attack us       while venus fills the heart without heart really        love though good always is not quite so good      ceres presents a plate of vermicelli        for love must be sustaind like flesh and blood      while bacchus pours out wine or hands a jelly        eggs oysters too are amatory food      but who is their purveyor from above      heaven knowsit may be neptune pan or jove       when juan woke he found some good things ready        a bath a breakfast and the finest eyes      that ever made a youthful heart less steady        besides her maids as pretty for their size      but i have spoken of all this already        and repetition s tiresome and unwise      welljuan after bathing in the sea      came always back to coffee and haidee       both were so young and one so innocent        that bathing passd for nothing juan seemd      to her as twere the kind of being sent        of whom these two years she had nightly dreamd      a something to be loved a creature meant        to be her happiness and whom she deemd      to render happy all who joy would win      must share ithappiness was born a twin       it was such pleasure to behold him such        enlargement of existence to partake      nature with him to thrill beneath his touch        to watch him slumbering and to see him wake      to live with him forever were too much        but then the thought of parting made her quake      he was her own her oceantreasure cast      like a rich wreckher first love and her last       and thus a moon rolld on and fair haidee        paid daily visits to her boy and took      such plentiful precautions that still he        remaind unknown within his craggy nook      at last her fathers prows put out to sea        for certain merchantmen upon the look      not as of yore to carry off an io      but three ragusan vessels bound for scio       then came her freedom for she had no mother        so that her father being at sea she was      free as a married woman or such other        female as where she likes may freely pass      without even the incumbrance of a brother        the freest she that ever gazed on glass      i speak of christian lands in this comparison      where wives at least are seldom kept in garrison       now she prolongd her visits and her talk        for they must talk and he had learnt to say      so much as to propose to take a walk        for little had he wanderd since the day      on which like a young flower snappd from the stalk        drooping and dewy on the beach he lay      and thus they walkd out in the afternoon      and saw the sun set opposite the moon       it was a wild and breakerbeaten coast        with cliffs above and a broad sandy shore      guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host        with here and there a creek whose aspect wore      a better welcome to the tempesttost        and rarely ceased the haughty billows roar      save on the dead long summer days which make      the outstretchd ocean glitter like a lake

was the coast that        was just describingyes it was the coast      lay at this period quiet as the sky        the sands untumbled the blue waves untost      and all was stillness save the seabirds cry        and dolphins leap and little billow crost      by some low rock or shelve that made it fret      against the boundary it scarcely wet       and forth they wanderd her sire being gone        as i have said upon an expedition      and mother brother guardian she had none        save zoe who although with due precision      she waited on her lady with the sun        thought daily service was her only mission      bringing warm water wreathing her long tresses      and asking now and then for castoff dresses       it was the cooling hour just when the rounded        red sun sinks down behind the azure hill      which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded        circling all nature hushd and dim and still      with the far mountaincrescent half surrounded        on one side and the deep sea calm and chill      upon the other and the rosy sky      with one star sparkling through it like an eye       and thus they wanderd forth and hand in hand        over the shining pebbles and the shells      glided along the smooth and hardend sand        and in the worn and wild receptacles      workd by the storms yet workd as it were plannd        in hollow halls with sparry roofs and cells      they turnd to rest and each claspd by an arm      yielded to the deep twilights purple charm       they lookd up to the sky whose floating glow        spread like a rosy ocean vast and bright      they gazed upon the glittering sea below        whence the broad moon rose circling into sight      they heard the waves splash and the wind so low        and saw each others dark eyes darting light      into each otherand beholding this      their lips drew near and clung into a kiss       a long long kiss a kiss of youth and love        and beauty all concentrating like rays      into one focus kindled from above        such kisses as belong to early days      where heart and soul and sense in concert move        and the blood s lava and the pulse a blaze      each kiss a heartquakefor a kisss strength      i think it must be reckond by its length       by length i mean duration theirs endured        heaven knows how longno doubt they never reckond      and if they had they could not have secured        the sum of their sensations to a second      they had not spoken but they felt allured        as if their souls and lips each other beckond      which being joind like swarming bees they clung      their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung       they were alone but not alone as they        who shut in chambers think it loneliness      the silent ocean and the starlight bay        the twilight glow which momently grew less      the voiceless sands and dropping caves that lay        around them made them to each other press      as if there were no life beneath the sky      save theirs and that their life could never die       they feard no eyes nor ears on that lone beach        they felt no terrors from the night they were      all in all to each other though their speech        was broken words they thought a language there      and all the burning tongues the passions teach        found in one sigh the best interpreter      of natures oraclefirst lovethat all      which eve has left her daughters since her fall       haidde spoke not of scruples askd no vows        nor offerd any she had never heard      of plight and promises to be a spouse        or perils by a loving maid incurrd      she was all which pure ignorance allows        and flew to her young mate like a young bird      and never having dreamt of falsehood she      had not one word to say of constancy       she loved and was belovedshe adored        and she was worshippd after natures fashion      their intense souls into each other pourd        if souls could die had perishd in that passion      but by degrees their senses were restored        again to be oercome again to dash on      and beating gainst his bosom haidees heart      felt as if never more to beat apart       alas they were so young so beautiful        so lonely loving helpless and the hour      was that in which the heart is always full        and having oer itself no further power      prompts deeds eternity can not annul        but pays off moments in an endless shower      of hellfireall prepared for people giving      pleasure or pain to one another living       alas for juan and haidee they were        so loving and so lovelytill then never      excepting our first parents such a pair        had run the risk of being damnd for ever      and haidee being devout as well as fair        had doubtless heard about the stygian river      and hell and purgatorybut forgot      just in the very crisis she should not       they look upon each other and their eyes        gleam in the moonlight and her white arm clasps      round juans head and his around her lies        half buried in the tresses which it grasps      she sits upon his knee and drinks his sighs        he hers until they end in broken gasps      and thus they form a group that s quite antique      half naked loving natural and greek       and when those deep and burning moments passd        and juan sunk to sleep within her arms      she slept not but all tenderly though fast        sustaind his head upon her bosoms charms      and now and then her eye to heaven is cast        and then on the pale cheek her breast now warms      pillowd on her oerflowing heart which pants      with all it granted and with all it grants       an infant when it gazes on a light        a child the moment when it drains the breast      a devotee when soars the host in sight        an arab with a stranger for a guest      a sailor when the prize has struck in fight        a miser filling his most hoarded chest      feel rapture but not such true joy are reaping      as they who watch oer what they love while sleeping       for there it lies so tranquil so beloved        all that it hath of life with us is living      so gentle stirless helpless and unmoved        and all unconscious of the joy t is giving      all it hath felt inflicted passd and proved        hushd into depths beyond the watchers diving      there lies the thing we love with all its errors      and all its charms like death without its terrors       the lady watchd her loverand that hour        of loves and nights and oceans solitude      oerflowd her soul with their united power        amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude      she and her waveworn love had made their bower        where nought upon their passion could intrude      and all the stars that crowded the blue space      saw nothing happier than her glowing face       alas the love of women it is known        to be a lovely and a fearful thing      for all of theirs upon that die is thrown        and if t is lost life hath no more to bring      to them but mockeries of the past alone        and their revenge is as the tigers spring      deadly and quick and crushing yet as real      torture is theirs what they inflict they feel       they are right for man to man so oft unjust        is always so to women one sole bond      awaits them treachery is all their trust        taught to conceal their bursting hearts despond      over their idol till some wealthier lust        buys them in marriageand what rests beyond      a

and scorches even the kiss        of his gazelleeyed daughters she was one      made but to love to feel that she was his        who was her chosen what was said or done      elsewhere was nothing she had naught to fear      hope care nor love beyond her heart beat here       and oh that quickening of the heart that beat        how much it costs us yet each rising throb      is in its cause as its effect so sweet        that wisdom ever on the watch to rob      joy of its alchymy and to repeat        fine truths even conscience too has a tough job      to make us understand each good old maxim      so goodi wonder castlereagh dont tax em       and now t was doneon the lone shore were plighted        their hearts the stars their nuptial torches shed      beauty upon the beautiful they lighted

if only from the devil they would insure us        how pleasant were the maxim not quite new      eat drink and love what can the rest avail us      so said the royal sage sardanapalus       but juan had he quite forgotten julia        and should he have forgotten her so soon      i cant but say it seems to me most truly        perplexing question but no doubt the moon      does these things for us and whenever newly        strong palpitation rises t is her boon      else how the devil is it that fresh features      have such a charm for us poor human creatures       i hate inconstancyi loathe detest        abhor condemn abjure the mortal made      of such quicksilver clay that in his breast        no permanent foundation can be laid      love constant love has been my constant guest        and yet last night being at a masquerade      i saw the prettiest creature fresh from milan      which gave me some sensations like a villain       but soon philosophy came to my aid        and whisperd think of every sacred tie      i will my dear philosophy i said        but then her teeth and then oh heaven her eye      ill just inquire if she be wife or maid        or neitherout of curiosity      stop cried philosophy with air so grecian      though she was masqued then as a fair venetian       stop so i stoppdbut to return that which        men call inconstancy is nothing more      than admiration due where natures rich        profusion with young beauty covers oer      some favourd object and as in the niche        a lovely statue we almost adore      this sort of adoration of the real      is but a heightening of the beau ideal       t is the perception of the beautiful        a fine extension of the faculties      platonic universal wonderful        drawn from the stars and filterd through the skies      without which life would be extremely dull        in short it is the use of our own eyes      with one or two small senses added just      to hint that flesh is formd of fiery dust       yet t is a painful feeling and unwilling        for surely if we always could perceive      in the same object graces quite as killing        as when she rose upon us like an eve      t would save us many a heartache many a shilling        for we must get them any how or grieve      whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever      how pleasant for the heart as well as liver       the heart is like the sky a part of heaven        but changes night and day too like the sky      now oer it clouds and thunder must be driven        and darkness and destruction as on high      but when it hath been scorchd and pierced and riven        its storms expire in waterdrops the eye      pours forth at last the hearts blood turnd to tears      which make the english climate of our years       the liver is the lazaret of bile        but very rarely executes its function      for the first passion stays there such a while        that all the rest creep in and form a junction      life knots of vipers on a dunghills soil        rage fear hate jealousy revenge compunction      so that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail      like earthquakes from the hidden fire calld central       in the mean time without proceeding more        in this anatomy i ve finishd now      two hundred and odd stanzas as before        that being about the number i ll allow      each canto of the twelve or twentyfour        and laying down my pen i make my bow      leaving don juan and haidee to plead      for them and theirs with all who deign to read   illustration canto 3     canto the third       hail muse et ceterawe left juan sleeping        pillowd upon a fair and happy breast      and watchd by eyes that never yet knew weeping        and loved by a young heart too deeply blest      to feel the poison through her spirit creeping        or know who rested there a foe to rest      had soild the current of her sinless years      and turnd her pure hearts purest blood to tears       o love what is it in this world of ours        which makes it fatal to be loved ah why      with cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers        and made thy best interpreter a sigh      as those who dote on odours pluck the flowers        and place them on their breastbut place to die      thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish      are laid within our bosoms but to perish       in her first passion woman loves her lover        in all the others all she loves is love      which grows a habit she can neer get over        and fits her looselylike an easy glove      as you may find wheneer you like to prove her        one man alone at first her heart can move      she then prefers him in the plural number      not finding that the additions much encumber       i know not if the fault be mens or theirs        but one thing s pretty sure a woman planted      unless at once she plunge for life in prayers        after a decent time must be gallanted      although no doubt her first of love affairs        is that to which her heart is wholly granted      yet there are some they say who have had none      but those who have neer end with only one       t is melancholy and a fearful sign        of human frailty folly also crime      that love and marriage rarely can combine        although they both are born in the same clime      marriage from love like vinegar from wine        a sad sour sober beverageby time      is sharpend from its high celestial flavour      down to a very homely household savour       there s something of antipathy as t were        between their present and their future state      a kind of flattery that s hardly fair        is used until the truth arrives too late      yet what can people do except despair        the same things change their names at such a rate      for instancepassion in a lover s glorious      but in a husband is pronounced uxorious       men grow ashamed of being so very fond        they sometimes also get a little tired      but that of course is rare and then despond        the same things cannot always be admired      yet t is so nominated in the bond        that both are tied till one shall have expired      sad thought to lose the spouse that was adorning      our days and put ones servants into mourning       there s doubtless something in domestic doings        which forms in fact true loves antithesis      romances paint at full length peoples wooings        but only give a bust of marriages      for no one cares for matrimonial cooings        there s nothing wrong in a connubial kiss      think you if laura had been petrarchs wife      he would have written sonnets all his life       all tragedies are finishd by a death        all comedies are ended by a marriage      the future states of both are left to faith        for authors fear description might disparage      the worlds to come of both or fall beneath        and then both worlds would punish their miscarriage      so leaving each their priest and prayerbook ready      they say no more of death or of the lady       the only two that in my recollection        have sung of heaven and hell or marriage are      dante and milton and of both the affection        was hapless in their nuptials for some bar      of fault or temper ruind the connection        such things in fact it dont ask much to mar      but dantes beatrice and miltons eve      were not drawn from their spouses you conceive       some persons say that dante meant theology        by beatrice and not a mistressi      although my opinion may require apology        deem this a commentators fantasy      unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he        decided thus and showd good reason why      i think that dantes more abstruse ecstatics      meant to personify the mathematics       haidee and juan were not married but        the fault was theirs not mine it is not fair      chaste reader then in any way to put        the blame on me unless you wish they were      then if you d have them wedded please to shut        the book which treats of this erroneous pair      before the consequences grow too awful      t is dangerous to read of loves unlawful       yet they were happyhappy in the illicit        indulgence of their innocent desires      but more imprudent grown with every visit        haidee forgot the island was her sires      when we have what we like t is hard to miss it        at least in the beginning ere one tires      thus she came often not a moment losing      whilst her piratical papa was cruising       let not his mode of raising cash seem strange        although he fleeced the flags of every nation      for into a prime minister but change        his title and

  they thus addressdand lambros visage fell      and oer his eye a momentary gloom        passd but he strove quite courteously to quell      the expression and endeavouring to resume        his smile requested one of them to tell      the name and quality of his new patron      who seemd to have turnd haidee into a matron       i know not quoth the fellow who or what        he is nor whence he

of breeding      which scarce even france the paragon of nations        eer saw her most polite of sons exceeding      he bore these sneers against his near relations        his own anxiety his heart too bleeding      the insults too of every servile glutton      who all the time was eating up his mutton       now in a person used to much command        to bid men come and go and come again      to see his orders done too out of hand        whether the word was death or but the chain      it may seem strange to find his manners bland        yet such things are which i can not explain      though doubtless he who can command himself      is good to governalmost as a guelf       not that he was not sometimes rash or so        but never in his real and serious mood      then calm concentrated and still and slow        he lay coild like the boa in the wood      with him it never was a word and blow        his angry word once oer he shed no blood      but in his silence there was much to rue      and his one blow left little work for two       he askd no further questions and proceeded        on to the house but by a private way      so that the few who met him hardly heeded        so little they expected him that day      if love paternal in his bosom pleaded        for haidees sake is more than i can say      but certainly to one deemd dead returning      this revel seemd a curious mode of mourning       if all the dead could now return to life        which god forbid or some or a great many      for instance if a husband or his wife        nuptial examples are as good as any      no doubt whateer might be their former strife        the present weather would be much more rainy      tears shed into the grave of the connection      would share most probably its resurrection       he enterd in the house no more his home        a thing to human feelings the most trying      and harder for the heart to overcome        perhaps than even the mental pangs of dying      to find our hearthstone turnd into a tomb        and round its once warm precincts palely lying      the ashes of our hopes is a deep grief      beyond a single gentlemans belief       he enterd in the househis home no more        for without hearts there is no home and felt      the solitude of passing his own door        without a welcome there he long had dwelt      there his few peaceful days time had swept oer        there his worn bosom and keen eye would melt      over the innocence of that sweet child      his only shrine of feelings undefiled       he was a man of a strange temperament        of mild demeanour though of savage mood      moderate in all his habits and content        with temperance in pleasure as in food      quick to perceive and strong to bear and meant        for something better if not wholly good      his countrys wrongs and his despair to save her      had stung him from a slave to an enslaver       the love of power and rapid gain of gold        the hardness by long habitude produced      the dangerous life in which he had grown old        the mercy he had granted oft abused      the sights he was accustomd to behold        the wild seas and wild men with whom he cruised      had cost his enemies a long repentance      and made him a good friend but bad acquaintance       but something of the spirit of old greece

flowd      past him in crystal and a joy in flowers      bedewd his spirit in his calmer hours       but whatsoeer he had of love reposed        on that beloved daughter she had been      the only

perfection which ensures        an epic from bob southey every spring      form not the true temptation which allures        the reader but t would not be hard to bring      some fine examples of the epopee      to prove its grand ingredient is ennui       we learn from horace homer sometimes sleeps        we feel without him wordsworth sometimes wakes      to show with what complacency he creeps        with his dear waggoners around his lakes      he wishes for a boat to sail the deeps        of oceanno of air and then he makes      another outcry for a little boat      and drivels seas to set it well afloat       if he must fain sweep oer the ethereal plain        and pegasus runs restive in his waggon      could he not beg the loan of charless wain        or pray medea for a single dragon

feel this tediousness will never do        t is being too epic and i must cut down      in copying this long canto into two        they ll never find it out unless i own      the fact excepting some experienced few        and then as an improvement t will be shown      i ll prove that such the opinion of the critic is      from aristotle passimsee poietikes     canto the fourth       nothing so difficult as a beginning        in poesy unless perhaps the end      for oftentimes when pegasus seems winning        the race he sprains a wing and down we tend      like lucifer when hurld from heaven for sinning        our sin the same and hard as his to mend      being pride which leads the mind to soar too far      till our own weakness shows us what we are       but time which brings all

fellow        and wishd that others held the same opinion      they took it up when my days grew more mellow        and other minds acknowledged my dominion      now my sere fancy falls into the yellow        leaf and imagination droops her pinion      and the sad truth which hovers oer my desk      turns what was once romantic to burlesque       and if i laugh at any mortal thing        t is that i may not weep and if i weep      t is that our nature cannot always bring        itself to apathy for we must steep      our hearts first in the depths of lethes spring        ere what we least

land      and trace it in this poem every line        i dont pretend that i quite understand      my own meaning when i would be very fine        but the fact is that i have nothing plannd      unless it were to be a moment merry      a novel word in my vocabulary       to the kind reader of our sober clime        this way of writing will appear exotic      pulci was sire of the halfserious rhyme        who sang when chivalry was more quixotic      and revelld in the fancies of the time        true knights chaste dames huge giants kings despotic      but all these save the last being obsolete      i chose a modern subject as more meet       how i have treated it i do not know        perhaps no better than they have treated me      who have imputed such designs as show        not what they saw but what they wishd to see      but if it gives them pleasure be it so        this is a liberal age and thoughts are free      meantime apollo plucks me by the ear      and tells me to resume my story here       young juan and his ladylove were left        to their own hearts most sweet society      even time the pitiless in sorrow cleft        with his rude scythe such gentle bosoms he      sighd to behold them of their hours bereft        though foe to love and yet they could not be      meant to grow old but die in happy spring      before one charm or hope had taken wing       their faces were not made for wrinkles their        pure blood to stagnate their great hearts to fail      the blank grey was not made to blast their hair        but like the climes that know nor snow nor hail      they were all summer lightning might assail        and shiver them to ashes but to trail      a long and snakelike life of dull decay      was not for themthey had too little day       they were alone once more for them to be        thus was another eden they were never      weary unless when separate the tree        cut from its forest root of yearsthe river      dammd from its fountainthe child from the knee        and breast maternal weand at once for ever      would wither less than these two torn apart      alas there is no instinct like the heart       the heartwhich may be broken

day        and all which must be borne and never told      while lifes strange principle will often lie      deepest in those who long the most to die       whom the gods love die young was said of yore        and many deaths do they escape by this      the death of friends and that which slays even more        the death of friendship love youth all that is      except mere breath and since the silent shore        awaits at last even those who longest miss      the old archers shafts perhaps the early grave      which men weep over may be meant to save       haidee and juan thought not of the dead        the heavens and earth and air seemd made for them      they found no fault with time save that he fled        they saw not in themselves aught to condemn      each was the others mirror and but read        joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem      and knew such brightness was but the reflection      of their exchanging glances of affection       the gentle pressure and the thrilling touch        the least glance better understood than words      which still said all and neer could say too much        a language too but like to that of birds      known but to them at least appearing such        as but to lovers a true sense affords      sweet playful phrases which would seem absurd      to those who have ceased to hear such or neer heard       all these were theirs for they were children still        and children still they should have ever been      they were not made in the real world to fill        a busy character in the dull scene      but like two beings born from out a rill        a nymph and her beloved all unseen      to pass their lives in fountains and on flowers      and never know the weight of human hours       moons changing had rolld on and changeless found        those their bright rise had lighted to such joys      as rarely they beheld throughout their round        and these were not of the vain kind which cloys      for theirs were buoyant spirits never bound        by the mere senses and that which destroys      most love possession unto them appeard      a thing which each endearment more endeard       o beautiful and rare as beautiful        but theirs was love in which the mind delights      to lose itself when the old world grows dull        and we are sick of its hack sounds and sights      intrigues adventures of the common school        its petty passions marriages and flights      where hymens torch but brands one strumpet more      whose husband only knows her not a whre       hard words harsh truth a truth which many know        enoughthe faithful and the fairy pair      who never found a single hour too slow        what was it made them thus exempt from care      young innate feelings all have felt below        which perish in the rest but in them were      inherentwhat we mortals call romantic      and always envy though we deem it frantic       this is in others a factitious state        an opium dream of too much youth and reading      but was in them their nature or their fate        no novels eer had set their young hearts bleeding      for haidees knowledge was by no means great        and juan was a boy of saintly breeding      so that there was no reason for their loves      more than for those of nightingales or doves       they gazed upon the sunset t is an hour        dear unto all but dearest to their eyes      for it had made them what they were the power        of love had first oerwhelmd them from such skies      when happiness had been their only dower        and twilight saw them linkd in passions ties      charmd with each other all things charmd that brought      the past still welcome as the present thought       i know not why but in that hour tonight        even as they gazed a sudden tremor came      and swept as t were across their hearts delight        like the wind oer a harpstring or a flame      when one is shook in sound and one in sight        and thus some boding flashd through either frame      and calld from juans breast a faint low sigh      while one new tear arose in haidees eye       that large black prophet eye seemd to dilate        and follow far the disappearing sun      as if their last day of a happy date        with his broad bright and dropping orb were gone      juan gazed on her as to ask his fate        he felt a grief but knowing cause for none      his glance inquired of hers for some excuse      for feelings causeless or at least abstruse       she turnd to him and smiled but in that sort        which makes not others smile then turnd aside      whatever feeling shook her it seemd short        and masterd by her wisdom or her pride      when juan spoke tooit might be in sport        of this their mutual feeling she replied      if it should be sobutit cannot be      or i at least shall not survive to see       juan would question further but she pressd        his lip to hers and silenced him with this      and then dismissd the omen from her breast        defying augury with that fond kiss      and no doubt of all methods t is the best        some people prefer winet is not amiss      i have tried both so those who would a part take      may choose between the headache and the heartache       one of the two according to your choice        woman or wine you ll have to undergo      both maladies are taxes on our joys        but which to choose i really hardly know      and if i had to give a casting voice        for both sides i could many reasons show      and then decide without great wrong to either      it were much better to have both than neither       juan and haidee gazed upon each other        with swimming looks of speechless tenderness      which mixd all feelings friend child lover brother        all that the best can mingle and express      when two pure hearts are pourd in one another        and love too much and yet can not love less      but almost sanctify the sweet excess      by the immortal wish and power to bless       mixd in each others arms and heart in heart        why did they not then diethey had lived too long      should an hour come to bid them breathe apart        years could but bring them cruel things or wrong      the world was not for them nor the worlds art        for beings passionate as sapphos song      love was born with them in them so intense      it was their very spiritnot a sense       they should have lived together deep in woods        unseen as sings the nightingale they were      unfit to mix in these thick solitudes        calld social haunts of hate and vice and care      how lonely every freeborn creature broods        the sweetest songbirds nestle in a pair      the eagle soars alone the gull and crow      flock oer their carrion just like men below       now pillowd cheek to cheek in loving sleep        haidee and juan their siesta took      a gentle slumber but it was not deep        for ever and anon a something shook      juan and shuddering oer his frame would creep        and haidees sweet lips murmurd like a brook      a wordless music and her face so fair      stirrd with her dream as roseleaves with the air       or as the stirring of a deep dear stream        within an alpine hollow when the wind      walks oer it was she shaken by the dream        the mystical usurper of the mind      oerpowering us to be whateer may seem        good to the soul which we no more can bind      strange state of being for t is still to be      senseless to feel and with seald eyes to see       she dreamd of being alone on the seashore        chaind to a rock she knew not how but stir      she could not from the spot and the loud roar        grew and each wave rose roughly threatening her      and oer her upper lip they seemd to pour        until she sobbd for breath and soon they were      foaming oer her lone head so fierce and high      each broke to drown her yet she could not die       anonshe was released and then she strayd        oer the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet      and stumbled almost every step she made        and something rolld before her in a sheet      which she must still pursue howeer afraid        t was white and indistinct nor stoppd to meet      her glance nor grasp for still she gazed and graspd      and ran but it escaped her as she claspd       the dream changedin a cave she stood its walls        were hung with marble icicles the work      of ages on its waterfretted halls        where waves might wash and seals might breed and lurk      her hair was dripping and the very balls        of her black eyes seemd turnd to tears and mirk      the sharp rocks lookd below each drop they caught      which froze to marble as it fellshe thought       and wet and cold and lifeless at her feet        pale as the foam that frothd on his dead brow      which she essayd in vain to clear how sweet        were once her cares how idle seemd they now      lay juan nor could aught renew the beat        of his quenchd heart and the sea dirges low      rang in her sad ears like a mermaids song      and that brief dream appeard a life too long       and gazing on the dead she thought his face        faded or alterd into something new      like to her fathers features till each trace        more like and like to lambros aspect grew      with all his keen worn look and grecian grace        and starting she awoke and what to view      o powers of heaven what dark eye meets she there      t ist is her fathersfixd upon the pair       then shrieking she arose and shrieking fell        with joy and sorrow hope and fear to see      him whom she deemd a habitant where dwell        the oceanburied risen from death to be      perchance the death of one she loved too well        dear as her father had been to haidee      it was a moment of that awful kind      i have seen suchbut must not call to mind       up juan sprung to haidees bitter shriek        and caught her falling and from off the wall      snatchd down his sabre in hot haste to wreak        vengeance on him who was the cause of all      then lambro who till now forbore to speak        smiled scornfully and said within my call      a thousand scimitars await the word      put up young man put up your silly sword       and haidee clung around him juan t is        t is lambrot is my father kneel with me      he will forgive usyesit must beyes        o dearest father in this agony      of pleasure and of paineven while i kiss        thy garments hem with transport can it be      that doubt should mingle with my filial joy      deal with me as thou wilt but spare this boy       high and inscrutable the old man stood        calm in his voice and calm within his eye      not always signs with him of calmest mood        he lookd upon her but gave no reply      then turnd to juan in whose cheek the blood        oft came and went as there resolved to die      in arms at least he stood in act to spring      on the first foe whom lambros call might bring       young man your sword so lambro once more said        juan replied not while this arm is free      the old mans cheek grew pale but not with dread        and drawing from his belt a pistol he      replied your blood be then on your own head        then lookd dose at the flint as if to see      t was freshfor he had lately used the lock      and next proceeded quietly to cock       it has a strange quick jar upon the ear        that cocking of a pistol when you know      a moment more will bring the sight to bear        upon your person twelve yards off or so      a gentlemanly distance not too near        if you have got a former friend for foe      but after being fired at once or twice      the ear becomes more irish and less nice       lambro presented and one instant more        had stoppd this canto and don juans breath      when haidee threw herself her boy before        stern as her sire on me she cried let death      descendthe fault is mine this fatal shore        he foundbut sought not i have pledged my faith      i love himi will die with him i knew      your natures firmnessknow your daughters too       a minute past and she had been all tears        and tenderness and infancy but now      she stood as one who championd human fears        pale statuelike and stern she wood the blow      and tall beyond her sex and their compeers        she drew up to her height as if to show      a fairer mark and with a fixd eye scannd      her fathers facebut never stoppd his hand       he gazed on her and she on him t was strange        how like they lookd the expression was the same      serenely savage with a little change        in the large dark eyes mutualdarted flame      for she too was as one who could avenge        if cause should bea lioness though tame      her fathers blood before her fathers face      boild up and proved her truly of his race       i said they were alike their features and        their stature differing but in sex and years      even to the delicacy of their hand        there was resemblance such as true blood wears      and now to see them thus divided stand        in fixd ferocity when joyous tears      and sweet sensations should have welcomed both      show what the passions are in their full growth       the father paused a moment then withdrew        his weapon and replaced it but stood still      and looking on her as to look her through        not i he said have sought this strangers ill      not i have made this desolation few        would bear such outrage and forbear to kill      but i must do my dutyhow thou hast      done thine the present vouches for the past       let him disarm or by my fathers head        his own shall roll before you like a ball      he raised his whistle as the word he said        and blew another answerd to the call      and rushing in disorderly though led        and armd from boot to turban one and all      some twenty of his train came rank on rank      he gave the wordarrest or slay the frank       then with a sudden movement he withdrew        his daughter while compressd within his clasp      twixt her and juan interposed the crew        in vain she struggled in her fathers grasp      his arms were like a serpents coil then flew        upon their prey as darts an angry asp      the file of pirates save the foremost who      had fallen with his right shoulder half cut through       the second had his cheek laid open but        the third a wary cool old sworder took      the blows upon his cutlass and then put        his own well in so well ere you could look      his man was floord and helpless at his foot        with the blood running like a little brook      from two smart sabre gashes deep and red      one on the arm the other on the head       and then they bound him where he fell and bore        juan from the apartment with a sign      old lambro bade them take him to the shore        where lay some ships which were to sail at nine      they laid him in a boat and plied the oar        until they reachd some galliots placed in line      on board of one of these and under hatches      they stowd him with strict orders to the watches       the world is full of strange vicissitudes        and here was one exceedingly unpleasant      a gentleman so rich in the worlds goods        handsome and young enjoying all the present      just at the very time when he least broods        on such a thing is suddenly to sea sent      wounded and chaind so that he cannot move      and all because a lady fell in love       here i must leave him for i grow pathetic        moved by the chinese nymph of tears green tea      than whom cassandra was not more prophetic        for if my pure libations exceed three      i feel my heart become so sympathetic        that i must have recourse to black bohea      t is pity wine should be so deleterious      for tea and coffee leave us much more serious       unless when qualified with thee cogniac        sweet naiad of the phlegethontic rill      ah why the liver wilt thou thus attack        and make like other nymphs thy lovers ill      i would take refuge in weak punch but rack        in each sense of the word wheneer i fill      my mild and midnight beakers to the brim      wakes me next morning with its synonym       i leave don juan for the present safe        not sound poor fellow but severely wounded      yet could his corporal pangs amount to half        of those with which his haidees bosom bounded      she was not one to weep and rave and chafe        and then give way subdued because surrounded      her mother was a moorish maid from fez      where all is eden or a wilderness       there the large olive rains its amber store        in marble fonts there grain and flower and fruit      gush from the earth until the land runs oer        but there too many a poisontree has root      and midnight listens to the lions roar        and long long deserts scorch the camels foot      or heaving whelm the helpless caravan      and as the soil is so the heart of man       afric is all the suns and as her earth        her human day is kindled full of power      for good or evil burning from its birth        the moorish blood partakes the planets hour      and like the soil beneath it will bring forth        beauty and love were haidees mothers dower      but her large dark eye showd deep passions force      though sleeping like a lion near a source       her daughter temperd with a milder ray        like summer clouds all silvery smooth and fair      till slowly charged with thunder they display        terror to earth and tempest to the air      had held till now her soft and milky way        but overwrought with passion and despair      the fire burst forth from her numidian veins      even as the simoom sweeps the blasted plains       the last sight which she saw was juans gore        and he himself oermasterd and cut down      his blood was running on the very floor        where late he trod her beautiful her own      thus much she viewd an instant and no more        her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan      on her sires arm which until now scarce held      her writhing fell she like a cedar felld       a vein had burst and her sweet lips pure dyes        were dabbled with the deep blood which ran oer      and her head droopd as when the lily lies        oercharged with rain her summond handmaids bore      their lady to her couch with gushing eyes        of herbs and cordials they produced their store      but she defied all means they could employ      like one life could not hold nor death destroy       days lay she in that state unchanged though chill        with nothing livid still her lips were red      she had no pulse but death seemd absent still        no hideous sign proclaimd her surely dead      corruption came not in each mind to kill        all hope to look upon her sweet face bred      new thoughts of life for it seemd full of soul      she had so much earth could not claim the whole       the ruling passion such as marble shows        when exquisitely chiselld still lay there      but fixd as marbles unchanged aspect throws        oer the fair venus but for ever fair      oer the laocoons all eternal throes        and everdying gladiators air      their energy like life forms all their fame      yet looks not life for they are still the same       she woke at length but not as sleepers wake        rather the dead for life seemd something new      a strange sensation which she must partake        perforce since whatsoever met her view      struck not on memory though a heavy ache        lay at her heart whose earliest beat still true      brought back the sense of pain without the cause      for for a while the furies made a pause       she lookd on many a face with vacant eye        on many a token without knowing what      she saw them watch her without asking why        and reckd not who around her pillow sat      not speechless though she spoke not not a sigh        relieved her thoughts dull silence and quick chat      were tried in vain by those who served she gave      no sign save breath of having left the grave       her handmaids tended but she heeded not        her father watchd she turnd her eyes away      she recognized no being and no spot        however dear or cherishd in their day      they changed from room to roombut all forgot        gentle but without memory she lay      at length those eyes which they would fain be weaning      back to old thoughts waxd full of fearful meaning       and then a slave bethought her of a harp        the harper came and tuned his instrument      at the first notes irregular and sharp        on him her flashing eyes a moment bent      then to the wall she turnd as if to warp        her thoughts from sorrow through her heart resent      and he begun a long low island song      of ancient days ere tyranny grew strong       anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall        in time to his old tune he changed the theme      and sung of love the fierce name struck through all        her recollection on her flashd the dream      of what she was and is if ye could call        to be so being in a gushing stream      the tears rushd forth from her oerclouded brain      like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain       short solace vain reliefthought came too quick        and whirld her brain to madness she arose      as one who neer had dwelt among the sick        and flew at all she met as on her foes      but no one ever heard her speak or shriek        although her paroxysm drew towards its dose      hers was a phrensy which disdaind to rave      even when they smote her in the hope to save       yet she betrayd at times a gleam of sense        nothing could make her meet her fathers face      though on all other things with looks intense        she gazed but none she ever could retrace      food she refused and raiment no pretence        availd for either neither change of place      nor time nor skill nor remedy could give her      senses to sleepthe power seemd gone for ever       twelve days and nights she witherd thus at last        without a groan or sigh or glance to show      a parting pang the spirit from her past        and they who watchd her nearest could not know      the very instant till the change that cast        her sweet face into shadow dull and slow      glazed oer her eyesthe beautiful the black      o to possess such lustreand then lack       she died but not alone she held within        a second principle of life which might      have dawnd a fair and sinless child of sin        but closed its little being without light      and went down to the grave unborn wherein        blossom and bough lie witherd with one blight      in vain the dews of heaven descend above      the bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love       thus livedthus died she never more on her        shall sorrow light or shame she was not made      through years or moons the inner weight to bear        which colder hearts endure till they are laid      by age in earth her days and pleasures were        brief but delightfulsuch as had not staid      long with her destiny but she sleeps well      by the seashore whereon she loved to dwell       that isle is now all desolate and bare        its dwellings down its tenants passd away      none but her own and fathers grave is there        and nothing outward tells of human clay      ye could not know where lies a thing so fair        no stone is there to show no tongue to say      what was no dirge except the hollow seas      mourns oer the beauty of the cyclades       but many a greek maid in a loving song        sighs oer her name and many an islander      with her sires story makes the night less long        valour was his and beauty dwelt with her      if she loved rashly her life paid for wrong        a heavy price must all pay who thus err      in some shape let none think to fly the danger      for soon or late love is his own avenger       but let me change this theme which grows too sad        and lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf      i dont much like describing people mad        for fear of seeming rather touchd myself      besides i ve no more on this head to add        and as my muse is a capricious elf      we ll put about and try another tack      with juan left halfkilld some stanzas back       wounded and fetterd cabind cribbd confined        some days and nights elapsed before that he      could altogether call the past to mind        and when he did he found himself at sea      sailing six knots an hour before the wind        the shores of ilion lay beneath their lee      another time he might have liked to see em      but now was not much pleased with cape sigaeum       there on the green and villagecotted hill is        flankd by the hellespont and by the sea      entombd the bravest of the brave achilles        they say so bryant says the contrary      and further downward tall and towering still is        the tumulusof whom heaven knows t may be      patroclus ajax or protesilaus      all heroes who if living still would slay us       high barrows without marble or a name        a vast untilld and mountainskirted plain      and ida in the distance still the same        and old scamander if t is he remain      the situation seems still formd for fame        a hundred thousand men might fight again      with case but where i sought for ilions walls      the quiet sheep feeds and the tortoise crawls       troops of untended horses here and there        some little hamlets with new names uncouth      some shepherds unlike paris led to stare        a moment at the european youth      whom to the spot their schoolboy feelings bear        a turk with beads in hand and pipe in mouth      extremely taken with his own religion      are what i found therebut the devil a phrygian       don juan here permitted to emerge        from his dull cabin found himself a slave      forlorn and gazing on the deep blue surge        oershadowd there by many a heros grave      weak still with loss of blood he scarce could urge        a few brief questions and the answers gave      no very satisfactory information      about his past or present situation       he saw some fellow captives who appeard        to be italians as they were in fact      from them at least their destiny he heard        which was an odd one a troop going to act      in sicily all singers duly reard        in their vocation had not been attackd      in sailing from livorno by the pirate      but sold by the impresario at no high rate       by one of these the buffo of the party        juan was told about their curious case      for although destined to the turkish mart he        still kept his spirits upat least his face      the little fellow really lookd quite hearty        and bore him with some gaiety and grace      showing a much more reconciled demeanour      than did the prima donna and the tenor       in a few words he told their hapless story        saying our machiavellian impresario      making a signal off some promontory        haild a strange brigcorpo di caio mario      we were transferrd on board her in a hurry        without a single scudo of salario      but if the sultan has a taste for song      we will revive our fortunes before long       the prima donna though a little old        and haggard with a dissipated life      and subject when the house is thin to cold        has some good notes and then the tenors wife      with no great voice is pleasing to behold        last carnival she made a deal of strife      by carrying off count cesare cicogna      from an old roman princess at bologna       and then there are the dancers there s the nini        with more than one profession gains by all      then there s that laughing slut the pelegrini        she too was fortunate last carnival      and made at least five hundred good zecchini        but spends so fast she has not now a paul      and then there s the grotescasuch a dancer      where men have souls or bodies she must answer       as for the figuranti they are like        the rest of all that tribe with here and there      a pretty person which perhaps may strike        the rest are hardly fitted for a fair      there s one though tall and stiffer than a pike        yet has a sentimental kind of air      which might go far but she dont dance with vigour      the more s the pity with her face and figure       as for the men they are a middling set        the musico is but a crackd old basin      but being qualified in one way yet        may the seraglio do to set his face in      and as a servant some preferment get        his singing i no further trust can place in      from all the pope makes yearly t would perplex      to find three perfect pipes of the third sex       the tenors voice is spoilt by affectation        and for the bass the beast can only bellow      in fact he had no singing education        an ignorant noteless timeless tuneless fellow      but being the prima donnas near relation        who swore his voice was very rich and mellow      they hired him though to hear him you d believe      an ass was practising recitative       t would not become myself to dwell upon        my own merits and though youngi see siryou      have got a travelld air which speaks you one        to whom the opera is by no means new      you ve heard of raucocantii m the man        the time may come when you may hear me too      you was not last year at the fair of lugo      but next when i m engaged to sing theredo go       our baritone i almost had forgot        a pretty lad but bursting with conceit      with graceful action science not a jot        a voice of no great compass and not sweet      he always is complaining of his lot        forsooth scarce fit for ballads in the street      in lovers parts his passion more to breathe      having no heart to show he shows his teeth       here raucocantis eloquent recital        was interrupted by the pirate crew      who came at stated moments to invite all        the captives back to their sad berths each threw      a rueful glance upon the waves which bright all        from the blue skies derived a double blue      dancing all free and happy in the sun      and then went down the hatchway one by one       they heard next daythat in the dardanelles        waiting for his sublimitys firman      the most imperative of sovereign spells        which every body does without who can      more to secure them in their naval cells        lady to lady well as man to man      were to be chaind and lotted out per couple      for the slave market of constantinople       it seems when this allotment was made out        there chanced to be an odd male and odd female      who after some discussion and some doubt        if the soprano might be deemd to be male      they placed him oer the women as a scout        were linkd together and it happend the male      was juanwho an awkward thing at his age      paird off with

that power was wasted upon him        for sorrow oer each sense held stern command      her eye might flash on his but found it dim        and though thus chaind as natural her hand      touchd his

we should neer too much enquire        but facts are facts no knight could be more true      and firmer faith no ladyelove desire        we will omit the proofs save one or two      t is said no one in hand can hold a fire        by thought of frosty caucasus but few      i really think yet juans then ordeal      was more triumphant and not much less real       here i might enter on a chaste description        having withstood temptation in my youth      but hear that several people take exception        at the first two books having too much truth      therefore i ll make don juan leave the ship soon        because the publisher declares in sooth      through needles eyes it easier for the camel is      to pass than those two cantos into families       t is all the same to me i m fond of yielding        and therefore leave them to the purer page      of smollett prior ariosto fielding        who say strange things for so correct an age      i once had great alacrity in wielding        my pen and liked poetic war to wage      and recollect the time when all this cant      would have provoked remarks which now it shant       as boys love rows my boyhood liked a squabble        but at this hour i wish to part in peace      leaving such to the literary rabble        whether my verses fame be doomd to cease      while the right hand which wrote it still is able        or of some centuries to take a lease      the grass upon my grave will grow as long      and sigh to midnight winds but not to song       of poets who come down to us through distance        of time and tongues the fosterbabes of fame      life seems the smallest portion of existence        where twenty ages gather oer a name      t is as a snowball which derives assistance        from every flake and yet rolls on the same      even till an iceberg it may chance to grow      but after all t is nothing but cold snow       and so great names are nothing more than nominal        and love of glory s but an airy lust      too often in its fury overcoming all        who would as t were identify their dust      from out the wide destruction which entombing all        leaves nothing till the coming of the just      save change i ve stood upon achilles tomb      and heard troy doubted time will doubt of rome       the very generations of the dead        are swept away and tomb inherits tomb      until the memory of an age is fled        and buried sinks beneath its offsprings doom      where are the epitaphs our fathers read        save a few gleand from the sepulchral gloom      which oncenamed myriads nameless lie beneath      and lose their own in universal death       i canter by the spot each afternoon        where perishd in his fame the heroboy      who lived too long for men but died too soon        for human vanity the young de foix      a broken pillar not uncouthly hewn        but which neglect is hastening to destroy      records ravennas carnage on its face      while weeds and ordure rankle round the base       i pass each day where dantes bones are laid        a little cupola more neat than solemn      protects his dust but reverence here is paid        to the bards tomb and not the warriors column      the time must come when both alike decayd        the chieftains trophy and the poets volume      will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth      before pelides death or homers birth       with human blood that column was cemented        with human filth that column is defiled      as if the peasants coarse contempt were vented        to show his loathing of the spot he soild      thus is the trophy used and thus lamented        should ever be those bloodhounds from whose wild      instinct of gore and glory earth has known      those sufferings dante saw in hell alone       yet there will still be bards though fame is smoke        its fumes are frankincense to human thought      and the unquiet feelings which first woke        song in the world will seek what then they sought      as on the beach the waves at last are broke        thus to their extreme verge the passions brought      dash into poetry which is but passion      or at least was so ere it grew a fashion       if in the course of such a life as was        at once adventurous and contemplative      men who partake all passions as they pass        acquire the deep and bitter power to give      their images again as in a glass        and in such colours that they seem to live      you may do right forbidding them to show em      but spoil i think a very pretty poem       o ye who make the fortunes of all books        benign ceruleans of the second sex      who advertise new poems by your looks        your imprimatur will ye not annex      what must i go to the oblivious cooks        those cornish plunderers of parnassian wrecks      ah must i then the only minstrel be      proscribed from tasting your castalian tea       what can i prove a lion then no more        a ballroom bard a foolscap hotpress darling      to bear the compliments of many a bore        and sigh i cant get out like yoricks starling      why then i ll swear as poet wordy swore        because the world wont read him always snarling      that taste is gone that fame is but a lottery      drawn by the bluecoat misses of a coterie       o darkly deeply beautifully blue        as some one somewhere sings about the sky      and i ye learned ladies say of you        they say your stockings are so heaven knows why      i have examined few pair of that hue        blue as the garters which serenely lie      round the patrician leftlegs which adorn      the festal midnight and the levee morn       yet some of you are most seraphic creatures        but times are alterd

   i m sensible redundancy is wrong        but could not for the muse of me put less in t      and now delay the progress of don juan      till what is calld in ossian the fifth juan   illustration canto 5     canto the fifth       when amatory poets sing their loves        in liquid lines mellifluously bland      and pair their rhymes as venus yokes her doves        they little think what mischief is in hand      the greater their success the worse it proves        as ovids verse may give to understand      even petrarchs self if judged with due severity      is the platonic pimp of all posterity       i therefore do denounce all amorous writing        except in such a way as not to attract      plainsimpleshort and by no means inviting        but with a moral to each error tackd      formd rather for instructing than delighting        and with all passions in their turn attackd      now if my pegasus should not be shod ill      this poem will become a moral model       the

and hoar        the twelve isles and the more than i could dream      far less describe present the very view      which charmd the charming mary montagu       i have a passion for the name of mary        for once it was a magic sound to me      and still it half calls up the realms of fairy        where i beheld what never was to be      all feelings changed but this was last to vary        a spell from which even yet i am not quite free      but i grow sadand let a tale grow cold      which must not be pathetically told       the wind swept down the euxine and the wave        broke foaming oer the blue symplegades      t is a grand sight from off the giants grave        to watch the progress of those rolling seas      between the bosphorus as they lash and lave        europe and asia you being quite at ease      there s not a sea the passenger eer pukes in      turns up more dangerous breakers than the euxine       t was a raw day of autumns bleak beginning        when nights are equal but not so the days      the parcae then cut short the further spinning        of seamens fates and the loud tempests raise      the waters and repentance for past sinning        in all who oer the great deep take their ways      they vow to amend their lives and yet they dont      because if drownd they cantif spared they wont       a crowd of shivering slaves of every nation        and age and sex were in the market ranged      each bevy with the merchant in his station        poor creatures their good looks were sadly changed      all save the blacks seemd jaded with vexation        from friends and home and freedom far estranged      the negroes more philosophy displayd      used to it no doubt as eels are to be flayd       juan was juvenile and thus was full        as most at his age are of hope and health      yet i must own he looked a little dull        and now and then a tear stole down by stealth      perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull        his spirit down and then the loss of wealth      a mistress and such comfortable quarters      to be put up for auction amongst tartars       were things to shake a stoic neertheless        upon the whole his carriage was serene      his figure and the splendour of his dress        of which some gilded remnants still were seen      drew all eyes on him giving them to guess        he was above the vulgar by his mien      and then though pale he was so very handsome      and thenthey calculated on his ransom       like a backgammon board the place was dotted        with whites and blacks in groups on show for sale      though rather more irregularly spotted        some bought the jet while others chose the pale      it chanced amongst the other people lotted        a man of thirty rather stout and hale      with resolution in his dark grey eye      next juan stood till some might choose to buy       he had an english look that is was square        in make of a complexion white and ruddy      good teeth with curling rather dark brown hair        and it might be from thought or toil or study      an open brow a little markd with care        one arm had on a bandage rather bloody      and there he stood with such sangfroid that greater      could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator       but seeing at his elbow a mere lad        of a high spirit evidently though      at present weighd down by a doom which had        oerthrown even men he soon began to show      a kind of blunt compassion for the sad        lot of so young a partner in the woe      which for himself he seemd to deem no worse      than any other scrape a thing of course       my boy said he amidst this motley crew        of georgians russians nubians and what not      all ragamuffins differing but in hue        with whom it is our luck to cast our lot      the only gentlemen seem i and you        so let us be acquainted as we ought      if i could yield you any consolation      t would give me pleasurepray what is your nation       when juan answerdspanish he replied        i thought in fact you could not be a greek      those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed        fortune has playd you here a pretty freak      but that s her way with all men till they re tried        but never mindshe ll turn perhaps next week      she has served me also much the same as you      except that i have found it nothing new       pray sir said juan if i may presume        what brought you hereoh nothing very rare      six tartars and a dragchainto this doom        but what conducted if the questions fair      is that which i would learni served for some        months with the russian army here and there      and taking lately by suwarrows bidding      a town was taen myself instead of widdin       have you no friendsi hadbut by gods blessing        have not been troubled with them lately now      i have answerd all your questions without pressing        and you an equal courtesy should show      alas said juan t were a tale distressing        and long besidesoh if t is really so      you re right on both accounts to hold your tongue      a sad tale saddens doubly when t is long       but droop not fortune at your time of life        although a female moderately fickle      will hardly leave you as she s not your wife        for any length of days in such a pickle      to strive too with our fate were such a strife        as if the cornsheaf should oppose the sickle      men are the sport of circumstances when      the circumstances seem the sport of men       t is not said juan for my present doom        i mourn but for the pasti loved a maid      he paused and his dark eye grew full of gloom        a single tear upon his eyelash staid      a moment and then droppd but to resume        t is not my present lot as i have said      which i deplore so much for i have borne      hardships which have the hardiest overworn       on the rough deep but this last blow and here        he stoppd again and turnd away his face      ay quoth his friend i thought it would appear        that there had been a lady in the case      and these are things which ask a tender tear        such as i too would shed if in your place      i cried upon my first wifes dying day      and also when my second ran away       my thirdyour third quoth juan turning round        you scarcely can be thirty have you three      noonly two at present above ground        surely t is nothing wonderful to see      one person thrice in holy wedlock bound        well then your third said juan what did she      she did not run away toodid she sir      no faithwhat theni ran away from her       you take things coolly sir said juan why        replied the other what can a man do      there still are many rainbows in your sky        but mine have vanishd all when life is new      commence with feelings warm and prospects high        but time strips our illusions of their hue      and one by one in turn some grand mistake      casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake       t is true it gets another bright and fresh        or fresher brighter but the year gone through      this skin must go the way too of all flesh        or sometimes only wear a week or two      love s the first net which spreads its deadly mesh        ambition avarice vengeance glory glue      the glittering limetwigs of our latter days      where still we flutter on for pence or praise       all this is very fine and may be true        said juan but i really dont see how      it betters present times with me or you        no quoth the other yet you will allow      by setting things in their right point of view        knowledge at least is gaind for instance now      we know what slavery is and our disasters      may teach us better to behave when masters       would we were masters now if but to try        their present lessons on our pagan friends here      said juanswallowing a heartburning sigh        heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here      perhaps we shall be one day by and by        rejoind the other when our bad luck mends here      meantime yon old black eunuch seems to eye us       but after all what is our present state        t is bad and may be betterall mens lot      most men are slaves none more so than the great        to their own whims and passions and what not      society itself which should create        kindness destroys what little we had got      to feel for none is the true social art      of the worlds stoicsmen without a heart       just now a black old neutral personage        of the third sex stept up and peering over      the captives seemd to mark their looks and age        and capabilities as to discover      if they were fitted for the purposed cage        no lady eer is ogled by a lover      horse by a blackleg broadcloth by a tailor      fee by a counsel felon by a jailor       as is a slave by his intended bidder        t is pleasant purchasing our fellowcreatures      and all are to be sold if you consider        their passions and are dextrous some by features      are bought up others by a warlike leader        some by a placeas tend their years or natures      the most by ready cashbut all have prices      from crowns to kicks according to their vices       the eunuch having eyed them oer with care        turnd to the merchant and begun to bid      first but for one and after for the pair        they haggled wrangled swore tooso they did      as though they were in a mere christian fair        cheapening an ox an ass a lamb or kid      so that their bargain sounded like a battle      for this superior yoke of human cattle       at last they settled into simple grumbling        and pulling out reluctant purses and      turning each piece of silver oer and tumbling        some down and weighing others in their hand      and by mistake sequins with paras jumbling        until the sum was accurately scannd      and then the merchant giving change and signing      receipts in full began to think of dining       i wonder if his appetite was good        or if it were if also his digestion      methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude        and conscience ask a curious sort of question      about the right divine how far we should        sell flesh and blood when dinner has opprest one      i think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour      which turns up out of the sad twentyfour       voltaire says no he tells you that candide        found life most tolerable after meals      he s wrongunless man were a pig indeed        repletion rather adds to what he feels      unless he s drunk and then no doubt he s freed        from his own brains oppression while it reels      of food i think with philips son or rather      ammons ill pleased with one world and one father       i think with alexander that the act        of eating with another act or two      makes us feel our mortality in fact        redoubled when a roast and a ragout      and fish and soup by some side dishes backd        can give us either pain or pleasure who      would pique himself on intellects whose use      depends so much upon the gastric juice       the other evening t was on friday last        this is a fact and no poetic fable      just as my great coat was about me cast        my hat and gloves still lying on the table      i heard a shott was eight oclock scarce past        and running out as fast as i was able      i found the military commandant      stretchd in the street and able scarce to pant       poor fellow for some reason surely bad        they had slain him with five slugs and left him there      to perish on the pavement so i had        him borne into the house and up the stair      and strippd and lookd tobut why should i ad        more circumstances vain was every care      the man was gone in some italian quarrel      killd by five bullets from an old gunbarrel       i gazed upon him for i knew him well        and though i have seen many corpses never      saw one whom such an accident befell        so calm though pierced through stomach heart and liver      he seemd to sleepfor you could scarcely tell        as he bled inwardly no hideous river      of gore divulged the cause that he was dead      so as i gazed on him i thought or said       can this be death then what is life or death        speak but he spoke not wake but still he slept      but yesterday and who had mightier breath        a thousand warriors by his word were kept      in awe he said as the centurion saith        go and he goeth come and forth he steppd      the trump and bugle till he spake were dumb      and now nought left him but the muffled drum       and they who waited once and worshippdthey        with their rough faces throngd about the bed      to gaze once more on the commanding clay        which for the last though not the first time bled      and such an end that he who many a day        had faced napoleons foes until they fled      the foremost in the charge or in the sally      should now be butcherd in a civic alley       the scars of his old wounds were near his new        those honourable scars which brought him fame      and horrid was the contrast to the view        but let me quit the theme as such things claim      perhaps even more attention than is due        from me i gazed as oft i have gazed the same      to try if i could wrench aught out of death      which should confirm or shake or make a faith       but it was all a mystery here we are        and there we gobut where five bits of lead      or three or two or one send very far        and is this blood then formd but to be shed      can every element our elements mar        and airearthwaterfire liveand we dead      we whose minds comprehend all things no more      but let us to the story as before       the purchaser of juan and acquaintance        bore off his bargains to a gilded boat      embarkd himself and them and off they went thence        as fast as oars could pull and water float      they lookd like persons being led to sentence        wondering what next till the caique was brought      up in a little creek below a wall      oertoppd with cypresses darkgreen and tall       here their conductor tapping at the wicket        of a small iron door t was opend and      he led them onward first through a low thicket        flankd by large groves which towerd on either hand      they almost lost their way and had to pick it        for night was dosing ere they came to land      the eunuch made a sign to those on board      who rowd off leaving them without a word       as they were plodding on their winding way        through orange bowers and jasmine and so forth      of which i might have a good deal to say        there being no such profusion in the north      of oriental plants et cetera        but that of late your scribblers think it worth      their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works      because one poet travelld mongst the turks       as they were threading on their way there came        into don juans head a thought which he      whisperd to his companiont was the same        which might have then occurrd to you or me      methinks said he it would be no great shame        if we should strike a stroke to set us free      let s knock that old black fellow on the head      and march awayt were easier done than said       yes said the other and when done what then        how get out how the devil got we in      and when we once were fairly out and when        from saint bartholomew we have saved our skin      tomorrow d see us in some other den        and worse off than we hitherto have been      besides i m hungry and just now would take      like esau for my birthright a beefsteak       we must be near some place of mans abode        for the old negros confidence in creeping      with his two captives by so queer a road        shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping      a single cry would bring them all abroad        t is therefore better looking before leaping      and there you see this turn has brought us through      by jove a noble palacelighted too       it was indeed a wide extensive building        which opend on their view and oer the front      there seemd to be besprent a deal of gilding        and various hues as is the turkish wont      a gaudy taste for they are little skilld in        the arts of which these lands were once the font      each villa on the bosphorus looks a screen      new painted or a pretty operascene       and nearer as they came a genial savour        of certain stews and roastmeats and pilaus      things which in hungry mortals eyes find favour        made juan in his harsh intentions pause      and put himself upon his good behaviour        his friend too adding a new saving clause      said in heavens name lets get some supper now      and then i m with you if you re for a row       some talk of an appeal unto some passion        some to mens feelings others to their reason      the last of these was never much the fashion        for reason thinks all reasoning out of season      some speakers whine and others lay the lash on        but more or less continue still to tease on      with arguments according to their forte      but no one dreams of ever being short       but i digress of all appealsalthough        i grant the power of pathos and of gold      of beauty flattery threats

    the tocsin of the soulthe dinnerbell       turkey contains no bells and yet men dine        and juan and his friend albeit they heard      no christian knoll to table saw no line        of lackeys usher to the feast prepared      yet smelt roastmeat beheld a huge fire shine        and cooks in motion with their clean arms bared      and gazed around them to the left and right      with the prophetic eye of appetite       and giving up all notions of resistance        they followd close behind their sable guide      who little thought that his own crackd existence        was on the point of being set aside      he motiond them to stop at some small distance        and knocking at the gate t was opend wide      and a magnificent large hall displayd      the asian pomp of ottoman parade       i wont describe description is my forte        but every fool describes in these bright days      his wondrous journey to some foreign court        and spawns his quarto and demands your praise      death to his publisher to him t is sport        while nature tortured twenty thousand ways      resigns herself with exemplary patience      to guidebooks rhymes tours sketches illustrations       along this hall and up and down some squatted        upon their hams were occupied at chess      others in monosyllable talk chatted        and some seemd much in love with their own dress      and divers smoked superb pipes decorated        with amber mouths of greater price or less      and several strutted others slept and some      prepared for supper with a glass of rum       as the black eunuch enterd with his brace        of purchased infidels some raised their eyes      a moment without slackening from their pace        but those who sate neer stirrd in anywise      one or two stared the captives in the face        just as one views a horse to guess his price      some nodded to the negro from their station      but no one troubled him with conversation       he leads them through the hall and without stopping        on through a farther range of goodly rooms      splendid but silent save in one where dropping        a marble fountain echoes through the glooms      of night which robe the chamber or where popping        some female head most curiously presumes      to thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice      as wondering what the devil a noise that is       some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls        gave light enough to hint their farther way      but not enough to show the imperial halls        in all the flashing of their full array

three seem so little one seems nothing        in deserts forests crowds or by the shore      there solitude we know has her full growth in        the spots which were her realms for evermore      but in a mighty hall or gallery both in        more modern buildings and those built of yore      a kind of death comes oer us all alone      seeing what s meant for many with but one       a neat snug study on a winters night        a book friend single lady or a glass      of claret sandwich and an appetite        are things which make an english evening pass      though certes by no means so

accused i doubt not by conspiracy      of an improper friendship for her horse        love like religion sometimes runs to heresy      this monstrous tale had probably its source        for such exaggerations here and there i see      in writing courser by mistake for courier      i wish the case could come before a jury here       but to resumeshould there be what may not        be in these

  and et sepulchri immemor struis domos      shows that we build when we should but entomb us       at last they reachd a quarter most retired        where echo woke as if from a long slumber      though full of all things which could be desired        one wonderd what to do with such a number      of articles which nobody required        here wealth had done its utmost to encumber      with furniture an exquisite apartment      which puzzled nature much to know what art meant       it seemd however but to open on        a range or suite of further chambers which      might lead to heaven knows where but in this one        the movables were prodigally rich      sofas t was half a sin to sit upon        so costly were they carpets every stitch      of workmanship so rare they made you wish      you could glide oer them like a golden fish       the black however without hardly deigning        a glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder      trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining        as if the milky way their feet was under      with all its stars and with a stretch attaining        a certain press or cupboard niched in yonder      in that remote recess which you may see      or if you dont the fault is not in me       i wish to be perspicuous and the black        i say unlocking the recess pulld forth      a quantity of clothes fit for the back        of any mussulman whateer his worth      and of variety there was no lack        and yet though i have said there was no dearth      he chose himself to point out what he thought      most proper for the christians he had bought       the suit he thought most suitable to each        was for the elder and the stouter first      a candiote cloak which to the knee might reach        and trousers not so tight that they would burst      but such as fit an asiatic breech        a shawl whose folds in cashmire had been nurst      slippers of saffron dagger rich and handy      in short all things which form a turkish dandy       while he was dressing baba their black friend        hinted the vast advantages which they      might probably attain both in the end        if they would but pursue the proper way      which fortune plainly seemd to recommend        and then he added that he needs must say      t would greatly tend to better their condition      if they would condescend to circumcision       for his own part he really should rejoice        to see them true believers but no less      would leave his proposition to their choice        the other thanking him for this excess      of goodness in thus leaving them a voice        in such a trifle scarcely could express      sufficiently he said his approbation      of all the customs of this polishd nation       for his own sharehe saw but small objection        to so respectable an ancient rite      and after swallowing down a slight refection        for which he ownd a present appetite      he doubted not a few hours of reflection        would reconcile him to the business quite      will it said juan sharply strike me dead      but they as soon shall circumcise my head       cut off a thousand heads beforenow pray        replied the other do not interrupt      you put me out in what i had to say        siras i said as soon as i have supt      i shall perpend if your proposal may        be such as i can properly accept      provided always your great goodness still      remits the matter to our own freewill       baba eyed juan and said be so good        as dress yourself and pointed out a suit      in which a princess with great pleasure would        array her limbs but juan standing mute      as not being in a masquerading mood        gave it a slight kick with his christian foot      and when the old negro told him to get ready      replied old gentleman i m not a lady       what you may be i neither know nor care        said baba but pray do as i desire      i have no more time nor many words to spare        at least said juan sure i may enquire      the cause of this odd travestyforbear        said baba to be curious t will transpire      no doubt in proper place and time and season      i have no authority to tell the reason       then if i do said juan i ll behold        rejoind the negro pray be not provoking      this spirit s well but it may wax too bold        and you will find us not top fond of joking      what sir said juan shall it eer be told        that i unsexd my dress but baba stroking      the things down said incense me and i call      those who will leave you of no sex at all       i offer you a handsome suit of clothes        a womans true but then there is a cause      why you should wear themwhat though my soul loathes        the effeminate garbthus after a short pause      sighd juan muttering also some slight oaths        what the devil shall i do with all this gauze      thus he profanely termd the finest lace      which eer set off a marriagemorning face       and then he swore and sighing on he slippd        a pair of trousers of fleshcolourd silk      next with a virgin zone he was equippd        which girt a slight chemise as white as milk      but tugging on his petticoat he trippd        whichas we sayor as the scotch say whilk      the rhyme obliges me to this sometimes      monarchs are less imperative than rhymes       whilk which or what you please was owing to        his garments novelty and his being awkward      and yet at last he managed to get through        his toilet though no doubt a little backward      the negro baba helpd a little too        when some untoward part of raiment stuck hard      and wrestling both his arms into a gown      he paused and took a survey up and down       one difficulty still remaindhis hair        was hardly long enough but baba found      so many false long tresses all to spare        that soon his head was most completely crownd      after the manner then in fashion there        and this addition with such gems was bound      as suited the ensemble of his toilet      while baba made him comb his head and oil it       and now being femininely all arrayd        with some small aid from scissors paint and tweezers      he lookd in almost all respects a maid        and baba smilingly exclaimd you see sirs      a perfect transformation here displayd        and now then you must come along with me sirs      that isthe lady clapping his hands twice      four blacks were at his elbow in a trice       you sir said baba nodding to the one        will please to accompany those gentlemen      to supper but you worthy christian nun        will follow me no trifling sir for when      i say a thing it must at once be done        what fear you think you this a lions den      why t is a palace where the truly wise      anticipate the prophets paradise       you fool i tell you no one means you harm        so much the better juan said for them      else they shall feel the weight of this my arm        which is not quite so light as you may deem      i yield thus far but soon will break the charm        if any take me for that which i seem      so that i trust for everybodys sake      that this disguise may lead to no mistake       blockhead come on and see quoth baba while        don juan turning to his comrade who      though somewhat grieved could scarce forbear a smile        upon the metamorphosis in view      farewell they mutually exclaimd this soil        seems fertile in adventures strange and new      one s turnd half mussulman and one a maid      by this old black enchanters unsought aid       farewell said juan should we meet no more        i wish you a good appetitefarewell      replied the other though it grieves me sore        when we next meet we ll have a tale to tell      we needs must follow when fate puts from shore        keep your good name though eve herself once fell      nay quoth the maid the sultans self shant carry me      unless his highness promises to marry me       and thus they parted each by separate doors        baba led juan onward room by room      through glittering galleries and oer marble floors        till a gigantic portal through the gloom      haughty and huge along the distance lowers        and wafted far arose a rich perfume      it seemd as though they came upon a shrine      for all was vast still fragrant and divine       the giant door was broad and bright and high        of gilded bronze and carved in curious guise      warriors thereon were battling furiously        here stalks the victor there the vanquishd lies      there captives led in triumph droop the eye        and in perspective many a squadron flies      it seems the work of times before the line      of rome transplanted fell with constantine       this massy portal stood at the wide close        of a huge hall and on its either side      two little dwarfs the least you could suppose        were sate like ugly imps as if allied      in mockery to the enormous gate which rose        oer them in almost pyramidic pride      the gate so splendid was in all its features      you never thought about those little creatures       until you nearly trod on them and then        you started back in horror to survey      the wondrous hideousness of those small men        whose colour was not black nor white nor grey      but an extraneous mixture which no pen        can trace although perhaps the pencil may      they were misshapen pigmies deaf and dumb      monsters who cost a no less monstrous sum       their duty wasfor they were strong and though        they lookd so little did strong things at times      to ope this door which they could really do        the hinges being as smooth as rogers rhymes      and now and then with tough strings of the bow        as is the custom of those eastern climes      to give some rebel pacha a cravat      for mutes are generally used for that       they spoke by signsthat is not spoke at all        and looking like two incubi they glared      as baba with his fingers made them fall        to heaving back the portal folds it scared      juan a moment as this pair so small        with shrinking serpent optics on him stared      it was as if their little looks could poison      or fascinate whomeer they fixd their eyes on       before they enterd baba paused to hint        to juan some slight lessons as his guide      if you could just contrive he said to stint        that somewhat manly majesty of stride      t would be as well and though there s not much in t        to swing a little less from side to side      which has at times an aspect of the oddest      and also could you look a little modest       t would be convenient for these mutes have eyes        like needles which may pierce those petticoats      and if they should discover your disguise        you know how near us the deep bosphorus floats      and you and i may chance ere morning rise        to find our way to marmora without boats      stitchd up in sacksa mode of navigation      a good deal practised here upon occasion       with this encouragement he led the way        into a room still nobler than the last      a rich confusion formd a disarray        in such sort that the eye along it cast      could hardly carry anything away        object on object flashd so bright and fast      a dazzling mass of gems and gold and glitter      magnificently mingled in a litter       wealth had done wonderstaste not much such things        occur in orient palaces and even      in the more chastend domes of western kings        of which i have also seen some six or seven      where i cant say or gold or diamond flings        great lustre there is much to be forgiven      groups of bad statues tables chairs and pictures      on which i cannot pause to make my strictures       in this imperial hall at distance lay        under a canopy and there reclined      quite in a confidential queenly way        a lady baba stoppd and kneeling signd      to juan who though not much used to pray        knelt down by instinct wondering in his mind      what all this meant while baba bowd and bended      his head until the ceremony ended       the lady rising up with such an air        as venus rose with from the wave on them      bent like an antelope a paphian pair        of eyes which put out each surrounding gem      and raising up an arm as moonlight fair        she signd to baba who first kissd the hem      of her deep purple robe and speaking low      pointed to juan who remaind below       her presence was as lofty as her state        her beauty of that overpowering kind      whose force description only would abate        i d rather leave it much to your own mind      than lessen it by what i could relate        of forms and features it would strike you blind      could i do justice to the full detail      so luckily for both my phrases fail       thus much however i may addher years        were ripe they might make sixandtwenty springs      but there are forms which time to touch forbears        and turns aside his scythe to vulgar things      such as was marys queen of scots truetears        and love destroy and sapping sorrow wrings      charms from the charmer yet some never grow      ugly for instanceninon de lenclos       she spake some words to her attendants who        composed a choir of girls ten or a dozen      and were all clad alike like juan too        who wore their uniform by baba chosen      they formd a very nymphlike looking crew        which might have calld dianas chorus cousin      as far as outward show may correspond      i wont be bail for anything beyond       they bowd obeisance and withdrew retiring        but not by the same door through which came in      baba and juan which last stood admiring        at some small distance all he saw within      this strange saloon much fitted for inspiring        marvel and praise for both or none things win      and i must say i neer could see the very      great happiness of the nil admirari       not to admire is all the art i know        plain truth dear murray needs few flowers of speech      to make men happy or to keep them so        so take it in the very words of creech      thus horace wrote we all know long ago        and thus pope quotes the precept to reteach      from his translation but had none admired      would pope have sung or horace been inspired       baba when all the damsels were withdrawn        motiond to juan to approach and then      a second time desired him to kneel down        and kiss the ladys foot which maxim when      he heard repeated juan with a frown        drew himself up to his full height again      and said it grieved him but he could not stoop      to any shoe unless it shod the pope       baba indignant at this illtimed pride        made fierce remonstrances and then a threat      he mutterd but the last was given aside        about a bowstringquite in vain not yet      would juan bend though t were to mahomets bride        there s nothing in the world like etiquette      in kingly chambers or imperial halls      as also at the race and county balls       he stood like atlas with a world of words        about his ears and nathless would not bend      the blood of all his line s castilian lords        boild in his veins and rather than descend      to stain his pedigree a thousand swords        a thousand times of him had made an end      at length perceiving the foot could not stand      baba proposed that he should kiss the hand       here was an honourable compromise        a halfway house of diplomatic rest      where they might meet in much more peaceful guise        and juan now his willingness exprest      to use all fit and proper courtesies        adding that this was commonest and best      for through the south the custom still commands      the gentleman to kiss the ladys hands       and he advanced though with but a bad grace        though on more thoroughbred or fairer fingers      no lips eer left their transitory trace        on such as these the lip too fondly lingers      and for one kiss would fain imprint a brace        as you will see if she you love shall bring hers      in contact and sometimes even a fair strangers      an almost twelvemonths constancy endangers       the lady eyed him oer and oer and bade        baba retire which he obeyd in style      as if well used to the retreating trade        and taking hints in good part all the while      he whisperd juan not to be afraid        and looking on him with a sort of smile      took leave with such a face of satisfaction      as good men wear who have done a virtuous action       when he was gone there was a sudden change        i know not what might be the ladys thought      but oer her bright brow flashd a tumult strange        and into her dear cheek the blood was brought      bloodred as sunset summer clouds which range        the verge of heaven and in her large eyes wrought      a mixture of sensations might be scannd      of half voluptuousness and half command       her form had all the softness of her sex        her features all the sweetness of the devil      when he put on the cherub to perplex        eve and paved god knows how the road to evil      the sun himself was scarce more free from specks        than she from aught at which the eye could cavil      yet somehow there was something somewhere wanting      as if she rather orderd than was granting       something imperial or imperious threw        a chain oer all she did that is a chain      was thrown as t were about the neck of you        and raptures self will seem almost a pain      with aught which looks like despotism in view        our souls at least are free and t is in vain      we would against them make the flesh obey      the spirit in the end will have its way       her very smile was haughty though so sweet        her very nod was not an inclination      there was a selfwill even in her small feet        as though they were quite conscious of her station      they trod as upon necks and to complete        her state it is the custom of her nation      a poniard deckd her girdle as the sign      she was a sultans bride thank heaven not mine       to hear and to obey had been from birth        the law of all around her to fulfill      all phantasies which yielded joy or mirth        had been her slaves chief pleasure as her will      her blood was high her beauty scarce of earth        judge then if her caprices eer stood still      had she but been a christian i ve a notion      we should have found out the perpetual motion       whateer she saw and coveted was brought        whateer she did not see if she supposed      it might be seen with diligence was sought        and when t was found straightway the bargain closed      there was no end unto the things she bought        nor to the trouble which her fancies caused      yet even her tyranny had such a grace      the women pardond all except her face       juan the latest of her whims had caught        her eye in passing on his way to sale      she orderd him directly to be bought        and baba who had neer been known to fail      in any kind of mischief to be wrought        at all such auctions knew how to prevail      she had no prudence but he had and this      explains the garb which juan took amiss       his youth and features favourd the disguise        and should you ask how she a sultans bride      could risk or compass such strange phantasies        this i must leave sultanas to decide      emperors are only husbands in wives eyes        and kings and consorts oft are mystified      as we may ascertain with due precision      some by experience others by tradition       but to the main point where we have been tending        she now conceived all difficulties past      and deemd herself extremely condescending        when being made her property at last      without more preface in her blue eyes blending        passion and power a glance on him she cast      and merely saying christian canst thou love      conceived that phrase was quite enough to move       and so it was in proper time and place        but juan who had still his mind oerflowing      with haidees isle and soft ionian face        felt the warm blood which in his face was glowing      rush back upon his heart which filld apace        and left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing      these words went through his soul like arabspears      so that he spoke not but burst into tears       she was a good deal shockd not shockd at tears        for women shed and use them at their liking      but there is something when mans eye appears        wet still more disagreeable and striking      a womans teardrop melts a mans half sears        like molten lead as if you thrust a pike in      his heart to force it out for to be shorter      to them t is a relief to us a torture       and she would have consoled but knew not how        having no equals nothing which had eer      infected her with sympathy till now        and never having dreamt what t was to bear      aught of a serious sorrowing kind although        there might arise some pouting petty care      to cross her brow she wonderd how so near      her eyes anothers eye could shed a tear       but nature teaches more than power can spoil        and when a strong although a strange sensation      movesfemale hearts are such a genial soil        for kinder feelings whatsoeer their nation      they naturally pour the wine and oil        samaritans in every situation      and thus gulbeyaz though she knew not why      felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye       but tears must stop like all things else and soon        juan who for an instant had been moved      to such a sorrow by the intrusive tone        of one who dared to ask if he had loved      calld back the stoic to his eyes which shone        bright with the very weakness he reproved      and although sensitive to beauty he      felt most indignant still at not being free       gulbeyaz for the first time in her days        was much embarrassd never having met      in all her life with aught save prayers and praise        and as she also riskd her life to get      him whom she meant to tutor in loves ways        into a comfortable teteatete      to lose the hour would make her quite a martyr      and they had wasted now almost a quarter       i also would suggest the fitting time        to gentlemen in any such like case      that is to say in a meridian clime        with us there is more law given to the chase      but here a small delay forms a great crime        so recollect that the extremest grace      is just two minutes for your declaration      a moment more would hurt your reputation       juans was good and might have been still better        but he had got haidee into his head      however strange he could not yet forget her        which made him seem exceedingly illbred      gulbeyaz who lookd on him as her debtor        for having had him to her palace led      began to blush up to the eyes and then      grow deadly pale and then blush back again       at length in an imperial way she laid        her hand on his and bending on him eyes      which needed not an empire to persuade        lookd into his for love where none replies      her brow grew black but she would not upbraid        that being the last thing a proud woman tries      she rose and pausing one chaste moment threw      herself upon his breast and there she grew       this was an awkward test as juan found        but he was steeld by sorrow wrath and pride      with gentle force her white arms he unwound        and seated her all drooping by his side      then rising haughtily he glanced around        and looking coldly in her face he cried      the prisond eagle will not pair nor      serve a sultanas sensual phantasy       thou askst if i can love be this the proof        how much i have lovedthat i love not thee      in this vile garb the distaff web and woof        were fitter for me love is for the free      i am not dazzled by this splendid roof        whateer thy power and great it seems to be      heads bow knees bend eyes watch around a throne      and hands obeyour hearts are still our own       this was a truth to us extremely trite        not so to her who neer had heard such things      she deemd her least command must yield delight        earth being only made for queens and kings      if hearts lay on the left side or the right        she hardly knew to such perfection brings      legitimacy its born votaries when      aware of their due royal rights oer men       besides as has been said she was so fair        as even in a much humbler lot had made      a kingdom or confusion anywhere        and also as may be presumed she laid      some stress on charms which seldom are if eer        by their possessors thrown into the shade      she thought hers gave a double right divine      and half of that opinion s also mine       remember or if you can not imagine        ye who have kept your chastity when young      while some more desperate dowager has been waging        love with you and been in the dogdays stung      by your refusal recollect her raging        or recollect all that was said or sung      on such a

      a vulgar tempest t were to a typhoon        to match a common fury with her rage      and yet she did not want to reach the moon        like moderate hotspur on the immortal page      her anger pitchd into a lower tune        perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age      her wish was but to kill kill kill like lears      and then her thirst of blood was quenchd in tears       a storm it raged and like the storm it passd        passd without wordsin fact she could not speak      and then her sexs shame broke in at last        a sentiment till then in her but weak      but now it flowd

      her sixth to stab herself her seventh to sentence      the lash to bababut her grand resource      was to sit down again and cry of course       she thought to stab herself but then she had        the dagger close at hand which made it awkward      for eastern stays are little made to pad        so that a poniard pierces if t is stuck hard      she thought of killing juanbut poor lad        though he deserved it well for being so backward      the cutting off his head was not the art      most likely to attain her aimhis heart       juan was moved he had made up his mind        to be impaled or quarterd as a dish      for dogs or to be slain with pangs refined        or thrown to lions or made baits for fish      and thus heroically stood resignd        rather than sinexcept to his own wish      but all his great preparatives for dying      dissolved like snow before a woman crying       as through his palms bob acres valour oozed        so juans virtue ebbd i know not how      and first he wonderd why he had refused        and then if matters could be made up now      and next his savage virtue he accused        just as a friar may accuse his vow      or as a dame repents her of her oath      which mostly ends in some small breach of both       so he began to stammer some excuses        but words are not enough in such a matter      although you borrowd all

majesty was always so polite      as to announce his visits a long while        before he came especially at night      for being the last wife of the emperour      she was of course the favorite of

that the earth was square      because he had journeyd fifty miles and found        no sign that it was circular anywhere      his empire also was without a bound        t is true a little troubled here and there      by rebel pachas and encroaching giaours      but then they never came to the seven towers       except in shape of envoys who were sent        to lodge there when a war broke out according      to the true law of nations which neer meant        those scoundrels who have never had a sword in      their dirty diplomatic hands to vent        their spleen in making strife and

stowd      the former in a palace where like nuns        they lived till some bashaw was sent abroad      when she whose turn it was was wed at once        sometimes at six years oldthough it seems odd      t is true the reason is that the bashaw      must make a present to his sire in law       his sons were kept in prison till they grew        of years to fill a bowstring or the throne      one or the other but which of the two        could yet be known unto the fates alone      meantime the education they went through        was princely as the proofs have always shown      so that the heir apparent still was found      no less deserving to be hangd than crownd       his majesty saluted his fourth spouse        with all the ceremonies of his rank      who cleard her sparkling eyes and smoothd her brows        as suits a matron who has playd a prank      these must seem doubly mindful of their vows        to save the credit of their breaking bank      to no men are such cordial

toss and wriggle      but etiquette forbade them all to giggle       the turks do well to shutat least sometimes        the women up because in sad reality      their chastity in these unhappy climes        is not a thing of that astringent quality      which in the north prevents precocious crimes        and makes our snow less pure than our morality      the sun which yearly melts the polar ice

worst of vicespropagation       we leave this royal couple to repose        a bed is not a throne and they may sleep      whateer their dreams be if of joys or woes        yet disappointed joys are woes as deep      as any mans day mixture undergoes        our least of sorrows are such as we weep      tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears      the soul out like the stone with petty cares       a scolding wife a sullen son a bill        to pay unpaid protested or discounted      at a percentage a child cross dog ill        a favourite horse fallen lame just as he s mounted      a bad old woman making a worse will        which leaves you minus of the cash you counted      as certainthese are paltry things and yet      i ve rarely seen the man they did not fret       i m a philosopher confound them all        bills beasts and men andno not womankind      with one good hearty curse i vent my gall        and then my stoicism leaves nought behind      which it can either pain or evil call        and i can give my whole soul up to mind      though what is soul or mind their birth or growth      is more than i knowthe deuce take them both         as after reading athanasius curse      which doth your true believer so much please        i doubt if any now could make it worse      oer his worst enemy when at his knees        tis so sententious positive and terse      and decorates the book of common prayer      as doth a rainbow the just clearing air       gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping or        at least one of themoh the heavy night      when wicked wives who love some bachelor        lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light      of the gray morning and look vainly for        its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite      to toss to tumble doze revive and quake      lest their too lawful bedfellow should wake       these are beneath the canopy of heaven        also beneath the canopy of beds      fourposted and silk curtaind which are given        for rich men and their brides to lay their heads      upon in sheets white as what bards call driven        snow well tis all haphazard when one weds      gulbeyaz was an empress but had been      perhaps as wretched if a peasants quean       don juan in his feminine disguise        with all the damsels in their long array      had bowd themselves before th imperial eyes        and at the usual signal taen their way      back to their chambers those long galleries        in the seraglio where the ladies lay      their delicate limbs a thousand bosoms there      beating for love as the caged birds for air       i love the sex and sometimes would reverse        the tyrants wish that mankind only had      one neck which he with one fell stroke might pierce        my wish is quite as wide but not so bad      and much more tender on the whole than fierce        it being not now but only while a lad      that womankind had but one rosy mouth      to kiss them all at once from north to south       o enviable briareus with thy hands        and heads if thou hadst all things multiplied      in such proportionbut my muse withstands        the giant thought of being a titans bride      or travelling in patagonian lands        so let us back to lilliput and guide      our hero through the labyrinth of love      in which we left him several lines above       he went forth with the lovely odalisques        at the given signal joind to their array      and though he certainly ran many risks        yet he could not at times keep by the way      although the consequences of such frisks        are worse than the worst damages men pay      in moral england where the thing s a tax      from ogling all their charms from breasts to backs       still he forgot not his disguisealong        the galleries from room to room they walkd      a virginlike and edifying throng        by eunuchs flankd while at their head there stalkd      a dame who kept up discipline among        the female ranks so that none stirrd or talkd      without her sanction on their sheparades      her title was the mother of the maids       whether she was a mother i know not        or whether they were maids who calld her mother      but this is her seraglio title got        i know not how but good as any other      so cantemir can tell you or de tott        her office was to keep aloof or smother      all bad propensities in fifteen hundred      young women and correct them when they blunderd       a goodly sinecure no doubt but made        more easy by the absence of all men      except his majesty who with her aid        and guards and bolts and walls and now and then      a slight example just to cast a shade        along the rest contrived to keep this den      of beauties cool as an italian convent      where all the passions have alas but one vent       and what is that devotion doubtlesshow        could you ask such a questionbut we will      continue as i said this goodly row        of ladies of all countries at the will      of one good man with stately march and slow        like waterlilies floating down a rill      or rather lake for rills do not run slowly      paced on most maidenlike and melancholy       but when they reachd their own apartments there        like birds or boys or bedlamites broke loose      waves at springtide or women anywhere        when freed from bonds which are of no great use      after all or like irish at a fair        their guards being gone and as it were a truce      establishd between them and bondage they      began to sing dance chatter smile and play       their talk of course ran most on the new comer        her shape her hair her air her everything      some thought her dress did not so much become her        or wonderd at her ears without a ring      some said her years were getting nigh their summer        others contended they were but in spring      some thought her rather masculine in height      while others wishd that she had been so quite       but no one doubted on the whole that she        was what her dress bespoke a damsel fair      and fresh and beautiful exceedingly        who with the brightest georgians might compare      they wonderd how gulbeyaz too could be        so silly as to buy slaves who might share      if that his highness wearied of his bride      her throne and power and every thing beside       but what was strangest in this virgin crew        although her beauty was enough to vex      after the first investigating view        they all found out as few or fewer specks      in the fair form of their companion new        than is the custom of the gentle sex      when they survey with christian eyes or heathen      in a new face the ugliest creature breathing       and yet they had their little jealousies        like all the rest but upon this occasion      whether there are such things as sympathies        without our knowledge or our approbation      although they could not see through his disguise        all felt a soft kind of concatenation      like magnetism or devilism or what      you pleasewe will not quarrel about that       but certain tis they all felt for their new        companion something newer still as twere      a sentimental friendship through and through        extremely pure which made them all concur      in wishing her their sister save a few        who wishd they had a brother just like her      whom if they were at home in sweet circassia      they would prefer to padisha or pacha       of those who had most genius for this sort        of sentimental friendship there were three      lolah katinka and dudu in short        to save description fair as fair can be      were they according to the best report        though differing in stature and degree      and clime and time and country and complexion      they all alike admired their new connection       lolah was dusk as india and as warm        katinka was a georgian white and red      with great blue eyes a lovely hand and arm        and feet so small they scarce seemd made to tread      but rather skim the earth while dudus form        lookd more adapted to be put to bed      being somewhat large and languishing and lazy      yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy       a kind of sleepy venus seemd dudu        yet very fit to murder sleep in those      who gazed upon her cheeks transcendent hue        her attic forehead and her phidian nose      few angles were there in her form tis true        thinner she might have been and yet scarce lose      yet after all twould puzzle to say where      it would not spoil some separate charm to pare       she was not violently lively but        stole on your spirit like a mayday breaking      her eyes were not too sparkling yet halfshut        they put beholders in a tender taking      she lookd this simile s quite new just cut        from marble like pygmalions statue waking      the mortal and the marble still at strife      and timidly expanding into life       lolah demanded the new damsels name        juannawell a pretty name enough      katinka askd her also whence she came        from spainbut where is spaindont ask such stuff      nor show your georgian ignorancefor shame        said lolah with an accent rather rough      to poor katinka spain s an island near      morocco betwixt egypt and tangier       dudu said nothing but sat down beside        juanna playing with her veil or hair      and looking at her steadfastly she sighd        as if she pitied her for being there      a pretty stranger without friend or guide        and all abashd too at the general stare      which welcomes hapless strangers in all places      with kind remarks upon their mien and faces       but here the mother of the maids drew near        with ladies it is time to go to rest      i m puzzled what to do with you my dear        she added to juanna their new guest      your coming has been unexpected here        and every couch is occupied you had best      partake of mine but by tomorrow early      we will have all things settled for you fairly       here lolah interposedmamma you know        you dont sleep soundly and i cannot bear      that anybody should disturb you so        i ll take juanna we re a slenderer pair      than you would make the half ofdont say no        and i of your young charge will take due care      but here katinka interfered and said      she also had compassion and a bed       besides i hate to sleep alone quoth she        the matron frownd why sofor fear of ghosts      replied katinka i am sure i see        a phantom upon each of the four posts      and then i have the worst dreams that can be        of guebres giaours and ginns and gouls in hosts      the dame replied between your dreams and you      i fear juannas dreams would be but few       you lolah must continue still to lie        alone for reasons which dont matter you      the same katinka until by and by        and i shall place juanna with dudu      who s quiet inoffensive silent shy        and will not toss and chatter the night through      what say you childdudu said nothing as      her talents were of the more silent class       but she rose up and kissd the matrons brow        between the eyes and lolah on both cheeks      katinka too and with a gentle bow        curtsies are neither used by turks nor greeks      she took juanna by the hand to show        their place of rest and left to both their piques      the others pouting at the matrons preference      of dudu though they held their tongues from deference       it was a spacious chamber oda is        the turkish title and ranged round the wall      were couches toiletsand much more than this        i might describe as i have seen it all      but it sufficeslittle was amiss        twas on the whole a nobly furnishd hall      with all things ladies want save one or two      and even those were nearer than they knew       dudu as has been said was a sweet creature        not very dashing but extremely winning      with the most regulated charms of feature        which painters cannot catch like faces sinning      against proportionthe wild strokes of nature        which they hit off at once in the beginning      full of expression right or wrong that strike      and pleasing or unpleasing still are like       but she was a soft landscape of mild earth        where all was harmony and calm and quiet      luxuriant budding cheerful without mirth        which if not happiness is much more nigh it      than are your mighty passions and so forth        which some call the sublime i wish they d try it      i ve seen your stormy seas and stormy women      and pity lovers rather more than seamen       but she was pensive more than melancholy        and serious more than pensive and serene      it may be more than eithernot unholy        her thoughts at least till now appear to have been      the strangest thing was beauteous she was wholly        unconscious albeit turnd of quick seventeen      that she was fair or dark or short or tall      she never thought about herself at all       and therefore was she kind and gentle as        the age of gold when gold was yet unknown      by which its nomenclature came to pass        thus most appropriately has been shown      lucus a non lucendo not what was        but what was not a sort of style that s grown      extremely common in this age whose metal      the devil may decompose but never settle       i think it may be of corinthian brass        which was a mixture of all metals but      the brazen uppermost kind reader pass        this long parenthesis i could not shut      it sooner for the soul of me and class        my faults even with your own which meaneth put      a kind construction upon them and me      but that you wontthen donti am not less free       tis time we should return to plain narration        and thus my narrative proceedsdudu      with every kindness short of ostentation        showd juan or juanna through and through      this labyrinth of females and each station        describedwhat s strangein words extremely few      i have but one simile and that s a blunder      for wordless woman which is silent thunder       and next she gave her i say her because        the gender still was epicene at least      in outward show which is a saving clause        an outline of the customs of the east      with all their chaste integrity of laws        by which the more a haram is increased      the stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties      of any supernumerary beauties       and then she gave juanna a chaste kiss        dudu was fond of kissingwhich i m sure      that nobody can ever take amiss        because tis pleasant so that it be pure      and between females means no more than this        that they have nothing better near or newer      kiss rhymes to bliss in fact as well as verse      i wish it never led to something worse       in perfect innocence she then unmade        her toilet which cost little for she was      a child of nature carelessly arrayd        if fond of a chance ogle at her glass      twas like the fawn which in the lake displayd        beholds her own shy shadowy image pass      when first she starts and then returns to peep      admiring this new native of the deep       and one by one her articles of dress        were laid aside but not before she offerd      her aid to fair juanna whose excess        of modesty declined the assistance profferd      which passd well offas she could do no less        though by this politesse she rather sufferd      pricking her fingers with those cursed pins      which surely were invented for our sins       making a woman like a porcupine        not to be rashly touchd but still more dread      o ye whose fate it is as once twas mine        in early youth to turn a ladys maid      i did my very boyish best to shine        in tricking her out for a masquerade      the pins were placed sufficiently but not      stuck all exactly in the proper spot       but these are foolish things to all the wise        and i love wisdom more than she loves me      my tendency is to philosophise        on most things from a tyrant to a tree      but still the spouseless virgin knowledge flies        what are we and whence came we what shall be      our ultimate existence what s our present      are questions answerless and yet incessant       there was deep silence in the chamber dim        and distant from each other burnd the lights      and slumber hoverd oer each lovely limb        of the fair occupants if there be sprites      they should have walkd there in their sprightliest trim        by way of change from their sepulchral sites      and shown themselves as ghosts of better taste      than haunting some old ruin or wild waste       many and beautiful lay those around        like flowers of different hue and dime and root      in some exotic garden sometimes found        with cost and care and warmth induced to shoot      one with her auburn tresses lightly bound        and fair brows gently drooping as the fruit      nods from the tree was slumbering with soft breath      and lips apart which showd the pearls beneath       one with her flushd cheek laid on her white arm        and raven ringlets gatherd in dark crowd      above her brow lay dreaming soft and warm        and smiling through her dream as through a cloud      the moon breaks half unveild each further charm        as slightly stirring in her snowy shroud      her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night      all bashfully to struggle into light       this is no bull although it sounds so for        twas night but there were lamps as hath been said      a thirds all pallid aspect offerd more        the traits of sleeping sorrow and betrayd      through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore        beloved and deplored while slowly strayd      as nightdew on a cypress glittering tinges      the black bough teardrops through her eyes dark fringes       a fourth as marble statuelike and still        lay in a breathless hushd and stony sleep      white cold and pure as looks a frozen rill        or the snow minaret on an alpine steep      or lots wife done in saltor what you will        my similes are gatherd in a heap      so pick and chooseperhaps you ll be content      with a carved lady on a monument       and lo a fifth appearsand what is she        a lady of a certain age which means      certainly agedwhat her years might be        i know not never counting past their teens      but there she slept not quite so fair to see        as ere that awful period intervenes      which lays both men and women on the shelf      to meditate upon their sins and self       but all this time how slept or dreamd dudu        with strict inquiry i could neer discover      and scorn to add a syllable untrue        but ere the middle watch was hardly over      just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue        and phantoms hoverd or might seem to hover      to those who like their company about      the apartment on a sudden she screamd out       and that so loudly that upstarted all        the oda in a general commotion      matron and maids and those whom you may call        neither came crowding like the waves of ocean      one on the other throughout the whole hall        all trembling wondering without the least notion      more than i have myself of what could make      the calm dudu so turbulently wake       but wide awake she was and round her bed        with floating draperies and with flying hair      with eager eyes and light but hurried tread        and bosoms arms and ankles glancing bare      and bright as any meteor ever bred        by the north polethey sought her cause of care      for she seemd agitated flushd and frightend      her eye dilated and her colour heightend       but what was strangeand a strong proof how great        a blessing is sound sleepjuanna lay      as fast as ever husband by his mate        in holy matrimony snores away      not all the clamour broke her happy state        of slumber ere they shook herso they say      at leastand then she too unclosed her eyes      and yawnd a good deal with discreet surprise       and now commenced a strict investigation        which as all spoke at once and more than once      conjecturing wondering asking a narration        alike might puzzle either wit or dunce      to answer in a very clear oration        dudu had never passd for wanting sense      but being no orator as brutus is      could not at first expound what was amiss       at length she said that in a slumber sound        she dreamd a dream of walking in a wood      a wood obscure like that where dante found        himself in at the age when all grow good      lifes halfway house where dames with virtue crownd        run much less risk of lovers turning rude      and that this wood was full of pleasant fruits      and trees of goodly growth and spreading roots       and in the midst a golden apple grew        a most prodigious pippinbut it hung      rather too high and distant that she threw        her glances on it and then longing flung      stones and whatever she could pick up to        bring down the fruit which still perversely clung      to its own bough and dangled yet in sight      but always at a most provoking height       that on a sudden when she least had hope        it fell down of its own accord before      her feet that her first movement was to stoop        and pick it up and bite it to the core      that just as her young lip began to ope        upon the golden fruit the vision bore      a bee flew out and stung her to the heart      and soshe awoke with a great scream and start       all this she told with some confusion and        dismay the usual consequence of dreams      of the unpleasant kind with none at hand        to expound their vain and visionary gleams      i ve known some odd ones which seemd really plannd        prophetically or that which one deems      a strange coincidence to use a phrase      by which such things are settled nowadays       the damsels who had thoughts of some great harm        began as is the consequence of fear      to scold a little at the false alarm        that broke for nothing on their sleeping car      the matron too was wroth to leave her warm        bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear      and chafed at poor dudu who only sighd      and said that she was sorry she had cried       i ve heard of stories of a cock and bull        but visions of an apple and a bee      to take us from our natural rest and pull        the whole oda from their beds at halfpast three      would make us think the moon is at its full        you surely are unwell child we must see      tomorrow what his highnesss physician      will say to this hysteric of a vision       and poor juanna toothe childs first night        within these walls to be broke in upon      with such a clamour i had thought it right        that the young stranger should not lie alone      and as the quietest of all she might        with you dudu a good nights rest have known      but now i must transfer her to the charge      of lolahthough her couch is not so large       lolahs eyes sparkled at the proposition        but poor dudu with large drops in her own      resulting from the scolding or the vision        implored that present pardon might be shown      for this first fault and that on no condition        she added in a soft and piteous tone      juanna should be taken from her and      her future dreams should all be kept in hand       she promised never more to have a dream        at least to dream so loudly as just now      she wonderd at herself how she could scream        twas foolish nervous as she must allow      a fond hallucination and a theme        for laughterbut she felt her spirits low      and beggd they would excuse her she d get over      this weakness in a few hours and recover       and here juanna kindly interposed        and said she felt herself extremely well      where she then was as her sound sleep disclosed        when all around rang like a tocsin bell      she did not find herself the least disposed        to quit her gentle partner and to dwell      apart from one who had no sin to show      save that of dreaming once malapropos       as thus juanna spoke dudu turnd round        and hid her face within juannas breast      her neck alone was seen but that was found        the colour of a budding roses crest      i cant tell why she blushd nor can expound        the mystery of this rupture of their rest      all that i know is that the facts i state      are true as truth has ever been of late       and so good night to themor if you will        good morrowfor the cock had crown and light      began to clothe each asiatic hill        and the mosque crescent struggled into sight      of the long caravan which in the chill        of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height      that stretches to the stony belt which girds      asia where kaff looks down

divan      though an unusual fit of love or duty      had made him lately bask in his brides beauty       and now he rose and after due ablutions        exacted by the customs of the east      and prayers and other pious evolutions        he drank six cups of coffee at the least      and then withdrew to hear about the russians        whose victories had recently increased      in catherines

placed        upon the danubes left branch and left bank      with buildings in the oriental taste        but still a fortress of the foremost rank      or was at least unless t is since defaced        which with your conquerors is a common prank      it stands some eighty versts from the high sea      and measures round of toises thousands three       within the extent of this fortification        a borough is comprised along the height      upon the left which from its loftier station        commands the city and upon its site      a greek had raised around this elevation        a quantity of palisades upright      so placed as to impede the fire of those      who held the place and to assist the foes       this circumstance may serve to give a notion        of the high talents of this new

flotilla      and only shouted allah and bis millah       the russians now were ready to attack        but oh ye goddesses of war and glory      how shall i spell the name of each cossacque        who

then there were foreigners of much renown        of various nations and all volunteers      not fighting for their country or its crown        but wishing to be one day brigadiers      also to have the sacking of a town        a pleasant thing to young men at their years      mongst them were several englishmen of pith      sixteen calld thomson and nineteen named smith       jack thomson and bill thomson all the rest        had been calld jemmy after the great bard      i dont know whether they had arms or crest        but such a godfather s as good a card      three of the smiths were peters but the best        amongst them all hard blows to inflict or ward      was he since so renownd in country quarters      at halifax but now he served the tartars       the rest were jacks and gills and wills and bills        but when i ve added that the elder jack smith      was born in cumberland among the hills        and that his father was an honest blacksmith      i ve said all i know of a name that fills        three lines of the despatch in taking schmacksmith      a village of moldavias waste wherein      he fell immortal in a bulletin       i wonder although mars no doubt s a god        praise if a mans name in a bulletin      may make up for a bullet in his body        i hope this little question is no sin      because though i am but a simple noddy        i think one shakspeare puts the same thought in      the mouth of some one in his plays so doting      which many people pass for wits by quoting       then there were frenchmen gallant young and gay        but i m too great a patriot to record      their gallic names upon a glorious day        i d rather tell ten lies than say a word      of truthsuch truths are treason they betray        their country and as traitors are abhorrd      who name the french in english save to show      how peace should make john bull the frenchmans foe       the russians having built two batteries on        an isle near ismail had two ends in view      the first was to bombard it and knock down        the public buildings and the private too      no matter what poor souls might be undone        the citys shape suggested this t is true      formd like an amphitheatre each dwelling      presented a fine mark to throw a shell in       the second object was to profit by        the moment of the general consternation      to attack the turks flotilla which lay nigh        extremely tranquil anchord at its station      but a third motive was as probably        to frighten them into capitulation      a phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors      unless they are game as bulldogs and foxterriers       a habit rather blamable which is        that of despising those we combat with      common in many cases was in this        the cause of killing tchitchitzkoff and smith      one of the valorous smiths whom we shall miss        out of those nineteen who late rhymed to pith      but t is a name so spread oer sir and madam      that one would think the first who bore it adam       the russian batteries were incomplete        because they were constructed in a hurry      thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet        and throws a cloud oer longman and john murray      when the sale of new books is not so fleet        as they who print them think is necessary      may likewise put off for a time what story      sometimes calls murder and at others glory       whether it was their engineers stupidity        their haste or waste i neither know nor care      or some contractors personal cupidity        saving his soul by cheating in the ware      of homicide but there was no solidity        in the new batteries erected there      they either missd or they were never missd      and added greatly to the missing list       a sad miscalculation about distance        made all their naval matters incorrect      three fireships lost their amiable existence        before they reachd a spot to take effect      the match was lit too soon and no assistance        could remedy this lubberly defect      they blew up in the middle of the river      while though t was dawn the turks slept fast as ever       at seven they rose however and surveyd        the russ flotilla getting under way      t was nine when still advancing undismayd        within a cables length their vessels lay      off ismail and commenced a cannonade        which was returnd with interest i may say      and by a fire of musketry and grape      and shells and shot of every size and shape       for six hours bore they without intermission        the turkish fire and aided by their own      land batteries workd their guns with great precision        at length they found mere cannonade alone      by no means would produce the towns submission        and made a signal to retreat at one      one bark blew up a second near the works      running aground was taken by the turks       the moslem too had lost both ships and men        but when they saw the enemy retire      their delhis mannd some boats and saild again        and galld the russians with a heavy fire      and tried to make a landing on the main        but here the effect fell short of their desire      count damas drove them back into the water      pellmell and with a whole gazette of slaughter       if says the historian here i could report        all that the russians did upon this day      i think that several volumes would fall short        and i should still have many things to say      and so he says no morebut pays his court        to some distinguishd strangers in that fray      the prince de ligne and langeron and damas      names great as any that the roll of fame has       this being the case may show us what fame is        for out of these three preux chevaliers how      many of common readers give a guess        that such existed and they may live now      for aught we know renown s all hit or miss        there s fortune even in fame we must allow      t is true the memoirs of the prince de ligne      have half withdrawn from him oblivions screen       but here are men who fought in gallant actions        as gallantly as ever heroes fought      but buried in the heap of such transactions        their names are rarely found nor often sought      thus even good fame may suffer sad

glory        showd that somewhere somehow there was a fault      and admiral ribas known in russian story        most strongly recommended an assault      in which he was opposed by young and hoary        which made a long debate but i must halt      for if i wrote down every warriors speech      i doubt few readers eer would mount the breach       there was a man if that he was a man        not that his manhood could be calld in question      for had he not been hercules his span        had been as short in youth as indigestion      made his last illness when all worn and wan        he died beneath a tree as much unblest on      the soil of the green province he had wasted      as eer was locust on the land it blasted       this was potemkina great thing in days        when homicide and harlotry made great      if stars and titles could entail long praise        his glory might half equal his estate      this fellow being six foot high could raise        a kind of phantasy proportionate      in the then sovereign of the russian people      who measured men as you would do a steeple       while things were in abeyance ribas sent        a courier to the prince and he succeeded      in ordering matters after his own bent        i cannot tell the way in which he pleaded      but shortly he had cause to be content        in the mean time the batteries proceeded      and fourscore cannon on the danubes border      were briskly fired and answerd in due order       but on the thirteenth when already part        of the troops were embarkd the siege to raise      a courier on the spur inspired new heart        into all panters for newspaper praise      as well as dilettanti in wars art        by his despatches couchd in pithy phrase      announcing the appointment of that lover of      battles to the command fieldmarshal souvaroff       the letter of the prince to the same marshal        was worthy of a spartan had the cause      been one to which a good heart could be partial        defence of freedom country or of laws      but as it was mere lust of power to oerarch all        with its proud brow it merits slight applause      save for its style which said all in a trice      you will take ismail at whatever price       let there be light said god and there was light        let there be blood says man and there s a seal      the fiat of this spoild child of the night        for day neer saw his merits could decree      more evil in an hour than thirty bright        summers could renovate though they should be      lovely as those which ripend edens fruit      for war cuts up not only branch but root       our friends the turks who with loud allahs now        began to signalise the russ retreat      were damnably mistaken few are slow        in thinking that their enemy is beat      or beaten if you insist on grammar though        i never think about it in a heat      but here i say the turks were much mistaken      who hating hogs yet wishd to save their bacon       for on the sixteenth at full gallop drew        in sight two horsemen who were deemd cossacques      for some time till they came in nearer view        they had but little baggage at their backs      for there were but three shirts between the two        but on they rode upon two ukraine hacks      till in approaching were at length descried      in this plain pair suwarrow and his guide       great joy to london now says some great fool        when london had a grand illumination      which to that bottleconjurer john bull        is of all dreams the first hallucination      so that the streets of colourd lamps are full        that sage said john surrenders at discretion      his purse his soul his sense and even his nonsense      to gratify like a huge moth this one sense       t is strange that he should farther damn his eyes        for they are damnd that once allfamous oath      is to the devil now no farther prize        since john has lately lost the use of both      debt he calls wealth and taxes paradise        and famine with her gaunt and bony growth      which stare him in the face he wont examine      or swears that ceres hath begotten famine       but to the talegreat joy unto the camp        to russian tartar english french cossacque      oer whom suwarrow shone like a gas lamp        presaging a most luminous attack      or like a wisp along the marsh so damp        which leads beholders on a boggy walk      he flitted to and fro a dancing light      which all who saw it followd wrong or right       but certes matters took a different face        there was enthusiasm and much applause      the fleet and camp saluted with great grace        and all presaged good fortune to their cause      within a cannonshot length of the place        they drew constructed ladders repaird flaws      in former works made new prepared fascines      and all kinds of benevolent machines       t is thus the spirit of a single mind        makes that of multitudes take one direction      as roll the waters to the breathing wind        or roams the herd beneath the bulls protection      or as a little dog will lead the blind        or a bellwether form the flocks connection      by tinkling sounds when they go forth to victual      such is the sway of your great men oer little       the whole camp rung with joy you would have thought        that they were going to a marriage feast      this metaphor i think holds good as aught        since there is discord after both at least      there was not now a luggage boy but sought        danger and spoil with ardour much increased      and why because a littleoddold man      stript to his shirt was come to lead the van       but so it was and every preparation        was made with all alacrity the first      detachment of three columns took its station        and waited but the signals voice to burst      upon the foe the seconds ordination        was also in three columns with a thirst      for glory gaping oer a sea of slaughter      the third in columns two attackd by water       new batteries were erected and was held        a general council in which unanimity      that stranger to most councils here prevaild        as sometimes happens in a great extremity      and every difficulty being dispelld        glory began to dawn with due sublimity      while souvaroff determined to obtain it      was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet       it is an actual fact that he commander        in chief in proper person deignd to drill      the awkward squad and could afford to squander        his time a corporals duty to fulfil      just as you d break a sucking salamander        to swallow flame and never take it ill      he showd them how to mount a ladder which      was not like jacobs or to cross a ditch       also he dressd up for the nonce fascines        like men with turbans scimitars and dirks      and made them charge with bayonet these machines        by way of lesson against actual turks      and when well practised in these mimic scenes        he judged them proper to assail the works      at which your wise men sneerd in phrases witty      he made no answer but he took the city       most things were in this posture on the eve        of the assault and all the camp was in      a stern repose which you would scarce conceive        yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin      are very silent when they once believe        that all is settledthere was little din      for some were thinking of their home and friends      and others of themselves and latter ends       suwarrow chiefly was on the alert        surveying drilling ordering jesting pondering      for the man was we safely may assert        a thing to wonder at beyond most wondering      hero buffoon halfdemon and halfdirt        praying instructing desolating plundering      now mars now momus and when bent to storm      a

a party towards the twilights fall      one of whom spoke their tongueor well or ill        t was much that he was understood at all      but whether from his voice or speech or manner      they found that he had fought beneath their banner       whereon immediately at his request        they brought him and his comrades to headquarters      their dress was moslem but you might have guessd        that these were merely masquerading tartars      and that beneath each turkishfashiond vest        lurkd christianity which sometimes barters      her inward grace for outward show and makes      it difficult to shun some strange mistakes       suwarrow who was standing in his shirt        before a company of calmucks drilling      exclaiming fooling swearing at the inert        and lecturing on the noble art of killing      for deeming human clay but common dirt        this great philosopher was thus instilling      his maxims which to martial comprehension      proved death in battle equal to a pension       suwarrow when he saw this company        of cossacques and their prey turnd round and cast      upon them his slow brow and piercing eye        whence come yefrom constantinople

bade them push on      to slay the pagans who resisted battering      the armies of the christian empress catherine       johnson who knew by this long colloquy        himself a favourite ventured to address      suwarrow though engaged with accents high        in his resumed amusement i confess      my debt in being thus allowd to die        among the foremost but if you d express      explicitly our several posts my friend      and self would know what duty to attend       right i was busy and forgot why you        will join your former regiment which should be      now under arms ho katskoff take him to        here he calld up a polish orderly      his post i mean the regiment nikolaiew        the stranger stripling may remain with me      he s a fine boy the women may be sent      to the other baggage or to the sick tent       but here a sort of scene began to ensue        the ladieswho by no means had been bred      to be disposed of in a way so new        although their haram education led      doubtless to that of doctrines the most true        passive obediencenow raised up the head      with flashing eyes and starting tears and flung      their arms as hens their wings about their young       oer the promoted couple of brave men        who were thus honourd by the greatest chief      that ever peopled hell with heroes slain        or plunged a province or a realm in grief      o foolish mortals always taught in vain        o glorious laurel since for one sole leaf      of thine imaginary deathless tree      of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea       suwarrow who had small regard for tears        and not much sympathy for blood surveyd      the women with their hair about their ears        and natural agonies with a slight shade      of feeling for however habit sears        mens hearts against whole millions when their trade      is butchery sometimes a single sorrow      will touch even heroesand such was suwarrow       he saidand in the kindest calmuck tone        why johnson what the devil do you mean      by bringing women here they shall be shown        all the attention possible and seen      in safety to the waggons where alone        in fact they can be safe you should have been      aware this kind of baggage never thrives      save wed a year i hate recruits with wives       may it please your excellency thus replied        our british friend these are the wives of others      and not our own i am too qualified        by service with my military brothers      to break the rules by bringing ones own bride        into a camp i know that nought so bothers      the hearts of the heroic on a charge      as leaving a small family at large       but these are but two turkish ladies who        with their attendant aided our escape      and afterwards accompanied us through        a thousand perils in this dubious shape      to me this kind of life is not so new        to them poor things it is an awkward scrape      i therefore if you wish me to fight freely      request that they may both be used genteelly       meantime these two poor girls with swimming eyes        lookd on as if in doubt if they could trust      their own protectors nor was their surprise        less than their grief and truly not less just      to see an old man rather wild than wise        in aspect plainly clad besmeard with dust      stript to his waistcoat and that not too clean      more feard than all the sultans ever seen       for every thing seemd resting on his nod        as they could read in all eyes now to them      who were accustomd as a sort of god        to see the sultan rich in many a gem      like an imperial peacock stalk abroad        that royal bird whose tail s a diadem      with all the pomp of power it was a doubt      how power could condescend to do without       john johnson seeing their extreme dismay        though little versed in feelings oriental      suggested some slight comfort in his way        don juan who was much more sentimental      swore they should see him by the dawn of day        or that the russian army should repent all      and strange to say they found some consolation      in thisfor females like exaggeration       and then with tears and sighs and some slight kisses        they parted for the presentthese to await      according to the artillerys hits or misses

hues      so beautiful so fleeting to the muse       when i call fading martial immortality        i mean that every age and every year      and almost every day in sad reality        some sucking hero is compelld to rear      who when we come to sum up the totality        of deeds to human happiness most dear      turns out to be a butcher in great business      afflicting young folks with a

noises      while the whole rampart blazed like etna when      the restless titan hiccups in his den       and one enormous shout of allah rose        in the same moment loud as even the roar      of

and still less guessing where they might be going      but on they marchd dead bodies trampling oer        firing and thrusting slashing sweating glowing      but fighting thoughtlessly enough to win      to their two selves one whole bright bulletin       thus on they wallowd in the bloody mire        of dead and dying thousandssometimes gaining      a yard or two of ground which brought them nigher        to some odd angle for which all were straining      at other times repulsed by the close fire        which really pourd as if all hell were raining      instead of heaven they stumbled backwards oer      a wounded comrade sprawling in his gore       though t was don juans first of fields and though        the nightly muster and the silent march      in the chill dark when courage does not glow        so much as under a triumphal arch      perhaps might make him shiver yawn or throw        a glance on the dull clouds as thick as starch      which stiffend heaven as if he wishd

and afterward if he must needs destroy        in such good company as always throng      to battles sieges and that kind of pleasure      no less delighted to employ his leisure       but always

oft divides        warrior from warrior in their grim career      like chastest wives from constant husbands sides        just at the close of the first bridal year      by one of those odd turns of fortunes tides        was on a sudden rather puzzled here      when after a good deal of heavy firing      he found himself alone and friends retiring       i dont know how the thing occurrdit might        be that the greater part were killd or wounded      and that the rest had faced unto the right        about a circumstance which has confounded      caesar himself who in the very sight        of his whole army which so much abounded      in courage was obliged to snatch a shield      and rally back his romans to the field       juan who had no shield to snatch and was        no caesar but a fine young lad who fought      he knew not why arriving at this pass        stoppd for a minute as perhaps he ought      for a much longer time then like an as        start not kind reader since great homer thought      this simile enough for ajax juan      perhaps may find it better than a new one       then like an ass he went upon his way        and what was stranger never lookd behind      but seeing flashing forward like the day        over the hills a fire enough to blind      those who dislike to look upon a fray        he stumbled on to try if he could find      a path to add his own slight arm and forces      to corps the greater part of which were corses       perceiving then no more the commandant        of his own corps nor even the corps which had      quite disappeardthe gods know howl i cant        account for every thing which may look bad      in history but we at least may grant        it was not marvellous that a mere lad      in search of glory should look on before      nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps       perceiving nor commander nor commanded        and left at large like a young heir to make      his way towhere he knew notsingle handed        as travellers follow over bog and brake      an ignis fatuus or as sailors stranded        unto the nearest hut themselves betake      so juan following honour and his nose      rushd where the thickest fire announced most foes       he knew not where he was nor greatly cared        for he was dizzy busy and his veins      filld as with lightningfor his spirit shared        the hour as is the case with lively brains      and where the hottest fire was seen and heard        and the loud cannon peald his hoarsest strains      he rushd while earth and air were sadly shaken      by thy humane discovery friar bacon       and as he rushd along it came to pass he        fell in with what was late the second column      under the orders of the general lascy        but now reduced as is a bulky volume      into an elegant extract much less massy        of heroism and took his place with solemn      air midst the rest who kept their valiant faces      and levelld weapons still against the glacis       just at this crisis up came johnson too        who had retreated as the phrase is when      men run away much rather than go through        destructions jaws into the devils den      but johnson was a clever fellow who        knew when and how to cut and come again      and never ran away except when running      was nothing but a valorous kind of cunning       and so when all his corps were dead or dying        except don juan a mere novice whose      more virgin valour never dreamt of flying        from ignorance of danger which indues      its votaries like innocence relying        on its own strength with careless nerves and thews      johnson retired a little just to rally      those who catch cold in shadows of deaths valley       and there a little shelterd from the

did not combat like the devil as yet      he found a number of chasseurs all scatterd      by the resistance of the chase they batterd       and these he calld on and what s strange they came        unto his call unlike the spirits from      the vasty deep to whom you may exclaim        says hotspur long ere they will leave their home      their reasons were uncertainty or shame        at shrinking from a bullet or a bomb      and that odd impulse which in wars or creeds      makes men like cattle follow him who leads       by jove he was a noble fellow johnson        and though his name than ajax or achilles      sounds less harmonious underneath the sun soon        we shall not see his likeness he could kill his      man quite as quietly as blows the monsoon        her steady breath which some months the same still is      seldom he varied feature hue or muscle      and could be very busy without bustle       and therefore when he ran away he did so        upon reflection knowing that behind      he would find others who would fain be rid so        of idle apprehensions which like wind      trouble heroic stomachs though their lids so        oft are soon closed all heroes are not blind      but when they light upon immediate death      retire a little merely to take breath       but johnson only ran off to return        with many other warriors as we said      unto that rather somewhat misty bourn        which hamlet tells us is a pass of dread      to jack howeer this gave but slight concern        his soul like galvanism upon the dead      acted upon the living as on wire      and led them back into the heaviest fire       egad they found the second time what they        the first time thought quite terrible enough      to fly from malgre all which people say        of glory and all that immortal stuff      which fills a regiment besides their pay        that daily shilling which makes warriors tough      they found on their return the selfsame welcome      which made some think and others know a hell come       they fell as thick as harvests beneath hail        grass before scythes or corn below the sickle      proving that trite old truth that life s as frail        as any other boon for which men stickle      the turkish batteries thrashd them like a flail        or a good boxer into a sad pickle      putting the very bravest who were knockd      upon the head before their guns were cockd       the turks behind the traverses and flanks        of the next bastion fired away like devils      and swept as gales sweep foam away whole ranks        however heaven knows how the fate who levels      towns nations worlds in her revolving pranks        so orderd it amidst these sulphury revels      that johnson and some few who had not scamperd      reachd the interior talus of the rampart       first one or two then five six and a dozen        came mounting quickly up for it was now      all neck or nothing as like pitch or rosin        flame was showerd forth above as well s below      so that you scarce could say who best had chosen        the gentlemen that were the first to show      their martial faces on the parapet      or those who thought it brave to wait as yet       but those who scaled found out that their advance        was favourd by an accident or blunder      the greek or turkish cohorns ignorance        had

palisades were primly set       so that on either side some nine or ten        paces were left whereon you could contrive      to march a great convenience to our men        at least to all those who were left alive      who thus could form a line and fight again        and that which farther aided them to strive      was that they could kick down the palisades      which scarcely rose much higher

rousseau points out to the dubious fair      observe your lover when he leaves your arms      but juan never left them while they had charms       unless compelld by fate or wave or wind        or near relations who are much the same      but here he waswhere each tie that can bind        humanity must yield to steel and flame      and he whose very body was all mind        flung here by fate or circumstance which tame      the loftiest hurried by the time and place      dashd on like a spurrd bloodhorse in a race       so was his blood stirrd while he found resistance        as is the

reckoning him to be a base bezonian      as pistol calls it but a young livonian       juan to whom he spoke in german knew        as much of german as of sanscrit and      in answer made an inclination to        the general who held him in command      for seeing one with ribands black and blue        stars medals and a bloody sword in hand      addressing him in tones which seemd to

a skewer        and left him midst the invalid and maimd      the regimental surgeon could not cure        his patient and perhaps was to be blamed      more than the head of the inveterate foe      which was cut off and scarce even then let go       but then the fact s a factand t is the part        of a true poet to escape from fiction      wheneer he can for there is little art        in leaving verse more free from the restriction      of truth than prose unless to suit the mart        for what is sometimes called poetic diction      and that outrageous appetite for lies      which satan angles with for souls like flies       the city s taken but not renderdno        there s not a moslem that hath yielded sword      the blood may gush out as the danubes flow        rolls by the

own       the bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves        and human lives are lavishd everywhere      as the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves        when the strippd forest bows to the bleak air      and groans and thus the peopled city grieves        shorn of its best and loveliest and left bare      but still it falls in vast and awful splinters      as oaks blown down with all their thousand winters       it is an awful topicbut t is not        my cue for any time to be terrific      for checkerd as is seen our human lot        with good and bad and worse alike prolific      of melancholy merriment to quote        too much of one sort would be soporific      without or with offence to friends or foes      i sketch your world exactly as it goes       and one good action in the midst of crimes        is quite refreshing in the affected phrase      of these ambrosial pharisaic times        with all their pretty milkandwater ways      and may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes        a little scorchd at present with the blaze      of conquest and its consequences which      make epic poesy so rare and rich       upon a taken bastion where there lay        thousands of slaughterd men a yet warm group      of murderd women who had found their way        to this vain refuge made the good heart droop      and shudderwhile as beautiful as may        a female child of ten years tried to stoop      and hide her little palpitating breast      amidst the bodies lulld in bloody rest       two villainous cossacques pursued the child        with flashing eyes and weapons matchd with them      the rudest brute that roams siberias wild        has feelings pure and polishd as a gem      the bear is civilised the wolf is mild        and whom for this at last must we condemn      their natures or their sovereigns who employ      all arts to teach their subjects to destroy       their sabres glitterd oer her little head        whence her fair hair rose twining with affright      her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead        when juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight      i shall not say exactly what he said        because it might not solace ears polite      but what he did was to lay on their backs      the readiest way of reasoning with cossacques       ones hip he slashd and split the others shoulder        and drove them with their brutal yells to seek      if there might be chirurgeons who could solder        the wounds they richly merited and shriek      their baffled rage and pain while waxing colder        as he turnd oer each pale and gory cheek      don juan raised his little captive from      the heap a moment more had made her tomb       and she was chill as they and on her face        a slender streak of blood announced how near      her fate had been to that of all her race        for the same blow which laid her mother here      had scarrd her brow and left its crimson trace        as the last link with all she had held dear      but else unhurt she opend her large eyes      and gazed on juan with a wild surprise       just at this instant while their eyes were fixd        upon each other with dilated glance      in juans look pain pleasure hope fear mixd        with joy to save and dread of some mischance      unto his protege while hers transfixd        with infant terrors glared as from a trance      a pure transparent pale yet radiant face      like to a lighted alabaster vase       up came john johnson i will not say jack        for that were vulgar cold and commonplace      on great occasions such as an attack        on cities as hath been the present case      up johnson came with hundreds at his back        exclaimingjuan juan on boy brace      your arm and i ll bet moscow to a dollar      that you and i will win st georges collar       the seraskier is knockd upon the head        but the stone bastion still remains wherein      the old pacha sits among some hundreds dead        smoking his pipe quite calmly midst the din      of our artillery and his own t is said        our killd already piled up to the chin      lie round the battery but still it batters      and grape in volleys like a vineyard scatters       then up with mebut juan answerd look        upon this childi saved hermust not leave      her life to chance but point me out some nook        of safety where she less may shrink and grieve      and i am with youwhereon johnson took        a glance aroundand shruggdand twitchd his sleeve      and black silk neckclothand replied you re right      poor thing what s to be done i m puzzled quite       said juan whatsoever is to be        done i ll not quit her till she seems secure      of present life a good deal more than we        quoth johnson neither will i quite ensure      but at the least you may die gloriously        juan replied at least i will endure      whateer is to be bornebut not resign      this child who is parentless and therefore mine       johnson said juan we ve no time to lose        the child s a pretty childa very pretty      i never saw such eyesbut hark now choose        between your fame and feelings pride and pity      hark how the roar increasesno excuse        will serve when there is plunder in a city      i should be loth to march without you but      by god we ll be too late for the first cut       but juan was immovable until        johnson who really loved him in his way      pickd out amongst his followers with some skill        such as he thought the least given up to prey      and swearing if the infant came to ill        that they should all be shot on the next day      but if she were deliverd safe and sound      they should at least have fifty rubles round       and all allowances besides of plunder        in fair proportion with their comradesthen      juan consented to march on through thunder        which thinnd at every step their ranks of men      and yet the rest rushd eagerlyno wonder        for they were heated by the hope of gain      a thing which happens everywhere each day      no hero trusteth wholly to half pay       and such is victory and such is man        at least nine tenths of what we call sogod      may have another name for half we scan        as human beings or his ways are odd      but to our subject a brave tartar khan        or sultan as the author to whose nod      in prose i bend my humble verse doth call      this chieftainsomehow would not yield at all       but flankd by five brave sons such is polygamy        that she spawns warriors by the score where none      are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy        he never would believe the city won      while courage clung but to a single twigam i        describing priams peleus or joves son      neitherbut a good plain old temperate man      who fought with his five children in the van       to take him was the point the truly brave        when they behold the brave oppressd with odds      are touchd with a desire to shield and save        a mixture of wild beasts and demigods      are theynow furious as the sweeping wave        now moved with pity even as sometimes nods      the rugged tree unto the summer wind      compassion breathes along the savage mind       but he would not be taken and replied        to all the propositions of surrender      by mowing christians down on every side        as obstinate as swedish charles at bender      his five brave boys no less the foe defied        whereon the russian pathos grew less tender      as being a virtue like terrestrial patience      apt to wear out on trifling provocations       and spite of johnson and of juan who        expended all their eastern phraseology      in begging him for gods sake just to show        so much less fight as might form an apology      for them in saving such a desperate foe        he hewd away like doctors of theology      when they dispute with sceptics and with curses      struck at his friends as babies beat their nurses       nay he had wounded though but slightly both        juan and johnson whereupon they fell      the first with sighs the second with an oath        upon his angry sultanship pellmell      and all around were grown exceeding wroth        at such a pertinacious infidel      and pourd upon him and his sons like rain      which they resisted like a sandy plain       that drinks and still is dry at last they perishd        his second son was levelld by a shot      his third was sabred and the fourth most cherishd        of all the five on bayonets met his lot      the fifth who by a christian mother nourishd        had been neglected illused and what not      because deformd yet died all game and bottom      to save a sire who blushd that he begot him       the eldest was a true and tameless tartar        as great a scorner of the nazarene      as ever mahomet pickd out for a martyr        who only saw the blackeyed girls in green      who make the beds of those who wont take quarter        on earth in paradise and when once seen      those houris like all other pretty creatures      do just whateer they please by dint of features       and what they pleased to do with the young khan        in heaven i know not nor pretend to guess      but doubtless they prefer a fine young man        to tough old heroes and can do no less      and that s the cause no doubt why if we scan        a field of battles ghastly wilderness      for one rough weatherbeaten veteran body      you ll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody       your houris also have a natural pleasure        in lopping off your lately married men      before the bridal hours have danced their measure        and the sad second moon grows dim again      or dull repentance hath had dreary leisure        to wish him back a bachelor now and then      and thus your houri it may be disputes      of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits       thus the young khan with houris in his sight        thought not upon the charms of four young brides      but bravely rushd on his first heavenly night        in short howeer our better faith derides      these blackeyed virgins make the moslems fight        as though there were one heaven and none besides      whereas if all be true we hear of heaven      and hell there must at least be six or seven       so fully flashd the phantom on his eyes        that when the very lance was in his heart      he shouted allah and saw paradise        with all its veil of mystery drawn apart      and bright eternity without disguise        on his soul like a ceaseless sunrise dart      with prophets houris angels saints descried      in one voluptuous blazeand then he died       but with a heavenly rapture on his face        the good old khan who long had ceased to see      houris or aught except his florid race        who grew like cedars round him gloriously      when he beheld his latest hero grace        the earth which he became like a felld tree      paused for a moment from the fight and cast      a glance on that slain son his first and last       the soldiers who beheld him drop his point        stoppd as if once more willing to concede      quarter in case he bade them not aroynt        as he before had done he did not heed      their pause nor signs his heart was out of joint        and shook till now unshaken like a reed      as he lookd down upon his children gone      and feltthough done with lifehe was alone       but t was a transient tremorwith a spring        upon the russian steel his breast he flung      as carelessly as hurls the moth her wing        against the light wherein she dies he clung      closer that all the deadlier they might wring        unto the bayonets which had pierced his young      and throwing back a dim look on his sons      in one wide wound pourd forth his soul at once       t is strange enoughthe rough tough soldiers who        spared neither sex nor age in their career      of carnage when this old man was pierced through        and lay before them with his children near      touchd by the heroism of him they slew        were melted for a moment though no tear      flowd from their bloodshot eyes all red with strife      they honourd such determined scorn of life       but the stone bastion still kept up its fire        where the chief pacha calmly held his post      some twenty times he made the russ retire        and baffled the assaults of all their host      at length he condescended to inquire        if yet the citys rest were won or lost      and being told the latter sent a bey      to answer ribas summons to give way       in the mean time crossleggd with great sangfroid        among the scorching ruins he sat smoking      tobacco on a little carpettroy        saw nothing like the scene aroundyet looking      with martial stoicism nought seemd to annoy        his stern philosophy but gently stroking      his beard he puffd his pipes ambrosial gales      as if he had three lives as well as tails       the town was takenwhether he might yield        himself or bastion little matterd now      his stubborn valour was no future shield        ismail s no more the crescents silver bow      sunk and the crimson cross glared oer the field        but red with no redeeming gore the glow      of

and therefore worthy of commemoration      the topic s tender so shall be my phrase        perhaps the seasons chill and their long station      in winters depth or want of rest and victual      had made them chastethey ravishd very little       much did they slay more plunder and no less        might here and there occur some violation      in the other linebut not to such excess        as when the french that dissipated nation      take towns by storm no causes can i guess        except cold weather and commiseration      but all the ladies save some twenty score      were almost as much virgins as before       some odd mistakes too happend in the dark        which showd a want of lanterns or of taste      indeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark        their friends from foesbesides such things from haste      occur though rarely when there is a spark        of light to save the venerably chaste      but six old damsels each of seventy years      were all deflowerd by different grenadiers       but on the whole their continence was great        so that some disappointment there ensued      to those who had felt the inconvenient state        of single blessedness and thought it good      since it was not their fault but only fate        to bear these crosses for each waning prude      to make a roman sort of sabine wedding      without the expense and the suspense of bedding       some voices of the buxom middleaged        were also heard to wonder in the din      widows of forty were these birds long caged        wherefore the ravishing did not begin

recollecting the whole empress nor        forgetting quite the woman which composed      at least three parts of this great whole she tore        the letter open with an air which posed      the court

the two are so mixd with human dust        that he who names one both perchance may hit on      but in such matters russias mighty empress      behaved no better than a common sempstress       the whole court melted into one wide whisper        and all lips were applied unto all ears      the elder ladies wrinkles curld much crisper        as they beheld the younger cast some leers      on one another and each lovely lisper        smiled as she talkd the matter oer but tears      of rivalship rose in each clouded eye      of all the standing army who stood by       all the ambassadors of all the powers        enquired who was this very new young man      who promised to be great in some few hours        which is full soonthough life is but a span      already they beheld the silver showers        of rubles rain as fast as specie can      upon his cabinet besides the presents      of several ribands and some thousand peasants       catherine was generousall such ladies are

was not the best wife unless we call      such clytemnestra though perhaps t is better      that one should die than two drag on the fetter       love had made catherine make each lovers fortune        unlike our own halfchaste elizabeth      whose avarice all disbursements did importune        if history the grand liar ever saith      the truth and though grief her old age might shorten        because she put a favourite to death      her vile ambiguous method of flirtation      and stinginess disgrace her sex and station       but when the levee rose and all was bustle        in the dissolving circle all the nations      ambassadors began as t were to hustle        round the young man with their congratulations      also the softer silks were heard to rustle        of gentle dames among whose recreations      it is to speculate on handsome faces      especially when such lead to high places       juan who found himself he knew not how        a general object of attention made      his answers with a very graceful bow        as if born for the ministerial trade      though modest on his unembarrassd brow        nature had written gentleman he said      little but to

lit on a heavenkissing hill      so lofty that i feel my brain turn round        and all my fancies whirling like a mill      which is a signal to my nerves and brain      to take a quiet ride in some green lane   illustration canto 10     canto the tenth       when newton saw an apple fall he found        in that slight startle from his contemplation      t is said for i ll not answer above ground        for any sages creed or calculation      a mode of proving that the earth turnd round        in a most natural whirl called gravitation      and this is the sole mortal who could grapple      since adam with a fall or with an apple       man fell with apples and with apples rose        if this be true for we must deem the mode      in which sir isaac newton could disclose        through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road      a thing to counterbalance human woes        for ever since immortal man hath glowd      with all kinds of mechanics and full soon      steamengines will

have saild and sail but for        the stars i own my telescope is dim      but at least i have shunnd the common shore        and leaving land far out of sight would skim      the ocean of eternity the roar        of breakers has not daunted my slight trim      but still seaworthy skiff and she may float      where ships have founderd as doth many a boat       we left our hero juan in the bloom        of favouritism but not yet in the blush      and far be it from my muses to presume        for i have more than one muse at a push      to follow him beyond the drawingroom        it is enough that fortune found him flush      of youth and vigour beauty and those things      which for an instant clip enjoyments wings       but soon they grow again and leave their nest        oh saith the psalmist that i had a doves      pinions to flee away and be at rest        and who that recollects young years and loves      though hoary now and with a withering breast        and palsied fancy which no longer roves      beyond its dimmd eyes spherebut would much rather      sigh like his son than cough like his grandfather       but sighs subside and tears even widows shrink        like arno in the summer to a shallow      so narrow as to shame their wintry brink        which threatens inundations deep and yellow      such difference doth a few months make you d think        grief a rich field which never would lie fallow      no more it doth its ploughs but change their boys      who furrow some new soil to sow for joys       but coughs will come when sighs departand now        and then before sighs cease for oft the one      will bring the other ere the lakelike brow        is ruffled by a wrinkle or the sun      of life reachd ten oclock and while a glow        hectic and brief as summers day nigh done      oerspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay      thousands blaze love hope diehow happy they       but juan was not meant to die so soon        we left him in the focus of such glory      as may be won by favour of the moon        or ladies fanciesrather transitory      perhaps but who would scorn the month of june        because december with his breath so hoary      must come much rather should he court the ray      to hoard up warmth against a wintry day       besides he had some qualities which fix        middleaged ladies even more than young      the former know what s what while newfledged chicks        know little more of love than what is sung      in rhymes or dreamt for fancy will play tricks        in visions of those skies from whence

 to pain the moment when you cease to please       the lawyer and the critic but behold        the baser sides of literature and life      and nought remains unseen but much untold        by those who scour those double vales of strife      while common men grow ignorantly old        the lawyers brief is like the surgeons knife      dissecting the whole inside of a question      and with it all the

seem a schoolboys whine        and yet i seek not to be grand nor witty      but i am half a scot by birth and bred      a whole one and my heart flies to my head       as auld lang syne brings

though as you remember in a fit        of wrath and rhyme when juvenile and curly      i raild at scots to show my wrath and wit        which must be ownd was sensitive and surly      yet t is in vain such sallies to permit        they cannot quench young feelings fresh and early      i scotchd not killd the scotchman in my blood      and love the land of mountain and of flood       don juan who was real or ideal        for both are much the same since what men think      exists when the once thinkers are less real        than what they thought for mind can never sink      and gainst the body makes a strong appeal        and yet t is very puzzling on the brink      of what is calld eternity to stare      and know no more of what is here than there       don juan grew a very polishd russian        how we wont mention why we need not say      few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion        of any slight temptation in their way      but his just now were spread as is a cushion        smoothd for a monarchs seat of honour gay      damsels and dances revels ready money      made ice seem paradise and winter sunny       the favour of the empress was agreeable        and though the duty waxd a little hard      young people at his time of life should be able        to come off handsomely in that regard      he was now growing up like a green tree able        for love war or ambition which reward      their luckier votaries till old ages tedium      make some prefer the circulating medium       about this time as might have been anticipated        seduced by youth and dangerous examples      don juan grew i fear a little dissipated        which is a sad thing and not only tramples      on our fresh feelings butas being participated        with all kinds of incorrigible samples      of frail humanitymust make us selfish      and shut our souls up in us like a shellfish       this we pass over we will also pass        the usual progress of intrigues between      unequal matches such as are alas        a young lieutenants with a not old queen      but one who is not so youthful as she was        in all the royalty of sweet seventeen      sovereigns may sway materials but not matter       and death the sovereigns sovereign though the great        gracchus of all mortality who levels      with his agrarian laws the high estate        of him who feasts and fights and roars and revels      to one small grassgrown patch which must await        corruption for its crop with the poor devils      who never had a foot of land till now      death s a reformer all men must allow       he lived not death but juan in a hurry        of waste and haste and glare and gloss and glitter      in this gay clime of bearskins black and furry        which though i hate to say a thing that s bitter      peep out sometimes when things are in a flurry        through all the purple and fine linen fitter      for babylons than russias royal harlot      and neutralize her outward show of scarlet       and this same state we wont describe we would        perhaps from hearsay or from recollection      but getting nigh grim dantes obscure wood

to its teatsticks to me through the abyss      of this odd labyrinth or as the kelp        holds by the rock or as a lovers kiss      drains its first draught of lipsbut as i said      i wont philosophise and will be read       juan instead of courting courts was courted        a thing which happens rarely this he owed      much to his youth and much to his reported        valour much also to the blood he showd      like a racehorse much to each dress he sported        which set the beauty off in which he glowd      as purple clouds befringe the sun but most      he owed to an old woman and his post       he wrote to spainand all his near relations        perceiving fie was in a handsome way      of getting on himself and finding stations        for cousins also answerd the same day      several prepared themselves for emigrations        and eating ices were oerheard to say      that with the addition of a slight pelisse      madrids and moscows climes were of a piece       his mother donna inez finding too        that in the lieu of drawing on his banker      where his assets were waxing rather few        he had brought his spending to a handsome anchor      replied that she was glad to see him through        those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker      as the sole sign of mans being in his senses      is learning to reduce his past expenses       she also recommended him to god        and no less to gods son as well as mother      warnd him against greek worship which looks odd        in catholic eyes but told him too to smother      outward dislike which dont look well abroad        informd him that he had a little brother      born in a second wedlock and above      all praised the empresss maternal love       she could not too much give her approbation        unto an empress who preferrd young men      whose age and what was better still whose nation        and climate stoppd all scandal now and then      at home it might have given her some vexation        but where thermometers sunk down to ten      or five or one or zero she could never      believe that virtue thawd before the river       o for a fortyparson power to chant        thy praise hypocrisy oh for a hymn      loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt        not practise oh for trumps of cherubim      or the eartrumpet of my good old aunt        who though her spectacles at last grew dim      drew quiet consolation through its hint      when she no more could read the pious print       she was no hypocrite at least poor soul        but went to heaven in as sincere a way      as any body on the elected roll        which portions out upon the judgment day      heavens freeholds in a sort of doomsday scroll        such as the conqueror william did repay      his knights with lotting others properties      into some sixty thousand new knights fees       i cant complain whose ancestors are there        erneis radulphuseightandforty manors      if that my memory doth not greatly err        were their reward for following billys banners      and though i cant help thinking t was scarce fair        to strip the saxons of their hydes like tanners      yet as they founded churches with the produce      you ll deem no doubt they put it to a good use       the gentle juan flourishd though at times        he felt like other plants called sensitive      which shrink from touch as monarchs do from rhymes        save such as southey can afford to give      perhaps he longd in bitter frosts for climes        in which the nevas ice would cease to live      before mayday perhaps despite his duty      in royaltys vast arms he sigh d for beauty       perhapsbut sans perhaps we need not seek        for causes young or old the cankerworm      will feed upon the fairest freshest cheek        as well as further drain the witherd form      care like a housekeeper brings every week        his bills in and however we may storm      they must be paid though six days smoothly run      the seventh will bring blue devils or a dun       i dont know how it was but he grew sick        the empress was alarmd and her physician      the same who physickd peter found the tick        of his fierce pulse betoken a condition      which augurd of the dead however quick        itself and showd a feverish disposition      at which the whole court was extremely troubled      the sovereign shockd and all his medicines doubled       low were the whispers manifold the rumours        some said he had been poisond by potemkin      others talkd learnedly of certain tumours        exhaustion or disorders of the same kin      some said t was a concoction of the humours        which with the blood too readily will claim kin      others again were ready

while that hiatus maxime deflendus        to be filld up by spade or mattocks near      instead of gliding graciously down lethe      we tease mild baillie or soft abernethy       juan demurrd at this first notice to        quit and though death had threatend an ejection      his youth and constitution bore him through        and sent the doctors in a new direction      but still his state was delicate the hue        of health but flickerd with a faint reflection      along his wasted cheek and seemd to gravel      the facultywho said that he must travel       the climate was too cold they said for him        meridianborn to bloom in this opinion      made the chaste catherine look a little grim        who did not like at first to lose her minion      but when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim        and drooping like an eagles with clipt pinion      she then resolved to send him on a mission      but in a style becoming his condition       there was just then a kind of a discussion        a sort of treaty or negotiation      between the british cabinet and russian        maintaind with all the due prevarication      with which great states such things are apt to push on        something about the baltics navigation      hides trainoil tallow and the rights of thetis      which britons deem their uti possidetis       so catherine who had a handsome way        of fitting out her favourites conferrd      this secret charge on juan to display        at once her royal splendour and reward      his services he kissd hands the next day        received instructions how to play his card      was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours      which showd what great discernment was the donors       but she was lucky and luck s all your queens        are generally prosperous in reigning      which puzzles us to know what fortune means        but to continue though her years were waning      her climacteric teased her like her teens        and though her dignity brookd no complaining      so much did juans setting off distress her      she could not find at first a fit successor       but time the comforter will come at last        and fourandtwenty hours and twice that number      of candidates requesting to be placed        made catherine taste next night a quiet slumber      not that she meant to fix again in haste        nor did she find the quantity encumber      but always choosing with deliberation      kept the place open for their emulation       while this high post of honour s in abeyance        for one or two days reader we request      you ll mount with our young hero the conveyance        which wafted him from petersburgh the best      barouche which had the glory to display once        the fair czarinas autocratic crest      when a new lphigene she went to tauris      was given to her favourite and now bore his       a bulldog and a bullfinch and an ermine        all private favourites of don juanfor      let deeper sages the true cause determine        he had a kind of inclination or      weakness for what most people deem mere vermin        live animals an old maid of threescore      for cats and birds more penchant neer

preserved a pure and living pearl       poor little thing she was as fair as docile        and with that gentle serious character      as rare in living beings as a fossile        man midst thy mouldy mammoths grand cuvier      ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle        with this oerwhelming world where all must err      but she was yet but ten years old and therefore      was tranquil though she knew not why or wherefore       don juan loved her and she loved him as        nor brother father sister daughter love      i cannot tell exactly what it was        he was not yet quite old enough to prove      parental feelings and the other class        calld brotherly affection could not move      his bosomfor he never had a sister      ah if he had how much he would have missd her       and still less was it sensual for besides        that he was not an ancient debauchee      who like sour fruit to stir their veins salt tides        as acids rouse a dormant alkali      although t will happen as our planet guides        his youth was not the chastest that might be      there was the purest platonism at bottom      of all his feelingsonly he forgot em       just now there was no peril of temptation        he loved the infant orphan he had saved      as patriots now and then may love a nation        his pride too felt that she was not enslaved      owing to himas also her salvation        through his means and the churchs might be paved      but one thing s odd which here must be inserted      the little turk refused to be converted       t was strange enough she should retain the impression        through such a scene of change and dread and slaughter      but though three bishops told her the transgression        she showd a great dislike to holy water      she also had no passion for confession        perhaps she had nothing to confessno matter      whateer the cause the church made little of it      she still held out that mahomet was a prophet       in fact the only christian she could bear        was juan whom she seemd to have selected      in place of what her home and friends once were        he naturally loved what he protected      and thus they formd a rather curious pair        a guardian green in years a ward connected      in neither clime time blood with her defender      and yet this want of ties made theirs more tender       they journeyd on through poland and through warsaw        famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron      through courland also which that famous farce saw        which gave her dukes the graceless name of biron      t is the same landscape which the modern mars saw        who marchd to moscow led by fame the siren      to lose by one months frost some twenty years      of conquest and his guard of

on tiptoe through their seacoal canopy      a huge dun cupola like a foolscap crown      on a fools headand there is london town       but juan saw not this each wreath of smoke        appeard to him

wrapt in contemplation        walkd on behind his carriage oer the summit      and lost in wonder of so great a nation        gave way to t since he could not overcome it      and here he cried is

from four pads        in ambush laid who had perceived him loiter      behind his carriage and like handy lads        had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre      in which the heedless gentleman who gads        upon the road unless he prove a fighter      may find himself within that isle of riches      exposed to lose his life as well as breeches       juan who did not understand a word

sudden      drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture        and fired it into one assailants pudding      who fell as rolls an ox oer in his pasture        and roard out as he writhed his native

recollect some innkeepers who dont        differ except in robbing with a bow      in lieu of a bare blade and brazen front        but what is to be done i cant allow      the fellow to lie groaning

they are found      useful like malthus in promoting marriage      but juan now is stepping from his carriage       into one of the sweetest of hotels        especially for foreignersand mostly

upon him as the public learnd      and to say truth it had been fairly earnd       besides the ministers and underlings        who must be courteous to the accredited      diplomatists of rather

you doubt pray ask of your next neighbour      when for a passport or some other bar        to freedom he applied a grief and a bore      if he found not his spawn of taxborn riches       but juan was received with much empressement        these phrases of refinement i must borrow      from our next neighbours land where like a chessman        there is a move set down for joy or sorrow      not

had      an air as sentimental as mozarts        softest of melodies and could be sad      or cheerful without any flaws or starts        just at the proper time and though a lad      had seen the

have prided      themselves on innocent tantalisation      and hate all vice except its reputation       but these are few and in the end they make        some devilish escapade or stir which shows

being at large       besides he had found out he was no tutor        i wish that others would find out the same      and rather wishd in such things to stand neuter        for silly wards will bring their guardians blame      so when he saw each ancient dame a suitor        to make his little wild asiatic tame      consulting the society for vice      suppression lady pinchbeck was his choice

syllable that s wrong        in fact there s nothing makes me so much grieve      as that abominable tittletattle      which is the cud eschewd by human cattle       moreover i ve remarkd and i was once        a slight observer in a modest way      and so may every one except a dunce        that ladies in their youth a little gay      besides their knowledge of the world and sense        of the sad consequence of going astray      are wiser in their warnings gainst the woe      which the mere passionless can never know       while the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue        by railing at the unknown and envied passion      seeking far less to save you than to hurt you        or what s still worse to put you out of fashion      the kinder veteran with calm words will court you        entreating you to pause before you dash on      expounding and illustrating the riddle      of epic loves beginning end and middle       now whether it be thus or that they are stricter        as better knowing why they should be so      i think you ll find from many a family picture        that daughters of such mothers as may know      the world by experience rather than by lecture        turn out much better for the smithfield show      of vestals brought into the marriage mart      than those bred up by prudes without a heart       i said that lady pinchbeck had been talkd about        as who has not if female young and pretty      but now no more the ghost of scandal stalkd about        she merely was deemd amiable and witty      and several of her best bonmots were hawkd about        then she was given to charity and pity      and passd at least the latter years of life      for being a most exemplary wife       high in high circles gentle in her own        she was the mild reprover of the young      wheneverwhich means every daythey d shown        an awkward inclination to go wrong      the quantity of good she did s unknown        or at the least would lengthen out my song      in brief the little orphan of the east      had raised an interest in her which increased       juan too was a sort of favourite with her        because she thought him a good heart at bottom      a little spoild but not so altogether        which was a wonder if you think who got him      and how he had been tossd he scarce knew whither        though this might ruin others it did not him      at least entirelyfor he had seen too many      changes in youth to be surprised at any       and these vicissitudes tell best in youth        for when they happen at a riper age      people are apt to blame the fates forsooth        and wonder providence is not more sage      adversity is the first path to truth        he who hath proved war storm or womans rage      whether his winters be eighteen or eighty      hath won the experience which is deemd so weighty       how far it profits is another matter        our hero gladly saw his little charge      safe with a lady whose last grownup daughter        being long married and thus set at large      had left all the accomplishments she taught her        to be transmitted like the lord mayors barge      to the next comer oras it will tell      more muselikelike to cythereas shell       i call such things transmission for there is        a floating balance of accomplishment      which forms a pedigree from miss to miss        according as their minds or backs are bent      some waltz some draw some fathom the abyss        of metaphysics others are content      with music the most moderate shine as wits      while others have a genius turnd for fits       but whether fits or wits or harpsichords        theology fine arts or finer stays      may be the baits for gentlemen or lords        with regular descent in

yet bent on matches       but now i will begin my poem t is        perhaps a little strange if not quite new      that from the first of cantos up to this        i ve not begun what we have to go through      these first twelve books are merely flourishes        preludios trying just a string or two      upon my lyre or making the pegs sure      and when so you shall have the overture       my muses do not care a pinch of rosin        about what s calld success or not succeeding      such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen        t is a great moral lesson they are reading      i thought at setting off about two dozen        cantos would do but at apollos pleading      if that my pegasus should not be founderd      i think to canter gently through a hundred       don juan saw that microcosm on stilts        yclept the great world for it is the least      although the highest but as swords have hilts        by which their power of mischief is increased      when man in battle or in quarrel tilts        thus the low world north south or west or east      must still obey the highwhich is their handle      their moon their sun their gas their farthing candle       he had many friends who had many wives and was        well lookd upon by both to that extent      of friendship which you may accept or pass        it does nor good nor harm being merely meant      to keep the wheels going of the higher class        and draw them nightly when a ticket s sent      and what with masquerades and fetes and balls      for the first season such a life scarce palls       a young unmarried man with a good name        and fortune has an awkward part to play      for good society is but a game        the royal game of goose as i may say      where every body has some separate aim        an end to answer or a plan to lay      the single ladies wishing to be double      the married ones to save the virgins trouble       i dont mean this as general but particular        examples may be found of such pursuits      though several also keep their perpendicular        like poplars with good principles for roots      yet many have a method more reticular        fishers for men like sirens with soft lutes      for talk six times with the same single lady      and you may get the wedding dresses ready       perhaps you ll have a letter from the mother        to say her daughters feelings are trepannd      perhaps you ll have a visit from the brother        all strut and stays and whiskers to demand      what your intentions areone way or other        it seems the virgins heart expects your hand      and between pity for her case and yours      you ll add to matrimonys list of cures       i ve known a dozen weddings made even thus        and some of them high names i have also known      young men whothough they hated to discuss        pretensions which they never dreamd to have shown      yet neither frightend by a female fuss        nor by mustachios moved were let alone      and lived as did the brokenhearted fair      in happier plight than if they formd a pair       there s also nightly to the uninitiated        a perilnot indeed like love or marriage      but not the less for this to be depreciated        it isi meant and mean not to disparage      the show of virtue even in the vitiated        it adds an outward grace unto their carriage      but to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot      couleur de rose who s neither white nor scarlet       such is your cold coquette who cant say no        and wont say yes and keeps you on and offing      on a leeshore till it begins to blow        then sees your heart wreckd with an inward scoffing      this works a world of sentimental woe        and sends new werters yearly to their coffin      but yet is merely innocent flirtation      not quite adultery but adulteration       ye gods i grow a talker let us prate        the next of perils though i place it sternest      is when without regard to church or state        a wife makes or takes love in upright earnest      abroad such things decide few womens fate        such early traveller is the truth thou learnest      but in old england when a young bride errs      poor thing eves was a trifling case to hers       for t is a low newspaper humdrum lawsuit        country where a young couple of the same ages      cant form a friendship but the world oerawes it      a verdictgrievous foe to those who cause it        forms a sad climax to romantic homages      besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders      and evidences which regale all readers       but they who blunder thus are raw beginners        a little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy      has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners        the loveliest oligarchs of our gynocracy      you may see such at all the balls and dinners        among the proudest of our aristocracy      so gentle charming charitable chaste      and all by having tact as well as taste       juan who did not stand in the predicament        of a mere novice had one safeguard more      for he was sickno t was not the word sick i meant        but he had seen so much love before      that he was not in heart so very weaki meant        but thus much and no sneer against the shore      of white cliffs white necks blue eyes bluer stockings      tithes taxes duns and doors with double knockings       but coming young from lands and scenes romantic        where lives not lawsuits must be riskd for passion      and passions self must have a spice of frantic        into a country where t is half a fashion      seemd to him half commercial half pedantic        howeer he might esteem this moral nation      besides alas his tasteforgive and pity      at first he did not think the women pretty       i say at firstfor he found out at last        but by degrees that they were fairer far      than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast        beneath the influence of the eastern star      a further proof we should not judge in haste        yet inexperience could not be his bar      to tastethe truth is if men would confess      that novelties please less than they impress       though travelld i have never had the luck to        trace up those shuffling negroes nile or niger      to that impracticable place timbuctoo        where geography finds no one to oblige her      with such a chart as may be safely stuck to        for europe ploughs in afric like bos piger      but if i had been at timbuctoo there      no doubt i should be told that black is fair       it is i will not swear that black is white        but i suspect in fact that white is black      and the whole matter rests upon eyesight        ask a blind man the best judge you ll attack      perhaps this new positionbut i m right        or if i m wrong i ll not be taen aback      he hath no morn nor night but all is dark      within and what seest thou a dubious spark       but i m relapsing into metaphysics        that labyrinth whose clue is of the same      construction as your cures for hectic phthisics        those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame      and this reflection brings me to plain physics        and to the beauties of a foreign dame      compared with those of our pure pearls of price      those polar summers all sun and some ice       or say they are like virtuous mermaids whose        beginnings are fair faces ends mere fishes      not that there s not a quantity of those        who have a due respect for their own wishes      like russians rushing from hot baths to snows        are they at bottom virtuous even when vicious      they warm into a scrape but keep of course      as a reserve a plunge into remorse       but this has nought to do with their outsides        i said that juan did not think them pretty      at the first blush for a fair briton hides        half her attractionsprobably from pity      and rather calmly into the heart glides        than storms it as a foe would take a city      but once there if you doubt this prithee try      she keeps it for you like a true ally       she cannot step as does an arab barb        or andalusian girl from mass returning      nor wear as gracefully as gauls her garb        nor in her eye ausonias glance is burning      her voice though sweet is not so fit to warb        le those bravuras which i still am learning      to like though i have been seven years in italy      and have or had an ear that served me prettily       she cannot do these things nor one or two        others in that offhand and dashing style      which takes so muchto give the devil his due        nor is she quite so ready with her smile      nor settles all things in one interview        a thing approved as saving time and toil      but though the soil may give you time and trouble      well cultivated it will render double       and if in fact she takes to a grande passion        it is a very serious thing indeed      nine times in ten t is but caprice or fashion        coquetry or a wish to take the lead      the pride of a mere child with a new sash on        or wish to make a rivals bosom bleed      but the tenth instance will be a tornado      for there s no saying what they will or may do       the reason s obvious if there s an eclat        they lose their caste at once as do the parias      and when the delicacies of the law        have filld their papers with their comments various      society that china without flaw        the hypocrite will banish them like marius      to sit amidst the ruins of their guilt      for fame s a carthage not so soon rebuilt       perhaps this is as it should beit is        a comment on the gospels sin no more      and be thy sins forgivenbut upon this        i leave the saints to settle their own score      abroad though doubtless they do much amiss        an erring woman finds an opener door      for her return to virtueas they cal      that lady who should be at home to all       for me i leave the matter where i find it        knowing that such uneasy virtue leads      people some ten times less in fact to mind it        and care but for discoveries and not deeds      and as for chastity you ll never bind it        by all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads      but aggravate the crime you have not prevented      by rendering desperate those who had else repented       but juan was no casuist nor had ponderd        upon the moral lessons of mankind      besides he had not seen of several hundred        a lady altogether to his mind      a little blaset is not to be wonderd        at that his heart had got a tougher rind      and though not vainer from his past success      no doubt his sensibilities were less       he also had been busy seeing sights        the parliament and all the other houses      had sat beneath the gallery at nights        to hear debates whose thunder roused not rouses      the world to gaze upon those northern lights        which flashd as far as where the muskbull browses      he had also stood at times behind the throne      but grey was not arrived and chatham gone       he saw however at the closing session        that noble sight when really free the nation      a king in constitutional possession        of such a throne as is the proudest station      though despots know it nottill the progression        of freedom shall complete their education      t is not mere splendour makes the show august      to eye or heartit is the peoples trust       there too he saw whateer he may be now        a prince the prince of princes at the time      with fascination in his very bow        and full of promise as the spring of prime      though royalty was written on his brow        he had then the grace too rare in every clime      of being without alloy of fop or beau      a finishd gentleman from top to toe       and juan was

know that some would fain postpone this era        reluctant as all placemen to resign      their post but theirs is merely a chimera        for they have passd lifes equinoctial line      but then they have their claret and madeira        to irrigate the dryness of decline      and county meetings and the parliament      and debt and what not for their solace sent       and is there not

      for my part i am but a mere spectator      and gaze whereer the palace or the hovel is      much in the mode of goethes mephistopheles       but neither love nor hate in much excess

hum      was the queenbee the glass of all that s fair        whose charms made all men speak and women dumb      the last s a miracle and such was reckond      and since that time there has not been a second       chaste was she to detractions desperation        and wedded unto one she had loved well      a man known in the councils of the nation        cool and quite english imperturbable      though apt to act with fire upon occasion        proud of himself and her the world could tell      nought against either and both seemd secure      she in her virtue he in his hauteur       it chanced some diplomatical relations        arising out of business often brought      himself and juan in their mutual stations        into close contact though reserved nor caught      by specious seeming juans youth and patience        and talent on his haughty spirit wrought      and formd a basis of esteem which ends      in making men what courtesy calls friends       and thus lord henry who was cautious as        reserve and pride could make him and full slow      in judging menwhen once his judgment was        determined right or wrong on friend or foe      had all the pertinacity pride has        which knows no ebb to its imperious flow      and loves or hates disdaining to be guided      because its own good pleasure hath decided       his friendships therefore and no less aversions        though oft well founded which confirmd but more      his prepossessions like the laws of persians        and medes would neer revoke what went before      his feelings had not those strange fits like tertians        of common likings which make some deplore      what they should laugh atthe mere ague still      of mens regard the fever or the chill       t is not in mortals to command success        but do you more semproniusdont deserve it      and take my word you wont have any less        be wary watch the time and always serve it      give gently way when there s too great a press        and for your conscience only learn to nerve it      for like a racer or a boxer training      t will make if proved vast efforts without paining       lord henry also liked to be superior        as most men do the little or the great      the very lowest find out an inferior        at least they think so to exert their state      upon for there are very few things wearier        than solitary prides oppressive weight      which mortals generously would divide      by bidding others carry while they ride       in birth in rank in fortune likewise equal        oer juan he could no distinction claim      in years he had the advantage of times sequel        and as he thought in country much the same      because bold britons have a tongue and free quill        at which all modern nations vainly aim      and the lord henry was a great debater      so that few members kept the house up later       these were advantages and then he thought        it was his foible but by no means sinister      that few or none more than himself had caught        court mysteries having been himself a minister      he liked to teach that which he had been taught        and greatly shone whenever there had been a stir      and reconciled all qualities which grace man      always a patriot and sometimes a placeman       he liked the gentle spaniard for his gravity        he almost honourd him for his docility      because though young he acquiesced with suavity        or contradicted but with proud humility      he knew the world and would not see depravity        in faults which sometimes show the soils fertility      if that the weeds oerlive not the first crop      for then they are very difficult to stop       and then he talkd with him about madrid        constantinople and such distant places      where people always did as they were bid        or did what they should not with foreign graces      of coursers also spake they henry rid        well like most englishmen and loved the races      and juan like a trueborn andalusian      could back a horse as despots ride a russian       and thus acquaintance grew at noble routs        and diplomatic dinners or at other      for juan stood well both with ins and outs        as in freemasonry a higher brother      upon his talent henry had no doubts        his manner showd him sprung from a high mother      and all men like to show their hospitality      to him whose breeding matches with his quality       at blankblank squarefor we will break no squares        by naming streets since men are so censorious      and apt to sow an authors wheat with tares        reaping allusions private and inglorious      where none were dreamt of unto loves affairs        which were or are or are to be notorious      that therefore do i previously declare      lord henrys mansion was in blankblank square       also there bin another pious reason        for making squares and streets anonymous      which is that there is scarce a single season        which doth not shake some very splendid house      with some slight heartquake of domestic treason        a topic scandal doth delight to rouse      such i might stumble over unawares      unless i knew the very chastest squares       t is true i might have chosen piccadilly        a place where peccadillos are unknown      but i have motives whether wise or silly        for letting that pure sanctuary alone      therefore i name not square street place until i        find one where nothing naughty can be shown      a vestal shrine of innocence of heart       at henrys mansion then in blankblank square        was juan a recherche welcome guest      as many other noble scions were        and some who had but talent for their crest      or wealth which is a passport every where        or even mere fashion which indeed s the best      recommendation and to be well drest      will very often supersede the rest       and since there s safety in a multitude        of counsellors as solomon has said      or some one for him in some sage grave mood        indeed we see the daily proof displayd      in senates at the bar in wordy feud        whereer collective wisdom can parade      which is the only cause that we can guess      of britains present wealth and happiness       but as there s safety grafted in the number        of counsellors for men thus for the sex      a large acquaintance lets not virtue slumber        or should it shake the choice will more perplex      variety itself will more encumber        midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks      and thus with women howsoeer it shocks somes      selflove there s safety in a crowd of coxcombs       but adeline had not the least occasion        for such a shield which leaves but little merit      to virtue proper or good education        her chief resource was in her own high spirit      which judged mankind at their due estimation        and for coquetry she disdaind to wear it      secure of admiration its impression      was faint as of an everyday possession       to all she was polite without parade        to some she showd attention of that kind      which flatters but is flattery conveyd        in such a sort as cannot leave behind      a trace unworthy either wife or maid        a gentle genial courtesy of mind      to those who were or passd for meritorious      just to console sad glory for being glorious       which is in all respects save now and then        a dull and desolate appendage gaze      upon the shades of those distinguishd men        who were or are the puppetshows of praise      the praise of persecution gaze again        on the most favourd and amidst the blaze      of sunset halos oer the laurelbrowd      what can ye recognisea gilded cloud       there also was of course in adeline        that calm patrician polish in the address      which neer can pass the equinoctial line        of any thing which nature would express      just as a mandarin finds nothing fine        at least his manner suffers not to guess      that any thing he views can greatly please      perhaps we have borrowd this from the chinese       perhaps from horace his nil admirari        was what he calld the art of happiness      an art on which the artists greatly vary        and have not yet attaind to much success      however t is expedient to be wary        indifference certes dont produce distress      and rash enthusiasm in good society      were nothing but a moral inebriety       but adeline was not indifferent for        now for a commonplace beneath the snow      as a volcano holds the lava more        withinet caetera shall i go onno      i hate to hunt down a tired metaphor        so let the oftenused volcano go      poor thing how frequently by me and others      it hath been stirrd up till its smoke quite smothers       i ll have another figure in a trice        what say you to

still older mansion of a rich and rare        mixd gothic such as artists all allow      few specimens yet left us can compare        withal it lies perhaps a little low      because the monks preferrd a hill behind      to shelter their devotion from the wind       it stood embosomd in a happy valley        crownd by high woodlands where the druid oak      stood like caractacus in act to rally        his host with broad arms gainst the thunderstroke      and from beneath his boughs were seen to sally        the dappled forestersas day awoke      the branching stag swept down with all his herd      to quaff a brook which murmurd like a bird       before the mansion lay a lucid lake        broad as transparent deep and freshly fed      by a river which its softend way did take        in currents through the calmer water spread      around the wildfowl nestled in the brake        and sedges brooding in their liquid bed      the woods sloped downwards to its brink and stood      with their green faces fixd upon the flood       its outlet dashd into a deep cascade        sparkling with foam until again subsiding      its shriller echoeslike an infant made        quietsank into softer ripples gliding      into a rivulet and thus allayd        pursued its course now gleaming and now hiding      its windings through the woods now clear now blue      according as the skies their shadows threw       a glorious remnant of the gothic pile        while yet the church was romes stood half apart      in a grand arch which once screend many an aisle        these last had disappearda loss to art      the first yet frownd superbly oer the soil        and kindled feelings in the roughest heart      which mournd the power of times or tempests march      in gazing on that venerable arch       within a niche nigh to its pinnacle        twelve saints had once stood sanctified in stone      but these had fallen not when the friars fell        but in the war which struck charles from his throne      when each house was a fortalice as tell        the annals of full many a line undone      the gallant cavaliers who fought in vain      for those who knew not to resign or

spoild      she made the earth below seem holy ground        this may be superstition weak or wild      but even the faintest relics of a shrine      of any worship wake some thoughts divine       a mighty window hollow in the centre        shorn of its glass of thousand colourings      through which the deepend glories once could enter        streaming from off the sun like seraphs wings      now yawns all desolate now loud now fainter        the gale sweeps through its fretwork and oft sings      the owl his anthem where the silenced quire      lie with their hallelujahs quenchd like fire       but in the noontide of the moon and when        the wind is winged from one point of heaven      there moans a strange unearthly sound which then        is musicala dying accent driven      through the huge arch which soars and sinks again        some deem it but the distant echo given      back to the night wind by the waterfall      and harmonised by the old choral wall       others that some original shape or form        shaped by decay perchance hath given the power      though less than that of memnons statue warm        in egypts rays to harp at a fixd hour      to this grey ruin with a voice to charm        sad but serene it sweeps oer tree or tower      the cause i know not nor can solve but such      the facti ve heard itonce perhaps too much       amidst the court a

mankind        who like to mix some slight alloy with fame      for i was rather famous in my time      until i fairly knockd it up with rhyme       i have brought this world about my ears and eke

of which there s no description recent        the reason why is easy to determine      although it seems both prominent and pleasant        there is a sameness in its gems and ermine      a dull and family likeness through all ages      of no great promise for poetic pages       with much to excite there s little to exalt        nothing that speaks to all men and all times      a sort of varnish over every fault        a kind of commonplace even in their crimes      factitious passions wit without much salt        a want of that true nature which sublimes      whateer it shows with truth a smooth monotony      of character in those at least who have got any       sometimes indeed like soldiers off parade        they break their ranks and gladly leave the drill      but then the rollcall

jeunes hommes who stem      the stream nor leave the world which leaveth them       t is saidindeed a general complaint        that no one has succeeded in describing      the monde exactly as they ought to paint        some say that authors only snatch by bribing      the porter some slight scandals strange and quaint        to furnish matter for their moral gibing      and that their books have but one style in common      my ladys prattle filterd through her woman       but this cant well be true just now for writers        are grown of the beau monde a part potential      i ve seen them balance even the scale with fighters        especially when young for that s essential      why do their sketches fail them as inditers        of what they deem themselves most consequential      the real portrait of the highest tribe      t is that in fact there s little to describe       haud ignara loquor these are nugae quarum        pars parva fui but still art and part      now i could

     own they foresaw that you would fall at last      and solace your slight lapse gainst bonos mores      with a long memorandum of old stories       the lady adelines serene severity        was not confined to feeling for her friend      whose fame she rather doubted with posterity        unless her habits should begin to mend      but juan also shared in her austerity        but mixd with pity pure as eer was pennd      his inexperience moved her gentle ruth      and as her junior by six weeks his youth       these forty days advantage of her years        and hers were those which can face calculation      boldly referring to the list of peers        and noble births nor dread the enumeration      gave her a right to have maternal fears        for a young gentlemans fit education      though she was far from that leap year whose leap      in female dates strikes time all of a heap       this may be fixd at somewhere before thirty        say sevenandtwenty for i never knew      the

experience made her sage        for she had seen the world and stood its test      as i have said ini forget what page        my muse despises reference as you have guessd      by this timebut strike six from sevenandtwenty      and you will find her sum of years in plenty       at sixteen she came out presented vaunted        she put all coronets into commotion      at seventeen too the world was still enchanted        with the new venus of their brilliant ocean      at eighteen though below her feet still panted        a hecatomb of suitors with devotion      she had consented to create again      that adam calld the happiest of men       since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters        admired adored but also so correct      that she had puzzled all the acutest hinters        without the apparel of being circumspect      they could not even glean the slightest splinters        from off the marble which had no defect      she had also snatchd a moment since her marriage      to bear a son and heirand one miscarriage       fondly the wheeling fireflies flew around her        those little glitterers of the london night      but none of these possessd a sting to wound her        she was a pitch beyond a coxcombs flight      perhaps she wishd an aspirant profounder        but whatsoeer she wishd she acted right      and whether coldness pride or virtue dignify      a woman so she s good what does it signify       i hate a motive like a lingering bottle        which with the landlord makes too long a stand      leaving allclaretless the unmoistend throttle        especially with politics on hand      i hate it as i hate a drove of cattle        who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand      i hate it as i hate an argument      a laureates ode or servile peers content       t is sad to hack into the roots of things        they are so much intertwisted with the earth      so that the branch a goodly verdure flings        i reck not if an acorn gave it birth      to trace all actions to their secret springs        would make indeed some melancholy mirth      but this is not at present my concern      and i refer you to wise oxenstiern       with the kind view of saving an eclat        both to the duchess and diplomatist      the lady adeline as soon s she saw        that juan was unlikely to resist      for foreigners dont know that a faux pas        in england ranks quite on a different list      from those of other lands unblest with juries      whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is       the lady adeline resolved to take        such measures as she thought might best impede      the farther progress of this sad mistake        she thought with some simplicity indeed      but innocence is bold even at the stake        and simple in the world and doth not need      nor use those palisades by dames erected      whose virtue lies in never being detected       it was not that she feard the very worst        his grace was an enduring married man      and was not likely all at once to burst        into a scene and swell the clients clan      of doctors commons but she dreaded first        the magic of her graces talisman      and next a quarrel as he seemd to fret      with lord augustus fitzplantagenet       her grace too passd for being an intrigante        and somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere      one of those pretty precious plagues which haunt        a lover with caprices soft and dear      that like to make a quarrel when they cant        find one each day of the delightful year      bewitching torturing as they freeze or glow      andwhat is worst of allwont let you go       the sort of thing to turn a young mans head        or make a werter of him in the end      no wonder then a purer soul should dread        this sort of chaste liaison for a friend      it were much better to be wed or dead        than wear a heart a woman loves to rend      t is best to pause and think ere you rush on      if that a bonne fortune be really bonne       and first in the oerflowing of her heart        which really knew or thought it knew no guile      she calld her husband now and then apart        and bade him counsel juan with a smile      lord henry heard her plans of artless art        to wean don juan from the sirens wile      and answerd like a statesman or a prophet      in such guise that she could make nothing of it       firstly he said he never interfered        in any bodys business but the kings      next that he never judged from what appeard        without strong reason of those sort of things      thirdly that juan had more brain than beard        and was not to be held in leading strings      and fourthly what need hardly be said twice      that good but rarely came from good advice       and therefore doubtless to approve the truth        of the last axiom he advised his spouse      to leave the parties to themselves forsooth        at least as far as bienseance allows      that time would temper juans faults of youth        that young men rarely made monastic vows      that opposition only more attaches      but here a messenger brought in despatches       and being of the council calld the privy        lord henry walkd into his cabinet      to furnish matter for some future livy        to tell how he reduced the nations debt      and if their full contents i do not give ye        it is because i do not know them yet      but i shall add them in a brief appendix      to come between mine epic and its index       but ere he went he added a slight

t is pertinacity      must the event decide between the two        i leave it to your people of sagacity      to draw the line between the false and true        if such can eer be drawn by mans capacity      my business is with lady adeline      who in her way too was a heroine       she knew not her own heart then how should i        i think not she was then in love with juan      if so she would have had the strength to fly        the wild sensation unto her a new one      she merely felt a common sympathy        i will not say it was a false or true one      in him because she thought he was in danger      her husbands friend her own young and a stranger       she was or thought she was his friendand this        without the farce of friendship or romance      of platonism which leads so oft amiss        ladies who have studied friendship but in france      or germany where people purely kiss        to thus much adeline would not advance      but of such friendship as mans may to man be      she was as capable as woman can be       no doubt the secret influence of the sex        will there as also in the ties of blood      an innocent predominance annex        and tune the concord to a finer mood      if free from passion which all friendship checks        and your true feelings fully understood      no friend like to a woman earth discovers      so that you have not been nor will be lovers       love bears within its breast the very germ        of change and how should this be otherwise      that violent things more quickly find a term        is shown through natures whole analogies      and how should the most fierce of all be firm        would you have endless lightning in the skies      methinks loves very title says enough      how should the tender passion eer be tough       alas by all experience seldom yet        i merely quote what i have heard from many      had lovers not some reason to regret        the passion which made solomon a zany      i ve also seen some wives not to forget        the marriage state the best or worst of any      who were the very paragons of wives      yet made the misery of at least two lives       i ve also seen some female friends  t is odd        but trueas if expedient i could prove      that faithful were through thick and thin abroad        at home far more than ever yet was love      who did not quit me when oppression trod        upon me whom no scandal could remove      who fought and fight in absence too my battles      despite the snake societys loud rattles       whether don juan and chaste adeline        grew friends in this or any other sense      will be discussd hereafter i opine        at present i am glad of a pretence      to leave them hovering as the effect is fine        and keeps the atrocious reader in suspense      the surest way for ladies and for books      to bait their tender or their tenter hooks       whether they rode or walkd or studied spanish        to read don quixote in the original      a pleasure before which all others vanish        whether their talk was of the kind calld small      or serious are the topics i must banish        to the next canto where perhaps i shall      say something to the purpose and display      considerable talent in my way       above all i beg all men to forbear        anticipating aught about the matter      they ll only make mistakes about the fair        and juan too especially the latter      and i shall take a much more serious air        than i have yet done in this epic satire      it is not clear that adeline and juan      will fall but if they do t will be their ruin       but great things spring from littlewould you think        that in our youth as dangerous a passion      as eer brought man and woman to the brink        of ruin rose from such a slight occasion      as few would ever dream could form the link        of such a sentimental situation      you ll never guess i ll bet you millions milliards      it all sprung from a harmless game at billiards       t is strangebut true for truth is always strange        stranger than fiction if it could be told      how much would novels gain by the exchange        how differently the world would men behold      how oft would vice and virtue places change        the new world would be nothing to the old      if some columbus of

 a pretty name as one would wish to read        must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill      there s music in the sighing of a reed        there s music in the gushing of a rill      there s music in all things if men had ears      their earth is but an echo of the spheres       the lady adeline right honourable        and honourd ran a risk of growing less so      for few of the soft sex are very stable        in their resolvesalas that i should say so      they differ as wine differs from its label        when once decantedi presume to guess so      but will not swear yet both upon occasion      till old may undergo adulteration       but adeline was of the purest vintage        the unmingled essence of the grape and yet      bright as a new napoleon from its mintage        or glorious as a diamond richly set      a page where time should hesitate to print age        and for which nature might forego her debt      sole creditor whose process doth involve in t      the luck

pleases       fair adeline the more ingenuous        where she was interested as was said      because she was not apt like some of us        to like too readily or too high bred      to show it points we need not now discuss        would give up artlessly both heart and head      unto such feelings as seemd innocent      for objects worthy of the sentiment       some parts of juans history which rumour        that live gazette had scatterd to disfigure      she had heard but women hear with more good humour        such aberrations than we men of rigour      besides his conduct since in england grew more        strict and his mind assumed a manlier vigour      because he had like alcibiades      the art of living in all climes with ease       his manner was perhaps the more seductive        because he neer seemd anxious to seduce      nothing affected studied or constructive        of coxcombry or conquest no abuse      of his attractions marrd the fair perspective        to indicate a cupidon broke loose      and seem to say resist us if you can      which makes a dandy while it spoils a man       they are wrongthat s not the way to set about it        as if they told the truth could well be shown      but right or wrong don juan was without it        in fact his manner was his own alone      sincere he wasat least you could not doubt it        in listening merely to his voices tone      the devil hath not in all his quivers choice      an arrow for the heart like a sweet voice       by nature soft his whole address held off        suspicion though not timid his regard      was such as rather seemd to keep aloof        to shield himself than put you on your guard      perhaps t was hardly quite assured enough        but modesty s at times its own reward      like virtue and the absence of pretension      will go much farther than there s need to mention       serene accomplishd cheerful but not loud        insinuating without insinuation      observant of the foibles of the crowd        yet neer betraying this in conversation      proud with the proud yet courteously proud        so as to make them feel he knew his station      and theirswithout a struggle for priority      he neither brookd nor claimd superiority       that is with men with women he was what        they pleased to make or take him for and their      imagination s quite enough for that        so that the outline s tolerably fair      they fill the canvas upand verbum sat        if once their phantasies be brought to bear      upon an object whether sad or playful      they can transfigure brighter than a raphael       adeline no deep judge of character        was apt to add a colouring from her own      t is thus the good will amiably err        and eke the wise as has been often shown      experience is the chief philosopher        but saddest when his science is well known      and persecuted sages teach the schools      their folly in forgetting there are fools

desultory rhyme      but there s a conversational facility        which may round off an hour upon a time      of this i m sure at least there s no servility        in mine irregularity of chime

allerknights and dames i sing        such as the times may furnish t is a flight      which seems at first to need no lofty wing        plumed by longinus or the stagyrite      the difficultly lies in colouring        keeping the due proportions still in sight      with nature manners which are artificial      and rendring general that which is especial       the difference is that in the days of old        men made the manners manners now make men      pinnd like a flock and fleeced too in their fold        at least nine and a ninth beside of ten      now this at all events must render cold

columbus found a new world in a cutter      or brigantine or pink of no great tonnage      while yet america was in her nonage       when adeline in all her growing sense        of juans merits and his situation      felt on the whole an interest intense        partly perhaps because a fresh sensation      or that he had an air of innocence        which is for innocence a sad temptation      as women hate half measures on the whole      she gan to ponder how to save his soul       she had a good opinion of advice        like all who give and eke receive it gratis      for which small thanks are still the market price        even where the article at highest rate is      she thought upon the subject twice or thrice        and morally decided the best state is      for morals marriage and this question carried      she seriously advised him to get married       juan replied with all becoming deference        he had a predilection for that tie      but that at present with immediate reference        to his own circumstances there might lie      some difficulties as in his own preference        or that of her to whom he might apply      that still he d wed with such or such a lady      if that they were not married all already       next to the making matches for herself        and daughters brothers sisters kith or kin      arranging them like books on the same shelf        there s nothing women love to dabble in      more like a stockholder in growing pelf        than matchmaking in general t is no sin      certes but a preventative and therefore      that is no doubt the only reason wherefore       but never yet except of course a miss        unwed or mistress never to be wed      or wed already who object to this        was there chaste dame who had not in her head      some drama of the marriage unities        observed as strictly both at board and bed      as those of aristotle though sometimes      they turn out melodrames or pantomimes       they generally have some only son        some heir to a large property some friend      of an old family some gay sir john        or grave lord george with whom perhaps might end      a line and leave posterity undone        unless a marriage was applied to mend      the prospect and their morals and besides      they have at hand a blooming glut of brides       from these they will be careful to select        for this an heiress and for that a beauty      for one a songstress who hath no defect        for t other one who promises much duty      for this a lady no one can reject        whose sole accomplishments were quite a booty      a second for her excellent connections      a third because there can be no objections       when rapp the harmonist embargod marriage        in his harmonious settlement which flourishes      strangely enough as yet without miscarriage        because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes      without those sad expenses which disparage        what nature naturally most encourages      why calld he harmony a state sans wedlock      now here i ve got the preacher at a dead lock       because he either meant to sneer at harmony        or marriage by divorcing them thus oddly      but whether reverend rapp learnd this in germany        or no t is said his sect is rich and godly      pious and pure beyond what i can term any        of ours although they propagate more broadly      my objection s to his title not his ritual      although i wonder how it grew habitual       but rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons        who favour malgre malthus generation      professors of that genial art and patrons        of all the modest part of propagation      which after all at such a desperate rate runs        that half its produce tends to emigration      that sad result of passions and potatoes      two weeds which pose our economic catos       had adeline read malthus i cant tell        i wish she had his book s the eleventh commandment      which says thou shalt not marry unless well        this he as far as i can understand meant      t is not my purpose on his views to dwell        nor canvass what so eminent a hand meant      but certes it conducts to lives ascetic      or turning marriage into arithmetic       but adeline who probably presumed        that juan had enough of maintenance      or separate maintenance in case t was doomd        as on the whole it is an even chance      that bridegrooms after they are fairly groomd        may retrograde a little in the dance      of marriage which might form a painters fame      like holbeins dance of deathbut t is the same       but adeline determined juans wedding        in her own mind and that s enough for woman      but then with whom there was the sage miss reading        miss raw miss flaw miss showman and miss knowman      and the two fair coheiresses giltbedding        she deemd his merits something more than common      all these were unobjectionable matches      and might go on if well wound up like watches       there was miss millpond smooth as summers sea        that usual paragon an only daughter      who seemd the cream of equanimity        till skimmdand then there was some milk and water      with a slight shade of blue too it might be        beneath the surface but what did it matter      love s riotous but marriage should have quiet      and being consumptive live on a milk diet       and then there was the miss audacia shoestring        a dashing demoiselle of good estate      whose heart was fixd upon a star or blue string        but whether english dukes grew rare of late      or that she had not harpd upon the true string        by which such sirens can attract our great      she took up with some foreign younger brother      a russ or turkthe one s as good as t other       and then there wasbut why should i go on        unless the ladies should go offthere was      indeed a certain fair and fairy one        of the best class and better than her class      aurora raby a young star who shone        oer life too sweet an image for such glass      a lovely being scarcely formd or moulded      a rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded       rich noble but an orphan left an only        child to the care of guardians good and kind      but still her aspect had an air so lonely        blood is not water and where shall we find      feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie        by death when we are left alas behind      to feel in friendless palaces a home      is wanting and our best ties in the tomb       early in years and yet more infantine        in figure she had something of sublime      in eyes which sadly shone as seraphs shine        all youthbut with an aspect beyond time      radiant and graveas pitying mans decline        mournfulbut mournful of anothers crime      she lookd as if she sat by edens door      and grieved for those who could return no more       she was a catholic too sincere austere        as far as her own gentle heart allowd      and deemd that fallen worship far more dear        perhaps because t was fallen her sires were proud      of deeds and days when they had filld the ear        of nations and had never bent or bowd      to novel power and as she was the last      she held their old faith and old feelings fast       she gazed upon a world she scarcely knew        as seeking not to know it silent lone      as grows a flower thus quietly she grew        and kept her heart serene within its zone      there was awe in the homage which she drew        her spirit seemd as seated on a throne      apart from the surrounding world and strong      in its own strengthmost strange in one so young       now it so happend in the catalogue        of adeline aurora was omitted      although her birth and wealth had given her vogue        beyond the charmers we have already cited      her beauty also seemd to form no clog        against her being mentiond as well fitted      by many virtues to be worth the trouble      of single gentlemen who would be double       and this omission like that of the bust        of brutus at the pageant of tiberius      made juan wonder as no doubt he must        this he expressd half smiling and half serious      when adeline replied with some disgust        and with an air to say the least imperious      she marvelld what he saw in such a baby      as that prim silent cold aurora raby       juan rejoindshe was a catholic        and therefore fittest as of his persuasion      since he was sure his mother would fall sick        and the pope thunder excommunication      if but here adeline who seemd to pique        herself extremely on the inoculation      of others with her own opinions stated      as usualthe same reason which she late did       and wherefore not a reasonable reason        if good is none the worse for repetition      if bad the best way s certainly to tease on        and amplify you lose much by concision      whereas insisting in or out of season        convinces all men even a politician      orwhat is just the sameit wearies out      so the end s gaind what signifies the route       why adeline had this slight prejudice        for prejudice it wasagainst a creature      as pure as sanctity itself from vice        with all the added charm of form and feature      for me appears a question far too nice        since adeline was liberal by nature      but nature s nature and has more caprices      than i have time or will to take to pieces       perhaps she did not like the quiet way        with which aurora on those baubles lookd      which charm most people in their earlier day        for there are few things by mankind less brookd      and womankind too if we so may say        than finding thus their genius stand rebuked      like anthonys by caesar by the few      who look upon them as they ought to do       it was not envyadeline had none        her place was far beyond it and her mind      it was not scornwhich could not light on one        whose greatest fault was leaving few to find      it was not jealousy i think but shun        following the ignes fatui of mankind      it was notbut t is easier far alas      to say what it was not than what it was       little aurora deemd she was the theme        of such discussion she was there a guest      a beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream        of rank and youth though purer than the rest      which flowd on for a moment in the beam        time sheds a moment oer each sparkling crest      had she known this she would have calmly smiled      she had so much or little of the child       the dashing and proud air of adeline        imposed not upon her she saw her blaze      much as she would have seen a glowworm shine        then turnd unto the stars for loftier rays      juan was something she could not divine        being no sibyl in the new worlds ways      yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor      because she did not pin her faith on feature       his fame toofor he had that kind of fame        which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind      a heterogeneous mass of glorious blame        half virtues and whole vices being combined      faults which attract because they are not tame        follies trickd out so brightly that they blind      these seals upon her wax made no impression      such was her coldness or her selfpossession       juan knew nought of such a character        high yet resembling not his lost haidee      yet each was radiant in her proper sphere        the island girl bred up by the lone sea      more warm as lovely and not less sincere        was natures all aurora could not be      nor would be thusthe difference in them      was such as lies between a flower and gem       having wound up with this sublime comparison        methinks we may proceed upon our narrative      and as my friend scott says i sound my warison        scott the superlative of my comparative      scott who can paint your christian knight or saracen        serf lord man with such skill as none would share it if      there had not been one shakspeare and voltaire      of one or both of whom he seems the heir       i say in my slight way i may proceed        to play upon the surface of humanity      i write the world nor care if the world read        at least for this i cannot spare its vanity      my muse hath bred and still perhaps may breed        more foes by this same scroll when i began it i      thought that it might turn out sonow i know it      but still i am or was a pretty poet       the conference or congress for it ended        as congresses of late do of the lady      adeline and don juan rather blended        some acids with the sweetsfor she was heady      but ere the matter could be marrd or mended        the silvery bell rang not for dinner ready      but for that hour calld halfhour given to dress      though ladies robes seem scant enough for less       great things were now to be achieved at table        with massy plate for armour knives and forks      for weapons but what muse since homer s able        his feasts are not the worst part of his works      to draw up in array a single daybill        of modern dinners where more mystery lurks      in soups or sauces or a sole ragout       there was a goodly soupe a la bonne femme        though god knows whence it came from there was too      a turbot for relief of those who cram        relieved with dindon a la parigeux        how shall i get this gourmand stanza through      soupe a la beauveau whose relief was dory      relieved itself by pork for greater glory       but i must crowd all into one grand mess        or mass for should i stretch into detail      my muse would run much more into excess        than when some squeamish people deem her frail      but though a bonne vivante i must confess        her stomach s not her peccant part this tale      however doth require some slight refection      just to relieve her spirits from dejection       fowls a la conde slices eke of salmon        with sauces genevoises and haunch of venison      wines too which might again have slain young ammon        a man like whom i hope we shant see many soon      they also set a glazed westphalian ham on        whereon apicius would bestow his benison      and then there was champagne with foaming whirls      as white as cleopatras melted pearls       then there was god knows what a lallemande        a lespagnole timballe and salpicon      with things i cant withstand or understand        though swallowd with much zest upon the whole      and entremets to piddle with at hand        gently to lull down the subsiding soul      while great lucullus robe triumphal muffles      there s fame young partridge fillets deckd with truffles       what are the fillets on the victors brow        to these they are rags or dust where is the arch      which nodded to the nations spoils below        where the triumphal chariots haughty march      gone to where victories must like dinners go        farther i shall not follow the research      but oh ye modern heroes with your cartridges      when will your names lend lustre een to partridges       those truffles too are no bad accessaries        followd by petits puits damoura dish      of which perhaps the cookery rather varies        so every one may dress it to his wish      according to the best of dictionaries        which encyclopedize both flesh and fish      but even sans confitures it no less true is      there s pretty picking in those petits puits       the mind is lost in mighty contemplation        of intellect expanded on two courses      and indigestions grand multiplication        requires arithmetic beyond my forces      who would suppose from adams simple ration        that cookery could have calld forth such resources      as form a science and a nomenclature      from out the commonest demands of nature       the glasses jingled and the palates tingled        the diners of celebrity dined well      the ladies with more moderation mingled        in the feast pecking less than i can tell      also the younger men too for a springald        cant like ripe age in gormandize excel      but thinks less of good eating than the whisper      when seated next him of some pretty lisper       alas i must leave undescribed the gibier        the salmi the consomme the puree      all which i use to make my rhymes run glibber        than could roast beef in our rough john bull way      i must not introduce even a spare rib here        bubble and squeak would spoil my liquid lay      but i have dined and must forego alas      the chaste description even of a becasse       and fruits and ice and all that art refines        from nature for the service of the gout      taste or the goutpronounce it as inclines        your stomach ere you dine the french will do      but after there are sometimes certain signs        which prove plain english truer of the two      hast ever had the gout i have not had it      but i may have and you too reader dread it       the simple olives best allies of wine        must i pass over in my bill of fare      i must although a favourite plat of mine        in spain and lucca athens every where      on them and bread t was oft my luck to dine        the grass my tablecloth in openair      on sunium or hymettus like diogenes      of whom half my philosophy the progeny is       amidst this tumult of fish flesh and fowl        and vegetables all in masquerade      the guests were placed according to their roll        but various as the various meats displayd      don juan sat next an lespagnole        no damsel but a dish as hath been said      but so far like a lady that t was drest      superbly and containd a world of zest       by some odd chance too he was placed between        aurora and the lady adeline      a situation difficult i ween        for man therein with eyes and heart to dine      also the conference which we have seen        was not such as to encourage him to shine      for adeline addressing few words to him      with two transcendent eyes seemd to look through him       i sometimes almost think that eyes have ears        this much is sure that out of earshot things      are somehow echoed to the pretty dears        of which i cant tell whence their knowledge springs      like that same mystic music of the spheres        which no one bears so loudly though it rings      t is wonderful how oft the sex have heard      long dialogueswhich passd without a word       aurora sat with that indifference        which piques a preux chevalieras it ought      of all offences that s the worst offence        which seems to hint you are not worth a thought      now juan though no coxcomb in pretence        was not exactly pleased to be so caught      like a good ship entangled among ice      and after so much excellent advice       to his gay nothings nothing was replied        or something which was nothing as urbanity      required aurora scarcely lookd aside        nor even smiled enough for any vanity      the devil was in the girl could it be pride        or modesty or absence or inanity      heaven knows but adelines malicious eyes      sparkled with her successful prophecies       and lookd as much as if to say i said it        a kind of triumph i ll not recommend      because it sometimes as i have seen or read it        both in the case of lover and of friend      will pique a gentleman for his own credit        to bring what was a jest to a serious end      for all men prophesy what is or was      and hate those who wont let them come to pass       juan was drawn thus into some attentions        slight but select and just enough to express      to females of perspicuous comprehensions        that he would rather make them more than less      aurora at the last so history mentions        though probably much less a fact than guess      so far relaxd her thoughts from their sweet prison      as once or twice to smile if not to listen       from answering she began to question this        with her was rare and adeline who as yet      thought her predictions went not much amiss        began to dread shed thaw to a coquette      so very difficult they say it is        to keep extremes from meeting when once set      in motion but she here too much refined      auroras spirit was not of that kind       but juan had a sort of winning way        a proud humility if such there be      which showd such deference to what females say        as if each charming word were a decree      his tact too temperd him from grave to gay        and taught him when to be reserved or free      he had the art of drawing people out      without their seeing what he was about       aurora who in her indifference        confounded him in common with the crowd      of flatterers though she deemd he had more sense        than whispering foplings or than witlings loud      commenced from such slight things will great commence        to feel that flattery which attracts the proud      rather by deference than compliment      and wins even by a delicate dissent       and then he had good looksthat point was carried        nem con amongst the women which i grieve      to say leads oft to crim con with the married        a case which to the juries we may leave      since with digressions we too long have tarried        now though we know of old that looks deceive      and always have done somehow these good looks      make more impression than the best of books       aurora who lookd more on books than faces        was very young although so very sage      admiring more minerva than the graces        especially upon a printed page      but virtues self with all her tightest laces        has not the natural stays of strict old age      and socrates that model of all duty      ownd to a penchant though discreet for beauty       and girls of sixteen are thus far socratic        but innocently so as socrates      and really if the sage sublime and attic        at seventy years had phantasies like these      which plato in his dialogues dramatic        has shown i know not why they should displease      in virginsalways in a modest way      observe for that with me s a sine qua       also observe that like the great lord coke        see littleton wheneer i have expressd      opinions two which at first sight may look        twin opposites the second is the best      perhaps i have a third too in a nook        or none at allwhich seems a sorry jest      but if a writer should be quite consistent      how could he possibly show things existent       if people contradict themselves can        help contradicting them and every body      even my veracious selfbut that s a lie        i never did so never willhow should i      he who doubts all things nothing can deny        truths fountains may be clearher streams are muddy      and cut through such canals of contradiction      that she must often navigate oer fiction       apologue fable poesy and parable        are false but may he renderd also true      by those who sow them in a land that s arable        t is wonderful what fable will not do      t is said it makes reality more bearable        but what s reality who has its clue      philosophy no she too much rejects      religion yes but which of all her sects       some millions must be wrong that s pretty dear        perhaps it may turn out that all were right      god help us since we have need on our career        to keep our holy beacons always bright      t is time that some new prophet should appear        or old indulge man with a second sight      opinions wear out in some thousand years      without a small refreshment from the spheres       but here again why will i thus entangle        myself with metaphysics none can hate      so much as i do any kind of wrangle        and yet such is my folly or my fate      i always knock my head against some angle        about the present past or future state      yet i wish well to trojan and to tyrian      for i was bred a moderate presbyterian       but though i am a temperate theologian        and also meek as a metaphysician      impartial between tyrian and trojan        as eldon on a lunatic commission      in politics my duty is to show john        bull something of the lower worlds condition      it makes my blood boil like the springs of hecla      to see men let these scoundrel sovereigns break law       but politics and policy and piety        are topics which i sometimes introduce      not only for the sake of their variety        but as subservient to a moral use      because my business is to dress society        and stuff with sage that very verdant goose      and now that we may furnish with some matter all      tastes we are going to try the supernatural       and now i will give up all argument        and positively henceforth no temptation      shall fool me to the top up of my bent        yes i ll begin a thorough reformation      indeed i never knew what people meant        by deeming that my muses conversation      was dangerousi think she is as harmless      as some who labour more and yet may charm less       grim reader did you ever see a ghost        no but you have heardi understandbe dumb      and dont regret the time you may have lost        for you have got that pleasure still to come      and do not think i mean to sneer at most        of these things or by ridicule benumb      that source of the sublime and the mysterious      for certain reasons my belief is serious       serious you laughyou may that will i not        my smiles must be sincere or not at all      i say i do believe a haunted spot        existsand where that shall i not recall      because i d rather it should be forgot        shadows the soul of richard may appal      in short upon that subject i ve some qualms very      like those of the philosopher of malmsbury       the night i sing by nightsometimes an owl        and now and then a nightingale is dim      and the loud shriek of sage minervas fowl        rattles around me her discordant hymn      old portraits from old walls upon me scowl        i wish to heaven they would not look so grim      the dying embers dwindle in the grate      i think too that i have sate up too late       and therefore though t is by no means my way        to rhyme at noonwhen i have other things      to think of if i ever thinki say        i feel some chilly midnight shudderings      and prudently postpone until midday        treating a topic which alas but brings      shadowsbut you must be in my condition      before you learn to call this superstition     canto the sixteenth       the antique persians taught three useful things        to draw the bow to ride and speak the truth      this was the mode of cyrus best of kings        a mode adopted since by modern youth      bows have they generally with two strings        horses they ride without remorse or ruth      at speaking truth perhaps they are less clever      but draw the long bow better now than ever       the cause of this effect or this defect        for this effect defective comes by cause      is what i have not leisure to inspect        but this i must say in my own applause      of all the muses that i recollect        whateer may be her follies or her flaws      in some things mine s beyond all contradiction      the most sincere that ever dealt in fiction       and as she treats all things and neer retreats        from any thing this epic will contain      a wilderness of the most rare conceits        which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain      t is true there be some bitters with the sweets        yet mixd so slightly that you cant complain      but wonder they so few are since my tale is      de rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis       but of all truths which she has told the most        true is that which she is about to tell      i said it was a story of a ghost        what then i only know it so befell      have you explored the limits of the coast        where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell      t is time to strike such puny doubters dumb as      the sceptics who would not believe columbus       some people would impose now with authority        turpins or monmouth geoffrys chronicle      men whose historical superiority        is always greatest at a miracle      but saint augustine has the great priority        who bids all men believe the impossible      because t is so who nibble scribble quibble he      quiets at once with quia impossibile       and therefore mortals cavil not at all        believeif t is improbable you must      and if it is impossible you shall        t is always best to take things upon trust      i do not speak profanely to recall        those holier mysteries which the wise and just      receive as gospel and which grow more rooted      as all truths must the more they are disputed       i merely mean to say what johnson said        that in the course of some six thousand years      all nations have believed that from the dead        a visitant at intervals appears      and what is strangest upon this strange head        is that whatever bar the reason rears      gainst such belief there s something stronger still      in its behalf let those deny who will       the dinner and the soiree too were done        the supper too discussd the dames admired      the banqueteers had droppd off one by one        the song was silent and the dance expired      the last thin petticoats were vanishd gone        like fleecy clouds into the sky retired      and nothing brighter gleamd through the saloon      than dying tapersand the peeping moon       the evaporation of a joyous day        is like the last glass of champagne without      the foam which made its virgin bumper gay        or like a system coupled with a doubt      or like a soda bottle when its spray        has sparkled and let half its spirit out      or like a billow left by storms behind      without the animation of the wind       or like an opiate which brings troubled rest        or none or likelike nothing that i know      except itselfsuch is the human breast        a thing of which similitudes can show      no real likenesslike the old tyrian vest        dyed purple none at present can tell how      if from a shellfish or from cochineal      so perish every tyrants robe piecemeal       but next to dressing for a rout or ball        undressing is a woe our robe de chambre      may sit like that of nessus and recall        thoughts quite as yellow but less clear than amber      titus exclaimd i ve lost a day of all        the nights and days most people can remember      i have had of both some not to be disdaind      i wish they d state how many they have gaind       and juan on retiring for the night        felt restless and perplexd and compromised      he thought aurora rabys eyes more bright        than adeline such is advice advised      if he had known exactly his own plight        he probably would have philosophised      a great resource to all and neer denied      till wanted therefore juan only sighd       he sighdthe next resource is the full moon        where all sighs are deposited and now      it happend luckily the chaste orb shone        as clear as such a climate will allow      and juans mind was in the proper tone        to hail her with the apostropheo thou      of amatory egotism the tuism      which further to explain would be a truism       but lover poet or astronomer        shepherd or swain whoever may behold      feel some abstraction when they gaze on her        great thoughts we catch from thence besides a cold      sometimes unless my feelings rather err        deep secrets to her rolling light are told      the oceans tides and mortals brains she sways      and also hearts if there be truth in lays       juan felt somewhat pensive and disposed        for contemplation rather than his pillow      the gothic chamber where he was enclosed        let in the rippling sound of the lakes billow      with all the mystery by midnight caused        below his window waved of course a willow      and he stood gazing out on the cascade      that flashd and after darkend in the shade       upon his table or his toiletwhich        of these is not exactly ascertaind      i state this for i am cautious to a pitch        of nicety where a fact is to be gaind      a lamp burnd high while he leant from a niche        where many a gothic ornament remaind      in chiselld stone and painted glass and all      that time has left our fathers of their hall       then as the night was clear though cold he threw        his chamber door wide openand went forth      into a gallery of a sombre hue        long furnishd with old pictures of great worth      of knights and dames heroic and chaste too        as doubtless should be people of high birth      but by dim lights the portraits of the dead      have something ghastly desolate and dread       the forms of the grim knight and pictured saint        look living in the moon and as you turn      backward and forward to the echoes faint        of your own footstepsvoices from the urn      appear to wake and shadows wild and quaint        start from the frames which fence their aspects stern      as if to ask how you can dare to keep      a vigil there where all but death should sleep       and the pale smile of beauties in the grave        the charms of other days in starlight gleams      glimmer on high their buried locks still wave        along the canvas their eyes glance like dreams      on ours or spars within some dusky cave        but death is imaged in their shadowy beams      a picture is the past even ere its frame      be gilt who sate hath ceased to be the same       as juan mused on mutability        or on his mistressterms synonymous      no sound except the echo of his sigh        or step ran sadly through that antique house      when suddenly he heard or thought so nigh        a supernatural agentor a mouse      whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass      most people as it plays along the arras       it was no mouse but lo a monk arrayd        in cowl and beads and dusky garb appeard      now in the moonlight and now lapsed in shade        with steps that trod as heavy yet unheard      his garments only a slight murmur made        he moved as shadowy as the sisters weird      but slowly and as he passd juan by      glanced without pausing on him a bright eye       juan was petrified he had heard a hint        of such a spirit in these halls of old      but thought like most men there was nothing in t        beyond the rumour which such spots unfold      coind from surviving superstitions mint        which passes ghosts in currency like gold      but rarely seen like gold compared with paper      and did he see this or was it a vapour       once twice thrice passd repassdthe thing of air        or earth beneath or heaven or t other place      and juan gazed upon it with a stare        yet could not speak or move but on its base      as stands a statue stood he felt his hair        twine like a knot of snakes around his face      he taxd his tongue for words which were not granted      to ask the reverend person what he wanted       the third time after a still longer pause        the shadow passd awaybut where the hall      was long and thus far there was no great cause        to think his vanishing unnatural      doors there were many through which by the laws        of physics bodies whether short or tall      might come or go but juan could not state      through which the spectre seemd to evaporate       he stoodhow long he knew not but it seemd        an ageexpectant powerless with his eyes      straind on the spot where first the figure gleamd        then by degrees recalld his energies      and would have passd the whole off as a dream        but could not wake he was he did surmise      waking already and returnd at length      back to his chamber shorn of half his strength       all there was as he left it still his taper        burnt and not blue as modest tapers use      receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour        he rubbd his eyes and they did not refuse      their office he took up an old newspaper        the paper was right easy to peruse      he read an article the king attacking      and a long eulogy of patent blacking       this savourd of this world but his hand shook        he shut his door and after having read      a paragraph i think about horne tooke        undrest and rather slowly went to bed      there couchd all snugly on his pillows nook        with what he had seen his phantasy he fed      and though it was no opiate slumber crept      upon him by degrees and so he slept       he woke betimes and as may be supposed        ponderd upon his visitant or vision      and whether it ought not to be disclosed        at risk of being quizzd for superstition      the more he thought the more his mind was posed        in the mean time his valet whose precision      was great because his master brookd no less      knockd to inform him it was time to dress       he dressd and like young people he was wont        to take some trouble with his toilet but      this morning rather spent less time upon t        aside his very mirror soon was put      his curls fell negligently oer his front        his clothes were not curbd to their usual cut      his very neckcloths gordian knot was tied      almost an hairs breadth too much on one side       and when he walkd down into the saloon        he sate him pensive oer a dish of tea      which he perhaps had not discoverd soon        had it not happend scalding hot to be      which made him have recourse unto his spoon        so much distrait he was that all could see      that something was the matteradeline      the firstbut what she could not well divine       she lookd and saw him pale and turnd as pale        herself then hastily lookd down and mutterd      something but what s not stated in my tale        lord henry said his muffin was ill butterd      the duchess of fitzfulke playd with her veil        and lookd at juan hard but nothing utterd      aurora raby with her large dark eyes      surveyd him with a kind of calm surprise       but seeing him all cold and silent still        and everybody wondering more or less      fair adeline enquired if he were ill        he started and said yesnoratheryes      the family physician had great skill        and being present now began to express      his readiness to feel his pulse and tell      the cause but juan said he was quite well       quite well yesnothese answers were mysterious        and yet his looks appeard to sanction both      however they might savour of delirious        something like illness of a sudden growth      weighd on his spirit though by no means serious        but for the rest as he himself seemd loth      to state the case it might be taen for granted      it was not the physician that he wanted       lord henry who had now discussd his chocolate        also the muffin whereof he complaind      said juan had not got his usual look elate        at which he marvelld since it had not raind      then askd her grace what news were of the duke of late        her grace replied his grace was rather paind      with some slight light hereditary twinges      of gout which rusts aristocratic hinges       then henry turnd to juan and addressd        a few words of condolence on his state      you look quoth he as if you had had your rest        broke in upon by the black friar of late      what friar said juan and he did his best        to put the question with an air sedate      or careless but the effort was not valid      to hinder him from growing still more pallid       oh have you never heard of the black friar        the spirit of these wallsin truth not i      why famebut fame you know s sometimes a liar        tells an odd story of which by and by      whether with time the spectre has grown shyer        or that our sires had a more gifted eye      for such sights though the tale is half believed      the friar of late has not been oft perceived         who watchd the changes of don juans brow      and from its context thought she could divine        connexions stronger then he chose to avow      with this same legendif you but design        to jest you ll choose some other theme just now      because the present tale has oft been told      and is not much improved by growing old       jest quoth milor why adeline you know        that we ourselvest was in the honeymoon        but come i ll set your story to a tune      graceful as dian when she draws her bow        she seized her harp whose strings were kindled soon      as touchd and plaintively began to play      the air of t was a friar of orders gray       but add the words cried henry which you made        for adeline is half a poetess      turning round to the rest he smiling said        of course the others could not but express      in courtesy their wish to see displayd        by one three talents for there were no less      the voice the words the harpers skill at once      could hardly be united by a dunce       after some fascinating hesitation        the charming of these charmers who seem bound      i cant tell why to this dissimulation        fair adeline with eyes fixd on the ground      at first then kindling into animation        added her sweet voice to the lyric sound      and sang with much simplicitya merit      not the less precious that we seldom hear it            beware beware of the black friar             who sitteth by norman stone           for he mutters his prayer in the midnight air             and his mass of the days that are gone           when the lord of the hill amundeville             made norman church his prey           and expelld the friars one friar still             would not be driven away            though he came in his might with king henrys right             to turn church lands to lay           with sword in hand and torch to light             their walls if they said nay           a monk remaind unchased unchaind             and he did not seem formd of clay           for he s seen in the porch and he s seen in the church             though he is not seen by day            and whether for good or whether for ill             it is not mine to say           but still with the house of amundeville             he abideth night and day           by the marriagebed of their lords t is said             he flits on the bridal eve           and t is held as faith to their bed of death             he comesbut not to grieve            when an heir is born he s heard to mourn             and when aught is to befall           that ancient line in the we moonshine             he walks from hall to hall           his form you may trace but not his face             t is shadowd by his cowl           but his eyes may be seen from the folds between             and they seem of a parted soul            but beware beware of the black friar             he still retains his sway           for he is yet the churchs heir             whoever may be the lay           amundeville is lord by day             but the monk is lord by night           nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal             to question that friars right            say nought to him as he walks the hall             and he ll say nought to you           he sweeps along in his dusky pall             as oer the grass the dew           then grammercy for the black friar             heaven sain him fair or foul           and whatsoeer may be his prayer             let ours be for his soul       the ladys voice ceased and the thrilling wires        died from the touch that kindled them to sound      and the pause followd which when song expires        pervades a moment those who listen round      and then of course the circle much admires        nor less applauds as in politeness bound      the tones the feeling and the execution      to the performers diffident confusion       fair adeline though in a careless way        as if she rated such accomplishment      as the mere pastime of an idle day        pursued an instant for her own content      would now and then as t were without display        yet with display in fact at times relent      to such performances with haughty smile      to show she could if it were worth her while       now this but we will whisper it aside        waspardon the pedantic illustration      trampling on platos pride with greater pride        as did the cynic on some like occasion      deeming the sage would be much mortified        or thrown into a philosophic passion      for a spoild carpetbut the attic bee      was much consoled by his own repartee       thus adeline would throw into the shade        by doing easily wheneer she chose      what dilettanti do with vast parade        their sort of half profession for it grows      to something like this when too oft displayd        and that it is so everybody knows      who have heard miss that or this or lady tother      show offto please their company or mother       o the long evenings of duets and trios        the admirations and the speculations      the mamma mias and the amor mios        the tanti palpitis on such occasions      the lasciamis and quavering addios        amongst our own most musical of nations      with tu mi chamass from portingale      to soothe our ears lest italy should fail       in babylons bravurasas the home        heartballads of green erin or gray highlands      that bring lochaber back to eyes that roam        oer far atlantic continents or islands      the calentures of music which oercome        all mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands      no more to be beheld but in such visions      was adeline well versed as compositions       she also had a twilight tinge of blue        could write rhymes and compose more than she wrote      made epigrams occasionally too        upon her friends as everybody ought      but still from that sublimer azure hue        so much the present dye she was remote      was weak enough to deem pope a great poet      and what was worse was not ashamed to show it       aurorasince we are touching upon taste        which nowadays is the thermometer      by whose degrees all characters are classd        was more shakspearian if i do not err      the worlds beyond this worlds perplexing waste        had more of her existence for in her      there was a depth of feeling to embrace      thoughts boundless deep but silent too as space       not so her gracious graceful graceless grace        the fullgrown hebe of fitzfulke whose mind      if she had any was upon her face        and that was of a fascinating kind      a little turn for mischief you might trace        also thereonbut that s not much we find      few females without some such gentle leaven      for fear we should suppose us quite in heaven       i have not heard she was at all poetic        though once she was seen reading the bath guide      and hayleys triumphs which she deemd pathetic        because she said her temper had been tried      so much the bard had really been prophetic        of what she had gone through withsince a bride      but of all verse what most ensured her praise      were sonnets to herself or bouts rimes       t were difficult to say what was the object        of adeline in bringing this same lay      to bear on what appeard to her the subject        of juans nervous feelings on that day      perhaps she merely had the simple project        to laugh him out of his supposed dismay      perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it      though why i cannot sayat least this minute       but so far the immediate effect        was to restore him to his selfpropriety      a thing quite necessary to the elect        who wish to take the tone of their society      in which you cannot be too circumspect        whether the mode be persiflage or piety      but wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy      on pain of much displeasing the gynocracy       and therefore juan now began to rally        his spirits and without more explanation      to jest upon such themes in many a sally        her grace too also seized the same occasion      with various similar remarks to tally        but wishd for a still more detaild narration      of this same mystic friars curious doings      about the present familys deaths and wooings       of these few could say more than has been said        they passd as such things do for superstition      with some while others who had more in dread        the theme half credited the strange tradition      and much was talkd on all sides on that head        but juan when crossquestiond on the vision      which some supposed though he had not avowd it      had stirrd him answerd in a way to cloud it       and then the midday having worn to one        the company prepared to separate      some to their several pastimes or to none        some wondering t was so early some so late      there was a goodly match too to be run        between some greyhounds on my lords estate      and a young racehorse of old pedigree      matchd for the spring whom several went to see       there was a picturedealer who had brought        a special titian warranted original      so precious that it was not to be bought        though princes the possessor were besieging all      the king himself had cheapend it but thought        the civil list he deigns to accept obliging all      his subjects by his gracious acceptation      too scanty in these times of low taxation       but as lord henry was a connoisseur        the friend of artists if not artsthe owner      with motives the most classical and pure        so that he would have been the very donor      rather than seller had his wants been fewer        so much he deemd his patronage an honour      had brought the capo dopera not for sale      but for his judgmentnever known to fail       there was a modern goth i mean a gothic        bricklayer of babel calld an architect      brought to survey these grey walls which though so thick        might have from time acquired some slight defect      who after rummaging the abbey through thick        and thin produced a plan whereby to erect      new buildings of correctest conformation      and throw down oldwhich he calld restoration       the cost would be a triflean old song        set to some thousands t is the usual burden      of that same tune when people hum it long        the price would speedily repay its worth in      an edifice no less sublime than strong        by which lord henrys good taste would go forth in      its glory through all ages shining sunny      for gothic daring shown in english money       there were two lawyers busy on a mortgage        lord henry wishd to raise for a new purchase      also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage        and one on tithes which sure are discords torches      kindling religion till she throws down her gage        untying squires to fight against the churches      there was a prize ox a prize pig and ploughman      for henry was a sort of sabine showman       there were two poachers caught in a steel trap        ready for gaol their place of convalescence      there was a country girl in a close cap        and scarlet cloak i hate the sight to see since      sincesincein youth i had the sad mishap        but luckily i have paid few parish fees since      that scarlet cloak alas unclosed with rigour      presents the problem of a double figure       a reel within a bottle is a mystery        one cant tell how it eer got in or out      therefore the present piece of natural history        i leave to those who are fond of solving doubt      and merely state though not for the consistory        lord henry was a justice and that scout      the constable beneath a warrants banner      had baggd this poacher upon natures manor       now justices of peace must judge all pieces        of mischief of all kinds and keep the game      and morals of the country from caprices        of those who have not a license for the same      and of all things excepting tithes and leases        perhaps these are most difficult to tame      preserving partridges and pretty wenches      are puzzles to the most precautious benches       the present culprit was extremely pale        pale as if painted so her cheek being red      by nature as in higher dames less hale        t is white at least when they just rise from bed      perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail        poor soul for she was country born and bred      and knew no better in her immorality      than to wax whitefor blushes are for quality       her black bright downcast yet espiegle eye        had gatherd a large tear into its corner      which the poor thing at times essayd to dry        for she was not a sentimental mourner      parading all her sensibility        nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner      but stood in trembling patient tribulation      to be calld up for her examination       of course these groups were scatterd here and there        not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent      the lawyers in the study and in air        the prize pig ploughman poachers the men sent      from town viz architect and dealer were        both busy as a general in his tent      writing despatches in their several stations      exulting in their brilliant lucubrations       but this poor girl was left in the great hall        while scout the parish guardian of the frail      discussd he hated beer yclept the small        a mighty mug of moral double ale      she waited until justice could recall        its kind attentions to their proper pale      to name a thing in nomenclature rather      perplexing for most virginsa childs father       you see here was enough of occupation        for the lord henry linkd with dogs and horses      there was much bustle too and preparation        below stairs on the score of second courses      because as suits their rank and situation        those who in counties have great land resources      have public days when all men may carouse      though not exactly what s calld open house       but once a week or fortnight uninvited        thus we translate a general invitation      all country gentlemen esquired or knighted        may drop in without cards and take their station      at the full board and sit alike delighted        with fashionable wines and conversation      and as the isthmus of the grand connection      talk oer themselves the past and next election       lord henry was a great electioneerer        burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit      but county contests cost him rather dearer        because the neighbouring scotch earl of giftgabbit      had english influence in the selfsame sphere here        his son the honourable dick dicedrabbit      was member for the other interest meaning      the same selfinterest with a different leaning       courteous and cautious therefore in his county        he was all things to all men and dispensed      to some civility to others bounty        and promises to allwhich last commenced      to gather to a somewhat large amount he        not calculating how much they condensed      but what with keeping some and breaking others      his word had the same value as anothers       a friend to freedom and freeholdersyet        no less a friend to governmenthe held      that he exactly the just medium hit        twixt place and patriotismalbeit compelld      such was his sovereigns pleasure though unfit        he added modestly when rebels raild      to hold some sinecures he wishd abolishd      but that with them all law would be demolishd       he was free to confess whence comes this phrase        is t english not is only parliamentary      that innovations spirit nowadays        had made more progress than for the last century      he would not tread a factious path to praise        though for the public weal disposed to venture high      as for his place he could but say this of it      that the fatigue was greater than the profit       heaven and his friends knew that a private life        had ever been his sole and whole ambition      but could he quit his king in times of strife        which threatend the whole country with perdition      when demagogues would with a butchers knife        cut through and through oh damnable incision      the gordian or the geordian knot whose strings      have tied together commons lords and kings       sooner come lace into the civil list        and champion him to the utmosthe would keep it      till duly disappointed or dismissd        profit he care not for let others reap it      but should the day come when place ceased to exist        the country would have far more cause to weep it      for how could it go on explain who can      he gloried in the name of englishman       he was as independentay much more        than those who were not paid for independence      as common soldiers or a commonshore        have in their several arts or parts ascendance      oer the irregulars in lust or gore        who do not give professional attendance      thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager      to prove their pride as footmen to a beggar       all this save the last stanza henry said        and thought i say no morei ve said too much      for all of us have either heard or read        offor upon the hustingssome slight such      hints from the independent heart or head        of the official candidate i ll

old      was wont to boastas if a gluttons tray        were something very glorious to behold      but t was a public feast and public day        quite full right dull guests hot and dishes cold      great plenty much formality small cheer      and every body out of their own sphere       the squires familiarly formal and        my lords and ladies proudly condescending      the very servants puzzling how to hand        their plateswithout it might be too much bending      from their high places by the sideboards stand        yet like their masters fearful of offending      for any deviation from the graces      might cost both man and master tootheir places       there were some hunters bold and coursers keen        whose hounds neer errd nor greyhounds deignd to lurch      some deadly shots too septembrizers seen        earliest to rise and last to quit the search      of the poor partridge through his stubble screen        there were some massy members of the church      takers of tithes and makers of good matches      and several who sung fewer psalms than catches       there were some country wags tooand alas        some exiles from the town who had been driven      to gaze instead of pavement upon grass        and rise at nine in lieu of long eleven      and lo upon that day it came to pass        i sate next that oerwhelming son of heaven      the very powerful parson peter pith      the loudest wit i eer was deafend with       i knew him in his livelier london days        a brilliant diner out though but a curate      and not a joke he cut but earnd its praise        until preferment coming at a sure rate      o providence how wondrous are thy ways        who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate      gave him to lay the devil who looks oer lincoln      a fat fen vicarage and nought to think on       his jokes were sermons and his sermons jokes        but both were thrown away amongst the fens      for wit hath no great friend in aguish folks        no longer ready ears and shorthand pens      imbibed the gay bonmot or happy hoax        the poor priest was reduced to common sense      or to coarse efforts very loud and long      to hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng       there is a difference says the song between        a beggar and a queen or was of late      the latter worse used of the two we ve seen        but we ll say nothing of affairs of state      a difference twixt a bishop and a dean        a difference between crockery ware and plate      as between english beef and spartan broth      and yet great heroes have been bred by both       but of all natures discrepancies none        upon the whole is greater than the difference      beheld between the country and the town        of which the latter merits every preference      from those who have few resources of their own        and only think or act or feel with reference      to some small plan of interest or ambition      both which are limited to no condition       but en avant the light loves languish oer        long banquets and too many guests although      a slight repast makes people love much more        bacchus and ceres

fasting ruffles       dully past oer the dinner of the day        and juan took his place he knew not where      confused in the confusion and distrait        and sitting as if naild upon his chair      though knives and forks clankd round as in a fray        he seemd unconscious of all passing there      till some one with a groan exprest a wish      unheeded twice to have a fin of fish       on which at the third asking of the bans        he started and perceiving smiles around      broadening to grins he colourd more than once        and hastilyas nothing can confound      a wise man more than laughter from a dunce        inflicted on the dish a deadly wound      and with such hurry that ere he could curb it      he had paid his neighbours prayer with half a turbot       this was no bad mistake as it occurrd        the supplicator being an amateur      but others who were left with scarce a third        were angryas they well might to be sure      they wonderd how a young man so absurd        lord henry at his table should endure      and this and his not knowing how much oats      had fallen last market cost his host three votes       they little knew or might have sympathised        that he the night before had seen a ghost      a prologue which but slightly harmonised        with the substantial company engrossd      by matter and so much materialised        that one scarce knew at what to marvel most      of two thingshow the question rather odd is      such bodies could have souls or souls such bodies       but what confused him more than smile or stare        from all the squires and squiresses around      who wonderd at the abstraction of his air        especially as he had been renownd      for some vivacity among the fair        even in the country circles narrow bound      for little things upon my lords estate      were good small talk for others still less great       was that he caught auroras eye on his        and something like a smile upon her cheek      now this he really rather took amiss        in those who rarely smile their smiles bespeak      a strong external motive and in this        smile of auroras there was nought to pique      or hope or love with any of the wiles      which some pretend to trace in ladies smiles       t was a mere quiet smile of contemplation        indicative of some surprise and pity      and juan grew carnation with vexation        which was not very wise and still less witty      since he had gaind at least her observation        a most important outwork of the city      as juan should have known had not his senses      by last nights ghost been driven from their defences       but what was bad she did not blush in turn        nor seem embarrassdquite the contrary      her aspect was as usual stillnot stern        and she withdrew but cast not down her eye      yet grew a little palewith what concern        i know not but her colour neer was high      though sometimes faintly flushdand always clear      as deep seas in a sunny atmosphere       but adeline was occupied by fame        this day and watching witching condescending      to the consumers of fish fowl and game        and dignity with courtesy so blending      as all must blend whose part it is to aim        especially as the sixth year is ending      at their lords sons or similar connections      safe

through as though it were a dance      betraying only now and then her soul        by a look scarce perceptibly askance      of weariness or scorn began to feel      some doubt how much of adeline was real       so well she acted all and every part        by turnswith that vivacious versatility      which many people take for want of heart        they errt is merely what is calld mobility      a

all places        that honey of your fashionable bees      and store it up for mischievous enjoyment      and this at present was her kind employment       however the day closed as days must close        the evening also wanedand coffee came      each carriage was announced and ladies rose        and curtsying off as curtsies country dame      retired with most unfashionable bows        their docile esquires also did the same      delighted with their dinner and their host      but with the lady adeline the most       some praised her beauty others her great grace        the warmth of her politeness whose sincerity      was obvious in each feature of her face        whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity      yes she was truly worthy her high place        no one could envy her deserved prosperity      and then her dresswhat beautiful simplicity      draperied her form with curious felicity       meanwhile sweet adeline deserved their praises        by an impartial indemnification      for all her past exertion and soft phrases        in a most edifying conversation      which turnd upon their late guests miens and faces        and families even to the last relation      their hideous wives their horrid selves and dresses      and truculent distortion of their tresses       true she said littlet was the rest that broke        forth into universal epigram      but then t was to the purpose what she spoke        like addisons faint praise so wont to damn      her own but served to set off every joke        as music chimes in with a melodrame      how

pure and placid mien        and juan too in general behind none      in gay remark on what he had heard or seen        sate silent now his usual spirits gone      in vain he heard the others rail or rally      he would not join them in a single sally       t is true he saw aurora look as though        she approved his silence she perhaps mistook      its motive for that charity we owe        but seldom pay the absent nor would look      fartherit might or might not be so        but juan sitting silent in his nook      observing little in his reverie      yet saw this much which he was glad to see       the ghost at least had done him this much good        in making him as silent as a ghost      if in the circumstances which ensued        he gaind esteem where it was worth the most      and

and bears afar        our bubbles as the old burst new emerge      lashd from the foam of ages while the graves      of empires heave but like some passing waves       don juan shook as erst he had been shaken        the night before but being sick of shaking      he first inclined to think he had been mistaken        and then to be ashamed of such mistaking      his own internal ghost began to awaken        within him and to quell his corporal quaking      hinting that soul and body on the whole      were odds against a disembodied soul       and then his dread grew wrath and his wrath fierce        and he arose advanced the shade retreated      but juan eager now the truth to pierce        followed his veins no longer cold but heated      resolved to thrust the mystery carte and tierce        at whatsoever risk of being defeated      the ghost stopped menaced then retired until      he reached the ancient wall then stood stone still       juan put forth one arm eternal powers        it touched no soul nor body but the wall      on which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers        checkered with all the tracery of the hall      he shuddered as no doubt the bravest cowers        when he cant tell what tis that doth appal      how odd a single hobgoblins nonentity      should cause more fear than a whole hosts identity       but still the shade remained the blue eyes

fairhaired        a red lip with two rows of pearls beneath      gleamed forth as through the casements ivy shroud      the moon peeped just escaped from a grey cloud       and juan puzzled but still curious thrust        his other arm forth wonder upon wonder      it pressed upon a hard but glowing bust       which beat as if there was a warm heart under      he found as people on most trials must        that he had made at first a silly blunder      and that in his confusion he had caught      only the wall instead of what he sought       the ghost if ghost it were seemed a sweet soul

seventeenth       the world is full of orphans firstly those         who are so in the strict sense of the phrase      but many a lonely tree the loftier grows         than others crowded in the forests maze      the next are such as are not doomed to lose         their tender parents in their budding days      but merely their parental tenderness      which leaves them orphans of the heart no less       the next are only children as they are styled         who grow up children only since the old saw      pronounces that an only s a spoilt child         but not to go too far i hold it law      that where their education harsh or mild         transgresses the great bounds of love or awe      the sufferers bet in heart or intellect      whateer the cause are orphans in effect       but to return unto the stricter rule        as far as words make rules our common notion      of orphans paints at once a parish school         a halfstarved babe a wreck upon lifes ocean      a human what the italians nickname mule         a theme for pity or some worse emotion      yet if examined it might be admitted      the wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied       too soon they are
