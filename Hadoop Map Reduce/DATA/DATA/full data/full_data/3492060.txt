philadelphia   henry altemus company     copyright 1900 by   henry altemus company     trotty veck and his daughter meg   trotty seems a strange name for an old man but it was given to toby veck because of his always going at a trot to do his errands for he was a porter and carried letters and messages for people who were in too great a hurry to send them by the post he did not earn very much and had to be out in all weathers and all day long but toby was of a cheerful disposition and looked on the bright side of everything his greatest joy was his dear daughter meg who loved him dearly  one cold day toby had been trotting up and down in his usual place before the church when the bells chimed twelve oclock which made toby think of dinner  theres nothing he remarked more regular in coming round than dinnertime and nothing less regular in coming round than dinner thats the great difference between em he went on talking to himself never noticing who was coming near to him  why father father said a pleasant voice and toby turned to find his daughters sweet bright eyes close to his  why pet said he kissing her whatstodo i didnt expect you today meg  neither did i expect to come father said meg smiling but here i am and not alone not alone  why you dont mean to say observed trotty looking curiously at the covered basket she carried that you  smell it father dear said meg only smell it and guess what it is  toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket why its hot he said  but to megs great delight he could not guess what it was that smelt so good at last he exclaimed in triumph why what am i athinking of its tripe  and it was  just as toby was about to sit down to his dinner on the doorsteps of a big house close by the chimes rang out again and toby took off his hat and said amen  amen to the bells father  they broke in like a grace my dear said trotty theyd say a good one if they could im sure manys the kind thing they say to me how often have i heard them bells say toby veck toby veck keep a good heart toby a millions times more  well i never cried meg  while toby ate his unexpected dinner with immense relish meg told him how her lover richard a young blacksmith had brought his dinner to share with her and had begged her to marry him on new years day the best and happiest day of the whole year  so went on meg i wanted to make this a sort of holiday to you as well as a dear and happy day to me father and i made a little treat and brought it to surprise you  just then richard himself came up to persuade toby to agree to their plan and almost at the same moment a footman came out of the house and ordered them all off the steps and some gentleman came out who called up trotty and gave him a letter to carry  toby trotted off to a very grand house where he was told to take the letter in to the gentleman while he was waiting he heard the letter read it was from alderman cute to tell sir joseph bowley that one of his tenants named will fern who had come to london to try and get work had been brought before him charged with sleeping in a shed and asking if sir joseph wished him to be dealt leniently with or otherwise to tobys great disappointment the answer was given that will fern might be sent to prison as a vagabond though his only fault was poverty on his way home toby ran against a man dressed like a countryman carrying a fairhaired little girl the man asked him the way to alderman cutes house  its impossible cried toby that your name is will fern  thats my name said the man  thereupon toby told him what he had just heard and said dont go there    illustration trotty vecks dinner   toby took a sniff at the edge of the basket  poor will told him how he could not make a living in the country and had come to london with his orphan niece to try and find a friend of her mothers and to endeavor to get some work and wishing toby a happy new year was about to trudge wearily off again when trotty caught his hand saying  stay the new year never can be happy to me if i see the child and you go wandering away without a shelter for your heads come home with me im a poor man living in a poor place but i can give you lodging for one night and never miss it and lifting up the pretty little one he trotted towards home and rushing in he set the child down before his daughter the little girl ran into her arms at once while trotty ran round the room saying here we are and here we go here uncle will come to the fire meg my precious darling wheres the kettle here it is and here it goes and itll bile in no time  why father said meg youre crazy tonight i think poor little feet how cold they are  oh theyre warmer now exclaimed the child theyre quite warm now  no no no said meg we havent rubbed em half enough and when theyre done well brush out the damp hair and well bring some color to the poor pale face with fresh water and then well be so gay and brisk and happy  the child sobbing clasped her round the neck saying o meg o dear meg  good gracious me said meg presently fathers crazy hes put the dear childs bonnet on the kettle and hung the lid behind the door  trotty hastily repaired this mistake and went off to find some tea and a rasher of bacon he fancied he had seen lying somewhere on the stairs he soon came back and made the tea and before long they were all enjoying the meal  after tea meg took lilian to bed and toby showed will fern where he was to sleep then he went to sit by the fire and read his paper and fell asleep to have a wonderful dream so terrible and sad that it was a great relief when he woke to find meg sitting near him putting some ribbons on her simple gown for her wedding and looking so happy and young and blooming that he jumped up to clasp her in his arms  but somebody came rushing in between them cryingno not even you the first kiss of meg in the new year is mine meg my precious prize a happy year a life of happy years my darling wife  then in came lilian and will fern and a band of music with a flock of neighbors burst into the room shouting a happy new year meg a happy wedding many of em and the drum stepped forward and said  trotty veck its got about that your daughter is to be married tomorrow and there aint a soul that knows you both that dont wish you both all the happiness the new year can bring and here we are to play it in and dance it in accordingly then mrs chickenstalker came in a goodhumored comely woman who to the delight of all turned out to be the friend of lilians mother for whom will fern had come to look to wish meg joy and then the music struck up and trotty making meg and richard second couple led off mrs chickenstalker down the dance and danced it in a step unknown before or since founded on his own peculiar trot     tiny tim   there was once a man who did not like christmas his name was scrooge and he was a hard sourtempered man of business intent only on saving and making money and caring nothing for anyone he paid the poor hardworking clerk in his office as little as he could possibly get the work done for and lived on as little as possible himself alone in two dismal rooms he was never merry or comfortable or happy and he hated other people to be so and that was the reason why he hated christmas because people will be happy at christmas you know if they possibly can  well it was christmas eve a very cold and foggy one and mr scrooge having given his poor clerk unwilling permission to spend christmas day at home locked up his office and went home himself in a very bad temper after having taken some gruel as he sat over a miserable fire in his dismal room he got into bed and had some wonderful and disagreeable dreams to which we will leave him whilst we see how tiny tim the son of his poor clerk spent christmas day  the name of this clerk was bob cratchet he had a wife and five other children beside tim who was a weak and delicate little cripple gentle and patient and loving with a sweet face of his own which no one could help looking at  it was mr cratchets delight to carry his little boy out on his shoulder to see the shops and the people and today he had taken him to church for the first time  whatever has got your precious father and your brother tiny tim exclaimed mrs cratchet heres dinner all ready to be dished up ive never known him so late on christmas day before  here he is mother cried belinda and here he is cried the other children as mr cratchet came in his long comforter hanging three feet from under his threadbare coat for cold as it was the poor clerk had no topcoat tiny tim was perched on his fathers shoulder  and how did tim behave asked mrs cratchet  as good as gold and better replied his father he told me coming home that he hoped the people in church who saw he was a cripple would be pleased to remember on christmas day who it was who made the lame to walk  bless his sweet heart said the mother in a trembling voice  dinner was waiting to be dished up mrs cratchet proudly placed a goose upon the table belinda brought in the apple sauce and peter the mashed potatoes the other children set chairs tims as usual close to his fathers and tim was so excited that he rapped the table with his knife and carried hurrah after the goose came the pudding all ablaze with its sprig of holly in the middle and was eaten to the last morsel then apples and oranges were set upon the table and a shovelful of chestnuts on the fire and mr cratchet served round some hot sweet stuff out of a jug as they closed round the fire and said a merry christmas to us all my dears god bless us god bless us every one echoed tiny tim and then they drank each others health and mr scrooges health and told stories and sang songs    illustration tiny tim   tiny tim was perched on his fathers shoulder  now in one of mr scrooges dreams on christmas eve a christmas spirit showed him his clerks home he saw them all heard them drink his health and he took special note of tiny tim himself  how mr scrooge spent christmas day we do not know but on christmas night he had more dreams and the spirit took him again to his clerks poor home  upstairs the father with his face hidden in his hands sat beside a little bed on which lay a tiny figure white and still tiny tim died because his father was too poor to give him what was necessary to make him well you kept him poor said the dreamspirit to mr scrooge the father kissed the cold little face on the bed and went downstairs where the sprays of holly still remained about the humble room and taking his hat went out with a wistful glance at the little crutch in the corner as he shut the door mr scrooge saw all this but wonderful to relate he woke the next morning feeling as he had never felt in his life before  why i am as light as a feather and as happy as an angel and as merry as a schoolboy he said to himself i hope everybody had a merry christmas and heres a happy new year to all the world  poor bob cratchet crept into the office a few minutes late expecting to be scolded for it but his master was there with his back to a good fire and actually smiling and he shook hands with his clerk telling him heartily he was going to raise his salary and asking quite affectionately after tiny tim and mind you make up a good fire in your room before you set to work bob he said as he closed his own door  bob could hardly believe his eyes and ears but it was all true such doings as they had on new years day had never been seen before in the cratchets home nor such a turkey as mr scrooge sent them for dinner tiny tim had his share too for tiny tim did not die not a bit of it mr scrooge was a second father to him from that day he wanted for nothing and grew up strong and hearty mr scrooge loved him and well he might for was it not tiny tim who had unconsciously through the christmas dreamspirit touched his hard heart and caused him to become a good and happy man     little dombey   little dombey was the son of a rich city merchant a cold stern and pompous man whose life and interests were entirely absorbed in his business he was so desirous of having a son to associate with himself in the business and make the house once more dombey  son in fact as it was in name that the little boy who was at last born to him was eagerly welcomed  there was a pretty little girl six years old but her father had taken little notice of her of what use was a girl to dombey  son she could not go into the business  little dombeys mother died when he was born but the event did not greatly disturb mr dombey and since his son lived what did it matter to him that his little daughter florence was breaking her heart in loneliness for the mother who had loved and cherished her  during the first few months of his life little dombey grew and flourished and as soon as he was old enough to take notice there was no one he loved so well as his sister florence  in due time the baby was taken to church and baptized by the name of paul his fathers name a grand and stately christening it was followed by a grand and stately feast and little paul was declared by his godmother to be an angel and the perfect picture of his own papa  but from that time paul seemed to waste and pine his healthy and thriving babyhood had received a check and as for illnesses there never was a blessed dear so put upon his nurse said  by the time he was five years old though he had the prettiest sweetest little face in the world there was always a patient wistful look upon it and he was thin and tiny and delicate he soon got tired and had such oldfashioned ways of speaking and doing things that his nurse often shook her head sadly over him  when he sat in his little armchair with his father after dinner they were a strange pairso like and so unlike each other  what is money papa asked paul on one of these occasions crossing his tiny arms as well as he couldjust as his fathers were crossed  why gold silver and copper you know what it is well enough paul answered his father  oh yes i mean what can money do  anything everythingalmost replied mr dombey taking one of his sons wee hands  paul drew his hand gently away it didnt save me my mamma and it cant make me strong and big said he  why you are strong and big as big as such little people usually are returned mr dombey  no replied paul sighing when florence was as little as me she was strong and tall and did not get tired of playing as i do i am so tired sometimes papa  mr dombeys anxiety was aroused and the doctor was sent for to examine paul  the child is hardly so stout as we could wish said the doctor his mind is too big for his body he thinks too muchlet him try sea airsea air does wonders for children  so it was arranged that florence paul and nurse should go to brighton and stay in the house of a lady named mrs pipchin who kept a very select boardinghouse for children  there is no doubt that apart from his importance to the house of dombey  son little paul had crept into his fathers heart cold though it still was towards his daughter colder than ever now for there was in it a sort of unacknowledged jealousy of the warm love lavished on her by paul which he himself was unable to win  mrs pipchin was a marvellously ugly old lady with a hook nose and stern cold eyes  well master paul how do you think you will like me said mrs pipchin seeing the child intently regarding her  i dont think i shall like you at all replied paul shaking his head i want to go away i do not like your house  paul did not like mrs pipchin but he would sit in his armchair and look at her her ugliness seemed to fascinate him  as the weeks went by little paul grew more healthylooking but he did not seem any stronger and could not run about out of doors a little carriage was therefore got for him in which he could be wheeled down to the beach where he would pass the greater part of the day he took a great fancy to a queer crabfaced old man smelling of seaweed who wheeled his carriage and held long conversations with him but florence was the only child companion whom he ever cared to have with him though he liked to watch other children playing in the distance  i love you floy he said one day to her  florence laid her head against his pillow and whispered how much stronger he was growing  oh yes i know i am a great deal better said paul a very great deal better listen floy what is it the sea keeps saying  nothing dear it is only the rolling of the waves you hear  yes but they are always saying something and always the same thing what place is over there floy  she told him there was another country opposite but paul said he did not mean that he meant somewhere much farther away oh much farther awayand often he would break off in the midst of their talk to listen to the sea and gaze out towards that country farther away  after having lived at brighton for a year paul was certainly much stronger though still thin and delicate and on one of his weekly visits mr dombey explained to mrs pipchin with pompous condescension that pauls weak health having kept him back in his studies he had made arrangements to place him at the educational establishment of dr blimber which was close by florence was for the present to remain under mrs pipchins care and see her brother every week  dr blimbers school was a great hothouse for the forcing of boys brains and dr blimber promised speedily to make a man of paul  shall you like to be made a man of my son asked mr dombey  id rather be a child and stay with floy answered paul  miss blimber the doctors daughter a learned lady in spectacles was his special tutor and from morning till night his poor little brains were forced and crammed till his head was heavy and always had a dull ache in it and his small legs grew weak againevery day he looked a little thinner and a little paler and became more oldfashioned than ever in his looks and waysoldfashioned was a distinguishing title which clung to him he was gentle and polite to every onealways looking out for small kindnesses which he might do to any inmate of the house the oddest and most oldfashioned child in the world dr blimber would say to his daughter but bring him on corneliabring him on  and cornelia did bring him on and florence seeing how pale and weary the little fellow looked when he came to her on saturdays and how he could not rest from anxiety about his lessons would lighten his labors a little and ease his mind by helping him to prepare his weeks work but one day when his lessons were over little paul laid his weary and aching head against the knee of a schoolfellow of whom he was very fond and the first thing he noticed when he opened his eyes was that the window was open his face and hair were wet with water and that dr blimber and the usher were both standing looking at him  ah thats well said dr blimber as paul opened his eyes and how is my little friend now  oh quite well thank you sir answered paul but when he got up there seemed something the matter with the floor and the walls were dancing about and dr blimbers head was twice its natural size he was put to bed and presently the doctor came and said he was not to do any more lessons for the present  in a few days paul was able to get up and creep about the house he wondered sometimes why every one looked at and spoke so very kindly to him and was more than ever careful to do any little kindnesses he could think of for them even the rough ugly dog diogenes who lived in the yard came in for a share of his attentions  there was a party at dr blimbers on the evening before the boys went home paul sat in a corner of the sofa all the evening and every one was very kind to him indeed it was quite extraordinary paul thought and he was very happy he liked to see how pretty florence was and how every one admired and wished to dance with her after resting for a night at mrs pipchins house little paul went home and was carried straight upstairs to his bed    illustration little paul and florence   a little carriage was got for him  he lay in his bed day after day quite happily and patiently content to watch and talk to florence he would tell her his dreams and how he always saw the sunlit ripples of a river rolling rolling fast in front of him sometimes he seemed to be rocking in a little boat on the water and its motion lulled him to rest and then he would be floating away away to that shore farther off which he could not see one day he told florence that the water was rippling brighter and faster than ever and that he could not see anything else  my own boy cannot you see your poor father said mr dombey bending over him  oh yes but dont be so sorry dear papa i am so happygoodbye dear papa presently he opened his eyes again and said floy mamma is like you i can see her come close to me floy and tell them whispered the dying boy that the face of the picture of christ on the staircase at school is not divine enough the light from it is shining on me now and the water is shining too and rippling so fast so fast  the evening light shone into the room but little pauls spirit had gone out on the rippling water and the divine face was shining on him from the farther shore     the runaway couple   supposing a young gentleman not eight years old was to run away with a fine young woman of seven would you consider that a queer start that there is a start as ithe boots at the hollytree innhave seen with my own eyes and i cleaned the shoes they ran away in and they was so little that i couldnt get my hand into em    illustration the runaway couple  master harry walmerss father he lived at the elms away by shooters hill six or seven miles from london he was uncommon proud of master harry as was his only child but he didnt spoil him neither he was a gentleman that had a will of his own and an eye of his own and that would be minded consequently though he made quite a companion of the fine bright boy still he kept the command over him and the child was a child i was under gardener there at that time i and one morning master harry he comes to me and says  cobbs how should you spell norah if you were asked and he took out his little knife and began cutting that name in print all over the fence the next day as it might be he stops along with miss norah where i was hoeing weeds in the gravel and says speaking up  cobbs i like you why do i like you do you think cobbs because norah likes you  indeed sir says i thats very gratifying  gratifying cobbs says master harry its better than a million of the brightest diamonds to be liked by norah youre going away aint you cobbs then you shall be our head gardener when were married and he tucks her in her little skyblue mantle under his arm and walks away  i was the boots at this identical hollytree inn when one summer afternoon the coach drives up and out of the coach gets these two children the young gentleman gets out hands his lady out gives the guard something for himself says to my governor the landlord were to stop here tonight please sitting room and two bedrooms will be required mutton chops and cherry pudding for two and tucks her under his arm and walks into the house much bolder than brass  i had seen em without their seeing me and i gave the governor my views of the expedition they was upon cobbs says the governor if this is so i must set off myself and quiet their friends minds in which case you must keep your eye upon em and humor em until i come back but before i take these measures cobbs i should wish you to find out from themselves whether your opinion is correct  so i goes upstairs and there i finds master harry on an enormous sofa adrying the eyes of miss norah with his pocket handkercher their little legs was entirely off the ground of course and it really is not possible to express how small them children looked its cobbs its cobbs cries master harry and he comes aruning to me and catching hold of my hand miss norah she comes running to me on tother side and catching hold of my tother hand and they both jump for joy and what i had took to be the case was the case  were going to be married cobbs at gretna green says the boy weve run away on purpose norah has been in rather low spirits cobbs but shell be happy now we have found you to be our friend  i give you my word and honor upon it that by way of luggage the lady had got a parasol a smellingbottle a round and a half of cold buttered toast eight peppermint drops and a dolls hairbrush the gentleman had got about a dozen yards of string a knife three or four sheets of writingpaper folded up surprisingly small a orange and a chaney mug with his name on it  what may be the exact nature of your plans sir says i  to go on replies the boy in the morning and be married tomorrow  just so sir well sir if you will excuse my having the freedom to give an opinion what i should recommend would be this im acquainted with a pony sir which would take you and mrs harry walmers junior to the end of your journey in a very short space of time i am not altogether sure sir that the pony will be at liberty tomorrow but even if you had to wait for him it might be worth your while  they clapped their hands and jumped for joy and called me good cobbs and dear cobbs and says i is there anything you want at present sir  we should like some cakes after dinner answers mr harry and two applesand jam with dinner we should like to have toast and water but norah has always been accustomed to half a glass of currant wine at dessert and so have i  they shall be ordered sir i answered and away i went and the way in which all the women in the house went on about that boy and his bold spirit was a thing to see they climbed up all sorts of places to get a look at him and they peeped seven deep through the keyhole  in the evening after the governor had set off for the elms i went into the room to see how the runaway couple was getting on the gentleman was on the window seat supporting the lady in his arms she had tears upon her face and was lying very tired and half asleep with her head upon his shoulder  mrs harry walmers junior fatigued sir  yes shes tired cobbs shes been in low spirits again she isnt used to being in a strange place you see could you bring a norfolk biffin cobbs i think that would do her good  well i fetched the biffin and master harry fed her with a spoon but the lady being heavy with sleep and rather cross i suggested bed and called a chambermaid but master harry must needs escort her himself and carry the candle for her after embracing her at her own door he retired to his room where i softly locked him in  they consulted me at breakfast they had ordered sweet milk and water and toast and currant jelly over night about the pony and i told em that it did unfortunately happen that the pony was half clipped but that hed be finished clipping in the course of the day and that tomorrow morning at eight oclock he would be ready my own opinion is that mrs harry walmers junior was beginning to give in she hadnt had her hair curled when she went to bed and she didnt seem quite up to brushing it herself and it getting into her eyes put her out but nothing put out mr harry he sat behind his breakfast cup tearing away at the jelly as if hed been his own father  in the course of the morning master harry rung the bellit was surprising how that there boy did carry onand said in a sprightly way cobbs is there any good walks in the neighborhood  yes sir theres love lane  get out with you cobbsthat was that there mites expressionyoure joking  begging your pardon sir there really is a love lane and a pleasant walk it is and proud shall i be to show it to yourself and mrs harry walmers junior  well i took him down love lane to the water meadows and there master harry would have drowned himself in another minute a getting out a waterlily for her but they was tired out all being so new and strange to them they were as tired as tired could be and they laid down on a bank of daisies and fell asleep  they woke up at last and then one thing was getting pretty clear to me namely that mrs harry walmers juniors temper was on the move when master harry took her round the waist she said he teased her so and when he says norah my young may moon your harry tease you she tells him yes and i want to go home  a boiled fowl and baked bread and butter pudding brought mrs walmers up a little but i could have wished i must privately own to have seen her more sensible to the voice of love and less abandoning herself to the currants in the pudding however master harry he kep up and his noble heart was as fond as ever mrs walmers turned very sleepy about dusk and began to cry therefore mrs walmers went off to bed as per yesterday and master harry ditto repeated  about eleven at night comes back the governor in a chaise along of master harrys father and a elderly lady and master harrys door being unlocked by me master harrys father goes in goes up to the bedside bends gently down and kisses the little sleeping face then he stands looking at it for a moment looking wonderfully like it and then he gently shakes the little shoulder harry my dear boy harry  master harry starts up and looks at his pa such is the honor of that mite that he looks at me too to see whether he has brought me into trouble  i am not angry my child i only want you to dress yourself and come home  yes pa master harry dresses himself quick  please may iplease dear pamay ikiss norah before i go  master harrys father he takes master harry in his hand and i leads the way with the candle to that other bedroom where the elderly lady is seated by the bed and poor little mrs harry walmers junior is fast asleep there the father lifts the boy up to the pillow and he lays his little face down for an instant by the little warm face of poor little mrs harry walmers junior and gently draws it to him  and thats all about it master harrys father drove away in the chaise having hold of master harrys hand the elderly lady mrs harry walmers junior that was never to be she married a captain long after and went to india went off next day     poor jo   jo was a crossingsweeper every day he swept up the mud and begged for pennies from the people who passed poor jo wasnt pretty and he wasnt clean his clothes were only a few poor rags that hardly protected him from the cold and the rain he had never been to school and he could neither write nor readcould not even spell his own name  poor jo he was ugly and dirty and ignorant but he knew one thing that it was wicked to tell a lie and knowing this he always told the truth one other thing poor jo knew too well and that was what being hungry means for little jo was very poor he lived in tomallalones one of the most horrible places in all london the people who live in this dreadful den are the poorest of london poor all miserably clad all dirty all very hungry they know and like jo for he is always willing to go on errands for them and does them many little acts of kindness  no one in tomallalones is spoken of by his name thus it is that if you inquired there for a boy named jo you would be asked whether you meant carrots or the colonel or gallows or young chisel or terrier tip or lanky or the brick  jo was generally called toughy although a few superior persons who affected a dignified style of speaking called him the tough subject  jo used to say he had never had but one friend  it was one cold winter night when he was shivering in a doorway near his crossing that a darkhaired roughbearded man turned to look at him and then came back and began to talk to him  have you a friend boy he asked presently  no never ad none  neither have i not one take this and goodnight and so saying the man who looked very poor and shabby put into jos hand the price of a supper and a nights lodging  often afterwards the stranger would stop to talk with jo and give him money jo firmly believed whenever he had any to give when he had none he would merely say i am as poor as you are today jo and pass on  one day jo was fetched away from his crossing to a publichouse where the coroner was holding an inquestan inkwich jo called it  did the boy know the deceased asked the coroner  indeed jo had known him it was his only friend who was dead  he was very good to me he was was all poor jo could say  the next day they buried the dead man in the churchyard hard by  but that night there came a slouching figure through the court to the iron gate it stood looking in for a little while then with an old broom it softly swept the step and made the archway clean it was poor jo and as he went away he softly said to himself he was very good to me he was  now there happened to be at the inquest a kindhearted little man named snagsby and he pitied jo so much that he gave him halfacrown  jo was very sad after the death of his one friend the more so as his friend had died in great poverty and misery with no one near him to care whether he lived or not  a few days after the funeral while jo was still living on mr snagsbys halfcrown he was standing at his crossing as the day closed in when a lady closely veiled and plainly dressed came up to him  are you the boy jo who was examined at the inquest she asked  thats me said jo  come farther up the court i want to speak to you  wot about him as was dead did you know him  how dare you ask me if i knew him  no offence my lady said jo humbly  listen and hold your tongue show me the place where he lived then where he died then where they buried him go in front of me dont look back once and ill pay you well    illustration jo and the policeman   im always a moving on  jo takes her to each of the places she wants to see then she draws off her glove and jo sees that she has sparkling rings on her fingers she drops a coin into his hand and is gone jo holds the coin to the light and sees to his joy that it is a golden sovereign  but people in jos position in life find it hard to change a sovereign for who will believe that they can come by it honestly so poor little jo didnt get much of the sovereign for himself for as he afterwards told mr snagsby  i had to pay five bob down in tomallalones before theyd square it for to give me change and then a young man he thieved another five while i was asleep and a boy he thieved ninepence and the landlord he stood drains round with a lot more of it  as time went on jos troubles began in earnest the police turned him away from his crossing and wheresoever they met him ordered him to move on  once a policeman angry to find that jo hadnt moved on seized him by the arm and dragged him down to mr snagsbys  whats the matter constable asked mr snagsby  this boys as obstinate a young gonoph as i know although repeatedly told to he wont move on  im always amoving on cried jo oh my eye where am i to move to  my instructions dont go to that the constable answered my instructions are that youre to keep moving on now the simple question is sir turning to mr snagsby whether you know him he says you do  yes i know him  very well i leave him here but mind you keep moving on  the constable then moved on himself leaving jo at mr snagsbys there was a little teaparty there that evening and when jo was at last allowed to go mr snagsby followed him to the door and filled his hands with the remains of the little feast they had had upstairs  and now jo began to find life harder and rougher than ever he lost his crossing altogether and spent day after day in moving on he remembered a poor woman he had once done a kindness to who had told him she lived at st albans and that a lady there had been very good to her perhaps shell be good to me thought jo and he started off to go to st albans  one saturday night jo reached that town very tired and very ill happily for him the woman met him and took him into her cottage while he was resting there a lady came in and asked him very kindly what was the matter  im

night air where he went he could never remember for when he next came to his senses he found himself in a hospital he stayed there for some weeks and was then discharged though still weak and ill he was very thin and when he drew a breath his chest was very painful it draws said jo as heavy as a cart  now a certain young doctor who was very kind to poor people was walking through tomallalones one

little kenwigs   mrs kenwigs was the wife of an ivory turner and though they only had a very humble home of two rooms in a dingylooking house in a small street they had great pretensions to being genteel the little miss kenwigs had their flaxen hair plaited into pigtails and tied with blue ribbons and wore little white trousers with frills round their ankles the highest fashion of that day besides being dressed with such elegance the two eldest girls went twice a week to a dancing school mrs kenwigs too had an uncle who collected the water rate and she was therefore considered a person of great distinction with quite the manners of a lady on the eighth anniversary of their wedding day mr and mrs kenwigs invited a party of friends to supper to celebrate the occasion the four eldest children were to be allowed to sit up to supper and the uncle mr lillyvick had promised to come the baby was put to bed in a little room lent by one of the lady guests and a little girl hired to watch him all the company had assembled when a ring was heard and morleena whose name had been invented by mrs kenwigs specially for her ran down to open the door and lead in her distinguished greatuncle then the supper was brought in  the table was cleared mr lillyvick established in the armchair by the fireside the four little girls arranged on a small form in front of the company with their flaxen tails towards them mrs kenwigs was suddenly dissolved in tears and sobbed out  they are so beautiful  oh dear said all the ladies so they are its very natural you should feel proud of that but dont give way dont  i cannot help it and it dont signify sobbed mrs kenwigs oh theyre too beautiful to live much too beautiful  on hearing this dismal prophecy all four little girls screamed until their light flaxen tails vibrated again and rushed to bury their heads in their mothers lap  at length she was soothed and the children calmed down while the ladies and gentlemen all said they were sure they would live for many many years and there was no occasion for their mothers distress and as the children were not so remarkably lovely this was quite true  then mr lillyvick talked to the company about his nieces marriage and said graciously that he had always found mr kenwigs a very honest wellbehaved upright and respectable sort of man and shook hands with him and then morleena and her sisters kissed their uncle and most of the guests  then miss petowker who could sing and recite in a way that brought tears to mrs kenwigs eyes remarked  oh dear mrs kenwigs while mr noggs is making that punch to drink happy returns in do let morleena go through that figure dance before mr lillyvick  well ill tell you what said mrs kenwigs morleena shall do the steps if uncle can persuade miss petowker to recite us the blooddrinkers burial afterwards  everyone clapped their hands and stamped their feet at this proposal but miss petowker said you know i dislike doing anything professional at private parties  oh but not here said mrs kenwigs you might as well be going through it in your own room besides the occasion  i cant resist that interrupted miss petowker anything in my humble power i shall be delighted to do  in reality mrs kenwigs and miss petowker had arranged all the entertainment between them beforehand but had settled that a little pressing on each side would look more natural then miss petowker hummed a tune and morleena danced it was a very beautiful figure with a great deal of work for the arms and gained much applause then miss petowker was entreated to begin her recitation so she let down her back hair and went through the performance with great spirit and died raving mad in the arms of a bachelor friend who was to rush out and catch her at the words in death expire to the great delight of the audience and the terror of the little kenwigses who were nearly frightened into fits  just as the punch was ready a knock at the door startled them all but it was only a friend of mr noggs who lived upstairs and who had come down to say that mr noggs was wanted  mr noggs hurried out saying he would be back soon and presently startled them all by rushing in snatching up a candle and a tumbler of hot punch and darting out again  now it happened unfortunately that the tumbler of punch was the very one that mr lillyvick was just going to lift to his lips and the great manthe rich relationwho had it in his power to make morleena and her sisters heiressesand whom everyone was most anxious to pleasewas offended  poor mr kenwigs endeavored to soothe him but only made matters worse mr lillyvick demanded his hat and was only induced to remain by mrs kenwigs tears and the entreaties of the entire company    illustration the little kenwigs   they are so beautiful  there kenwigs said mr lillyvick and let me tell you to show you how much out of temper i was that if i had gone away without another word it would have made no difference respecting that pound or two which i shall leave among your children when i die  morleena kenwigs cried her mother go down on your knees to your dear uncle and beg him to love you all his life through for hes more an angel than a man and ive always said so  just as all were happy again everyone was startled by a rapid succession of the loudest and shrillest shrieks apparently coming from the room where the baby was asleep  my baby my blessed blessed blessed blessed baby my own darling sweet innocent lillyvick let me goooo screamed mrs kenwigs  mr kenwigs rushed out and was met at the door of the bedroom by a young man with the baby upside down in his arms who came out so quickly that he knocked mr kenwigs down handing the child to his mother he said dont be alarmed its all out its all overthe little girl being tired i suppose fell asleep and set her hair on fire i heard her cries and ran up in time to prevent her setting fire to anything else the child is not hurt i took it off the bed myself and brought it here to convince you  after they had all talked over this last excitement and discussed little lillyvicks deliverer the collector pulled out his watch and announced that it was nearly two oclock and as the poor children had been for some time obliged to keep their little eyes open with their little forefingers the company took leave declaring they had never spent such a delightful evening and that they wished mr and mrs kenwigs had a weddingday once a week     little dorrit   many years ago when people could be put in prison for debt a poor gentleman who was unfortunate enough to lose all his money was brought to the marshalsea prison as there seemed no prospect of being able to pay his debts his wife and their two little children came to live there with him the elder child was a boy of three the younger a little girl of two years old and not long afterwards another little girl was born the three children played in the courtyard and were happy on the whole for they were too young to remember a happier state of things  but the youngest child who had never been outside the prison walls was a thoughtful little creature and wondered what the outside world could be like her great friend the turnkey who was also her godfather became very fond of her and as soon as she could walk and talk he bought a little armchair and stood it by his fire at the lodge and coaxed her with cheap toys to come and sit with him  one day she was sitting in the lodge gazing wistfully up at the sky through the barred window the turnkey after watching her some time said  thinking of the fields aint you  where are they she asked  why theyreover there my dear said the turnkey waving his key vaguely just about there  does anybody open them and shut them are they locked  well said the turnkey discomfited not in general  are they pretty bob she called him bob because he wished it  lovely full of flowers theres buttercups and theres daisies and theres here he hesitated not knowing the names of many flowerstheres dandelions and all manner of games  is it very pleasant to be there bob  prime said the turnkey  was father ever there  hem coughed the turnkey o yes he was there sometimes  is he sorry not to be there now  nnot particular said the turnkey  nor any of the people she asked glancing at the listless crowd within o are you quite sure and certain bob  at this point bob gave in and changed the subject but after this chat the turnkey and little amy would go out on his free sunday afternoons to some meadows or green lanes and she would pick grass and flowers to bring home while he smoked his pipe  when amy was only eight years old her mother died and the poor father was more helpless and brokendown than ever and as fanny was a careless child and edward idle the little one who had the bravest and truest heart was inspired by her love and unselfishness to be the little mother of the forlorn family and struggled to get some little education for herself and her brother and sister she went as often as she could to an evening school outside and managed to get her brother and sister sent to a dayschool at intervals during three or four years at thirteen she could read and keep accounts once amongst the debtors a dancingmaster came in and as fanny had a great desire to learn dancing little amy went timidly to the new prisoner and said  if you please i was born here sir  oh you are the young lady are you said he  yes sir  and what can i do for you  nothing for me sir thank you but if while you stay here you could be so kind as to teach my sister cheap  my child ill teach her for nothing said the dancingmaster  fanny was a very apt pupil and the goodnatured dancingmaster went on giving her lessons even after his release and amy was so emboldened with the success of her attempt that when a milliner came in she went to her on her own behalf and begged her to teach her  i am afraid you are so weak you see the milliner objected  i dont think i am weak maam  and you are so very very little you see the milliner still objected    illustration the blind toy maker    illustration little dorrit and maggie   she has never grown older since  yes i am afraid i am very little indeed returned the child and began to sob so that the milliner was touched and took her in hand and made her a clever workwoman  but the father could not bear the idea that his children should work for their living so they had to keep it all secret fanny became a dancer and lived with a poor old uncle who played the clarionet at the small theatre where fanny was engaged amy or little dorrit as she was generally called her fathers name being dorrit earned small sums by going out to do needlework she got edward into a great many situations but he was an idle careless fellow and always came back to be a burden and care to his poor little sister at last she saved up enough to send him out to canada  god bless you dear tip his name had been shortened to tip dont be too proud to come and see us when you have made your fortune she said  but tip only went as far as liverpool and appeared once more before his poor little second mother in rags and with no shoes  in the end after another trial tip returned telling amy that this time he was one of the regulars  oh dont say you are a prisoner tip dont dont  but he wasand amy nearly broke her heart so with all these cares and worries struggling bravely on little dorrit passed the first twentytwo years of her life then the son of a lady mrs clennem to whose house amy went to do needlework was interested in the pale patient little creature and learning her history resolved to do his best to try and get her father released and to help them all  one day when he was walking home with little dorrit a voice was heard calling little mother little mother and a strange figure came bouncing up to them and fell down scattering her basketful of potatoes on the ground oh maggie said little dorrit what a clumsy child you are  she was about eight and twenty with large bones large features large hands and feet large eyes and no hair little dorrit told mr clennem that maggie was the granddaughter of her old nurse and that her grandmother had been very unkind to her and beat her when maggie was ten years old she had a fever and she has never grown older since  ten years old said maggie but what a nice hospital so comfortable wasnt it such a evnly place such beds there is there such lemonades such oranges such delicious broth and wine such chicking oh aint it a delightful place to stop at  then when she came out her grandmother did not know what to do with her and was very unkind but after some time maggie tried to improve and was very attentive and industrious and now she can earn her own living entirely sir  little dorrit did not say who had taken pains to teach and encourage the poor halfwitted creature but mr clennem guessed from the name little mother and the fondness of the poor creature for amy  thanks to mr clennem a great change took place in the fortunes of the family and not long after this wretched night it was discovered that mr dorrit was owner of a large property and they became very rich  when in his turn mr clennem became a prisoner in the marshalsea little dorrit came to comfort and console him and after many changes of fortune she became his wife and they lived happy ever after     the blind toymaker   caleb plummer and his blind daughter lived alone in a little cracked nutshell of a house they were toymakers and their house was stuck like a toadstool on to the premises of messrs gruff  tackleton the toy merchants for whom they workedthe latter of whom was himself both gruff and tackleton in one  i am saying that caleb and his blind daughter lived here i should say caleb did his daughter lived in an enchanted palace which her fathers love had created for her she did not know that the ceilings were cracked the plaster tumbling down and the wood work rotten that everything was old and ugly and povertystricken about her and that her father was a greyhaired stooping old man and the master for whom they worked a hard and brutal taskmasteroh dear no she fancied a pretty cosy compact little home full of tokens of a kind masters care a smart brisk gallantlooking father and a handsome and noblelooking toy merchant who was an angel of goodness  this was all calebs doings when his blind daughter was a baby he had determined in his great love and pity for her that her deprivation should be turned into a blessing and her life as happy as he could make it and she was happy everything about her she saw with her fathers eyes in the rainbowcoloured light with which it was his care and pleasure to invest it  bertha sat busily at work making a dolls frock whilst caleb bent over the opposite side of the table painting a dolls house  you were out in the rain last night in your beautiful new greatcoat said bertha  yes in my beautiful new greatcoat answered caleb glancing to where a roughly made garment of sackcloth was hung up to dry  how glad i am you bought it father  and of such a tailor quite a fashionable tailor a bright blue cloth with bright buttons its a deal too good a coat for me  too good cried the blind girl stopping to laugh and clap her handsas if anything was too good for my handsome father with his smiling face and black hair and his straight figure  caleb began to sing a rollicking song  what you are singing are you growled a gruff voice as mr tackleton put his head in at the door i cant afford to sing i hope you can afford to work too hardly time for both i should say  you dont see how the master is winking at me whispered caleb in his daughters earsuch a joke pretending to scold you know  the blind girl laughed and nodded and taking mr tackletons reluctant hand kissed it gently what is the idiot doing grumbled the toy merchant pulling his hand roughly away  i am thanking you for the beautiful little tree replied bertha bringing forward a tiny rosetree in blossom which caleb had made her believe was her masters gift though he himself had gone without a meal or two to buy it  heres bedlam broke loose what does the idiot mean snarled mr tackleton and giving caleb some rough orders he departed without the politeness of a farewell  if you could only have seen him winking at me all the time pretending to be so rough to escape thanking exclaimed caleb when the door was shut  now a very sad and curious thing had happened caleb in his love for bertha had so successfully deceived her as to the real character of mr tackleton that she had fallen in love not with her master but with what she imagined him to be and was happy in an innocent belief in his affection for her but one day she accidently heard he was going to be married and could not hide from her father the pain and bewilderment she felt at the news  bertha my dear said caleb at length i have a confession to make to you hear me kindly though i have been cruel to you you cruel to me cried bertha turning her sightless face towards him not meaning it my child and i never suspected it till the other day i have concealed things from you which would have given pain i have invented things to please you and have surrounded you with fancies  but living people are not fancies father you cannot change them  i have done so my child god forgive me bertha the man who is married today is a hard master to us both ugly in his looks and in his nature and hard and heartless as he can be  oh heavens how blind i have been how could you father and i so helpless poor caleb hung his head  answer me father said bertha what is my home like  a poor place bertha a very poor and bare place indeed as little able to keep out wind and weather as my sackcloth coat  and the presents that i took such care of that came at my wish and were so dearly welcome caleb did not answer  i see i understand said bertha and now i am looking at you at my kind loving compassionate father tell me what is he like  an old man my child thin bent greyhaired wornout with hard work and sorrow a weak foolish deceitful old man  the blind girl threw herself on her knees before him and took his grey head in her arms it is my sight it is my sight restored she cried i have been blind but now i see i have never till now truly seen my father father there is not a grey hair on your head that shall be forgotten in my prayers and thanks to heaven  my bertha sobbed caleb and the brisk smart father in the blue coathes gone my child  dearest father no hes not gone nothing is gone i have been happy and contented but i shall be happier and more contented still now that i know what you are i am not blind father any longer     little nell   the house was one of those receptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd corners of the town and in the old dark murky rooms there lived alone together an old man and a childhis grandchild little nell solitary and monotonous as was her life the innocent and cheerful spirit of the child found happiness in all things and through the dim rooms of the old curiosity shop little nell went singing moving with gay and lightsome step  but gradually over the old man to whom she was so tenderly attached there stole a sad change he became thoughtful dejected and wretched he had no sleep or rest but that which he took by day in his easy chair for every night and all night long he was away from home  at last a raging fever seized him and as he lay delirious or insensible through many weeks nell learned that the house which sheltered them was theirs no longer that in the future they would be very poor that they would scarcely have bread to eat  at length the old man began to mend but his mind was weakened as the time drew near when they must leave the house he made no reference to the necessity of finding other shelter but a change came upon him one evening as he and nell sat silently together  let us speak softly nell he said hush for if they knew our purpose they would say that i was mad and take thee from me we will not stop here another day we will travel afoot through the fields and woods and trust ourselves to god in the places where he dwells  the childs heart beat high with hope and confidence to her it seemed that they might beg their way from door to door in happiness so that they were together  when the day began to glimmer they stole out of the house and passing into the street stood still  which way asked the child  the old man looked irresolutely and helplessly at her and shook his head it was plain that she was thenceforth his guide and leader the child felt it but had no doubts or misgivings and putting her hand in his led him gently away  they passed through the long deserted streets until these streets dwindled away and the open country was about them they walked all day and slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to travellers the sun was setting on the second day of their journey when following a path which led to the town where they were to spend the night they fell in with two travelling showmen bound for the races at a neighboring town  they made two long days journey with their new companions the men were rough and strange in their ways but they were kindly too and in the bewildering noise and movement of the racecourse where she tried to sell some little nosegays nell would have clung to them for protection had she not learned that these men suspected that she and the old man had left their home secretly and that they meant to take steps to have them sent back and taken care of separation from her grandfather was the greatest evil nell could dread she seized her opportunity to evade the watchfulness of the two men and hand in hand she and the old man fled away together  that night they reached a little village in a woody hollow the village schoolmaster attracted by the childs sweetness and modesty gave them a lodging for the night nor would he let them leave him until two days more had passed  they journeyed on when the time came that they must wander forth again by pleasant country lanes the afternoon had worn away into a beautiful evening when they came to a caravan drawn up by the road it was a smart little house upon wheels and at the door sat a stout and comfortable lady taking tea the teathings were set out upon a drum covered with a white napkin and there as if at the most convenient table in the world sat this roving lady taking her tea and enjoying the prospect of this stout lady nell ventured to ask how far it was to the neighboring town and the lady noticing that the tired child could hardly repress a tear at hearing that eight weary miles lay still before them not only gave them tea but offered to take them on in the caravan  now this lady of the caravan was the owner of a waxwork show and her name was mrs jarley she offered nell employment in pointing out the figures in the waxwork show to the visitors who came to see it promising in return both board and lodging for the child and her grandfather and some small sum of money this offer nell was thankful to accept and for some time her life and that of the poor vacant fond old man passed quietly and almost happily  one night nell and her grandfather went out to walk a terrible thunderstorm coming on they were forced to take refuge in a small publichouse where men played cards the old man watched them with increasing interest and excitement until his whole appearance underwent a complete change his face was flushed and eager his teeth set he seized nells little purse and in spite of her entreaties joined in the game gambling with such a savage thirst for gain that the distressed and frightened child could almost better have borne to see him dead the night was far advanced before the play came to an end and they were forced to remain where they were until the morning and in the night the child was awakened from her troubled sleep to find a figure in the room it was her grandfather himself his white face pinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally bright counting the money of which his hands were robbing her  evening after evening after that night the old man would steal away not to return until the night was far spent demanding wildly money and at last there came an hour when the child overheard him tempted beyond his feeble powers of resistence undertake to find more money to feed the desperate passion which had laid hold upon his weakness by robbing mrs jarley  that night the child took her grandfather by the hand and led him forth sustained by one ideathat they were flying from disgrace and crime and that her grandfathers preservation must depend solely upon her firmness the old man following as though she had been an angel messenger sent to lead him where she would  they slept in the open air that night and on the following morning some men offered to take them a long distance on their barge these men though they were not unkindly drank and quarrelled among themselves to nells inexpressible terror it rained too heavily and she was wet and cold at last they reached the great city whither the barge was bound and here they wandered up and down being now penniless and watched the faces of those who passed to find among them a ray of encouragement or hope  they laid down that night and the next night too with nothing between them and the sky a penny loaf was all they had had that day and when the third morning came it found the child much weaker yet she made no complaint faint and spiritless as they were the streets were insupportable and the child throughout the remainder of that hard day compelled herself to press on that they might reach the country evening was drawing on they were dragging themselves through the last street seeing a traveller on foot before them she shot on before her grandfather and began in a few faint words to implore the strangers help he turned his head the child uttered a wild shriek and fell senseless at his feet it was the village schoolmaster who had been so kind to them before  the good man took her in his arms and carried her quickly to a little inn hard by where she was tenderly put to bed and where a doctor arrived with all speed the schoolmaster as it appeared was on his way to a new home and when the child had recovered somewhat from her exhaustion it was arranged that she and her grandfather should accompany him to the village whither he was bound and that he should endeavor to find them some humble occupation by which they could subsist  it was a secluded village lying among the quiet country scenes nell loved and here her grandfather being tranquil and at rest a great peace fell upon the spirit of the child often she would steal into the church and sit down among the quiet figures carved upon the tombs what if the spot awakened thoughts of death it would be no pain to sleep here for the time was drawing nearer every day when nell was to rest indeed she never murmured or complained but faded like a light upon a summers evening and died day after day and all day long the old man brokenhearted and with no love or care for anything in life would sit beside her grave with her straw hat and the little basket she had been used to carry waiting till she should come to him again at last they found him lying dead upon the stone and in the church where they had often prayed and mused and lingered hand in hand the child and the old man slept together     little david copperfield   little david copperfield lived with his mother in a pretty house in the village of blunderstone in suffolk his father died before david could remember anything and he had neither brothers nor sisters he was fondly loved by his pretty young mother and their kind good servant peggotty and david was a very happy little fellow they had very few friends and the only relation mrs copperfield talked about was an aunt of davids father a tall and rather terrible old lady from all accounts one visitor a tall dark gentleman david did not like at all and he was rather inclined to be jealous that his mother should be friendly with the stranger  one day peggotty the servant asked david if he would like to go with her on a visit to her brother at yarmouth  is your brother an agreeable man peggotty he enquired  oh what an agreeable man he is cried peggotty then theres the sea and the boats and ships and the fishermen and the beach and am to play with  ham was her nephew david was quite anxious to go when he heard of all these delights but his mother what would she do all alone peggotty told him his mother was going to pay a visit to some friends and would be sure to let him go so all was arranged and they were to start the next day in the carriers cart when they arrived at yarmouth they found ham waiting to meet them he was a great strong fellow six feet high and took david on his back and the box under his arm to carry both to the house david was delighted to find that this house was made of a real big black boat with a door and windows cut in the side and an iron funnel sticking out of the roof for a chimney inside it was very cosy and clean and david had a tiny bedroom in the stern he was very much pleased to find a dear little girl about his own age to play with and soon discovered that she and ham were orphans children of mr peggottys brother and sister whose fathers had been drowned at sea so kind mr peggotty had taken them to live with him david was very happy in this queer house playing on the beach with emly as they called the little girl and told her all about his happy home and she told him how her father had been drowned at sea before she came to live with her uncle david said he thought mr peggotty must be a very good man  good said emly if ever i was to be a lady id give him a skyblue coat with diamond buttons nankeen trousers a red velvet waistcoat a cocked hat a large gold watch a silver pipe and a box of money  david was quite sorry to leave these kind people and his dear little companion but still he was glad to think he should get back to his own dear mamma when he reached home however he found a great change his mother was married to the dark man david did not like whose name was mr murdstone and he was a stern hard man who had no love for little david and did not allow his mother to pet and indulge him as she had done before mr murdstones sister came to live with them and as she was even more difficult to please than her brother and disliked boys davids life was no longer a happy one he had always had lessons with his mother and as she was patient and gentle he had enjoyed learning to read but now he had a great many very hard lessons to do and was so frightened and shy when mr and miss murdstone were in the room that he did not get on at all well and was continually in disgrace his only pleasure was to go up into the little room at the top of the house where he had found a number of books that had belonged to his own father and he would sit and read robinson crusoe and many tales of travels and adventures  but one day he got into sad trouble over his lessons and mr murdstone was very angry and took him away from his mother and beat him with a cane david had never been beaten in his life before and was so maddened by pain and rage that he bit mr murdstones hand now indeed he had done something to deserve the punishment and mr murdstone in a fury beat him savagely and left him sobbing and crying on the floor david was kept locked up in his room for some days seeing no one but miss murdstone who brought him his food at last one night he heard his name whispered at the key hole  is that you peggotty he asked groping his way to the door  yes my precious davy be as soft as a mouse or the cat will hear us  david understood she meant miss murdstone whose room was quite near hows mamma peggotty dear is she very angry with me he whispered  nonot very she said  what is going to be done with me dear peggotty do you know asked poor david who had been wondering all these long lonely days  schoolnear london  when peggotty  tomorrow answered peggotty  shant i see mamma  yesmorning she said and went on to promise david she would always love him and take the greatest care of his dear mamma and write him every week  the next morning david saw his mother very pale and with red eyes he ran to her arms and begged her to forgive him  oh davy she said that you should hurt anyone i love i forgive you davy but it grieves me so that you should have such bad passions in your heart try to be better pray to be better  david was very unhappy that his mother should think him so wicked and though she kissed him and said i forgive you my dear boy god bless you he cried so bitterly when he was on his way in the carriers cart that his pocket handkerchief had to be spread out on the horses back to dry  after they had gone a little way the cart stopped and peggotty came running up with a parcel of cakes and a purse for david after giving him a good hug she ran off  davy found three bright shillings in the purse and two halfcrowns wrapped in paper on which was written in his mothers handfor davy with my love  davy shared his cakes with the carrier who asked if peggotty made them and david told him yes she did all their cooking the carrier looked thoughtful and then asked david if he would send a message to peggotty from him david agreed and the message was barkis is willing while david was waiting for the coach at yarmouth he wrote to peggotty  my dear peggottyi have come here safe barkis is willing my love to mammayours affectionately  p she says he particularly wanted you to know barkis is willing  at yarmouth he found dinner was ordered for him and felt very shy at having a table all to himself and very much alarmed when the waiter told him he had seen a gentleman fall down dead after drinking some of their beer david said he would have some water and was quite grateful to the waiter for drinking the ale that had been ordered for him for fear the people of the hotel should be offended he also helped david to eat his dinner and accepted one of his bright shillings  when they got to salem house as the school was called david found that he had been sent before the holidays were over as a punishment and was also to wear a placard on his back on which was writtentake care of him he bites this made david miserable and he dreaded the return of the boys  some of the boys teased david by pretending he was a dog calling him towser and patting and stroking him but on the whole it was not so bad as david had expected the head boy steerforth promised to take care of him and david loved him dearly and thought him a great hero steerforth took a great fancy to the pretty brighteyed little fellow and david became a favorite with all the boys by telling them all he could remember of the tales he had read  one day david had a visit from mr peggotty and ham who had brought two enormous lobsters a huge crab and a large canvas bag of shrimps as they remembered he was partial to a relish with his meals  david was proud to introduce his friend steerforth to these kind simple friends and told them how good steerforth was to him and the relish was much appreciated by the boys at supper that night  when he got home for the holidays david found he had a little baby brother and his mother and peggotty were very much pleased to see him again mr and miss murdstone were out and david sat with his mother and peggotty and told them all about his school and steerforth and took the little baby in his arms and nursed it lovingly but when the murdstones came back they showed plainly they disliked him and thought him in the way and scolded him and would not allow him to touch the baby or even to sit with peggotty in the kitchen so he was not sorry when the time came for him to go back to school except for leaving his dear mamma and the baby  about two months after he had been back at school he was sent for one day and told that his dear mamma had died the wife of the headmaster was very kind and gentle to the desolate little boy and the boys were very sorry for him  david went home the next day and heard that the dear baby had died too peggotty received him with great tenderness and told him about his mothers illness and how she had sent a loving message  tell my dearest boy that his mother as she lay here blessed him not once but a thousand times and she had prayed to god to protect and keep her fatherless boy  mr murdstone did not take any notice of poor little david nor had miss murdstone a word of kindness for the orphan peggotty was to leave in a month and to their great joy david was allowed to go with her on a visit to mr peggotty on their way david found out that the mysterious message he had given to peggotty meant that barkis wanted to marry her and peggotty had consented everyone in mr peggottys cottage was pleased to see david and did their best to comfort him little emly was at school when he arrived and he went out to meet her but when he saw her coming along her blue eyes bluer and her bright face prettier than ever he pretended not to know her and was passing by when emly laughed and ran away so of course he was obliged to run and catch her and try to kiss her but she would not let him saying she was not a baby now but she was kind to him all the same and when they spoke about the loss of his dear mother david saw that her eyes were full of tears  during this visit peggotty was married to mr barkis and had a nice little house of her own and davy spent the night before he was to return home in a little room in the roof  young or old davy dear so long as i have this house over my head said peggotty you shall find it as if i expected you here directly every minute i shall keep it as i used to keep your old little room my darling and if you was to go to china you might think of its being kept just the same all the time you were away  david felt how good and true a friend she was and thanked her as well as he could for they had brought him to the gate of his home and peggotty had him clasped in her arms  how utterly wretched and forlorn he felt he found he was not to go back to school any more and wandered about sad and solitary neglected and uncared for peggottys weekly visits were his only comfort no one took any pains with him and he had no friends near who could help him  at last one day after some weary months had passed mr murdstone told him he was to go to london and earn his own living there was a place for him at murdstone  grinbys a firm in the wine trade his lodging and clothes would be provided for him by his stepfather and he would earn enough for his food and pocket money the next day david was sent up to london with the manager dressed in a shabby little white hat with black crape round it for his mother a black jacket and hard stiff corduroy trousers a little fellow of ten years old to fight his own battles in the world  his place he found was one of the lowest with boys of no education and in quite an inferior station to himselfhis duties were to wash bottles stick on labels and so on david was utterly miserable at being degraded in this way and shed bitter tears as he feared he would forget all he had learnt at school his lodging one bare little room was in the house of some people named micawber shiftless careless goodnatured people who were always in debt and difficulties david felt great pity for their misfortunes and did what he could to help poor mrs micawber to sell her books and other little things she could spare to buy food for herself her husband and their four children if he had not been a very innocentminded good little boy he might easily have fallen into bad ways at this time but god took care of the orphan boy and kept him from harm  the troubles of the micawbers increased more and more until at last they were obliged to leave london the last sunday the micawbers were in town david dined with them after he had seen them off the next morning by the coach he wrote to peggotty to ask her if she knew where his aunt miss betsy trotwood lived and to borrow half a guinea for he had resolved to run away from murdstone  grinbys and go to his aunt and tell her his story peggotty wrote enclosing the halfguinea and saying she only knew miss trotwood lived near dover but whether in that place itself or at folkestone sandgate or hythe she could not tell hearing that all these places were close together david made up his mind to start as he had received his weeks wages in advance he waited till the following saturday thinking it would not be honest to go before he went out to look for some one to carry his box to the coach office and unfortunately employed a wicked young man who not only ran off with his box but robbed him of his halfguinea leaving poor david in dire distress in despair he started off to walk to dover and was forced to sell his waistcoat to buy some bread the first night he found his way to his old school at blackheath and slept on a haystack close by feeling some comfort in the thought of the boys being near he knew steerforth had left or he would have tried to see him  on he trudged the next day and sold his jacket for one shilling and fourpence he was afraid to buy anything but bread or to spend any money on a bed or a shelter for the night after six days he arrived at dover ragged dusty and halfdead with hunger and fatigue but here at first he could get no tidings of his aunt and in despair was going to try some of the other places peggotty had mentioned when the driver of a fly dropped his horsecloth and as david was handing it up to him he saw something kind in the mans face that encouraged him to ask once more if he knew where miss trotwood lived    illustration little david copperfield  the man directed him towards some houses on the heights and thither david toiled a forlorn little creature without a jacket or waistcoat his white hat crushed out of shape his shoes worn out his shirt and trousers torn and stained his pretty curly hair tangled his face and hands sunburnt and covered with dust lifting his big wistful eyes to one of the windows above he saw a pleasant faced gentleman with grey hair who nodded at him several times then shook his head and went away david was just turning away to think what he should do when a tall erect elderly lady with a gardening apron on and a knife in her hand came out of the house and began to dig up a root in the garden  go away she cried go away no boys here  but david felt desperate going in softly he stood beside her and touched her with his finger and said timidly if you please maam and when she looked up he went on  please aunt i am your nephew  oh lord she exclaimed in astonishment and sat flat down on the path staring at him while he went on  i am david copperfield of blunderstone in suffolk where you came the night i was born and saw my dear mamma i have been unhappy since she died i have been slighted and taught nothing and thrown upon myself and put to work not fit for me it made me run away to you i was robbed at first starting out and have walked all the way and have never slept in a bed since i began the journey here he broke into a passion of crying and his aunt jumped up and took him into the house where she put him on the sofa and sent the servant to ask mr dick to come down the gentleman whom david had seen at the window came in and was told who the ragged little object on the sofa was  now here you see young david copperfield and the question is what shall i do with him  do with him answered mr dick then after some consideration and looking at david he said well if i was you i would wash him  david knelt down to say his prayers that night in a pleasant room facing the sea and as he lay in the clean snowwhite bed he prayed he might never be homeless again and might never forget the homeless  the next morning his aunt told him she had written to mr murdstone and at last mr and miss murdstone arrived  mr murdstone told miss betsy that david was a very bad stubborn violenttempered boy whom he had tried to improve but could not succeed if miss trotwood chose to protect and encourage him now she must do it always for he had come to fetch him away  are you ready to go david asked his aunt  but david answered no and begged and prayed her for his fathers sake to befriend and protect him for neither mr nor miss murdstone had ever liked him or been kind to him  mr dick said miss trotwood what shall i do with this child  mr dick considered have him measured for a suit of clothes directly  mr dick said miss trotwood your common sense is invaluable  then she pulled david towards her and said to mr murdstone you can go when you like ill take my chance with the boy if hes all you say he is i can at least do as much for him as you have done but i dont believe a word of it  some clothes were bought for him that same day and marked trotwood copperfield for his aunt wished to call him by her name  now david felt his troubles were over and he began quite a new life well cared for and kindly treated he was sent to a very nice school in canterbury where his aunt left him with these words which david never forgot  trot be a credit to yourself to me and mr dick and heaven be with you never be mean in anything never be false never be cruel avoid these three vices trot and i shall always be hopeful of you  david did his best to show his gratitude to his dear aunt by studying hard and trying to be all she could wish  when you are older you can read how he grew up to be a good clever man and met again all his old friends and made many new ones     jenny wren   one day a great many years ago a gentleman ran up the steps of a tall house in the neighborhood of st mary axe  the gentleman knocked and rang several times before any one came but at last an old man opened the door what were you up to that you did not hear me said mr fledgeby irritably  i was taking the air at the top of the house sir said the old man meekly it being a holiday what might you please to want sir  humph holiday indeed grumbled his master who was a toy merchant amongst other things he then seated himself and gave the old mana jew and riah by namedirections about the dressing of some dolls and as he rose to go exclaimed  by the bye how do you take the air do you stick your head out of a chimneypot  no sir i have made a little garden on the roof  lets look at it said mr fledgeby  sir i have company there returned riah hesitating but will you please come up and see them  mr fledgeby nodded and the old man led the way up flight after flight of stairs till they arrived at the housetop seated on a carpet and leaning against a chimneystack were two girls bending over books some creepers were trained round the chimneypots and evergreens were placed round the roof and a few more books a basket of gaily colored scraps and bits of tinsel lay near one of the girls rose on seeing that riah had brought a visitor but the other remarked im the person of the house downstairs but i cant get up whoever you are because my back is bad and my legs are queer  this is my master said riah speaking to the two girls and this he added turning to mr fledgeby is miss jenny wren she lives in this house and is a clever little dressmaker for little people her friend lizzie continued riah introducing the second girl they are good girls both and as busy as they are good in spare moments they come up here and take to book learning  humph said mr fledgeby looking round humph he was so much surprised that apparently he couldnt get beyond that word  lizzie the elder of these two girls was strong and handsome but the little jenny wren whom she so loved and protected was small and deformed though she had a beautiful little face and the longest and loveliest golden hair in the world which fell about her like a cloak of shining curls as though to hide the poor little misshapen figure  the jew riah as well as lizzie was always kind and gentle to jenny wren who called him godfather she had a father who shared her poor little rooms whom she called her child for he was a bad drunken disreputable old man and the poor girl had to care for him and earn money to keep them both sometimes the two girls jenny helping herself along with a crutch would go and walk about the fashionable streets as they walked along jenny would tell her friend of the fancies she had when sitting alone at her work i imagine birds till i can hear them sing she said one day and flowers till i can smell them and oh the beautiful children that come to me in the early mornings they are quite different to other children not like me never cold or anxious or tired or hungry never any pain they come in numbers in long bright slanting rows all dressed in white with shiny heads who is this in pain they say and they sweep around and about me take me up in their arms and i feel so light and all the pain goes i know they are coming a long way off by hearing them say who is this in pain and i answer oh my blessed children its poor me have pity on me and take me up and then the pain will go    illustration jennie wren   the beautiful children that come to me  lizzie sat stroking and brushing the beautiful hair when they were at home again and as she kissed her goodnight a miserable old man stumbled into the room hows my jenny wren best of children he mumbled as he shuffled unsteadily towards her but jenny pointed her small finger towards him exclaiminggo along with you you bad wicked old child you troublesome wicked old thing i know where you have been aint you ashamed of yourself you disgraceful boy yes my dear yes stammered the tipsy old father tumbling into a corner one day when jenny was on her way home with riah they came on a small crowd of people a tipsy man had been knocked down and badly hurtlet us see what it is said jennie the next moment she exclaimedoh gentlemengentlemen he is my child he belongs to me my poor bad old child  your childbelongs to you repeated the man who was about to lift the helpless figure on to a stretcher aye its old dollstipsy old dolls cried some one in the crowd for it was by this name that they knew the old man  hes her father sir said riah in a low tone to the doctor who was now bending over the stretcher  so much the worse answered the doctor for the man is dead  yes mr dolls was dead and many were the dresses which the weary fingers of the sorrowful little worker must make in order to pay for his humble funeral and buy a black frock for herself often the tears rolled down on to her work my poor child she said to riah my poor old child and to think i scolded him so  you were always a good brave patient girl returned riah always good and patient however tired  and so the poor little person of the house was left alone but for the faithful affection of the kind jew and her friend lizzie her room grew pretty comfortable for she was in great request in her profession as she called it and there was now no one to spend and waste her earnings but nothing could make her life otherwise than a suffering one till the happy morning when her childangels visited her for the last time and carried her away to the land where all such pain as hers is healed for evermore     pips adventure   all that little philip pirrip usually called pip knew about his father and mother and five little brothers was from seeing their tombstones in the churchyard he was taken care of by his sister who was twenty years older than himself she had married a blacksmith named joe gargery a kind good man while she unfortunately was a hard stern woman and treated her little brother and her amiable husband with great harshness they lived in a marshy part of the country about twenty miles from the sea  one cold raw day towards evening when pip was about six years old he wandered into the churchyard and trying to make out what he could of the inscriptions on his family tombstones and the darkness coming on he felt very lonely and frightened and began to cry  hold your noise cried a terrible voice and a man started up from among the graves close to him keep still you little imp or ill cut your throat  he was a dreadful looking man dressed in coarse grey cloth with a great iron on his leg wet muddy and miserable his teeth chattered in his head as he seized pip by the chin  oh dont cut my throat sir cried pip in terror  tell us your name said the man quick  pip sir  once more said the man staring at him give it mouth  pip pip sir  show us where you live said the man point out the place  pip showed him the village about a mile or more from the church  the man looked at him for a moment and then turned him upside down and emptied his pockets he found nothing in them but a piece of bread which he ate ravenously  now lookee here said the man wheres your mother  there sir said pip  at this the man started to run away but stopped and looked over his shoulder  there sir explained pip showing him the tombstone  oh and is that your father along of your mother  yes sir said pip  ha muttered the man then who dye live withsupposin youre kindly let to live which i hant made up my mind about  my sister sir mrs joe gargery wife of joe gargery the blacksmith sir  blacksmith eh said the man and looked down at his leg then he seized the trembling little boy by both arms and glaring down at him he said  now lookee here the question being whether youre to be let to liveyou know what a file is  yes sir  and you know what wittles is  yes sir  you get me a file and you get me wittlesyou bring em both to me all this time he was tilting poor pip backwards till he was dreadfully frightened and giddy  you bring me tomorrow morning early that file and them wittlesyou do it and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me or any person sumever and you shall be let to live then he let him go sayingyou remember what youve undertook and you get home  pip ran home without stopping joe was sitting in the chimney corner and told him mrs joe had been out to look for him and taken tickler with her tickler was a cane and pip was rather depressed by this piece of news  mrs joe came in almost directly and after having given pip a taste of tickler she sat down to prepare the tea and cutting a huge slice of bread and butter she gave half of it to joe and half to pip pip managed after some time to slip his down the leg of his trousers and joe thinking he had swallowed it was dreadfully alarmed and begged him not to bolt his food like that pip old chap youll do yourself a mischiefitll stick somewhere you cant have chewed it pip you know pip you and me is always friends and id be the last to tell upon you at any time but such asuch a most uncommon bolt as that    illustration pip and the convict   half dead with cold and hunger  been bolting his food has he cried mrs joe  you know old chap said joe i bolted myself when i was your agefrequentand as a boy ive been among many bolters but i never see your bolting equal yet pip and its a mercy you aint bolted dead  poor pip passed a wretched night thinking of the dreadful promise he had made and as soon as it was beginning to get light outside he got up and crept downstairs  as quickly as he could he took some bread some cheese about half a jar of mincemeat he tied up in a handkerchief with the slice of bread and butter some brandy from a stone bottle a meat bone with very little on it and a pork pie which he found on an upper shelf then he got a file from among joes tools and ran for the marshes  pip found the man waiting for him half dead with cold and hunger and he ate the food in such a ravenous way that pip in spite of his terror was quite pitiful over him and said i am glad you enjoy it  thankee my boy i do  pip watched him trying to file the iron off his leg and then being afraid of stopping longer away from home he ran off  pip passed a wretched morning expecting every moment that the disappearance of the pie would be found out but mrs joe was too much taken up with preparing the dinner for they were expecting visitors  just at the end of the dinner pip thought his time had come to be found out for his sister said graciously to her guests  you must taste a most delightful and delicious present i have had its a pie a savory pork pie  pip could bear it no longer and ran for the door and there ran head foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to him sayinghere you are look sharp come on but they had not come for him they only wanted joe to mend the handcuffs for they were on the search for two convicts who had escaped and were somewhere hid in the marshes this turned the attention of mrs joe from the disappearance of the pie without which she had come back in great astonishment when the handcuffs were mended the soldiers went off accompanied by joe and one of the visitors and joe took pip and carried him on his back  pip whispered i hope joe we shant find them and joe answered id give a shilling if they had cut and run pip  but the soldiers soon caught them and one was pips miserable acquaintance and once when the man looked at pip the child shook his head to try and let him know he had said nothing  but the convict without looking at anyone told the sergeant he wanted to say something to prevent other people being under suspicion and said he had taken some wittles from the blacksmiths it was some broken wittles thats what it was and a dram of liquor and a pie  have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith enquired the sergeant  my wife did at the very moment when you came in  so said the convict looking at joe youre the blacksmith are you then im sorry to say ive eat your pie  god knows youre welcome to it said joe we dont know what you have done but we wouldnt have you starved to death for it poor miserable fellow creature would us pip  then the boat came and the convicts were taken back to prison and joe carried pip home  some years after some mysterious friend sent money for pip to be educated and brought up as a gentleman but it was only when pip was quite grown up that he discovered this mysterious friend was the wretched convict who had frightened him so dreadfully that cold dark christmas eve
