29383060	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    peters pence   sailormen dont bother much about their relations as a rule said the nightwatchman sometimes because a railwayticket costs as much as a barrel o beer and they aint got the money for both and sometimes because most relations run away with the idea that a sailorman has been knocking about arf over the world just to bring them ome presents  then agin some relations are partikler about appearances and they dont like it if a chap dont wear a collar and tidy imself up  dress is everything nowadays put me in a top at and a tailcoat with a twopenny smoke stuck in my mouth and who would know the difference between me and a lord  put a bishop in my clothes and youd ask im to ave a arfpint as soon as you would mesooner praps  illustration put a bishop in my clothes and youd ask im to ave a arfpint as soon as you would me  talking of relations reminds me of peter russets uncle  its some years ago now and peter and old sam

was brought to peter wot had been waiting for im at the office  he didnt like opening it at fust  the last letter he had ad kept im hiding indoors for a week and then made him ship a fortnight afore e had meant to  he stood turning it over and over and at last arter sam wot was always a curious man ad told im that if he didnt open it hed do it for im he tore it open and read it  its from my old

start  i bleeve so ses peter in a offhand way  i dont spose e lives on air  any wives or children ses sam  no ses peter  he ad a wife but she died  then you have im peter ses sam wot was always

throw away a chance  if e was my uncle i should pretend to be a teetotaller while e was here just to please im  and when you felt like a drink peter ses ginger me and sam would look arter im while you slipped off to get it  he could ave the room below us ses sam  it is empty  peter gave a sniff  wot about you and ginger  he ses  wot about us ses sam and ginger both together  why youd ave to be teetotallers too ses peter  woes the good o me pretending to be steady if e sees ive got pals like you  sam scratched his ead agin ever so long and at last he ses well mate he ses drink dont trouble me nor ginger  we can do without it as far as that goes and we must all take it in turns to keep the old gentleman busy while the others go and get wot they want  youd better go and take the room downstairs for im afore it goes  peter looked at im in surprise but that was sam all over  the idea o knowing a man with money was too much for im and he sat there giving good advice to peter about is behavior until peter didnt know whether it was is uncle or sams  owever he took the room and wrote the letter and next arternoon at three oclock mr goodman came in a four wheel cab with a big bag and a fat umbrella  a short stiffishbuilt man of about sixty he was with is top lip shaved and a bit o short gray beard  he ad on a top at and a tailcoat black kid gloves and a little black bow and he didnt answer the cabman back a single word  illustration mr goodman came in a fourwheel cab with a big bag and a fat umbrella  he seemed quite pleased to see peter and by and by sam who was bursting with curiosity came downstairs to ask peter to lend im a bootlace and was interduced  then ginger came down to look for sam and in a few minutes they was all talking as comfortable as possible  i aint seen peter for twenty years ses mr goodmantwenty long years  sam shook his ead and looked at the floor  i happened to go and see peters sistermy niece polly ses mr goodman and she told me the name of is ship  it was quite by chance because she told me it was the fust letter she had ad from him in seven years  i didnt think it was so long as that ses peter  time passes so quick  his uncle nodded  ah so it does e ses  its all the same whether we spend it on the foaming ocean or pass our little lives ashore  afore we can turn round in a manner o speaking it as gorn  the main thing ses peter in a good voice is to pass it properly  then it dont matter ses ginger  so it dont ses sam very serious  i held im in my arms when e was a baby ses mr goodman looking at peter  fond o children ses sam  mr goodman nodded  fond of everybody he ses  thats ow peter is ses ginger specially young  peter russet and sam both turned and looked at im very sharp  children ses ginger remembering imself and teetotallers  i spose it is being a teetotaller imself  is peter a teetotaller ses mr goodman  id no idea of it  wot a joyful thing  it was your example wot put it into his ead fust i bleeve ses sam looking at peter for im to notice ow clever he was  and then sam and ginger dick being teetotallers too ses peter we all naturallike keep together  mr goodman said they was wise men and arter a little more talk he said ow would it be if they went out and saw a little bit of the great wicked city  they all said they would and ginger got quite excited about it until he found that it meant london  they got on a bus at aldgate and fust of all they went to the british museum and when mr goodman was tired o thatand long arter the others wasthey went into a place and ad a nice strong cup of tea and a piece o cake each  when they come out o there they all walked about looking at the shops until they was tired out and arter wot mr goodman said was a very improving evening they all went ome  sam and ginger went ome just for the look o the thing and arter waiting a few minutes in their room they crept downstairs agin to spend wot was left of the evening  they went down as quiet as mice but for all that just as they was passing mr goodmans room the door opened and peter in a polite voice asked em to step inside  we was just thinking youd be dull up there all alone he ses  sam lost is presence o mind and afore he knew wot e was doing im and ginger ad walked in and sat down  they sat there for over an hour and a arf talking and then sam with a look at ginger said they must be going because he ad got to call for a pair o boots he ad left to be mended  why sam wot are you thinking of ses peter who didnt want anybody to ave wot he couldnt  why the shops shut  i dont think so ses sam glaring at im  anyway we can go and see  peter said hed go with im and just as they got to the door mr goodman said hed go too  o course the shops was shut and arter mr goodman ad stood on tower hill admiring the tower by moonlight till sam felt ready to drop they all walked back  three times sams bootlace come undone but as the ethers all stopped too to see im do it up it didnt do im much good  wot with temper and dryness e could ardly bid peter goodnight  sam and ginger ad something the next morning but morning aint the time for it and arter they had ad dinner mr goodman asked em to go to the zoological gardens with im  he paid for them all and he ad a lot to say about kindness to animals and ow you could do anything with em amost by kindness  he walked about the place talking like a book and when a fat monkey wot was pretending to be asleep got a bit o sams whisker he said it was ony instink and the animal had no wish to do im arm  very likely thought it was doing you a kindness sam ses ginger  mr goodman said it was very likely afore sam could speak and arter walking about and looking at the other things they come out and ad a nice strong ot cup o tea same as they ad the day before and then walked about not knowing what to do with themselves  sam got tired of it fust and catching gingers eye said he thought it was time to get ome in case too much enjoyment wasnt good for em  his idea was to get off with ginger and make a night of it and when e found peter and his uncle was coming too he began to think that things was looking serious  i dont want to spile your evening he says very perlite  i must get ome to mend a pair o trowsis o mine but theres no need for you to come  ill come and watch you ses peters uncle  and then im going off to bed early ses sam  me too ses ginger and peter said he could hardly keep is eyes open  they got on a bus and as sam was about to foller ginger and peter on top mr goodman took hold of im by the arm and said theyd go inside he paid two penny fares and while sam was wondering ow to tell im that it would be threepence each the bus stopped to take up a passenger and he got up and moved to the door  theyve gone up there he ses pointing  afore sam could stop im he got off and sam full o surprise got off too and follered im on to the pavement  whos gone up there  he ses as the bus went on agin  peter and mr ginger dick ses mr goodman  but dont you trouble you go ome and mend your trowsis  but theyre on the bus ses sam staring  dick and peter i mean  mr goodman shook his ead  they got off  didnt you see em  he ses  no ses sam ill swear they didnt  well its my mistake i spose ses peters uncle  but you get off home im not tired yet and ill walk  sam said e wasnt very tired and he walked along wondering whether mr goodman was quite right in his ead  for one thing e seemed upset about something or other and kept taking little peeps at im in a way he couldnt understand at all  it was nice tea we ad this arternoon ses mr goodman at last  delicious ses sam  trust a teetotaller for knowing good tea ses mr goodman  i expect peter enjoyed it  i spose e is a very strict teetotaller  strict aint the word for it ses sam trying to do is duty by peter we all are  thats right ses mr goodman and he pushed his at back and looked at sam very serious  they walked on a bit further and then peters uncle stopped sudden just as they was passing a large publicouse and looked at sam  i dont want peter to know cos it might alarm im he ses but ive come over a bit faint  ill go in ere for arf a minnit and sit down youd better wait outside  ill come in with you in case you want help ses sam  i dont mind wot people think  mr goodman tried to persuade im not to but it was all no good and at last e walked in and sat down on a tall stool that stood agin the bar and put his hand to his ead  i spose we shall ave to ave something he ses in a whisper to sam we cant expect to come in and sit down for nothing  whatll you take  sam looked at im but he might just as well ha looked at a brass door knob  iiill ave a small gingerbeer he ses at last a very small one  one small ginger ses mr goodman to the barmaid and one special scotch  sam could ardly believe his ears and he stood there oldin his glass o gingerbeer and watching peters teetotal uncle drink whiskey and thought e must be dreaming  i dessay it seems very shocking to you ses mr goodman putting down is glass and dryin is lips on each other but i find it useful for these attacks  ii spose the flavors very nasty ses sam taking a sip at is gingerbeer  not exactly wot you could call nasty ses mr goodman though i dessay it would seem so to you  i dont suppose you could swallow it  i dont spose i could ses sam but ive a good mind to ave a try if its good for one teetotaller i dont see why it should hurt another  mr goodman looked at im very hard and then he ordered a whiskey and stood watching while sam arter pretending for a minnit to look at it as though e didnt know wot to do with it took a sip and let it roll round is mouth  well  ses mr goodman looking at im anxiouslike  it aint so orrid as i ad fancied ses sam lapping up the rest very gentle  illustration it aint so orrid as i ad fancied  ses sam  ave you ad enough to do you all the good it ought to  mr goodman said that it was no good arf doing a thing and praps he ad better ave one more and arter sam ad paid for the next two they went out arminarm  ow cheerful everybody looks ses mr goodman smiling  theyre going to amuse theirselves i expect ses sam musicalls and suchlike  mr goodman shook his ead at em  musicalls aint so bad as some people try to make out ses sam  look ere i took some drink to see what the flavor was like suppose you go to a musicall to see wot thats like  it seems ony fair ses peters uncle considering  it is fair ses sam and twenty minutes arterwards they was sitting in a musicall drinking each others ealths and listening to the songs mr goodman with a big cigar in is mouth and his at cocked over one eye and sam beating time to the music with is pipe  ow do you like it  he ses  mr goodman didnt answer im because e was joining in the chorus with one side of is mouth and keeping is cigar alight with the other  he just nodded at im but e looked so appy that sam felt it was a pleasure to sit there and look at im  i wonder wot peter and ginger is doin he ses when the song was finished  i dont know ses mr goodman and wots more i dont care  if id ad any idea that peter was like wot he is i should never ave wrote to im  i cant think ow you can stand im  he aint so bad ses sam wondering whether he ought to tell im arf of wot peter really was like  bad ses mr goodman  i come up to london for a olidaya change mind youand i thought peter and me was going to ave a good time instead o that he goes about with a face as long as a fiddle  he dont drink e dont go to places of amusementinnercent places of amusement and is idea of enjoying life is to go walking about the streets and drinking cups o tea  we must try and alter im ses sam arter doing a bit o thinking  certainly not ses mr goodman laying his and on sams knee  far be it from me to interfere with a fellercreatures ideas o wots right besides he might get writing to is sister agin and she might tell my wife  but peter said she was dead ses sam very puzzled  i married agin ses peters uncle in a whisper cos people was telling im to keep quiet a tartara perfect tartar  shes in a orsepittle at present else i shouldnt be ere  and i shouldnt ha been able to come if i adnt found five pounds wot shed hid in a matchbox up the chimbley  but wotll you do when she finds it out ses sam opening is eyes  im going to ave the house cleaned and the chimbleys swept to welcome her ome ses mr goodman taking a sip o whiskey  itll be a little surprise for her  they stayed till it was over and on the bus he gave sam some strong peppermint lozenges wot e always carried about with im and took some imself  he said e found em helpful  what are we going to tell peter and ginger ses sam as they got near the ouse  tell em  ses mr goodman  tell em the truth  how we follered em when they got off the bus and ave been looking for em ever since  im not going to ave my oliday spoilt by a teetotal nevvy i can tell you  he started on peter wot was sitting on his bed with ginger waiting for them the moment he got inside and all ginger and peter could say didnt make any difference  mr small see you as plain as what i did he ses  plainer ses sam  but i tell you we come straight ome ses ginger and weve been waiting for you ere ever since  mr goodman shook his ead at im  say no more about it he ses in a kind voice  i dessay its rather tiresome for young men to go about with two old ones and in future if you and peter keep together me and my friend mr small will do the same  sam shook ands with im and though peter tried his ardest to make im alter his mind it was no good  his uncle patted im on the shoulder and said theyd try it for a few days at any rate and ginger wot thought it was a very good idea backed im up  everybody seemed pleased with the idea except peter russet but arter sam ad told im in private wot a high opinion is uncle ad got of im and ow well off he was e gave way  they all enjoyed the next evening and sam and mr goodman got on together like twin brothers  they went to a place of amusement every night and the ony unpleasantness that happened was when peters uncle knocked a chemists shop up at a quarterpast twelve one night to buy a pennorth o peppermint lozenges  they ad four of the appiest evenings together that sam ad ever known and mr goodman would ave been just as appy too if it hadnt ha been for the thoughts o that five pounds  the more e thought of it the more unlikely it seemed that is wife would blame it on to the sweep and one night he took the matchbox out of is pocket and shook his ead over it till sam felt quite sorry for im  dont take up your troubles afore they come he ses  orsepittles are dangerous places  mr goodman cheered up a bit at that but he got miserable agin the next night because is money was getting low and he wanted another week in london  ive got seven shillings and fourpence and two stamps left he ses where its all gone to i cant think  dont you worry about that ses sam  ive got a pound or two left yet  no i aint going to be a burden on you ses mr goodman but another week i must ave so i must get the money somehow  peter cant spend much the way he goes on  sam gave a little cough  ill get a pound or two out of im ses mr goodman  sam coughed agin  wont he think it rather funny  he ses arter a bit  not if its managed properly ses mr goodman thinking ard  ill tell you ow well do it  tomorrow morning while we are eating of our breakfast you ask me to lend you a pound or two  sam what ad just taken up is glass for a drink put it down agin and stared at im  but i dont want no money he ses and besides you avent got any  you do as i tell you ses mr goodman and when youve got it you hand it over to me see  ask me to lend you five pounds  sam thought as ow the whiskey ad got to mr goodmans ead at last owever to pacify im he promised to do wot e was told and next morning when they was all at breakfast he looks over and catches mr goodmans eye  i wonder if i might be so bold as to ask a favor of you  he ses  certainly ses peters uncle and glad i shall be to oblige you there is no man ive got a greater respect for  thankee ses sam  the fact is ive run a bit short owing to paying a man some money i owed im  if you could lend me five pounds i couldnt thank you enough  mr goodman put down is knife and fork and wrinkled up is forehead  im very sorry he ses feeling in is pockets do you want it today  yes i should like it ses sam  its most annoying ses mr goodman but i was so afraid o pickpockets that i didnt bring much away with me  if you could wait till the day arter tomorrow when my money is sent to me you can ave ten if you like  youre very kind ses sam but that ud be too late for me  i must try and get it somewhere else  peter and ginger went on eating their breakfast but every time peter looked up he caught is uncle looking at im in such a surprised and disappointed sort o way that e didnt like the look of it at all  i could just do it for a couple o days sam he ses at last but itll leave me very short  thats right ses his uncle smiling  my nevvy peter russet will lend it to you mr small of is own free will  he as offered afore he was asked and thats the proper way to do it in my opinion  he reached acrost the table and shook ands with peter and said that generosity ran in their family and something seemed to tell im as peter wouldnt lose by it  everybody seemed pleased with each other and arter ginger dick and peter ad gone out mr goodman took the five pounds off of old sam and stowed em away very careful in the matchbox  illustration he reached acrost the table and shook ands with peter  its nice to ave money agin he ses  theres enough for a weeks enjoyment here  yes ses sam slowlike but wot i want to know is wot about the day arter tomorrow when peter expects is money  mr goodman patted im on the shoulder  dont you worry about peters troubles he ses  i know exactly wot to do its all planned out  now im going to ave a lay down for an houri didnt get much sleep last nightand if youll call me at twelve oclock well go somewhere  knock loud  he patted im on the shoulder agin and sam arter fidgeting about a bit went out  the last time he ever see peters uncle he was laying on the bed with is eyes shut smiling in his sleep  and peter russet didnt see sam for eighteen months
