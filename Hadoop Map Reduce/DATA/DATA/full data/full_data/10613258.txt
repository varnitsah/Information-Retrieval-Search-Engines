10613258	the kasÎdah of hÂjÎ abdÛ elyezdÎ  translated and annotated by hs friend and pupil fb    to the reader   the translator has ventured to entitle a lay of the higher law the following composition which aims at being in advance of its time and he has not feared the danger of collision with such unpleasant forms as the higher culture the principles which justify the name are as follows  the author asserts that happiness and misery are equally divided and distributed in the world  he makes selfcultivation with due regard to others the sole and sufficient object of human life  he suggests that the affections the sympathies and the divine gift of pity are mans highest enjoyments  he advocates suspension of judgment with a proper suspicion of facts the idlest of superstitions  finally although destructive to appearance he is essentially reconstructive  for other details concerning the poem and the poet the curious reader is referred to the end of the volume  f b  vienna nov 1880    the kasÎdah   i   the hour is nigh the waning queen    walks forth to rule the later night crownd with the sparkle of a star    and throned on orb of ashen light  the wolftail sweeps the paling east    to leave a deeper gloom behind and dawn uprears her shining head    sighing with semblance of a wind      the false dawn  the highlands catch yon orient gleam    while purpling still the lowlands lie and pearly mists the morningpride    soar incenselike to greet the sky  the horses neigh the camels groan    the torches gleam the cressets flare the town of canvas falls and man    with din and dint invadeth air  the golden gates swing right and left    up springs the sun with flamy brow the dewcloud melts in gush of light    brown earth is bathed in morningglow  slowly they wind athwart the wild    and while young day his anthem swells sad falls upon my yearning ear    the tinkling of the camelbells  oer fiery wastes and frozen wold    oer horrid hill and gloomy glen the home of grisly beast and ghoul    the haunts of wilder grislier men      the demon of the desert  with the brief gladness of the palms    that tower and sway oer seething plain fraught with the thoughts of rustling shade    and welling spring and rushing rain  with the short solace of the ridge    by gentle zephyrs played upon whose breezy head and bosky side    front seas of cooly celadon  tis theirs to pass with joy and hope    whose souls shall ever thrill and fill dreams of the birthplace and the tomb    visions of allahs holy hill      arafât near mecca  but we another shift of scene    another pang to rack the heart why meet we on the bridge of time    to change one greeting and to part  we meet to part yet asks my sprite    part we to meet ah is it so mans fancymade omniscience knows    who made omniscience nought can know  why must we meet why must we part    why must we bear this yoke of must without our leave or askt or given    by tyrant fate on victim thrust  that eve so gay so bright so glad    this morn so dim and sad and grey strange that lifes registrar should write    this day a day that day a day  mine eyes my brain my heart are sad    sad is the very core of me all wearies changes passes ends    alas the birthdays injury  friends of my youth a last adieu    haply some day we meet again yet neer the selfsame men shall meet    the years shall make us other men  the light of morn has grown to noon    has paled with eve and now farewell go vanish from my life as dies    the tinkling of the camels bell    ii   in these drear wastes of seaborn land    these wilds where none may dwell but he what visionary pasts revive    what process of the years we see  gazing beyond the thin blue line    that rims the far horizonring our saddend sight why haunt these ghosts    whence do these spectral shadows spring  what endless questions vex the thought    of whence and whither when and how what fond and foolish strife to read    the scripture writ on human brow  as stand we percht on point of time    betwixt the two eternities whose awful secrets gathering round    with black profound oppress our eyes  this gloomy night these grisly waves    these winds and whirlpools loud and dread what reck they of our wretched plight    who safetys shore so lightly tread  thus quoth the bard of love and wine

hebrew shlm    notes   note i   hÂjÎ abdÛ the man  hâjî abdû has been known to me for more years than i care to record a native it is believed of darâbghird in the yezd province he always preferred to style himself elhichmakâni a facetious lackab or surname meaning of nohall nowhere he had travelled far and wide with his eyes open as appears by his couplets to a natural facility a knack of language learning he added a store of desultory various reading scraps of chinese and old egyptian of hebrew and syriac of sanskrit and prakrit of slav especially lithuanian of latin and greek including romaic of berber the nubian dialect and of zend and akkadian besides persian his mothertongue and arabic the classic of the schools nor was he ignorant of the ologies and the triumphs of modern scientific discovery briefly his memory was wellstored and he had every talent save that of using his talents  but no one thought that he wood the muse to speak in the style of the last century even his intimates were ignorant of the fact that he had a skeleton in his cupboard his kasîdah or distichs he confided to me his secret when we last met in western indiai am purposely vague in specifying the place when so doing he held in hand the long and hoary honours of his chin with the points toward me as if to say with the islandking     there is a touch of winter in my beard    a sign the gods will guard me from imprudence  and yet the piercing eye clear as an onyx seemed to protest against the plea of age the ms was in the vilest shikastah or runninghand and as i carried it off the writer declined to take the trouble of copying out his cacograph  we his old friends had long addressed hâjî abdû by the sobriquet of nabbianâ our prophet and the reader will see that the pilgrim has or believes he has a message to deliver he evidently aspires to preach a faith of his own an eastern version of humanitarianism blended with the sceptical or as we now say the scientific habit of mind the religion of which fetishism hinduism and heathendom judæism christianity and islamism are mere fractions may methinks be accepted by the philosopher it worships with singleminded devotion the holy cause of truth of truth for its own sake not for the goods it may bring and this belief is equally acceptable to honest ignorance and to the highest attainments in naturestudy  with confucius the hâjî cultivates what strauss has called the stern commonsense of mankind while the reign of order is a paragraph of his higher law he traces from its rudest beginnings the all but absolute universality of some perception by man called faith that sensus numinis which by inheritance or communication is now universal except in those who force themselves to oppose it and he evidently holds this general consent of mankind to be so far divine that it primarily discovered for itself if it did not create a divinity he does not cry with the christ of novalis children you have no father and perhaps he would join renan in exclaiming un monde sans dieu est horrible  but he recognises the incompatibility of the infinite with the definite of a being who loves who thinks who hates of an actus purus who is called jealous wrathful and revengeful with an eternal that makes for righteousness in the presence of the endless contradictions which spring from the idea of a personal deity with the synthesis the begriff of providence our agnostic takes refuge in the sentiment of an unknown and an unknowable he objects to the countless variety of forms assumed by the perception of a causa causans a misnomer and to that intellectual adoption of general propositions capable of distinct statement but incapable of proofs which we term belief  he looks with impartial eye upon the endless variety of systems maintained with equal confidence and selfsufficiency by men of equal ability and honesty he is weary of wandering over the world and of finding every petty race wedded to its own opinions claiming the monopoly of truth holding all others to be in error and raising disputes whose violence acerbity and virulence are in inverse ratio to the importance of the disputed matter a peculiarly active and acute observation taught him that many of these jarring families especially those of the same blood are par in the intellectual processes of perception and reflection that in the business of the visible working world they are confessedly by no means superior to one another whereas in abstruse matters of mere faith not admitting direct and sensual evidence one in a hundred will claim to be right and immodestly charge the other ninetynine with being wrong  thus he seeks to discover a system which will prove them all right and all wrong which will reconcile their differences will unite past creeds will account for the present and will anticipate the future with a continuous and uninterrupted development this too by a process not negative and distinctive but on the contrary intensely positive and constructive i am not called upon to sit in the seat of judgment but i may say that it would be singular if the attempt succeeded such a system would be allcomprehensive because not limited by space time or race its principle would be extensive as matter itself and consequently eternal meanwhile he satisfies himselfthe main point  students of metaphysics have of late years defined the abuse of their science as the morphology of common opinion contemporary investigators they say have been too much occupied with introspection their labors have become merely physiologicobiographical and they have greatly neglected the study of averages for says la rochefoucauld il est plus aisé de connoître lhomme en général que de connoître un homme en particulier and on so wide a subject all views must be onesided  but this is not the fashion of easterns they have still to treat great questions ex analogiâ universi instead of ex analogiâ hominis they must learn the basis of sociology the philosophic conviction that mankind should be studied not as a congeries of individuals but as an organic whole hence the zeitgeist or historical evolution of the collective consciousness of the age despises the obsolete opinion that society the state is bound by the same moral duties as the simple citizen hence too it holds that the spirit of man being of equal and uniform substance doth usually suppose and feign in nature a greater equality and uniformity than is in truth  christianity and islamism have been on their trial for the last eighteen and twelve centuries they have been ardent in proselytizing yet they embrace only onetenth and onetwentieth of the human race hâjî abdû would account for the tardy and unsatisfactory progress of what their votaries call pure truths by the innate imperfections of the same both propose a reward for mere belief and a penalty for simple unbelief rewards and punishments being by the way very disproportionate thus they reduce everything to the scale of a somewhat unrefined egotism and their demoralizing effects become clearer to every progressive age  hâjî abdû seeks truth only truth as far as man in the present phase of his development is able to comprehend it he disdains to associate utility like bacon nov org i aph 124 the high priest of the english creed le gros bon sens with the lumen siccum ac purum notionum verarum he seems to see the injury inflicted upon the sum of thought by the â posteriori superstition the worship of facts and the deification of synthesis lastly came the reckless way in which locke freed philosophy from the incubus of innate ideas like luther and the leaders of the great french revolution he broke with the past and he threw overboard the whole cargo of human tradition the result has been an immense movement of the mind which we love to call progress when it has often been retrograde together with a mighty development of egotism resulting from the pampered sentiment of personality  the hâjî regrets the excessive importance attached to a possible future state he looks upon this as a psychical stimulant a day dream whose revulsion and reaction disorder waking life the condition may appear humble and prosaic to those exalted by the fumes of fancy by a spiritual dramdrinking which like the physical is the pursuit of an ideal happiness but he is too wise to affirm or to deny the existence of another world for life beyond the grave there is no consensus of mankind no catholic opinion held semper et ubique et ab omnibus the intellectual faculties perception and reflection are mute upon the subject they bear no testimony to facts they show no proof even the instinctive sense of our kind is here dumb we may believe what we are taught we can know nothing he would therefore cultivate that receptive mood which marching under the shadow of mighty events leads to the highest of goalsthe development of humanity with him suspension of judgment is a system  man has done much during the sixtyeight centuries which represent his history this assumes the first egyptian empire following the prehistoric to begin with b c 5000 and to end with b c 3249 it was the old as opposed to the middle the new and the low it contained the dynasties from i to x and it was the age of the pyramids at once simple solid and grand when the praiser of the past contends that modern civilization has improved in nothing upon homer and herodotus he is apt to forget that every schoolboy is a miracle of learning compared with the caveman and the palæolithic race and as the past has been so shall the future be  the pilgrims view of life is that of the soofi with the usual dash of buddhistic pessimism the profound sorrow of existence so often sung by the dreamy eastern poet has now passed into the practical european mind even the light frenchman murmurs     moi moi chaque jour courbant plus bas ma tête      je passeet refroidi sous ce soleil joyeux    je men irai bientôt au milieu de la fête      sans que rien manque au monde immense et radieux  but our hâjî is not nihilistic in the nonothing sense of hoods poem or as the american phrases it there is nothing new nothing true and it dont signify his is a healthy wail over the shortness and the miseries of life because he finds all created things     measure the world with me immense  he reminds us of st augustine med c 21 vita hæc vita misera vita caduca vita incerta vita laboriosa vita immunda vita domina malorum regina superborum plena miseriis et erroribus    quam humores tumidant escæ inflant jejunia macerant joci dissolvunt tristitiæ consumunt sollicitudo coarctat securitas hebetat divitiæ inflant et jactant paupertas dejicit juventus extollit senectus incurvat importunitas frangit mæror deprimit et his malis omnibus mors furibunda succedit but for furibunda the pilgrim would perhaps read benedicta  with cardinal newman one of the glories of our age hâjî abdû finds the light of the world nothing else than the prophets scroll full of lamentations and mourning and woe i cannot refrain from quoting all this fine passage if it be only for the sake of its lame and shallow deduction to consider the world in its length and breadth its various history and the many races of men their starts their fortunes their mutual alienation their conflicts and then their ways habits governments forms of worship their enterprises their aimless courses their random achievements and acquirements the impotent conclusion of longstanding facts the tokens so faint and broken of a superintending design the blind evolution  of what turn out to be great powers or truths the progress of things as if from unreasoning elements not towards final causes the greatness and littleness of man his farreaching aims and short duration the curtain hung over his futurity the disappointments of life the defeat of good the success of evil physical pain mental anguish the prevalence and intensity of sin the pervading idolatries the corruptions the dreary hopeless irreligion that condition of the whole race so fearfully yet exactly described in the apostles words having no hope and without god in the worldall this is a vision to dizzy and appall and inflicts upon the mind the sense of a profound mystery which is absolutely without human solution hence that admirable writer postulates some terrible original calamity and thus the hateful doctrine theologically called original sin becomes to him almost as certain as that the world exists and as the existence of god similarly the schedule of doctrines of the most liberal christian church insists upon the human depravity and the absolute need of the holy spirits agency in mans regeneration and sanctification  but what have we here the original calamity was either caused by god or arose without leave of god in either case degrading god to man it is the old dilemma whose horns are the irreconcilable attributes of goodness and omniscience in the supposed creator of sin and suffering if the one quality be predicable the other cannot be predicable of the same subject far better and wiser is the essayists poetical explanation now apparently despised because it was the fashionable doctrine of the sage bards day     all nature is but art       all discord harmony not understood    all partial evil universal goodessay 289292  the pilgrim holds with st augustine absolute evil is impossible because it is always rising up into good he considers the theory of a beneficent or maleficent deity a purely sentimental fancy contradicted by human reason and the aspect of the world evil is often the active form of good as f w newman says so likewise is evil the revelation of good with him all existences are equal so long as they possess the hindu agasa lifefluid or vital force it matters not they be     fungus or oak or worm or man  war he says brings about countless individual miseries but it forwards general progress by raising the stronger upon the ruins of the weaker races earthquakes and cyclones ravage small areas but the former builds up earth for mans habitation and the latter renders the atmosphere fit for him to breathe hence he echoes                    the universal cause    acts not by partial but by general laws  ancillary to the churchmans immoral view of original sin is the unscientific theory that evil came into the world with adam and his seed let us ask what was the state of our globe in the preadamite days when the tyrants of the earth the huge saurians and other monsters lived in perpetual strife in a destructiveness of which we have now only the feeblest examples what is the actual state of the world of waters where the only object of life is death where the law of murder is the law of development  some will charge the hâjî with irreverence and hold him a lieutenant of satan who sits in the chair of pestilence but he is not intentionally irreverent like men of far higher strain who deny divinely the divine he speaks the things that others think and hide with the author of supernatural religion he holds that we gain infinitely more than we lose in abandoning belief in the reality of revelation and he looks forward to the day when the old tyranny shall have been broken and when the anarchy of transition shall have passed away but he is an eastern when he repeats the greeks remember not to believe he means strive to learn to know for right ideas lead to right actions among the couplets not translated for this eclogue is     of all the safest ways of life       the safest way is still to doubt    men win the future world with faith       the present world they win without  this is the spaniards     de las cosas mas seguras mas seguro es duvidar  a typically modern sentiment of the brazen age of science following the golden age of sentiment but the pilgrim continues     the sages say i tell thee no       with equal faith all faiths receive    none more none less for doubt is death       they live the most who most believe  here again is an oriental subtlety a man who believes in everything equally and generally may be said to believe in nothing it is not a simple european view which makes honest doubt worth a dozen of the creeds and it is in direct opposition to the noted writer who holds that the man of simple faith is worth ninetynine of those who hold only to the egotistic interests of their own individuality this dark saying means if it mean anything that the socalled moral faculties of man fancy and ideality must lord it over the perceptive and reflective powersa simple absurdity it produced a turricremata alias torquemada who shedding floods of honest tears caused his victims to be burnt alive and an anchieta the thaumaturgist of brazil who beheaded a converted heretic lest the latter by lapse from grace lose his immortal soul  but this vein of speculation which bigots brand as doubt denial and destruction this earnest religious scepticism this curious inquiry has the universal tradition any base of fact this craving after the secrets and mysteries of the future the unseen the unknown is common to all races and to every age even amongst the romans whose model man in augustus day was horace the philosophic the epicurean we find propertius asking     an ficta in miseras descendit fabula gentes       et timor haud ultra quam rogus esse potest  to return the pilgrims doctrines upon the subject of conscience and repentance will startle those who do not follow his train of thought     never repent because thy will       with will of fate be not at one    think an thou please before thou dost       but never rue the deed when done  this again is his modified fatalism he would not accept the boisterous mode of cutting the gordianknot proposed by the noble british philisterwe know were free and theres an end on it he prefers lamarcks the will is in truth never free he believes man to be a coordinate term of natures great progression a result of the interaction of organism and environment working through cosmic sections of time he views the human machine the pipe of flesh as depending upon the physical theory of life every corporeal fact and phenomenon which like the tree grows from within or without is a mere product of organization living bodies being subject to the natural law governing the lifeless and the inorganic whilst the religionist assures us that man is not a mere toy of fate but a free agent responsible to himself with work to do and duties to perform the hâjî with many modern schools holds mind to be a word describing a special operation of matter the faculties generally to be manifestations of movements in the central nervous system and every idea even of the deity to be a certain little pulsation of a certain little mass of animal papthe brain thus he would not object to relationship with a tailless catarrhine anthropoid ape descended from a monad or a primal ascidian  hence he virtually says i came into the world without having applied for or having obtained permission nay more without my leave being asked or given here i find myself handtied by conditions and fettered by laws and circumstances in making which my voice had no part while in the womb i was an automaton and death will find me a mere machine therefore not i but the law or if you please the lawgiver is answerable for all my actions let me here observe that to the western mind law postulates a lawgiver not so to the eastern and especially to the soofi who holds these ideas to be human unjustifiably extended to interpreting the nonhuman which men call the divine  further he would say i am an individual qui nil habet dividui a circle touching and intersecting my neighbours at certain points but nowhere corresponding nowhere blending physically i am not identical in all points with other men morally i differ from them in nothing do the approaches of knowledge my five organs of sense with their shelleyan interpretation exactly resemble those of any other being ergo the effect of the world of life of natural objects will not in my case be the same as with the beings most resembling me thus i claim the right of creating or modifying for my own and private use the system which most imports me and if the reasonable leave be refused to me i take it without leave  but my individuality however allsufficient for myself is an infinitesimal point an atom subject in all things to the law of storms called life i feel i know that fate is but i cannot know what is or what is not fated to befall me therefore in the pursuit of perfection as an individual lies my highest and indeed my only duty the i being duly blended with the we i object to be a selfless man which to me denotes an inverted moral sense i am bound to take careful thought concerning the consequences of every word and deed when however the future has become the past it would be the merest vanity for me to grieve or to repent over that which was decreed by universal law  the usual objection is that of mans practice it says this is well in theory but how carry it out for instance why would you kill or give over to be killed the man compelled by fate to kill your father hâjî abdû replies i do as others do not because the murder was done by him but because the murderer should not be allowed another chance of murdering he is a tiger who has tasted blood and who should be shot i am convinced that he was a tool in the hands of fate but that will not prevent my taking measures whether predestined or not in order to prevent his being similarly used again  as with repentance so with conscience conscience may be a fear which is the shadow of justice even as pity is the shadow of love though simply a geographical and chronological accident which changes with every age of the world it may deter men from seeking and securing the prize of successful villainy but this incentive to beneficence must be applied to actions that will be done not to deeds that have been done  the hâjî moreover carefully distinguishes between the working of fate under a personal god and under the reign of law in the former case the contradiction between the foreknowledge of a creator and the freewill of a creature is direct palpable absolute we might as well talk of blackwhiteness and of whiteblackness a hundred generations of divines have never been able to ree the riddle a million will fail the difficulty is insurmountable to the theist whose almighty is perforce omniscient and as omniscient prescient but it disappears when we convert the person into law or a settled order of events subject moreover to certain exceptions fixed and immutable but at present unknown to man the difference is essential as that between the penal code with its narrow forbiddal and the broad commandment which is a guide rather than a taskmaster  thus too the belief in fixed law versus arbitrary will modifies the hâjîs opinions concerning the pursuit of happiness mankind das rastlose ursachenthier is born to be on the whole equally happy and miserable the highest organisms the fine porcelain of our family enjoy the most and suffer the most they have a capacity for rising to the empyrean of pleasure and for plunging deep into the swiftflowing river of woe and pain thus dante inf vi 106                          tua scienza    che vuol quanto la cosa è più perfetta    più senta l bene e cosi la doglienza  so buddhism declares that existence in itself implies effort pain and sorrow and the higher the creature the more it suffers the common clay enjoys little and suffers little sum up the whole and distribute the mass the result will be an average and the beggar is on the whole happy as the prince why then asks the objector does man ever strive and struggle to change to rise a struggle which involves the idea of improving his condition the hâjî answers because such is the law under which man is born it may be fierce as famine cruel as the grave but man must obey it with blind obedience he does not enter into the question whether life is worth living whether man should elect to be born yet his eastern pessimism which contrasts so sharply with the optimism of the west reechoes the lines                             a life    with large results so little rife    though bearable seems hardly worth    this pomp of words this pain of birth  life whatever may be its consequence is built upon a basis of sorrow literature the voice of humanity and the verdict of mankind proclaim that all existence is a state of sadness the physicians of the soul would save her melancholy from degenerating into despair by doses of steadfast belief in the presence of god in the assurance of immortality and in visions of the final victory of good were hâjî abdû a mere theologist he would add that sin not the possibility of revolt but the revolt itself against conscience is the primary form of evil because it produces error moral and intellectual this man who omits to read the consciencelaw however it may differ from the societylaw is guilty of negligence that man who obscures the light of nature with sophistries becomes incapable of discerning his own truths in both cases error deliberately adopted is succeeded by suffering which we are told comes in justice and benevolence as a warning a remedy and a chastisement  but the pilgrim is dissatisfied with the idea that evil originates in the individual actions of free agents ourselves and others this doctrine fails to account for its characteristicsessentiality and universality that creatures endowed with the mere possibility of liberty should not always choose the good appears natural but that of the milliards of human beings who have inhabited the earth not one should have been found invariably to choose good proves how insufficient is the solution hence no one believes in the existence of the complete man under the present state of things the hâjî rejects all popular and mythical explanation by the fall of adam the innate depravity of human nature and the absolute perfection of certain incarnations which argues their divinity he can only wail over the prevalence of evil assume its foundation to be error and purpose to abate it by unrooting that ignorance which bears and feeds it  his eschatology like that of the soofis generally is vague and shadowy he may lean towards the doctrine of marc aurelius the unripe grape the ripe and the dried all things are changes not into nothing but into that which is not at present this is one of the monstruosa opinionum portenta mentioned by the xixth general council alias the first council of the vatican but he only accepts it with a limitation he cleaves to the ethical not to the intellectual worship of nature which moderns define to be an unscientific and imaginary synonym for the sum total of observed phenomena consequently he holds to the dark and degrading doctrines of the materialist the hylotheist in opposition to the spiritualist a distinction far more marked in the west than in the east europe draws a hard dry line between spirit and matter asia does not  among us the idealist objects to the materialists that the latter cannot agree upon fundamental points that they cannot define what is an atom that they cannot account for the transformation of physical action and molecular motion into consciousness and vice versâ that they cannot say what matter is and lastly that berkeley and his school have proved the existence of spirit while denying that of matter  the materialists reply that the want of agreement shows only a study insufficiently advanced that man cannot describe an atom because he is still an infant in science yet there is no reason why his mature manhood should not pass through error and incapacity to truth and knowledge that consciousness becomes a property of matter when certain conditions are present that hyle greek hylae or matter may be provisionally defined as phenomena with a substructure of their own transcendental and eternal subject to the action direct or indirect of the five senses whilst its properties present themselves in three states the solid the liquid and the gaseous to casuistical berkeley they prefer the common sense of mankind they ask the idealist and the spiritualist why they cannot find names for themselves without borrowing from a dark and degraded school why the former must call himself after his eye idein the latter after his breath spiritus thus the hâjî twits them with affixing their own limitations to their own almighty power and as socrates said with bringing down heaven to the marketplace  modern thought tends more and more to reject crude idealism and to support the monistic theory the double aspect the transfigured realism it discusses the nature of things in themselves to the question is there anything outside of us which corresponds with our sensations that is to say is the whole world simply i they reply that obviously there is a something else and that this something else produces the braindisturbance which is called sensation instinct orders us to do something reason the balance of faculties directs and the strongest motive controls modern science by the discovery of radiant matter a fourth condition seems to conciliate the two schools la découverte dun quatrième état de la matière says a reviewer cest la porte ouverte à linfini de ses transformations cest lhomme invisible et impalpable de même possible sans cesser dêtre substantiel cest le monde des esprits entrant sans absurdité dans la domaine des hypothèses scientifiques cest la possibilité pour le matérialiste de croire à la vie doutre tombe sans renoncer au substratum matériel quil croit nécessaire au maintien de lindividualité  with hâjî abdû the soul is not material for that would be a contradiction of terms he regards it with many moderns as a state of things not a thing a convenient word denoting the sense of personality of individual identity in its ghostly signification he discovers an artificial dogma which could hardly belong to the brutal savages of the stone age he finds it in the funereal books of ancient egypt whence probably it passed to the zendavesta and the vedas in the hebrew pentateuch of which part is still attributed to moses it is unknown or rather it is deliberately ignored by the author or authors the early christians could not agree upon the subject origen advocated the preexistence of mens souls supposing them to have been all created at one time and successively embodied others make spirit born with the hour of birth and so forth  but the brainaction or if you so phrase it the mind is not confined to the reasoning faculties nor can we afford to ignore the sentiments the affections which are perhaps the most potent realities of life their loud affirmative voice contrasts strongly with the titubant accents of the intellect they seem to demand a future life even a state of rewards and punishments from the maker of the world the ortolano eterno1 the potter of the east the watchmaker of the west they protest against the idea of annihilation they revolt at the notion of eternal parting from parents kinsmen and friends yet the dogma of a future life is by no means catholic and universal the angloeuropean race apparently cannot exist without it and we have lately heard of the aryan soulland on the other hand many of the buddhist and even the brahman schools preach nirwâna comparative nonexistence and parinirwâna absolute nothingness moreover the great turanian family actually occupying all eastern asia has ever ignored it and the 200000000 of chinese confucians the mass of the nation protest emphatically against the mainstay of the western creeds because it unfits men for the business and duty of life by fixing their speculations on an unknown world and even its votaries in all ages races and faiths cannot deny that the next world is a copy more or less idealized of the present and that it lacks a single particular savouring of originality it is in fact a mere continuation and the continuation is not proven     it is most hard to be a man  and the pilgrims sole consolation is in selfcultivation and in the pleasures of the affections this sympathy may be an indirect selflove a reflection of the light of egotism still it is so transferred as to imply a different system of convictions it requires a different name to call benevolence selflove is to make the fruit or flower not only depend upon a root for development which is true but the very root itself which is false and finally his ideal is of the highest his praise is reserved for                            lives    lived in obedience to the inner law    which cannot alter    1 the eternal gardener so the old inscription saying           locatus est in homo     damnatus est in     horto          humatus est in          renatus est in    note ii   a few words concerning the kasîdah itself our hâjî begins with a miseenscène and takes leave of the caravan setting out for mecca he sees the wolfs tail dumigurg the greek lykaugés or wolfgleam the diluculum the zodiacal dawnlight the first faint brushes of white radiating from below the eastern horizon it is accompanied by the morningbreath damisubh the current of air almost imperceptible except by the increase of cold which moslem physiologists suppose to be the early prayer offered by nature to the first cause the ghoulibiyâbân desertdemon is evidently the personification of mans fears and of the dangers that surround travelling in the wilds the woldwherenonesavehe allahcandwell is a great and terrible wilderness dashtilâsiwâ hu and allahs holy hill is arafât near mecca which the caravan reaches after passing through medina the first section ends with a sore lament that the meetings of this world take place upon the highway of separation and the original also has     the chill of sorrow numbs my thought       methinks i hear the passing knell    as dies across yon thin blue line       the tinkling of the camelbell  the next section quotes the various aspects under which life appeared to the wise and foolish teachers of humanity first comes hafiz whose wellknown lines are quoted beginning with shabitârîk o bîmimauj etc hûr is the plural of ahwar in full ahwar elayn a maid whose eyes are intensely white where they should be white and black elsewhere hence our silly houries follows umarikhayyâm who spiritualized tasawwof or sooffeism even as the soofis gnostics spiritualized moslem puritanism the verses alluded to are     you know my friends with what a brave carouse    i made a second marriage in my house       divorced old barren reason from my bed    and took the daughter of the vine to spouse             st 60 mr fitzgeralds translation  here wine is used in its mystic sense of entranced love for the soul of souls umar was hated and feared because he spoke boldly when his brethren the soofis dealt in innuendoes a third quotation has been trained into a likeness of the hymn of life despite the commonplace and the navrante vulgarité which characterize the pseudoschillerangloamerican school the same has been done to the words of isâ jesus for the author who is wellread in the ingîl evangel evidently intended the allusion mansur elhallâj the cottoncleaner was stoned for crudely uttering the pantheistic dogma ana l hakk i am the truth ie god wa laysa fijubbatî il allah and within my coat is nought but god his blood traced on the ground the firstquoted sentence lastly there is a quotation from sardanapalus son of anacyndaraxes etc here greek paîze may mean sport but the context determines the kind of sport intended the zâhid is the literal believer in the letter of the law opposed to the soofi who believes in its spirit hence the former is called a zâhiri outsider and the latter a bâtini an insider moses is quoted because he ignored future rewards and punishments as regards the two eternities persian and arab metaphysicians split eternity ie the negation of time into two halves azal beginninglessness and abad endlessness both being mere words gatherings of letters with a subjective significance in english we use eternal Æviternus agelong lifelong as loosely by applying it to three distinct ideas 1 the habitual in popular parlance 2 the exempt from duration and 3 the everlasting which embraces all duration omnisciencemaker is the old roman sceptics homo fecit deos  the next section is one long wail over the contradictions the mysteries the dark end the infinite sorrowfulness of all existence and the arcanum of grief which luther said underlies all life as with euripides to live is to die to die is to live hâjî abdû borrows the hindu idea of the human body it is a mansion says menu with bones for its beams and rafters with nerves and tendons for cords with muscles and blood for cement with skin for its outer covering filled with no sweet perfume but loaded with impurities a mansion infested by age and sorrow the seat of malady harassed with pains haunted with the quality of darkness tamaguna and incapable of standing the pot and potter began with the ancient egyptians sitting as a potter at the wheel cneph at philæ moulds clay and gives the spirit of life to the nostrils of osiris hence the genesitic breath then we meet him in the vedas the being by whom the fictile vase is formed the clay out of which it is fabricated we find him next in jeremiahs arise and go down unto the potters house etc xviii 2 and lastly in romans ix 20 hath not the potter power over the clay no wonder that the first hand who moulded the manmud is a lieu commun in eastern thought the waste of agony is buddhism or schopenhauerism pure and simple i have moulded earth on earth upon seint ysidres wellknown rhymes ad 1440     erthe out of erthe is wondirli wrouzt    erthe out of erthe hath gete a dignity of nouzt    erthe upon erthe hath sett all his thouzt    how that erthe upon erthe may be his brouzt etc  the camelrider suggests ossian yet a few years and the blast of the desert comes the dromedary was chosen as deaths vehicle by the arabs probably because it bears the bedouins corpse to the distant burialground where he will lie among his kith and kin the end of this section reminds us of     how poor how rich how abject how august    how complicate how wonderful is man  the hâjî now passes to the results of his long and anxious thoughts i have purposely twisted his exordium into an echo of milton     till old experience doth attain    to something of prophetic strain  he boldly declares that there is no god as man has created his creator here he is at one with modern thoughten général les croyants font le dieu comme ils sont euxmêmes says j j rousseau confessions i 6 les bons le font bon les méchants le font méchant les dévots haineux et bilieux ne voient que lenfer parce quils voudraient damner tout le monde les âmes aimantes et douces ny croient guère et lun des étonnements dont je ne reviens pas est de voir le bon fénélon en parler dans son télémaque comme sil y croyoit tout de bon mais jespère quil mentoit alors car enfin quelque véridique quon soit il faut bien mentir quelquefois quand on est évêque man depicts himself in his gods says schiller hence the naturgott the deity of all ancient peoples and with which every system began allowed and approved of actions distinctly immoral often diabolical belief became moralized only when the conscience of the community and with it of the individual items began aspiring to its golden ageperfection dieu est le superlatif dont le positif est lhomme says carl vogt meaning that the popular idea of a numen is that of a magnified and nonnatural man  he then quotes his authorities buddha whom the catholic church converted to saint josaphat refused to recognize ishwara the deity on account of the mystery of the cruelty of things schopenhauer miss cobbes model pessimist who at the humblest distance represents buddha in the world of western thought found the vision of mans unhappiness irrespective of his actions so overpowering that he concluded the supreme will to be malevolent heartless cowardly and arrogant confucius the throneless king more powerful than all kings denied a personal deity the epicurean idea rules the china of the present day god is great but he lives too far off say the turanian santâls in aryan india and this is the general language of man in the turanian east  hâjî abdû evidently holds that idolatry begins with a personal deity and let us note that the latter is deliberately denied by the thirtynine articles with them god is a being without parts personality or passions he professes a vague agnosticism and attributes popular faith to the fact that timor fecit deos every religion being without exception the child of fear and ignorance carl vogt he now speaks as the drawer of the wine the ancient taverner the old magus the patron of the mughân or magians all titles applied to the soofi as opposed to the zâhid his idols are the eidola illusions of bacon having their foundations in the very constitution of man and therefore appropriately called fabulæ that natures common course is subject to various interpretation may be easily proved aristotle was as great a subverter as alexander but the quasiprophetical stagyrite of the dark ages who ruled the world till the end of the thirteenth century became the twice execrable of martin luther and was finally abolished by galileo and newton here i have excised two stanzas the first is     theories for truths fable for fact       system for science vex the thought    lifes one great lesson you despise       to know that all we know is nought  this is in fact     well didst thou say athenas noblest son    the most we know is nothing can be known  the next is     essence and substance sequence cause       beginning ending space and time    these be the toys of manhoods mind       at once ridiculous and sublime  he is not the only one who so regards bothering time and space a late definition of the infinitely great viz that the idea arises from denying form to any figure of the infinitely small from refusing magnitude to any figure is a fair specimen of the dismal sciencemetaphysics  another omitted stanza reads     how canst thou phenomen pretend       the noumenon to mete and span    say which were easier probed and proved       absolute being or mortal man  one would think that he had read kant on the knowable and the unknowable or had heard of the yankee lady who could differentiate between the finite and the infinite it is a commonplace of the age in the west as well as the east that science is confined to phenomena and cannot reach the noumena the things themselves this is the scholastic realism the residuum of a bad metaphysic which deforms the system of comte with all its pretensions it simply means that there are or can be conceived things in themselves ie unrelated to thought that we know them to exist and at the same time that we cannot know what they are but who dares say cannot who can measure mans work when he shall be as superior to our present selves as we are to the caveman of past time  the chain of universe alludes to the jain idea that the whole consisting of intellectual as well as of natural principles existed from all eternity and that it has been subject to endless revolutions whose causes are the inherent powers of nature intellectual as well as physical without the intervention of a deity but the poet ridicules the nonhuman ie the notourselves the negation of ourselves and consequently a nonexistence most easterns confuse the contradictories in which one term stands for something and the other for nothing eg ourselves and notourselves with the contraries eg rich and notrich  poor in which both terms express a something so the positivenegative infinite is not the complement of finite but its negation the western man derides the process by making nothorse the complementary entity of horse the pilgrim ends with the favourite soofi tenet that the five six senses are the doors of all human knowledge and that no form of man incarnation of the deity prophet apostle or sage has ever produced an idea not conceived within his brain by the sole operation of these vulgar material agents evidently he is neither spiritualist nor idealist  he then proceeds to show that man depicts himself in his god and that god is the racial expression a pedagogue on the nile an abstraction in india and an astrologer in chaldæa where abraham says berosus josephus ant i 7 § 2 and ii 9 § 2 was skilful in the celestial science he notices the akâranazamân endless time of the guebres and the working dual hormuzd and ahriman he brands the god of the hebrews with pugnacity and cruelty he has heard of the beautiful creations of greek fancy which not attributing a moral nature to the deity included theology in physics and which like professor tyndall seemed to consider all matter everywhere alive we have adopted a very different unitarianism theology with its one creator pantheism with its one spirits plastic stress and science with its one energy he is hard upon christianity and its trinal god i have not softened his expression arabic  a riddle although it may offend readers there is nothing more enigmatical to the moslem mind than christian trinitarianism all other objections they can get over not this nor is he any lover of islamism which like christianity has its ascetic hebraism and its hellenic hedonism with the world of thought moving between these two extremes the former defined as predominant or exclusive care for the practice of right is represented by semitic and arab influence korânic and hadîsic the latter the religion of humanity a passion for life and light for culture and intelligence for art poetry and science is represented in islamism by the fondly and impiouslycherished memory of the old guebre kings and heroes beauties bards and sages hence the mention of zâl and his son rostam of cyrus and of the jâmijamshîd which may be translated either grail cup or mirror it showed the whole world within its rim and hence it was called jâmijehânnumâ universeexposing the contemptuous expressions about the diet of camels milk and the meat of the susmâr or green lizard are evidently quoted from firdausis famous lines beginning     arabrâ bejâî rasîdest kâr  the hâjî is severe upon those who make of the deity a khwâniyaghmâ or tray of plunder as the persians phrase it he looks upon the shepherds as men     who rob the sheep themselves to clothe  so schopenhauer leben etc by wilhelm gewinner furiously shows how the english nation ought to treat that set of hypocrites imposters and moneygraspers the clergy that annually devours £3500000  the hâjî broadly asserts that there is no good and no evil in the absolute sense as man has made them here he is one with pope     and spite of pride in erring natures spite    one truth is clearwhatever is is right  unfortunately the converse is just as truewhatever is is wrong khizr is the elijah who puzzled milman he represents the soofi the bâtini while musâ moses is the zâhid the zâhiri and the strange adventures of the twain invented by the jews have been appropriated by the moslems he derides the freewill of man and like diderot he detects pantaloon in a prelate a satyr in a president a pig in a priest an ostrich in a minister and a goose in a chief clerk he holds to fortune the greek túxae of alcman which is greek eunomías te kaì peithoûs adelphà kaì promatheías thugátaerchance the sister of order and trust and the daughter of forethought the scandinavian spinners of fate were urd the was the past verdandi the becoming or present and skuld the tobe or future he alludes to plato who made the demiourgos create the worlds by the logos the hebrew dabar or creative word through the Æons these greek aìwnes of the mystics were spiritual emanations from greek aìwn lit a wave of influx an age period or day hence the latin ævum and the welsh awen the stream of inspiration falling upon a bard basilides the egyptochristian made the creator evolve seven Æons or pteromata fulnesses from two of whom wisdom and power proceeded the 365 degrees of angels all were subject to a prince of heaven called abraxas who was himself under guidance of the chief Æon wisdom others represent the first cause to have produced an Æon or pure intelligence the first a second and so forth till the tenth this was material enough to affect hyle which thereby assumed a spiritual form thus the two incompatibles combined in the scheme of creation  he denies the three ages of the buddhists the wholly happy the happy mixed with misery and the miserable tinged with happinessthe present the zoroastrians had four each of 3000 years in the first hormuzd the goodgod ruled alone then ahriman the badgod began to rule subserviently in the third both ruled equally and in the last now current ahriman has gained the day  against the popular idea that man has caused the misery of this world he cites the ages when the old red sandstone bred gigantic cannibal fishes when the oolites produced the mighty reptile tyrants of air earth and sea and when the monsters of the eocene and miocene periods shook the ground with their ponderous tread and the world of waters is still a hideous scene of cruelty carnage and destruction  he declares conscience to be a geographical and chronological accident thus he answers the modern philosopher whose soul was overwhelmed by the marvel and the awe of two things the starry heaven above and the moral law within he makes the latter sense a development of the gregarious and social instincts and so travellers have observed that the moral is the last step in mental progress his moors are the savage dankali and other negroid tribes who offer a cup of milk with one hand and stab with the other he translates literally the indian word hâthî an elephant the animal with the hâth hand or trunk finally he alludes to the age of active volcanoes the present which is merely temporary the shifting of the pole and the spectacle to be seen from mushtari or the planet jupiter  the hâjî again asks the old old question what is truth and he answers himself after the fashion of the wise emperor of china truth hath not an unchanging name a modern english writer says i have long been convinced by the experience of my life as a pioneer of various heterodoxies which are rapidly becoming orthodoxies that nearly all truth is temperamental to us or given in the affections and intuitions and that discussion and inquiry do little more than feed temperament our poet seems to mean that the perceptions when they perceive truly convey objective truth which is universal whereas the reflectives and the sentiments the working of the moral region or the middle lobe of the phrenologists supplies only subjective truth personal and individual thus to one man the axiom opes irritamenta malorum represents a distinct fact while another holds wealth to be an incentive for good evidently both are right according to their lights  hâjî abdû cites plato and aristotle as usual with eastern songsters who delight in mantik logic here he appears to mean that a false proposition is as real a proposition as one that is true faith moves mountains and manet immota fides are evidently quotations he derides the teaching of the first council of the vatican cap v all the faithful are little children listening to the voice of saint peter who is the prince of the apostles he glances at the fancy of certain modern physicists devotion is a definite molecular change in the convolution of grey pulp he notices with contumely the riddle of which milton speaks so glibly where the dialoguists                                reasoned high    of providence foreknowledge will and fate    fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute  in opposition to the orthodox mohammedan tenets which make mans soul his percipient ego an entity a unity the soofi considers it a fancy opposed to body which is a fact at most a state of things not a thing a consensus of faculties whereof our frames are but the phenomena this is not contrary to genesitic legend the hebrew ruach and arabic ruh now perverted to mean soul or spirit simply signify wind or breath the outward and visible sign of life their later schools are even more explicit for that which befalls man befalls beasts as the one dies so does the other they have all one death all go unto one place eccles iii 19 but the modern soul a nothing a string of negations a negative in chief is thus described in the mahâbhârat it is indivisible inconceivable inconceptible it is eternal universal permanent immovable it is invisible and unalterable hence the modern spiritualism which rejecting materialism can use only material language  these says the hâjî are mere sounds he would not assert verba gignunt verba but verba gignunt res a step further the idea is bacons idola fori omnium molestissima the twofold illusions of language either the names of things that have no existence in fact or the names of things whose idea is confused and illdefined  he derives the soulidea from the savage ghost which dr johnson defined to be a kind of shadowy being he justly remarks that it arose perhaps in egypt and was not invented by the people of the book by this term moslems denote jews and christians who have a recognized revelation while their ignorance refuses it to guebres hindus and confucians  he evidently holds to the doctrine of progress with him protoplasm is the yliastron the prima materies our word matter is derived from the sanskrit sanskrit mâtrâ which however signifies properly the invisible type of visible matter in modern language the substance distinct from the sum of its physical and chemical properties thus mâtrâ exists only in thought and is not recognizable by the action of the five senses his chain of being reminds us of prof huxleys pedigree of the horse orohippus mesohippus meiohippus protohippus pleiohippus and equus he has evidently heard of modern biology or hylozoism which holds its quartermillion species of living beings animal and vegetable to be progressive modifications of one great fundamental unity an unity of socalled mental faculties as well as of bodily structure and this is the jellyspeck he scoffs at the popular idea that man is the great central figure round which all things gyrate like marionettes in fact the anthropocentric era of draper which strange to say lives by the side of the telescope and the microscope as man is of recent origin and may end at an early epoch of the macrocosm so before his birth all things revolved round nothing and may continue to do so after his death  the hâjî who elsewhere denounces compound ignorance holds that all evil comes from error and that all knowledge has been developed by overthrowing error the ordinary channel of human thought he ends this section with a great truth there are things which human reason or instinct matured in its undeveloped state cannot master but reason is a law to itself therefore we are not bound to believe or to attempt belief in any thing which is contrary or contradictory to reason here he is diametrically opposed to rome who says do not appeal to history that is private judgment do not appeal to holy writ that is heresy do not appeal to reason that is rationalism  he holds with the patriarchs of hebrew holy writ that the present life is allsufficient for an intellectual not a sentimental being and therefore that there is no want of a heaven or a hell with far more contradiction the western poet sings     hell hath no limits nor is circumscribed    in one selfplace but when we are in hell    and where hell is there must we ever be    and to be short when all this world dissolves    and every creature shall be purified    all places shall be hell which are not heaven  for what want is there of a hell when all are pure he enlarges upon the ancient buddhist theory that happiness and misery are equally distributed among men and beasts some enjoy much and suffer much others the reverse hence diderot declares sober passions produce only the commonplace    the man of moderate passion lives and dies like a brute and again we have the half truth     that the mark of rank in nature       is capacity for pain  the latter implies an equal capacity for pleasure and thus the balance is kept  hâjî abdû then proceeds to show that faith is an accident of birth one of his omitted distichs says     race makes religion true but aye       upon the maker acts the made    a finite god and infinite sin       in lieu of raising man degrade  in a manner of dialogue he introduces the various races each fighting to
