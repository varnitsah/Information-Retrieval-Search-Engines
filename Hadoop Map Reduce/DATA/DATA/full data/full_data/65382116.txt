65382116	coral reefs  by charles darwin     editorial note  although in some respects more technical in their subjects and style than darwins journal the books here reprinted will never lose their value and interest for the originality of the observations they contain  many parts of them are admirably adapted for giving an insight into problems regarding the structure and changes of the earths surface and in fact they form a charming introduction to physical geology and physiography in their application to special domains  the books themselves cannot be obtained for many times the price of the present volume and both the general reader who desires to know more of darwins work and the student of geology who naturally wishes to know how a master mind reasoned on most important geological subjects will be glad of the opportunity of possessing them in a convenient and cheap form  the three introductions which my friend professor judd has kindly furnished give critical and historical

introduction  a scientific discovery is the outcome of an interesting process of evolution in the mind of its author  when we are able to detect the germs of thought in which such a discovery has originated and to trace the successive stages of the reasoning by which the crude idea has developed into an epochmaking book we have the materials for reconstructing an important chapter of scientific history  such a contribution to the story of the making of science may be furnished in respect to darwins famous theory of coralreefs and the clearly reasoned treatise in which it was first fully set forth  the subject of corals and coralreefs is one concerning which much popular misconception has always prevailed  the misleading comparison of coralrock with the combs of bees and the nests of wasps is perhaps responsible for much of this misunderstanding one writer has indeed described a coralreef as being built by fishes by means of their teeth  scarcely less misleading however are the references we so frequently meet with both in prose and verse to the skill industry and perseverance of the coralinsect in building his home  as well might we praise men for their cleverness in making their own skeletons and laud their assiduity in filling churchyards with the same  the polyps and other organisms whose remains accumulate to form a coralreef simply live and perform their natural functions and then die leaving behind them in the natural course of events the hard calcareous portions of their structures to add to the growing reef  while the forms of coralreefs and coralislands are sometimes very remarkable and worthy of attentive study there is no ground it need scarcely be added for the suggestion that they afford proofs of design on the part of the living builders or that in the words of flinders they constitute breastworks defending the workshops from whence infant colonies might be safely sent forth  it was not till the beginning of the present century that travellers like beechey chamisso quoy and gaimard moresby nelson and others began to collect accurate details concerning the forms and structure of coralmasses and to make such observations on the habits of reefforming polyps as might serve as a basis for safe reasoning concerning the origin of coralreefs and islands  in the second volume of lyells principles of geology published in 1832 the final chapter gives an admirable summary of all that was then known on the subject  at that time the ringform of the atolls was almost universally regarded as a proof that they had grown up on submerged volcanic craters and lyell gave his powerful support to that theory  charles darwin was never tired of acknowledging his indebtedness to lyell in dedicating to his friend the second edition of his naturalists voyage round the world darwin writes that he does so with grateful pleasure as an acknowledgment that the chief part of whatever scientific merit this journal and the other works of the author may possess has been derived from studying the wellknown and admirable principles of geology  the second volume of lyells principles appeared after darwin had left england but it was doubtless sent on to him without delay by his faithful friend and correspondent professor henslow  it appears to have reached darwin at a most opportune moment while in fact he was studying the striking evidences of slow and longcontinued but often interrupted movement on the west coast of south america  darwins acute mind could not fail to detect the weakness of the then prevalent theory concerning the origin of the ringshaped atollsand the difficulty which he found in accepting the volcanic theory as an explanation of the phenomena of coralreefs is well set forth in his book  in an interesting fragment of autobiography darwin has given us a very clear account of the way in which the leading idea of the theory of coralreefs originated in his mind he writes no other work of mine was begun in so deductive a spirit as this for the whole theory was thought out on the west coast of south america before i had seen a true coralreef  i had therefore only to verify and extend my views by a careful examination of living reefs  but it should be observed that i had during the two previous years been incessantly attending to the effects on the shores of south america of the intermittent elevation of the land together with the denudation and deposition of sediment  this necessarily led me to reflect much on the effects of subsidence and it was easy to replace in imagination the continued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals  to do this was to form my theory of the formation of barrierreefs and atolls  on her homeward voyage the beagle visited tahiti australia and some of the coralislands in the indian ocean and darwin had an opportunity of testing and verifying the conclusion at which he had arrived by studying the statements of other observers  i well recollect a remarkable conversation i had with darwin shortly after the death of lyell  with characteristic modesty he told me that he never fully realised the importance of his theory of coralreefs till he had an opportunity of discussing it with lyell shortly after the return of the beagle  lyell on receiving from the lips of its author a sketch of the new theory was so overcome with delight that he danced about and threw himself into the wildest contortions as was his manner when excessively pleased  he wrote shortly afterwards to darwin as followsi could think of nothing for days after your lesson on coralreefs but of the tops of submerged continents  it is all true but do not flatter yourself that you will be believed till you are growing bald like me with hard work and vexation at the incredulity of the world  on may 24th 1837 lyell wrote to sir john herschel as followsi am very full of darwins new theory of coralislands and have urged whewell to make him read it at our next meeting  i must give up my volcanic crater forever though it cost me a pang at first for it accounted for so much  dr whewell was president of the geological society at the time and on may 31st 1837 darwin read a paper entitled on certain areas of elevation and subsidence in the pacific and indian oceans as deduced from the study of coral formations an abstract of which appeared in the second volume of the societys proceedings  it was about this time that darwin having settled himself in lodgings at great marlborough street commenced the writing of his book on coralreefs many delays from illhealth and the interruption of other work caused the progress to be slow and his journal speaks of recommencing the subject in february 1839 shortly after his marriage and again in october of the same year  in july 1841 he states that he began once more after more than thirteen months interval and the last proofsheet of the book was not corrected till may 6th 1842  darwin writes in his autobiography this book though a small one cost me twenty months of hard work as i had to read every work on the islands of the pacific and to consult many charts  the task of elaborating and writing out his books was with darwin always a very slow and laborious one but it is clear that in accomplishing the work now under consideration there was a long and constant struggle with the lethargy and weakness resulting from the sad condition of his health at that time  lyells anticipation that the theory of coralreefs would be slow in meeting with general acceptance was certainly not justified by the actual facts  on the contrary the new book was at once received with general assent among both geologists and zoologists and even attracted a considerable amount of attention from the general public  it was not long before the coralreef theory of darwin found an able exponent and sturdy champion in the person of the great american naturalist professor james d dana  two years after the return of the beagle to england the ships of the united states exploring expedition set sail upon their four years cruise under the command of captain wilkes and dana was a member of the scientific staff  when in 1839 the expedition arrived at sydney a newspaper paragraph was found which gave the american naturalist the first intimation of darwins new theory of the origin of atolls and barrierreefs  writing in 1872 dana describes the effect produced on his mind by reading this passagethe paragraph threw a flood of light over the subject and called forth feelings of peculiar satisfaction and of gratefulness to mr darwin which still come up afresh whenever the subject of coral islands is mentioned  the gambier islands in the paumotus which gave him the key to the theory i had not seen but on reaching the feejees six months later in 1840 i found there similar facts on a still grander scale and of a more diversified character so that i was afterward enabled to speak of his theory as established with more positiveness than he himself in his philosophic caution had been ready to adopt  his work on coralreefs appeared in 1842 when my report on the subject was already in manuscript  it showed that the conclusions on other points which we had independently reached were for the most part the same  the principal points of difference relate to the reason for the absence of corals from some coasts and the evidence therefrom as to changes of level and the distribution of the oceanic regions of elevation and subsidencetopics which a wide range of travel over the pacific brought directly and constantly to my attention  among the reports of the united states exploring expedition two important works from the pen of professor dana made their appearanceone on zoophytes which treats at length on corals and coralanimals and the other on coralreefs and islands  in 1872 dana prepared a work of a more popular character in which some of the chief results of his studies are described it bore the title of corals and coralislands  of this work new and enlarged editions appeared in 1874 and 1890 in america while two editions were published in this country in 1872 and 1875  in all these works their author while maintaining an independent judgment on certain matters of detail warmly defends the views of darwin on all points essential to the theory  another able exponent and illustrator of the theory of coralreefs was found in professor jb jukes who accompanied hms fly as naturalist during the survey of the great barrierreefin the years 1842 to 1846 jukes who was a man of great acuteness as well as independence of mind concludes his account of the great australian reefs with the following wordsafter seeing much of the great barrierreefs and reflecting much upon them and trying if it were possible by any means to evade the conclusions to which mr darwin has come i cannot help adding that his hypothesis is perfectly satisfactory to my mind and rises beyond a mere hypothesis into the true theory of coralreefs  as the result of the clear exposition of the subject by darwin lyell dana and jukes the theory of coralreefs had by the middle of the present century commanded the almost universal assent of both biologists and geologists  in 1859 baron von richthofen brought forward new facts in its support by showing that the existence of the thick masses of dolomitic limestone in the tyrol could be best accounted for if they were regarded as of coralline origin and as being formed during a period of long continued subsidence  the same views were maintained by professor mojsisovics in his dolomitriffe von sudtirol und venetien which appeared in 1879  the first serious note of dissent to the generally accepted theory was heard in 1863 when a distinguished german naturalist dr karl semper declared that his study of the pelew islands showed that uninterrupted subsidence could not have been going on in that region  dr sempers objections were very carefully considered by mr darwin and a reply to them appeared in the second and revised edition of his coralreefs which was published in 1874  with characteristic frankness and freedom from prejudice darwin admitted that the facts brought forward by dr semper proved that in certain specified cases subsidence could not have played the chief part in originating the peculiar forms of the coralislands  but while making this admission he firmly maintained that exceptional cases like those described in the pelew islands were not sufficient to invalidate the theory of subsidence as applied to the widely spread atolls encircling reefs and barrierreefs of the pacific and indian oceans  it is worthy of note that to the end of his life darwin maintained a friendly correspondence with semper concerning the points on which they were at issue  after the appearance of sempers work dr jj rein published an account of the bermudas in which he opposed the interpretation of the structure of the islands given by nelson and other authors and maintained that the facts observed in them are opposed to the views of darwin  although so far as i am aware darwin had no opportunity of studying and considering these particular objections it may be mentioned that two american geologists have since carefully reexamined the districtprofessor wn rice in 1884 and professor a heilprin in 1889and they have independently arrived at the conclusion that dr reins objections cannot be maintained  the most serious opposition to darwins coralreef theory however was that which developed itself after the return of hms challenger from her famous voyage  mr john murray one of the staff of naturalists on board that vessel propounded a new theory of coralreefs and maintained that the view that they were formed by subsidence was one that was no longer tenable these objections have been supported by professor alexander agassiz in the united states and by dr a geikie and dr hb guppy in this country  although mr darwin did not live to bring out a third edition of his coralreefs i know from several conversations with him that he had given the most patient and thoughtful consideration to mr murrays paper on the subject  he admitted to me that had he known when he wrote his work of the abundant deposition of the remains of calcareous organisms on the sea floor he might have regarded this cause as sufficient in a few cases to raise the summits of submerged volcanoes or other mountains to a level at which reefforming corals can commence to flourish  but he did not think that the admission that under certain favourable conditions atolls might be thus formed without subsidence necessitated an abandonment of his theory in the case of the innumerable examples of the kind which stud the indian and pacific oceans  a letter written by darwin to professor alexander agassiz in may 1881 shows exactly the attitude which careful consideration of the subject led him to maintain towards the theory propounded by mr murrayyou will have seen he writes mr murrays views on the formation of atolls and barrierreefs  before publishing my book i thought long over the same view but only as far as ordinary marine organisms are concerned for at that time little was known of the multitude of minute oceanic organisms  i rejected this view as from the few dredgings made in the beagle in the south temperate regions i concluded that shells the smaller corals etc decayed and were dissolved when not protected by the deposition of sediment and sediment could not accumulate in the open ocean  certainly shells etc were in several cases completely rotten and crumbled into mud between my fingers but you will know whether this is in any degree common  i have expressly said that a bank at the proper depth would give rise to an atoll which could not be distinguished from one formed during subsidence  i can however hardly believe in the existence of as many banks there having been no subsidence as there are atolls in the great oceans within a reasonable depth on which minute oceanic organisms could have accumulated to the depth of many hundred feet  darwins concluding words in the same letter written within a year of his death are a striking proof of the candour and openness of mind which he preserved so well to the end in this as in other controversies  if i am wrong the sooner i am knocked on the head and annihilated so much the better  it still seems to me a marvellous thing that there should not have been much and longcontinued subsidence in the beds of the great oceans  i wish some doubly rich millionaire would take it into his head to have borings made in some of the pacific and indian atolls and bring home cores for slicing from a depth of 500 or 600 feet  it is noteworthy that the objections to darwins theory have for the most part proceeded from zoologists while those who have fully appreciated the geological aspect of the question have been the staunchest supporters of the theory of subsidence  the desirability of such boring operations in atolls has been insisted upon by several geologists and it may be hoped that before many years have passed away darwins hopes may be realised either with or without the intervention of the doubly rich millionaire  three years after the death of darwin the veteran professor dana reentered the lists and contributed a powerful defence of the theory of subsidence in the form of a reply to an essay written by the ablest exponent of the antidarwinian views on this subject dr a geikie  while pointing out that the darwinian position had been to a great extent misunderstood by its opponents he showed that the rival theory presented even greater difficulties than those which it professed to remove  during the last five years the whole question of the origin of coralreefs and islands has been reopened and a controversy has arisen into which unfortunately acrimonious elements have been very unnecessarily introduced  those who desire it will find clear and impartial statements of the varied and often mutually destructive views put forward by different authors in three works which have made their appearance within the last yearthe bermuda islands by professor angelo heilprin corals and coralislands new edition by professor jd dana and the third edition of darwins coralreefs with notes and appendix by professor tg bonney  most readers will i think rise from the perusal of these works with the conviction that while on certain points of detail it is clear that through the want of knowledge concerning the action of marine organisms in the open ocean darwin was betrayed into some grave errors yet the main foundations of his argument have not been seriously impaired by the new facts observed in the deepsea researches or by the severe criticism to which his theory has been subjected during the last ten years  on the other hand i think it will appear that much misapprehension has been exhibited by some of darwins critics as to what his views and arguments really were so that the reprint and wide circulation of the book in its original form is greatly to be desired and cannot but be attended with advantage to all those who will have the fairness to acquaint themselves with darwins views at first hand before attempting to reply to them  john w judd   coralreefs  introduction  the object of this volume is to describe from my own observation and the works of others the principal kinds of coralreefs more especially those occurring in the open ocean and to explain the origin of their peculiar forms  i do not here treat of the polypifers which construct these vast works except so far as relates to their distribution and to the conditions favourable to their vigorous growth  without any distinct intention to classify coralreefs most voyagers have spoken of them under the following heads lagoonislands or atolls barrier or encircling reefs and fringing or shorereefs  the lagoonislands have received much the most attention and it is not surprising for every one must be struck with astonishment when he first beholds one of these vast rings of coralrock often many leagues in diameter here and there surmounted by a low verdant island with dazzling white shores bathed on the outside by the foaming breakers of the ocean and on the inside surrounding a calm expanse of water which from reflection is of a bright but pale green colour  the naturalist will feel this astonishment more deeply after having examined the soft and almost gelatinous bodies of these apparently insignificant creatures and when he knows that the solid reef increases only on the outer edge which day and night is lashed by the breakers of an ocean never at rest  well did francois pyrard de laval in the year 1605 exclaim cest une merueille de voir chacun de ces atollons enuironne dun grand banc de pierre tout autour ny ayant point dartifice humain  the accompanying sketch of whitsunday island in the south pacific taken from captain beecheys admirable voyage although excellent of its kind gives but a faint idea of the singular aspect of one of these lagoonislands  plate untitled woodcut whitsunday atoll  whitsunday island is of small size and the whole circle has been converted into land which is a comparatively rare circumstance  as the reef of a lagoonisland generally supports many separate small islands the word island applied to the whole is often the cause of confusion hence i have invariably used in this volume the term atoll which is the name given to these circular groups of coralislets by their inhabitants in the indian ocean and is synonymous with lagoonisland  plate untitled woodcut reef at bolabola island  barrierreefs when encircling small islands have been comparatively little noticed by voyagers but they well deserve attention  in their structure they are little less marvellous than atolls and they give a singular and most picturesque character to the scenery of the islands they surround  in the accompanying sketch taken from the voyage of the coquille the reef is seen from within from one of the high peaks of the island of bolabola  i have taken the liberty of simplifying the foreground and leaving out a mountainous island in the far distance here as in whitsunday island the whole of that part of the reef which is visible is converted into land  this is a circumstance of rare occurrence more usually a snowwhite line of great breakers with here and there an islet crowned by cocoanut trees separates the smooth waters of the lagoonlike channel from the waves of the open sea  the barrierreefs of australia and of new caledonia owing to their enormous dimensions have excited much attention in structure and form they resemble those encircling many of the smaller islands in the pacific ocean  with respect to fringing or shorereefs there is little in their structure which needs explanation and their name expresses their comparatively small extension  they differ from barrierreefs in not lying so far from the shore and in not having within a broad channel of deep water  reefs also occur around submerged banks of sediment and of worndown rock and others are scattered quite irregularly where the sea is very shallow these in most respects are allied to those of the fringing class but they are of comparatively little interest  i have given a separate chapter to each of the above classes and have described some one reef or island on which i possessed most information as typical and have afterwards compared it with others of a like kind although this classification is useful from being obvious and from including most of the coralreefs existing in the open sea it admits of a more fundamental division into barrier and atollformed reefs on the one hand where there is a great apparent difficulty with respect to the foundation on which they must first have grown and into fringingreefs on the other where owing to the nature of the slope of the adjoining land there is no such difficulty  the two blue tints and the red colour replaced by numbers in this edition on the map plate iii represent this main division as explained in the beginning of the last chapter  in the appendix every existing coralreef except some on the coast of brazil not included in the map is briefly described in geographical order as far as i possessed information and any particular spot may be found by consulting the index  several theories have been advanced to explain the origin of atolls or lagoonislands but scarcely one to account for barrierreefs  from the limited depths at which reefbuilding polypifers can flourish taken into consideration with certain other circumstances we are compelled to conclude as it will be seen that both in atolls and barrierreefs the foundation on which the coral was primarily attached has subsided and that during this downward movement the reefs have grown upwards  this conclusion it will be further seen explains most satisfactorily the outline and general form of atolls and barrierreefs and likewise certain peculiarities in their structure  the distribution also of the different kinds of coralreefs and their position with relation to the areas of recent elevation and to the points subject to volcanic eruptions fully accord with this theory of their origin  a brief account of my views on coral formations now published in my journal of researches was read may 31st 1837 before the geological society and an abstract has appeared in the proceedings   description of the plates  plate imap showing the resemblance in form between barrier coralreefs surrounding mountainous islands and atolls or lagoon islands  in the several original surveys from which the small plans on this plate have been reduced the coralreefs are engraved in very different styles for the sake of uniformity i have adopted the style used in the charts of the chagos archipelago published by the east indian company from the survey by captain moresby and lieutenant powell  the surface of the reef which dries at low water is represented by a surface with small crosses the coralislets on the reef are marked by small linear spaces on which a few cocoanut trees out of all proportion too large have been introduced for the sake of clearness  the entire annular reef which when surrounding an open expanse of water forms an atoll and when surrounding one or more high islands forms an encircling barrierreef has a nearly uniform structure  the reefs in some of the original surveys are represented merely by a single line with crosses so that their breadth is not given i have had such reefs engraved of the width usually attained by coralreefs i have not thought it worth while to introduce all those small and very numerous reefs which occur within the lagoons of most atolls and within the lagoonchannels of most barrierreefs and which stand either isolated or are attached to the shores of the reef or land  at peros banhos none of the lagoonreefs rise to the surface of the water a few of them have been introduced and are marked by plain dotted circles  a few of the deepest soundings are laid down within each reef they are in fathoms of six english feet  figure 1vanikoro situated in the western part

instance been represented  the southern shore of the island is narrowly fringed by a reef if the engraver had carried this reef entirely round both islands this figure would have served by leaving out in imagination the barrierreef as a good specimen of an abruptlysided island surrounded by a reef of the fringing class  figure 2hogoleu or roug in the caroline archipelago taken from the atlas of the

of hms beagle is given in plate i figure 10  the greatest width of this atoll is nine miles and a half  its structure is in most respects characteristic of the class to which it belongs with the exception of the shallowness of the lagoon  the accompanying woodcut represents a vertical section supposed to be drawn at low water from the outer coast across one of the low islets one being taken of average dimensions to within the lagoon  the section is true to the scale in a horizontal line but it could not be made so in a vertical one as the average greatest height of the land is only between six and twelve feet above highwater mark  i will describe the section commencing with the outer margin  i must first observe that the reefbuilding polypifers not being tidal animals require to be constantly submerged or washed by the breakers  i was assured by mr liesk a very intelligent resident on these islands as well as by some chiefs at tahiti otaheite that an exposure to the rays of the sun for a very short time invariably causes their destruction  hence it is possible only under the most favourable circumstances afforded by an unusually low tide and smooth water to reach the outer margin where the coral is alive  i succeeded only twice in gaining this part and found it almost entirely composed of a living porites which forms great irregularly rounded masses like those of an astraea but larger from four to eight feet broad and little less in thickness  these mounds are separated from each other by narrow crooked channels about six feet deep most of which intersect the line of reef at right angles  on the furthest mound which i was able to reach by the aid of a leapingpole and over which the sea broke with some violence although the day was quite calm and the tide low the polypifers in the uppermost cells were all dead but between three and four inches lower down on its side they were living and formed a projecting border round the upper and dead surface  the coral being thus checked in its upward growth extends laterally and hence most of the masses especially those a little further inwards had broad flat dead summits  on the other hand i could see during the recoil of the breakers that a few yards further seaward the whole convex surface of the porites was alive so that the point where we were standing was almost on the exact upward and shoreward limit of existence of those corals which form the outer margin of the reef  we shall presently see that there are other organic productions fitted to bear a somewhat longer exposure to the air and sun  next but much inferior in importance to the porites is the millepora complanata  this millepora palmipora of blainville as well as the m alcicornis possesses the singular property of stinging the skin where it is delicate as on the face and arm  it grows in thick vertical plates intersecting each other at various angles and forms an exceedingly strong honeycombed mass which generally affects a circular form the marginal plates alone being alive  between these plates and in the protected crevices on the reef a multitude of branching zoophytes and other productions flourish but the porites and millepora alone seem able to resist the fury of the breakers on its upper and outer edge at the depth of a few fathoms other kinds of stony corals live  mr liesk who was intimately acquainted with every part of this reef and likewise with that of north keeling atoll assured me that these corals invariably compose the outer margin  the lagoon is inhabited by quite a distinct set of corals generally brittle and thinly branched but a porites apparently of the same species with that on the outside is found there although it does not seem to thrive and certainly does not attain the thousandth part in bulk of the masses opposed to the breakers  the woodcut shows the form of the bottom off the reef the water deepens for a space between one and two hundred yards wide very gradually to twentyfive fathoms a in section beyond which the sides plunge into the unfathomable ocean at an angle of 45 deg  the soundings from which this section is laid down were taken with great care by captain fitzroy himself he used a bellshaped lead having a diameter of four inches and the armings each time were cut off and brought on board for me to examine  the arming is a preparation of tallow placed in the concavity at the bottom of the lead  sand and even small fragments of rock will adhere to it and if the bottom be of rock it brings up an exact impression of its surface to the depth of ten or twelve fathoms the bottom is exceedingly rugged and seems formed of great masses of living coral similar to those on the margin  the arming of the lead here invariably came up quite clean but deeply indented and chains and anchors which were lowered in the hopes of tearing up the coral were broken  many small fragments however of millepora alcicornis were brought up and on the arming from an eightfathom cast there was a perfect impression of an astraea apparently alive  i examined the rolled fragments cast on the beach during gales in order further to ascertain what corals grew outside the reef  the fragments consisted of many kinds of which the porites already mentioned and a madrepora apparently the m corymbosa were the most abundant  as i searched in vain in the hollows on the reef and in the lagoon for a living specimen of this madrepore i conclude that it is confined to a zone outside and beneath the surface where it must be very abundant fragments of the millepora alcicornis and of an astraea were also numerous the former is found but not in proportionate numbers in the hollows on the reef but the astraea i did not see living  hence we may infer that these are the kinds of coral which form the rugged sloping surface represented in the woodcut by an uneven line round and beneath the external margin  between twelve and twenty fathoms the arming came up an equal number of times smoothed with sand and indented with coral an anchor and lead were lost at the respective depths of thirteen and sixteen fathoms  out of twentyfive soundings taken at a greater depth than twenty fathoms every one showed that the bottom was covered with sand whereas at a less depth than twelve fathoms every sounding showed that it was exceedingly rugged and free from all extraneous particles  two soundings were obtained at the depth of 360 fathoms and several between two hundred and three hundred fathoms  the sand brought up from these depths consisted of finely triturated fragments of stony zoophytes but not as far as i could distinguish of a particle of any lamelliform genus fragments of shells were rare  at a distance of 2200 yards from the breakers captain fitzroy found no bottom with a line of 7200 feet in length hence the submarine slope of this coral formation is steeper than that of any volcanic cone  off the mouth of the lagoon and likewise off the northern point of the atoll where the currents act violently the inclination owing to the accumulation of sediment is less  as the arming of the lead from all the greater depths showed a smooth sandy bottom i at first concluded that the whole consisted of a vast conical pile of calcareous sand but the sudden increase of depth at some points and the circumstance of the line having been cut as if rubbed when between five hundred and six hundred fathoms were out indicate the probable existence of submarine cliffs  on the margin of the reef close within the line where the upper surface of the porites and of the millepora is dead three species of nullipora flourish  one grows in thin sheets like a lichen on old trees the second in stony knobs as thick as a mans finger radiating from a common centre and the third which is less common in a mosslike reticulation of thin but perfectly rigid branches  this last species is of a beautiful bright peachblossom colour  its branches are about as thick as crowquills they are slightly flattened and knobbed at the extremities  the extremities only are alive and brightly coloured  the two other species are of a dirty purplishwhite  the second species is extremely hard its short knoblike branches are cylindrical and do not grow thicker at their extremities the three species occur either separately or mingled together and they form by their successive growth a layer two or three feet in thickness which in some cases is hard but where formed of the lichenlike kind readily yields an impression to the hammer the surface is of a reddish colour  these nulliporae although able to exist above the limit of true corals seem to require to be bathed during the greater part of each tide by breaking water for they are not found in any abundance in the protected hollows on the back part of the reef where they might be immersed either during the whole or an equal proportional time of each tide  it is remarkable that organic productions of such extreme simplicity for the nulliporae undoubtedly belong to one of the lowest classes of the vegetable kingdom should be limited to a zone so peculiarly circumstanced  hence the layer composed by their growth merely fringes the reef for a space of about twenty yards in width either under the form of separate mammillated projections where the outer masses of coral are separate or more commonly where the corals are united into a solid margin as a continuous smooth convex mound b in woodcut like an artificial breakwater  both the mound and mammillated projections stand about three feet higher than any other part of the reef by which term i do not include the islets formed by the accumulation of rolled fragments  we shall hereafter see that other coral reefs are protected by a similar thick growth of nulliporae on the outer margin the part most exposed to the breakers and this must effectually aid in preserving it from being worn down  the woodcut represents a section across one of the islets on the reef but if all that part which is above the level of c were removed the section would be that of a simple reef as it occurs where no islet has been formed  it is this reef which essentially forms the atoll  it is a ring enclosing the lagoon on all sides except at the northern end where there are two open spaces through one of which ships can enter  the reef varies in width from two hundred and fifty to five hundred yards its surface is level or very slightly inclined towards the lagoon and at high tide the sea breaks entirely over it the water at low tide thrown by the breakers on the reef is carried by the many narrow and shoal gullies or channels on its surface into the lagoon a return stream sets out of the lagoon through the main entrance  the most frequent coral in the hollows on the reef is pocillopora verrucosa which grows in short sinuous plates or branches and when alive is of a beautiful pale lakered a madrepora closely allied or identical with m pocillifera is also common  as soon as an islet is formed and the waves are prevented breaking entirely over the reef the channels and hollows in it become filled up with cemented fragments and its surface is converted into a hard smooth floor c of woodcut like an artificial one of freestone  this flat surface varies in width from one hundred to two hundred or even three hundred yards and is strewed with a few large fragments of coral torn up during gales it is uncovered only at low water  i could with difficulty and only by the aid of a chisel procure chips of rock from its surface and therefore could not ascertain how much of it is formed by the aggregation of detritus and how much by the outward growth of mounds of corals similar to those now living on the margin  nothing can be more singular than the appearance at low tide of this flat of naked stone especially where it is externally bounded by the smooth convex mound of nulliporae appearing like a breakwater built to resist the waves which are constantly throwing over it sheets of foaming water  the characteristic appearance of this flat is shown in the foregoing woodcut of whitsunday atoll  the islets on the reef are first formed between two hundred and three hundred yards from its outer edge through the accumulation of a pile of fragments thrown together by some unusually strong gale  their ordinary width is under a quarter of a mile and their length varies from a few yards to several miles  those on the southeast and windward side of the atoll increase solely by the addition of fragments on their outer side hence the loose blocks of coral of which their surface is composed as well as the shells mingled with them almost exclusively consist of those kinds which live on the outer coast  the highest part of the islets excepting hillocks of blown sand some of which are thirty feet high is close to the outer beach e of the woodcut and averages from six to ten feet above ordinary highwater mark  from the outer beach the surface slopes gently to the shores of the lagoon which no doubt has been caused by the breakers the further they have rolled over the reef having had less power to throw up fragments  the little waves of the lagoon heap up sand and fragments of thinlybranched corals on the inner side of the islets on the leeward side of the atoll and these islets are broader than those to windward some being even eight hundred yards in width but the land thus added is very low  the fragments beneath the surface are cemented into a solid mass which is exposed as a ledge d of the woodcut projecting some yards in front of the outer shore and from two to four feet high  this ledge is just reached by the waves at ordinary highwater it extends in front of all the islets and everywhere has a waterworn and scooped appearance  the fragments of coral which are occasionally cast on the flat are during gales of unusual violence swept together on the beach where the waves each day at highwater tend to remove and gradually wear them down but the lower fragments having become firmly cemented together by the percolation of calcareous matter resist the daily tides longer and hence project as a ledge  the cemented mass is generally of a white colour but in some few parts reddish from ferruginous matter it is very hard and is sonorous under the hammer it is obscurely divided by seams dipping at a small angle seaward it consists of fragments of the corals which grow on the outer margin some quite and others partially rounded some small and others between two and three feet across and of masses of previously formed conglomerate torn up rounded and recemented or it consists of a calcareous sandstone entirely composed of rounded particles generally almost blended together of shells corals the spines of echini and other such organic bodies rocks of this latter kind occur on many shores where there are no coral reefs  the structure of the coral in the conglomerate has generally been much obscured by the infiltration of spathose calcareous matter and i collected a very interesting series beginning with fragments of unaltered coral and ending with others where it was impossible to discover with the naked eye any trace of organic structure  in some specimens i was unable even with the aid of a lens and by wetting them to distinguish the boundaries of the altered coral and spathose limestone  many even of the blocks of coral lying loose on the beach had their central parts altered and infiltrated  the lagoon alone remains to be described it is much shallower than that of most atolls of considerable size  the southern part is almost filled up with banks of mud and fields of coral both dead and alive but there are considerable spaces between three and four fathoms and smaller basins from eight to ten fathoms deep  probably about half its area consists of sediment and half of coralreefs  the corals composing these reefs have a very different aspect from those on the outside they are very numerous in kind and most of them are thinly branched  meandrina however lives in the lagoon and great rounded masses of this coral are numerous lying quite or almost loose on the bottom  the other commonest kinds consist of three closely allied species of true madrepora in thin branches of seriatapora subulata two species of porites this porites has somewhat the habit of p clavaria but the branches are not knobbed at their ends  when alive it is of a yellow colour but after having been washed in fresh water and placed to dry a jetblack slimy substance exuded from the entire surface so that the specimen now appears as if it had been dipped in ink with cylindrical branches one of which forms circular clumps with the exterior branches only alive and lastly a coral something like an explanaria but with stars on both surfaces growing in thin brittle stony foliaceous expansions especially in the deeper basins of the lagoon  the reefs on which these corals grow are very irregular in form are full of cavities and have not a solid flat surface of dead rock like that surrounding the lagoon nor can they be nearly so hard for the inhabitants made with crowbars a channel of considerable length through these reefs in which a schooner built on the se islet was floated out it is a very interesting circumstance pointed out to us by mr liesk that this channel although made less than ten years before our visit was then as we saw almost choked up with living coral so that fresh excavations would be absolutely necessary to allow another vessel to pass through it  the sediment from the deepest parts in the lagoon when wet appeared chalky but when dry like very fine sand  large soft banks of similar but even finer grained mud occur on the se shore of the lagoon affording a thick growth of a fucus on which turtle feed this mud although discoloured by vegetable matter appears from its entire solution in acids to be purely calcareous  i have seen in the museum of the geological society a similar but more remarkable substance brought by lieutenant nelson from the reefs of bermuda which when shown to several experienced geologists was mistaken by them for true chalk  on the outside of the reef much sediment must be formed by the action of the surf on the rolled fragments of coral but in the calm waters of the lagoon this can take place only in a small degree  there are however other and unexpected agents at work here large shoals of two species of scarus one inhabiting the surf outside the reef and the other the lagoon subsist entirely as i was assured by mr liesk the intelligent resident before referred to by browsing on the living polypifers  i opened several of these fish which are very numerous and of considerable size and i found their intestines distended by small pieces of coral and finely ground calcareous matter  this must daily pass from them as the finest sediment much also must be produced by the infinitely numerous vermiform and molluscous animals which make cavities in almost every block of coral dr j allan of forres who has enjoyed the best means of observation informs me in a letter that the holothuriae a family of radiata subsist on living coral and the singular structure of bone within the anterior extremity of their bodies certainly appears well adapted for this purpose the number of the species of holothuria and of the individuals which swarm on every part of these coralreefs is extraordinarily great and many shiploads are annually freighted as is wellknown for china with the trepang which is a species of this genus  the amount of coral yearly consumed and ground down into the finest mud by these several creatures and probably by many other kinds must be immense  these facts are however of more importance in another point of view as showing us that there are living checks to the growth of coralreefs and that the almost universal law of consumed and be consumed holds good even with the polypifers forming those massive bulwarks which are able to withstand the force of the open ocean  considering that keeling atoll like other coral formations has been entirely formed by the growth of organic beings and the accumulation of their detritus one is naturally led to inquire how long it has continued and how long it is likely to continue in its present state  mr liesk informed me that he had seen an old chart in which the present long island on the se side was divided by several channels into as many islets and he assures me that the channels can still be distinguished by the smaller size of the trees on them  on several islets also i observed that only young cocoanut trees were growing on the extremities and that older and taller trees rose in regular succession behind them which shows that these islets have very lately increased in length  in the upper and southeastern part of the lagoon i was much surprised by finding an irregular field of at least a mile square of branching corals still upright but entirely dead  they consisted of the species already mentioned they were of a brown colour and so rotten that in trying to stand on them i sank halfway up the leg as if through decayed brushwood  the tops of the branches were barely covered by water at the time of lowest tide  several facts having led me to disbelieve in any elevation of the whole atoll i was at first unable to imagine what cause could have killed so large a field of coral  upon reflection however it appeared to me that the closing up of the abovementioned channels would be a sufficient cause for before this a strong breeze by forcing water through them into the head of the lagoon would tend to raise its level  but now this cannot happen and the inhabitants observe that the tide rises to a less height during a high se wind at the head than at the mouth of the lagoon  the corals which under the former condition of things had attained the utmost possible limit of upward growth would thus occasionally be exposed for a short time to the sun and be killed  besides the increase of dry land indicated by the foregoing facts the exterior solid reef appears to have grown outwards  on the western side of the atoll the flat lying between the margin of the reef and the beach is very wide and in front of the regular beach with its conglomerate basis there is in most parts a bed of sand and loose fragments with trees growing out of it which apparently is not reached even by the spray at high water  it is evident some change has taken place since the waves formed the inner beach that they formerly beat against it with violence was evident from a remarkably thick and waterworn point of conglomerate at one spot now protected by vegetation and a bank of sand that they beat against it in the same peculiar manner in which the swell from windward now obliquely curls round the margin of the reef was evident from the conglomerate having been worn into a point projecting from the beach in a similarly oblique manner  this retreat in the line of action of the breakers might result either from the surface of the reef in front of the islets having been submerged at one time and afterward having grown upwards or from the mounds of coral on the margin having continued to grow outwards  that an outward growth of this part is in process can hardly be doubted from the fact already mentioned of the mounds of porites with their summits apparently lately killed and their sides only three or four inches lower down thickened by a fresh layer of living coral  but there is a difficulty on this supposition which i must not pass over  if the whole or a large part of the flat had been formed by the outward growth of the margin each successive margin would naturally have been coated by the nulliporae and so much of the surface would have been of equal height with the existing zone of living nulliporae this is not the case as may be seen in the woodcut  it is however evident from the abraded state of the flat with its original inequalities filled up that its surface has been much modified and it is possible that the hinder portions of the zone of nulliporae perishing as the reef grows outwards might be worn down by the surf  if this has not taken place the reef can in no part have increased outwards in breadth since its formation or at least since the nulliporae formed the convex mound on its margin for the zone thus formed and which stands between two and three feet above the other parts of the reef is nowhere much above twenty yards in width  thus far we have considered facts which indicate with more or less probability the increase of the atoll in its different parts there are others having an opposite tendency  on the southeast side lieutenant sulivan to whose kindness i am indebted for many interesting observations found the conglomerate projecting on the reef nearly fifty yards in front of the beach we may infer from what we see in all other parts of the atoll that the conglomerate was not originally so much exposed but formed the base of an islet the front and upper part of which has since been swept away  the degree to which the conglomerate round nearly the whole atoll has been scooped broken up and the fragments cast on the beach is certainly very surprising even on the view that it is the office of occasional gales to pile up fragments and of the daily tides to wear them away  on the western side also of the atoll where i have described a bed of sand and fragments with trees growing out of it in front of an old beach it struck both lieutenant sulivan and myself from the manner in which the trees were being washed down that the surf had lately recommenced an attack on this line of coast  appearances indicating a slight encroachment of the water on the land are plainer within the lagoon i noticed in several places both on its windward and leeward shores old cocoanut trees falling with their roots undermined and the rotten stumps of others on the beach where the inhabitants assured us the cocoanut could not now grow  captain fitzroy pointed out to me near the settlement the foundation posts of a shed now washed by every tide but which the inhabitants stated had seven years before stood above high watermark  in the calm waters of the lagoon directly connected with a great and therefore stable ocean it seems very improbable that a change in the currents sufficiently great to cause the water to eat into the land on all sides should have taken place within a limited period  from these considerations i inferred that probably the atoll had lately subsided to a small amount and this inference was strengthened by the circumstance that in 1834 two years before our visit the island had been shaken by a severe earthquake and by two slighter ones during the ten previous years  if during these subterranean disturbances the atoll did subside the downward movement must have been very small as we must conclude from the fields of dead coral still lipping the surface of the lagoon and from the breakers on the western shore not having yet regained the line of their former action  the subsidence must also have been preceded by a long period of rest during which the islets extended to their present size and the living margin of the reef grew either upwards or as i believe outwards to its present distance from the beach  whether this view be correct or not the above facts are worthy of attention as showing how severe a struggle is in progress on these low coral formations between the two nicely balanced powers of land and water with respect to the future state of keeling atoll if left undisturbed we can see that the islets may still extend in length but as they cannot resist the surf until broken by rolling over a wide space their increase in breadth must depend on the increasing breadth of the reef and this must be limited by the steepness of the submarine flanks which can be added to only by sediment derived from the wear and tear of the coral  from the rapid growth of the coral in the channel cut for the schooner and from the several agents at work in producing fine sediment it might be thought that the lagoon would necessarily become quickly filled up  some of this sediment however is transported into the open sea as appears from the soundings off the mouth of the lagoon instead of being deposited within it  the deposition moreover of sediment checks the growth of coralreefs so that these two agencies cannot act together with full effect in filling it up  we know so little of the habits of the many different species of corals which form the lagoonreefs that we have no more reasons for supposing that their whole surface would grow up as quickly as the coral did in the schoonerchannel than for supposing that the whole surface of a peatmoss would increase as quickly as parts are known to do in holes where the peat has been cut away  these agencies nevertheless tend to fill up the lagoon but in proportion as it becomes shallower so must the polypifers be subject to many injurious agencies such as impure water and loss of food  for instance mr liesk informed me that some years before our visit unusually heavy rain killed nearly all the fish in the lagoon and probably the same cause would likewise injure the corals the reefs also it must be remembered cannot possibly rise above the level of the lowest springtide so that the final conversion of the lagoon into land must be due to the accumulation of sediment and in the midst of the clear water of the ocean and with no surrounding high land this process must be exceedingly slow   section 1iigeneral description of atolls  general form and size of atolls their reefs and isletsexternal slope zone of nulliporaeconglomeratedepth of lagoonssedimentreefs submerged wholly or in partbreaches in the reefledgeformed shores round certain lagoonsconversion of lagoons into land  i will here give a sketch of the general form and structure of the many atolls and atollformed reefs which occur in the pacific and indian oceans comparing them with keeling atoll  the maldiva atolls and the great chagos bank differ in so many respects that i shall devote to them besides occasional references a third section of this chapter  keeling atoll may be considered as of moderate dimensions and of regular form  of the thirtytwo islands surveyed by captain beechey in the low archipelago the longest was found to be thirty miles and the shortest less than a mile but vliegen atoll situated in another part of the same group appears to be sixty miles long and twenty broad  most of the atolls in this group are of an elongated form thus bow island is thirty miles in length and on an average only six in width see figure 4 plate i and clermont tonnere has nearly the same proportions  in the marshall archipelago the ralick and radack group of kotzebue several of the atolls are more than thirty miles in length and rimsky korsacoff is fiftyfour long and twenty wide at the broadest part of its irregular outline  most of the atolls in the maldiva archipelago are of great size one of them which however bears a double name measured in a medial and slightly curved line is no less than eightyeight geographical miles long its greatest width being under twenty and its least only nine and a half miles  some atolls have spurs projecting from them and in the marshall group there are atolls united together by linear reefs for instance menchikoff island see figure 3 plate ii which is sixty miles in length and consists of three loops tied together  in far the greater number of cases an atoll consists of a simple elongated ring with its outline moderately regular  the average width of the annular wreath may be taken as about a quarter of a mile  captain beechey beecheys voyage to the pacific and beerings straits chapter viii says that in the atolls of the low archipelago it exceeded in no instance half a mile  the description given of the structure and proportional dimensions of the reef and islets of keeling atoll appears to apply perfectly to nearly all the atolls in the pacific and indian oceans  the islets are first formed some way back either on the projecting points of the reef especially if its form be angular or on the sides of the main entrances into the lagoonthat is in both cases on points where the breakers can act during gales of wind in somewhat different directions so that the matter thrown up from one side may accumulate against that before thrown up from another  in lutkes chart of the caroline atolls we see many instances of the former case and the occurrence of islets as if placed for beacons on the points where there is a gateway or breach through the reef has been noticed by several authors  there are some atollformed reefs rising to the surface of the sea and partly dry at low water on which from some cause islets have never been formed and there are others on which they have been formed but have subsequently been worn away  in atolls of small dimensions the islets frequently become united into a single horseshoe or ringformed strip but diego garcia although an atoll of considerable size being thirteen miles and a half in length has its lagoon entirely surrounded except at the northern end by a belt of land on an average a third of a mile in width to show how small the total area of the annular reef and the land is in islands of this class i may quote a remark from the voyage of lutke namely that if the fortythree rings or atolls in the caroline archipelago were put one within another and over a steeple in the centre of st petersburg the whole world would not cover that city and its suburbs  the form of the bottom off keeling atoll which gradually slopes to about twenty fathoms at the distance of between one and two hundred yards from the edge of the reef and then plunges at an angle of 45 deg into unfathomable depths is exactly the same the form of the bottom round the marshall atolls in the northern pacific is probably similar kotzebue first voyage volume ii page 16 says we had at a small distance from the reef forty fathoms depth which increased a little further so much that we could find no bottom with that of the sections of the atolls in the low archipelago given by captain beechey  the nature however of the bottom seems to differ for this officer i must be permitted to express my obligation to captain beechey for the very kind manner in which he has given me information on several points and to own the great assistance i have derived from his excellent published work informs me that all the soundings even the deepest were on coral but he does not know whether dead or alive  the slope round christmas atoll lat 1 deg 4 n 157 deg 45 w described by cook cooks third voyage volume ii chapter 10 is considerably less at about half a mile from the edge of the reef the average depth was about fourteen fathoms on a fine sandy bottom and at a mile only between twenty and forty fathoms it has no doubt been owing to this gentle slope that the strip of land surrounding its lagoon has increased in one part to the extraordinary width of three miles it is formed of successive ridges of broken shells and corals like those on the beach  i know of no other instance of such width in the reef of an atoll but mr fd bennett informs me that the inclination of the bottom round caroline atoll in the pacific is like that off christmas island very gentle  off the maldiva and chagos atolls the inclination is much more abrupt thus at heawandoo pholo lieutenant powell this fact is taken from a ms account of these groups lent me by captain moresby  see also captain moresbys paper on the maldiva atolls in the geographical journal volume v page 401 found fifty and sixty fathoms close to the edge of the reef and at 300 yards distance there was no bottom with a 300yard line  captain moresby informs me that at 100 fathoms from the mouth of the lagoon of diego garcia he found no bottom with 150 fathoms this is the more remarkable as the slope is generally less abrupt in front of channels through a reef owing to the accumulation of sediment  at egmont island also at 150 fathoms from the reef soundings were struck with 150 fathoms  lastly at cardoo atoll only sixty yards from the reef no bottom was obtained as i am informed by captain moresby with a line of 200 fathoms  the currents run with great force round these atolls and where they are strongest the inclination appears to be most abrupt  i am informed by the same authority that wherever soundings were obtained off these islands the bottom was invariably sandy nor was there any reason to suspect the existence of submarine cliffs as there was at keeling island  off some of the islands in the low archipelago the bottom appears to descend by ledges  off elizabeth island which however consists of raised coral captain beechey page 45 4to edition describes three ledges the first had an easy slope from the beach to a distance of about fifty yards the second extended two hundred yards with twentyfive fathoms on it and then ended abruptly like the first and immediately beyond this there was no bottom with two hundred fathoms  here then occurs a difficulty can sand accumulate on a slope which in some cases appears to exceed fiftyfive degrees  it must be observed that i speak of slopes where soundings were obtained and not of such cases as that of cardoo where the nature of the bottom is unknown and where its inclination must be nearly vertical  m elie de beaumont memoires pour servir a une description geolog de france tome iv page 216 has argued and there is no higher authority on this subject from the inclination at which snow slides down in avalanches that a bed of sand or mud cannot be formed at a greater angle than thirty degrees considering the number of soundings on sand obtained round the maldiva and chagos atolls which appears to indicate a greater angle and the extreme abruptness of the sandbanks in the west indies as will be mentioned in the appendix i must conclude that the adhesive property of wet sand counteracts its gravity in a much greater ratio than has been allowed for by m elie de beaumont  from the facility with which calcareous sand becomes agglutinated it is not necessary to suppose that the bed of loose sand is thick  captain beechey has observed that the submarine slope is much less at the extremities of the more elongated atolls in the low archipelago than at their sides in speaking of ducies island he says beecheys voyage 4to edition page 44 the buttress as it may be called which has the most powerful enemy the sw swell to oppose is carried out much further and with less abruptness than the other  in some cases the less inclination of a certain part of the external slope for instance of the northern extremities of the two keeling atolls is caused by a prevailing current which there accumulates a bed of sand  where the water is perfectly tranquil as within a lagoon the reefs generally grow up perpendicularly and sometimes even overhang their bases on the other hand on the leeward side of mauritius where the water is generally tranquil although not invariably so the reef is very gently inclined  hence it appears that the exterior angle varies much nevertheless in the close similarity in form between the sections of keeling atoll and of the atolls in the low archipelago in the general steepness of the reefs of the maldiva and chagos atolls and in the perpendicularity of those rising out of water always tranquil we may discern the effects of uniform laws but from the complex action of the surf and currents on the growing powers of the coral and on the deposition of sediment we can by no means follow out all the results  where islets have been formed on the reef that part which i have sometimes called the flat and which is partly dry at low water appears similar in every atoll  in the marshall group in the north pacific it may be inferred from chamissos description that the reef where islets have not been formed on it slopes gently from the external margin to the shores of the lagoon flinders states that the australian barrier has a similar inclination inwards and i have no doubt it is of general occurrence although according to ehrenberg the reefs of the red sea offer an exception  chamisso observes that the red colour of the reef at the marshall atolls under the breakers is caused by a nullipora which covers the stone wherever the waves beat and under favourable circumstances assumes a stalactical forma description perfectly applicable to the margin of keeling atoll  kotzebues first voyage volume iii page 142  near porto praya in the cape de verde islands some basaltic rocks lashed by no inconsiderable surf were completely enveloped with a layer of nulliporae  the entire surface over many square inches was coloured of a peachblossomed red the layer however was of no greater thickness than paper  another kind in the form of projecting knobs grew in the same situation  these nulliporae are closely related to those described on the coralreefs but i believe are of different species  although chamisso does not state that the masses of nulliporae form points or a mound higher than the flat yet i believe that this is the case for kotzebue kotzebue first voyage volume ii page 16  lieutenant nelson in his excellent memoir in the geological transactions volume ii page 105 alludes to the rocky points mentioned by kotzebue and infers that they consist of serpulae which compose incrusting masses on the reefs of bermudas as they likewise do on a sandstone bar off the coast of brazil which i have described in london phil journal october 1841  these masses of serpulae hold the same position relatively to the action of the sea with the nulliporae on the coralreefs in the indian and pacific oceans in another part speaks of the rocks on the edge of the reef as visible for about two feet at low water and these rocks we may feel quite certain are not formed of true coral captain moresby in his valuable paper on the northern atolls of maldivas geographical journal volume v says that the edges of the reefs there stand above water at low springtides whether a smooth convex mound of nulliporae like that which appears as if artificially constructed to protect the margin of keeling island is of frequent occurrence round atolls i know not but we shall presently meet with it under precisely the same form on the outer edge of the barrierreefs which encircle the society islands  there appears to be scarcely a feature in the structure of keeling reef which is not of common if not of universal occurrence in other atolls thus chamisso describes kotzebues first voyage volume iii page 144 a layer of coarse conglomerate outside the islets round the marshall atolls which appears on its upper surface uneven and eaten away  from drawings with appended remarks of diego garcia in the chagos group and of several of the maldiva atolls shown me by captain moresby see also moresby on the northern atolls of the maldivas geographical journal volume v page 400 it is evident that their outer coasts are subject to the same round of decay and renovation as those of keeling atoll  from the description of the atolls in the low archipelago given in captain beecheys voyage it is not apparent that any conglomerate coralrock was there observed  the lagoon in keeling atoll is shallow in the atolls of the low archipelago the depth varies from 20 to 38 fathoms and in the marshall group according to chamisso from 30 to 35 in the caroline atolls it is only a little less  within the maldiva atolls there are large spaces with 45 fathoms and some soundings are laid down of 49 fathoms  the greater part of the bottom in most lagoons is formed of sediment large spaces have exactly the same depth or the depth varies so insensibly that it is evident that no other means excepting aqueous deposition could have leveled the surface so equally  in the maldiva atolls this is very conspicuous and likewise in some of the caroline and marshall islands  in the former large spaces consist of sand and soft clay and kotzebue speaks of clay having been found within one of the marshall atolls  no doubt this clay is calcareous mud similar to that at keeling island and to that at bermuda already referred to as undistinguishable from disintegrated chalk and which lieutenant nelson says is called there pipeclay  i may here observe that on the coast of brazil where there is much coral the soundings near the land are described by admiral roussin in the pilote du bresil as siliceous sand mingled with much finely comminuted particles of shells and coral  further in the offing for a space of 1300 miles along the coast from the abrolhos islands to maranham the bottom in many places is composed of tuf blanc mele ou forme de madrepores broyes this white substance probably is analogous to that which occurs within the abovementioned lagoons it is sometimes according to roussin firm and he compares it to mortar  where the waves act with unequal force on the two sides of an atoll the islets appear to be first formed and are generally of greater continuity on the more exposed shore  the islets also which are placed to leeward are in most parts of the pacific liable to be occasionally swept entirely away by gales equalling hurricanes in violence which blow in an opposite direction to the ordinary tradewind  the absence of the islets on the leeward side of atolls or when present their lesser dimensions compared with those to windward is a comparatively unimportant fact but in several instances the reef itself on the leeward side retaining its usual defined outline does not rise to the surface by several fathoms  this is the case with the southern side of peros banhos plate i figure 9 in the chagos group with mourileu atoll frederick lutkes voyage autour du monde volume ii page 291  see also his account of namonouito below and the chart of oulleay in the atlas in the caroline archipelago and with the barrierreef plate i figure 8 of the gambier islands  i allude to the latter reef although belonging to another class because captain beechey was first led by it to observe the peculiarity in the question  at peros banhos the submerged part is nine miles in length and lies at an average depth of about five fathoms its surface is nearly level and consists of hard stone with a thin covering of loose sand  there is scarcely any living coral on it even on the outer margin as i have been particularly assured by captain moresby it is in fact a wall of dead coralrock having the same width and transverse section with the reef in its ordinary state of which it is a continuous portion  the living and perfect parts terminate abruptly and abut on the submerged portions in the same manner as on the sides of an ordinary passage through the reef  the reef to leeward in other cases is nearly or quite obliterated and one side of the lagoon is left open for instance at oulleay caroline archipelago where a crescentformed reef is fronted by an irregular bank on which the other half of the annular reef probably once stood  at namonouito in the same archipelago both these modifications of the reef concur it consists of a great flat bank with from twenty to twentyfive fathoms water on it for a length of more than forty miles on its southern side it is open and without any reef whilst on the other sides it is bounded by a reef in parts rising to the surface and perfectly characterised in parts lying some fathoms submerged  in the chagos group there are annular reefs entirely submerged which have the same structure as the submerged and defined portions just described  the speakers bank offers an excellent example of this structure its central expanse which is about twentytwo fathoms deep is twentyfour miles across the external rim is of the usual width of annular reefs and is welldefined it lies between six and eight fathoms beneath the surface and at the same depth there are scattered knolls in the lagoon  captain moresby believes the rim consists of dead rock thinly covered with sand and he is certain this is the case with the external rim of the great chagos bank which is also essentially a submerged atoll  in both these cases as in the submerged portion of the reef at peros banhos captain moresby feels sure that the quantity of living coral even on the outer edge overhanging the deepsea water is quite insignificant  lastly in several parts of the pacific and indian oceans there are banks lying at greater depths than in the cases just mentioned of the same form and size with the neighbouring atolls but with their atolllike structure wholly obliterated  it appears from the survey of freycinet that there are banks of this kind in the caroline archipelago and as is reported in the low archipelago  when we discuss the origin of the different classes of coral formations we shall see that the submerged state of the whole of some atollformed reefs and of portions of others generally but not invariably on the leeward side and the existence of more deeply submerged banks now possessing little or no signs of their original atolllike structure are probably the effects of a uniform causenamely the death of the coral during the subsidence of the area in which the atolls or banks are situated  there is seldom with the exception of the maldiva atolls more than two or three channels and generally only one leading into the lagoon of sufficient depth for a ship to enter  in small atolls there is usually not even one  where there is deep water for instance above twenty fathoms in the middle of the lagoon the channels through the reef are seldom as deep as the centreit may be said that the rim only of the saucershaped hollow forming the lagoon is notched  mr lyell principles of geology volume iii page 289 has observed that the growth of the coral would tend to obstruct all the channels through a reef except those kept open by discharging the water which during high tide and the greater part of each ebb is thrown over its circumference  several facts indicate that a considerable quantity of sediment is likewise discharged through these channels and captain moresby informs me that he has observed during the change of the monsoon the sea discoloured to a distance off the entrances into the maldiva and chagos atolls  this probably would check the growth of the coral in them far more effectually than a mere current of water  in the many small atolls without any channel these causes have not prevented the entire ring attaining the surface  the channels like the submerged and effaced parts of the reef very generally though not invariably occur on the leeward side of the atoll or on that side according to beechey beecheys voyage 4to edition volume i page 189 which from running in the same direction with the prevalent wind is not fully exposed to it  passages between the islets on the reef through which boats can pass at high water must not be confounded with shipchannels by which the annular reef itself is breached  the passages between the islets occur of course on the windward as well as on the leeward side but they are more frequent and broader to leeward owing to the lesser dimensions of the islets on that side  at keeling atoll the shores of the lagoon shelve gradually where the bottom is of sediment and irregularly or abruptly where there are coralreefs but this is by no means the universal structure in other atolls chamisso kotzebues first voyage volume iii page 142 speaking in general terms of the lagoons in the marshall atolls says the lead generally sinks from a depth of two or three fathoms to twenty or twentyfour and you may pursue a line in which on one side of the boat you may see the bottom and on the other the azureblue deep water  the shores of the lagoonlike channel within the barrierreef at vanikoro have a similar structure  captain beechey has described a modification of this structure and he believes it is not uncommon in two atolls in the low archipelago in which the shores of the lagoon descend by a few broad slightly inclined ledges or steps thus at matilda atoll beecheys voyage 4to edition volume i page 160  at whitsunday island the bottom of the lagoon slopes gradually towards the centre and then deepens suddenly the edge of the bank being nearly perpendicular  this bank is formed of coral and dead shells the great exterior reef the surface of which is gently inclined towards and beneath the surface of the lagoon ends abruptly in a little cliff three fathoms deep at its foot a ledge forty yards wide extends shelving gently inwards like the surfacereef and terminated by a second little cliff five fathoms deep beyond this the bottom of the lagoon slopes to twenty fathoms which is the average depth of its centre  these ledges seem to be formed of coralrock and captain beechey says that the lead often descended several fathoms through holes in them  in some atolls all the coral reefs or knolls in the lagoon come to the surface at low water in other cases of rarer occurrence all lie at nearly the same depth beneath it but most frequently they are quite irregularsome with perpendicular some with sloping sidessome rising to the surface and others lying at all intermediate depths from the bottom upwards  i cannot therefore suppose that the union of such reefs could produce even one uniformly sloping ledge and much less two or three one beneath the other and each terminated by an abrupt wall  at matilda island which offers the best example of the steplike structure captain beechey observes that the coralknolls within the lagoon are quite irregular in their height  we shall hereafter see that the theory which accounts for the ordinary form of atolls apparently includes this occasional peculiarity in their structure  in the midst of a group of atolls there sometimes occur small flat very low islands of coral formation which probably once included a lagoon since filled up with sediment and coralreefs  captain beechey entertains no doubt that this has been the case with the two small islands which alone of thirtyone surveyed by him in the low archipelago did not contain lagoons  romanzoff island in lat 15 deg s is described by chamisso kotzebues first voyage volume iii page 221 as formed by a dam of madreporitic rock inclosing a flat space thinly covered with trees into which the sea on the leeward side occasionally breaks  north keeling atoll appears to be in a rather less forward stage of conversion into land it consists of a horseshoe shaped strip of land surrounding a muddy flat one mile in its longest axis which is covered by the sea only at high water when describing south keeling atoll i endeavoured to show how slow the final process of filling up a lagoon must be nevertheless as all causes do tend to produce this effect it is very remarkable that not one instance as i believe is known of a moderately sized lagoon being filled up even to the low waterline at springtides much less of such a one being converted into land  it is likewise in some degree remarkable how few atolls except small ones are surrounded by a single linear strip of land formed by the union of separate islets  we cannot suppose that the many atolls in the pacific and indian oceans all have had a late origin and yet should they remain at their present level subjected only to the action of the sea and to the growing powers of the coral during as many centuries as must have elapsed since any of the earlier tertiary epochs it cannot i think be doubted that their lagoons and the islets on their reef would present a totally different appearance from what they now do this consideration leads to the suspicion that some renovating agency namely subsidence comes into play at intervals and perpetuates their original structure  description of the plates  plate iigreat chagos bank new caledoniamenchikoff atoll etc  figure 1great chagos bank in the indian ocean taken from the

chagos bankits submerged condition and extraordinary structure  although occasional references have been made to the maldiva atolls and to the banks in the chagos group some points of their structure deserve further consideration  my description is derived from an examination of the admirable charts lately published from the survey of captain moresby and lieutenant powell and more especially from information which captain moresby has communicated to me in the kindest manner  the maldiva archipelago is 470 miles in length with an average breadth of about 50 miles  the form and dimensions of the atolls and their singular position in a double line may be seen but not well in the greatly reduced chart figure 6 in plate ii  the dimensions of the longest atoll in the group called by the double name of milladoumadou and tilladoumatte have already been given it is 88 miles in a medial and slightly curved line and is less than 20 miles in its broadest part suadiva also is a noble atoll being 44 miles across in one direction and 34 in another and the great included expanse of water has a depth of between 250 and 300 feet  the smaller atolls in this group differ in no respect from ordinary ones but the larger ones are remarkable from being breached by numerous deepwater channels leading into the lagoon for instance there are 42 channels through which a ship could enter the lagoon of suadiva in the three southern large atolls the separate portions of reef between these channels have the ordinary structure and are linear but in the other atolls especially the more northern ones these portions are ring formed like miniature atolls  other ringformed reefs rise out of the lagoons in the place of those irregular ones which ordinarily occur there in the reduction of the chart of mahlos mahdoo plate ii figure 4 it was not found easy to define the islets and the little lagoons within each reef so that the ringformed structure is very imperfectly shown in the large published charts of tilladoumatte the appearance of these rings from standing further apart from each other is very remarkable  the rings on the margin are generally elongated many of them are three and some even five miles in diameter those within the lagoon are usually smaller few being more than two miles across and the greater number rather less than one  the depth of the little lagoon within these small annular reefs is generally from five to seven fathoms but occasionally more and in ari atoll many of the central ones are twelve and some even more than twelve fathoms deep  these rings rise abruptly from the platform or bank on which they are placed their outer margin is invariably bordered by living coral captain moresby informs me that millepora complanata is one of the commonest kinds on the outer margin as it is at keeling atoll within which there is a flat surface of coral rock of this flat sand and fragments have in many cases accumulated and been converted into islets clothed with vegetation  i can in fact point out no essential difference between these little ringformed reefs which however are larger and contain deeper lagoons than many true atolls that stand in the open sea and the most perfectly characterised atolls excepting that the ringformed reefs are based on a shallow foundation instead of on the floor of the open sea and that instead of being scattered irregularly they are grouped closely together on one large platform with the marginal rings arranged in a rudely formed circle  the perfect series which can be traced from portions of simple linear reef to others including long linear lagoons and from these again to oval or almost circular rings renders it probable that the latter are merely modifications of the linear or normal state  it is conformable with this view that the ringformed reefs on the margin even where most perfect and standing furthest apart generally have their longest axes directed in the line which the reef would have held if the atoll had been bounded by an ordinary wall  we may also infer that the central ringformed reefs are modifications of those irregular ones which are found in the lagoons of all common atolls  it appears from the charts on a large scale that the ringlike structure is contingent on the marginal channels or breaches being wide and consequently on the whole interior of the atoll being freely exposed to the waters of the open sea  when the channels are narrow or few in number although the lagoon be of great size and depth as in suadiva there are no ringformed reefs where the channels are somewhat broader the marginal portions of reef and especially those close to the larger channels are ringformed but the central ones are not so where they are broadest almost every reef throughout the atoll is more or less perfectly ringformed  although their presence is thus contingent on the openness of the marginal channels the theory of their formation as we shall hereafter see is included in that of the parent atolls of which they form the separate portions  the lagoons of all the atolls in the southern part of the archipelago are from ten to twenty fathoms deeper than those in the northern part  this is well exemplified in the case of addoo the southernmost atoll in the group for although only nine miles in its longest diameter it has a depth of thirtynine fathoms whereas all the other small atolls have comparatively shallow lagoons i can assign no adequate cause for this difference in depth  in the central and deepest part of the lagoons the bottom consists as i am informed by captain moresby of stiff clay probably a calcareous mud nearer the border it consists of sand and in the channels through the reef of hard sandbanks sandstone conglomerate rubble and a little live coral  close outside the reef and the line joining its detached portions where intersected by many channels the bottom is sandy and it slopes abruptly into unfathomable depths  in most lagoons the depth is considerably greater in the centre than in the channels but in tilladoumatte where the marginal ringformed reefs stand far apart the same depth is carried across the entire atoll from the deepwater line on one side to that on the other  i cannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these atollsa great sandy and generally concave disc rises abruptly from the unfathomable ocean with its central expanse studded and its border symmetrically fringed with oval basins of coralrock just lipping the surface of the sea sometimes clothed with vegetation and each containing a little lake of clear water  in the southern maldiva atolls of which there are nine large ones all the small reefs within the lagoons come to the surface and are dry at low water springtides hence in navigating them there is no danger from submarine banks  this circumstance is very remarkable as within some atolls for instance those of the neighbouring chagos group not a single reef comes to the surface and in most other cases a few only do and the rest lie at all intermediate depths from the bottom upwards  when treating of the growth of coral i shall again refer to this subject  although in the neighbourhood of the maldiva archipelago the winds during the monsoons blow during nearly an equal time from opposite quarters and although as i am informed by captain moresby the westerly winds are the strongest yet the islets are almost all placed on the eastern side of the northern atolls and on the southeastern side of the southern atolls that the formation of the islets is due to detritus thrown up from the outside as in the ordinary manner and not from the interior of the lagoons may i think be safely inferred from several considerations which it is hardly worth while to detail  as the easterly winds are not the strongest their action probably is aided by some prevailing swell or current  in groups of atolls exposed to a tradewind the shipchannels into the lagoons are almost invariably situated on the leeward or less exposed side of the reef and the reef itself is sometimes either wanting there or is submerged  a strictly analogous but different fact may be observed at the maldiva atollsnamely that where two atolls stand in front of each other the breaches in the reef are the most numerous on their near and therefore less exposed sides  thus on the near sides of ari and the two nillandoo atolls which face s male phaleedoo and moloque atolls there are seventythree deepwater channels and only twentyfive on their outer sides on the near side of the three latter named atolls there are fifty six openings and only thirtyseven on their outsides  it is scarcely possible to attribute this difference to any other cause than the somewhat different action of the sea on the two sides which would ensue from the protection afforded by the two rows of atolls to each other  i may here remark that in most cases the conditions favourable to the greater accumulation of fragments on the reef and to its more perfect continuity on one side of the atoll than on the other have concurred but this has not been the case with the maldivas for we have seen that the islets are placed on the eastern or southeastern sides whilst the breaches in the reef occur indifferently on any side where protected by an opposite atoll the reef being more continuous on the outer and more exposed sides of those atolls which stand near each other accords with the fact that the reef of the southern atolls is more continuous than that of the northern ones for the former as i am informed by captain moresby are more constantly exposed than the northern atolls to a heavy surf  the date of the first formation of some of the islets in this archipelago is known to the inhabitants on the other hand several islets and even some of those which are believed to be very old are now fast wearing away the work of destruction has in some instances been completed in ten years  captain moresby found on one waterwashed reef the marks of wells and graves which were excavated when it supported an islet  in south nillandoo atoll the natives say that three of the islets were formerly larger in north nillandoo there is one now being washed away and in this latter atoll lieutenant prentice found a reef about six hundred yards in diameter which the natives positively affirmed was lately an island covered with cocoanut trees  it is now only partially dry at low water springtides and is in lieutenant prentices words entirely covered with live coral and madrepore  in the northern part also of the maldiva archipelago and in the chagos group it is known that some of the islets are disappearing  the natives attribute these effects to variations in the currents of the sea  for my own part i cannot avoid suspecting that there must be some further cause which gives rise to such a cycle of change in the action of the currents of the great and open ocean  several of the atolls in this archipelago are so related to each other in form and position that at the first glance one is led to suspect that they have originated in the disseverment of a single one  male consists of three perfectly characterised atolls of which the shape and relative position are such that a line drawn closely round all three gives a symmetrical figure to see this clearly a larger chart is required than that of the archipelago in plate ii the channel separating the two northern male atolls is only little more than a mile wide and no bottom was found in it with 100 fathoms  powells island is situated at the distance of two miles and a half off the northern end of mahlos mahdoo see figure 4 plate ii at the exact point where the two sides of the latter if prolonged would meet no bottom however was found in the channel with 200 fathoms in the wider channel between horsburgh atoll and the southern end of mahlos mahdoo no bottom was found with 250 fathoms  in these and similar cases the relation consists only in the form and position of the atolls  but in the channel between the two nillandoo atolls although three miles and a quarter wide soundings were struck at the depth of 200 fathoms the channel between ross and ari atolls is four miles wide and only 150 fathoms deep  here then we have besides the relation of form a submarine connection  the fact of soundings having been obtained between two separate and perfectly characterised atolls is in itself interesting as it has never i believe been effected in any of the many other groups of atolls in the pacific and indian seas  in continuing to trace the connection of adjoining atolls if a hasty glance be taken at the chart figure 4 plate ii of mahlos mahdoo and the line of unfathomable water be followed no one will hesitate to consider it as one atoll  but a second look will show that it is divided by a bifurcating channel of which the northern arm is about one mile and threequarters in width with an average depth of 125 fathoms and the southern one threequarters of a mile wide and rather less deep  these channels resemble in the slope of their sides and general form those which separate atolls in every respect distinct and the northern arm is wider than that dividing two of the male atolls  the ringformed reefs on the sides of this bifurcating channel are elongated so that the northern and southern portions of mahlos mahdoo may claim as far as their external outline is concerned to be considered as distinct and perfect atolls  but the intermediate portion lying in the fork of the channel is bordered by reefs less perfect than those which surround any other atoll in the group of equally small dimensions  mahlos mahdoo therefore is in every respect in so intermediate a condition that it may be considered either as a single atoll nearly dissevered into three portions or as three atolls almost perfect and intimately connected  this is an instance of a very early stage of the apparent disseverment of an atoll but a still earlier one in many respects is exhibited at tilladou matte  in one part of this atoll the ringformed reefs stand so far apart from each other that the inhabitants have given different names to the northern and southern halves nearly all the rings moreover are so perfect and stand so separate and the space from which they rise is so level and unlike a true lagoon that we can easily imagine the conversion of this one great atoll not into two or three portions but into a whole group of miniature atolls  a perfect series such as we have here traced impresses the mind with an idea of actual change and it will hereafter be seen that the theory of subsidence with the upward growth of the coral modified by accidents of probable occurrence will account for the occasional disseverment of large atolls  the great chagos bank alone remains to be described  in the chagos group there are some ordinary atolls some annular reefs rising to the surface but without any islets on them and some atollformed banks either quite submerged or nearly so  of the latter the great chagos bank is much the largest and differs in its structure from the others a plan of it is given in plate ii figure 1 in which for the sake of clearness i have had the parts under ten fathoms deep finely shaded an east and west vertical section is given in figure 2 in which the vertical scale has been necessarily exaggerated  its longest axis is ninety nautical miles and another line drawn at right angles to the first across the broadest part is seventy  the central part consists of a level muddy flat between forty and fifty fathoms deep which is surrounded on all sides with the exception of some breaches by the steep edges of a set of banks rudely arranged in a circle  these banks consist of sand with a very little live coral they vary in breadth from five to twelve miles and on an average lie about sixteen fathoms beneath the surface they are bordered by the steep edges of a third narrow and upper bank which forms the rim to the whole  this rim is about a mile in width and with the exception of two or three spots where islets have been formed is submerged between five and ten fathoms  it consists of smooth hard rock covered with a thin layer of sand but with scarcely any live coral it is steep on both sides and outwards slopes abruptly into unfathomable depths  at the distance of less than half a mile from one part no bottom was found with 190 fathoms and off another point at a somewhat greater distance there was none with 210 fathoms  small steepsided banks or knolls covered with luxuriantly growing coral rise from the interior expanse to the same level with the external rim which as we have seen is formed only of dead rock  it is impossible to look at the plan figure 1 plate ii although reduced to so small a scale without at once perceiving that the great chagos bank is in the words of captain moresby this officer has had the kindness to lend me an excellent ms account of the chagos islands from this paper from the published charts and from verbal information communicated to me by captain moresby the above account of the great chagos bank is taken nothing more than a halfdrowned atoll  but of what great dimensions and of how extraordinary an internal structure  we shall hereafter have to consider both the cause of its submerged condition a state common to other banks in the group and the origin of the singular submarine terraces which bound the central expanse these i think it can be shown have resulted from a cause analogous to that which has produced the bifurcating channel across mahlos mahdoo   chapter iibarrier reefs  closely resemble in general form

thickness of barrierreefs  the term barrier has been generally applied to that vast reef which fronts the ne shore of australia and by most voyagers likewise to that on the western coast of new caledonia  at one time i thought it convenient thus to restrict the term but as these reefs are similar in structure and in position relatively to the land to those which like a wall with a deep moat within encircle many smaller islands i have classed them together  the reef also on the west coast of new caledonia circling round the extremities of the island is an intermediate form between a small encircling reef and the australian barrier which stretches for a thousand miles in nearly a straight line  the geographer balbi has in effect described those barrierreefs which encircle moderately sized islands by calling them atolls with high land rising from within their central expanse  the general resemblance between the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes may be seen in the small but accurately reduced charts on plate i the authorities from which these charts have been reduced together with some remarks on them and descriptive of the plates are given separately and this resemblance can be further shown to extend to every part of the structure  beginning with the outside of the reef many scattered soundings off gambier oualan and some other encircled islands show that close to the breakers there exists a narrow shelving margin beyond which the ocean becomes suddenly unfathomable but off the west coast of new caledonia captain kent dalrymple hydrog mem volume iii found no bottom with 150 fathoms at two ships length from the reef so that the slope here must be nearly as precipitous as off the maldiva atolls  i can give little information regarding the kinds of corals which live on the outer margin  when i visited the reef at tahiti although it was low water the surf was too violent for me to see the living masses but according to what i heard from some intelligent native chiefs they resemble in their rounded and branchless forms those on the margin of keeling atoll  the extreme verge of the reef which was visible between the breaking waves at low water consisted of a rounded convex artificiallike breakwater entirely coated with nulliporae and absolutely similar to that which i have described at keeling atoll  from what i heard when at tahiti and from the writings of the revs w ellis and j williams i conclude that this peculiar structure is common to most of the encircled islands of the society archipelago  the reef within this mound or breakwater has an extremely irregular surface even more so than between the islets on the reef of keeling atoll with which alone as there are no islets on the reef of tahiti it can properly be compared  at tahiti the reef is very irregular in width but round many other encircled islands for instance vanikoro or gambier islands figures 1 and 8 plate i it is quite as regular and of the same average width as in true atolls  most barrierreefs on the inner side slope irregularly into the lagoonchannel as the space of deep water separating the reef from the included land may be called but at vanikoro the reef slopes only for a short distance and then terminates abruptly in a submarine wall forty feet higha structure absolutely similar to that described by chamisso in the marshall atolls  in the society archipelago ellis consult on this and other points the polynesian researches by the rev w ellis an admirable work full of curious information states that the reefs generally lie at the distance of from one to one and a half miles and occasionally even at more than three miles from the shore  the central mountains are generally bordered by a fringe of flat and often marshy alluvial land from one to four miles in width  this fringe consists of coralsand and detritus thrown up from the lagoonchannel and of soil washed down from the hills it is an encroachment on the channel analogous to that low and inner part of the islets in many atolls which is formed by the accumulation of matter from the lagoon  at hogoleu figure 2 plate i in the caroline archipelago see hydrographical mem and the atlas of the voyage of the astrolabe by captain dumont durville page 428 the reef on the south side is no less than twenty miles on the east side five and on the north side fourteen miles from the encircled high islands  the lagoon channels may be compared in every respect with true lagoons  in some cases they are open with a level bottom of fine sand in others they are choked up with reefs of delicately branched corals which have the same general character as those within the keeling atoll  these internal reefs either stand separately or more commonly skirt the shores of the included high islands  the depth of the lagoonchannel round the society islands varies from two or three to thirty fathoms in cooks see the chart in volume i of hawkesworths 4to edition of cooks first voyage chart of ulieta however there is one sounding laid down of fortyeight fathoms at vanikoro there are several of fiftyfour and one of fiftysix and a half fathoms english a depth which even exceeds by a little that of the interior of the great maldiva atolls  some barrierreefs have very few islets on them whilst others are surmounted by numerous ones and those round part of bolabola plate i figure 5 form a single linear strip the islets first appear either on the angles of the reef or on the sides of the breaches through it and are generally most numerous on the windward side  the reef to leeward retaining its usual width sometimes lies submerged several fathoms beneath the surface i have already mentioned gambier island as an instance of this structure  submerged reefs having a less defined outline dead and covered with sand have been observed see appendix off some parts of huaheine and tahiti  the reef is more frequently breached to leeward than to windward thus i find in krusensterns memoir on the pacific that there are passages through the encircling reef on the leeward side of each of the seven society islands which possess shipharbours but that there are openings to windward through the reef of only three of them  the breaches in the reef are seldom as deep as the interior lagoonlike channel they generally occur in front of the main valleys a circumstance which can be accounted for as will be seen in the fourth chapter without much difficulty  the breaches being situated in front of the valleys which descend indifferently on all sides explains their more frequent occurrence through the windward side of barrierreefs than through the windward side of atollsfor in atolls there is no included land to influence the position of the breaches  it is remarkable that the lagoonchannels round mountainous islands have not in every instance been long ago filled up with coral and sediment but it is more easily accounted for than appears at first sight  in cases like that of hogoleu and the gambier islands where a few small peaks rise out of a great lagoon the conditions scarcely differ from those of an atoll and i have already shown at some length that the filling up of a true lagoon must be an extremely slow process  where the channel is narrow the agency which on unprotected coasts is most productive of sediment namely the force of the breakers is here entirely excluded and the reef being breached in the front of the main valleys much of the finer mud from the rivers must be transported into the open sea  as a current is formed by the water thrown over the edge of atollformed reefs which carries sediment with it through the deepwater breaches the same thing probably takes place in barrierreefs and this would greatly aid in preventing the lagoonchannel from being filled up  the low alluvial border however at the foot of the encircled mountains shows that the work of filling up is in progress and at maura plate i figure 6 in the society group it has been almost effected so that there remains only one harbour for small craft  if we look at a set of charts of barrierreefs and leave out in imagination the encircled land we shall find that besides the many points already noticed of resemblance or rather of identity in structure with atolls there is a close general agreement in form average dimensions and grouping  encircling barrierreefs like atolls are generally elongated with an irregularly rounded though sometimes angular outline  there are atolls of all sizes from less than two miles in diameter to sixty miles excluding tilladoumatte as it consists of a number of almost independent atollformed reefs and there are encircling barrierreefs from three miles and a half to fortysix miles in diameterturtle island being an instance of the former and hogoleu of the latter  at tahiti the encircled island is thirtysix miles in its longest axis whilst at maurua it is only a little more than two miles  it will be shown in the last chapter in this volume that there is the strictest resemblance in the grouping of atolls and of common islands and consequently there must be the same resemblance in the grouping of atolls and of encircling barrierreefs  the islands lying within reefs of this class are of very various heights tahiti is 7000 feet the height of tahiti is given from captain beechey maurua from mr fd bennett geograph journ volume viii page 220 aitutaki from measurements made on board the beagle and manouai or harvey island from an estimate by the rev j williams  the two latter islands however are not in some respects well characterised examples of the encircled class maurua about 800 aitutaki 360 and manouai only 50 the geological nature of the included land varies in most cases it is of ancient volcanic origin owing apparently to the fact that islands of this nature are most frequent within all great seas some however are of madreporitic limestone and others of primary formation of which latter kind new caledonia offers the best example  the central land consists either of one island or of several thus in the society group eimeo stands by itself while taha and raiatea figure 3 plate i both moderately large islands of nearly equal size are included in one reef within the reef of the gambier group there are four large and some smaller islands figure 8 plate i within that of hogoleu figure 2 plate i nearly a dozen small islands are scattered over the expanse of one vast lagoon  after the details now given it may be asserted that there is not one point of essential difference between encircling barrierreefs and atolls the latter enclose a simple sheet of water the former encircle an expanse with one or more islands rising from it  i was much struck with this fact when viewing from the heights of tahiti the distant island of eimeo standing within smooth water and encircled by a ring of snowwhite breakers remove the central land and an annular reef like that of an atoll in an early stage of its formation is left remove it from bolabola and there remains a circle of linear coralislets crowned with tall cocoanut trees like one of the many atolls scattered over the pacific and indian oceans  the barrierreefs of australia and of new caledonia deserve a separate notice from their great dimensions  the reef on the west coast of new caledonia figure 5 plate ii is 400 miles in length and for a length of many leagues it seldom approaches within eight miles of the shore and near the southern end of the island the space between the reef and the land is sixteen miles in width  the australian barrier extends with a few interruptions for nearly a thousand miles its average distance from the land is between twenty and thirty miles and in some parts from fifty to seventy  the great arm of the sea thus included is from ten to twentyfive fathoms deep with a sandy bottom but towards the southern end where the reef is further from the shore the depth gradually increases to forty and in some parts to more than sixty fathoms  flinders flinders voyage to terra australis volume ii page 88 has described the surface of this reef as consisting of a hard white agglomerate of different kinds of coral with rough projecting points  the outer edge is the highest part it is traversed by narrow gullies and at rare intervals is breached by shipchannels  the sea close outside is profoundly deep but in front of the main breaches soundings can sometimes be obtained  some low islets have been formed on the reef  plate unnamed three vertical sections woodcut diagrams  1 vanikoro from the atlas of the voyage of the astrolabe by d durville  2 gambier island from beechey  3 maurua from the atlas of the voyage of the coquille by duperrey  the horizontal line is the level of the sea from which on the right hand a plummet descends representing a depth of 200 fathoms or 1200 feet  the vertical shading shows the section of the land and the horizontal shading that of the encircling barrierreef from the smallness of the scale the lagoonchannel could not be represented  aaouter edge of the coralreefs where the sea breaks  bbthe shore of the encircled islands  there is one important point in the structure of barrierreefs which must here be considered  the accompanying diagrams represent north and south vertical sections taken through the highest points of vanikoro gambier and maurua islands and through their encircling reefs  the scale both in the horizontal and vertical direction is the same namely a quarter of an inch to a nautical mile  the height and width of these islands is known and i have attempted to represent the form of the land from the shading of the hills in the large published charts  it has long been remarked even from the time of dampier that considerable degree of relation subsists between the inclination of that part of the land which is beneath water and that above it hence the dotted line in the three sections probably does not widely differ in inclination from the actual submarine prolongation of the land  if we now look at the outer edge of the reef aa and bear in mind that the plummet on the right hand represents a depth of 1200 feet we must conclude that the vertical thickness of these barrier coralreefs is very great  i must observe that if the sections had been taken in any other direction across these islands or across other encircled islands in the fifth chapter an east and west section across the island of bolabola and its barrierreefs is given for the sake of illustrating another point  the unbroken line in it woodcut no 5 is the section referred to  the scale is 57 of an inch to a mile it is taken from the atlas of the voyage of the coquille by duperrey  the depth of the lagoonchannel is exaggerated the result would have been the same  in the succeeding chapter it will be shown that reefbuilding polypifers cannot flourish at great depthsfor instance it is highly improbable that they could exist at a quarter of the depth represented by the plummet on the right hand of the woodcut  here there is a great apparent difficultyhow were the basal parts of these barrierreef formed  it will perhaps occur to some that the actual reefs formed of coral are not of great thickness but that before their first growth the coasts of these encircled islands were deeply eaten into and a broad but shallow submarine ledge thus left on the edge of which the coral grew but if this had been the case the shore would have been invariably bounded by lofty cliffs and not have sloped down to the lagoonchannel as it does in many instances  on this view the rev d tyerman and mr bennett journal of voyage and travels volume i page 215 have briefly suggested this explanation of the origin of the encircling reefs of the society islands moreover the cause of the reef springing up at such a great distance from the land leaving a deep and broad moat within remains altogether unexplained  a supposition of the same nature and appearing at first more probable is that the reefs sprung up from banks of sediment which had accumulated round the shore previously to the growth of the coral but the extension of a bank to the same distance round an unbroken coast and in front of those deep arms of the sea as in raiatea see plate ii figure 3 which penetrate nearly to the heart of some encircled islands is exceedingly improbable  and why again should the reef spring up in some cases steep on both sides like a wall at a distance of two three or more miles from the shore leaving a channel often between two hundred and three hundred feet deep and rising from a depth which we have reason to believe is destructive to the growth of coral  an admission of this nature cannot possibly be made  the existence also of the deep channel utterly precludes the idea of the reef having grown outwards on a foundation slowly formed on its outside by the accumulation of sediment and coral detritus  nor again can it be asserted that the reefbuilding corals will not grow excepting at a great distance from the land for as we shall soon see there is a whole class of reefs which take their name from growing closely attached especially where the sea is deep to the beach  at new caledonia see plate ii figure 5 the reefs which run in front of the west coast are prolonged in the same line 150 miles beyond the northern extremity of the island and this shows that some explanation quite different from any of those just suggested is required  the continuation of the reefs on each side of the submarine prolongation of new caledonia is an exceedingly interesting fact if this part formerly existed as the northern extremity of the island and before the attachment of the coral had been worn down by the action of the sea or if it originally existed at its present height with or without beds of sediment on each flank how can we possibly account for the reefs not growing on the crest of this submarine portion but fronting its sides in the same line with the reefs which front the shores of the lofty island  we shall hereafter see that there is one and i believe only one solution of this difficulty  one other supposition to account for the position of encircling barrierreefs remains but it is almost too preposterous to be mentioned namely that they rest on enormous submarine craters surrounding the included islands  when the size height and form of the islands in the society group are considered together with the fact that all are thus encircled such a notion will be rejected by almost every one  new caledonia moreover besides its size is composed of primitive formations as are some of the comoro islands i have been informed that this is the case by dr allan of forres who has visited this group and aitutaki consists of calcareous rock  we must therefore reject these several explanations and conclude that the vertical thickness of barrierreefs from their outer edges to the foundation on which they rest from aa in the section to the dotted lines is really great but in this there is no difficulty for it is not necessary to suppose that the coral has sprung up from an immense depth as will be evident when the theory of the upward growth of coralreefs during the slow subsidence of their foundation is discussed   chapter iiifringing or

of brazilfringingreefs in very shallow seas round banks of sediment and on worndown islandsfringingreefs affected by currents of the sea coral coating the bottom of the sea but not forming reefs  fringingreefs or as they have been called by some voyagers shorereefs whether skirting an island or part of a continent might at first be thought to differ little except in generally being of less breadth from barrierreefs  as far as the superficies of the actual reef is concerned this is the case but the absence of an interior deepwater channel and the close relation in their horizontal extension with the probable slope beneath the sea of the adjoining land present essential points of difference  the reefs which fringe the island of mauritius offer a good example of this class  they extend round its whole circumference with the exception of two or three parts this fact is stated on the authority of the officier du roi in his extremely interesting voyage a lisle de france undertaken in 1768  according to captain carmichael hookers bot misc volume ii page 316 on one part of the coast there is a space for sixteen miles without a reef where the coast is almost precipitous and where if as is probable the bottom of the sea has a similar inclination the coral would have no foundation on which to become attached  a similar fact may sometimes be observed even in reefs of the barrier class which follow much less closely the outline of the adjoining land as for instance on the southeast and precipitous side of tahiti where the encircling reef is interrupted  on the western side of the mauritius which was the only part i visited the reef generally lies at the distance of about half a mile from the shore but in some parts it is distant from one to two and even three miles  but even in this last case as the coastland is gently inclined from the foot of the mountains to the seabeach and as the soundings outside the reef indicate an equally gentle slope beneath the water there is no reason for supposing that the basis of the reef formed by the prolongation of the strata of the island lies at a greater depth than that at which the polypifers could begin constructing the reef  some allowance however must be made for the outward extension of the corals on a foundation of sand and detritus formed from their own wear which would give to the reef a somewhat greater vertical thickness than would otherwise be possible  the outer edge of the reef on the western or leeward side of the island is tolerably well defined and is a little higher than any other part  it chiefly consists of large strongly branched corals of the genus madrepora which also form a sloping bed some way out to sea the kinds of coral growing in this part will be described in the ensuing chapter  between the outer margin and the beach there is a flat space with a sandy bottom and a few tufts of living coral in some parts it is so shallow that people by avoiding the deeper holes and gullies can wade across it at low water in other parts it is deeper seldom however exceeding ten or twelve feet so that it offers a safe coasting channel for boats  on the eastern and windward side of the island which is exposed to a heavy surf the reef was described to me as having a hard smooth surface very slightly inclined inwards just covered at lowwater and traversed by gullies it appears to be quite similar in structure to the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes  the reef of mauritius in front of every river and streamlet is breached by a straight passage at grand port however there is a channel like that within a barrierreef it extends parallel to the shore for four miles and has an average depth of ten or twelve fathoms its presence may probably be accounted for by two rivers which enter at each end of the channel and bend towards each other  the fact of reefs of the fringing class being always breached in front of streams even of those which are dry during the greater part of the year will be explained when the conditions unfavourable to the growth of coral are considered  low coralislets like those on barrierreefs and atolls are seldom formed on reefs of this class owing apparently in some cases to their narrowness and in others to the gentle slope of the reef outside not yielding many fragments to the breakers  on the windward side however of the mauritius two or three small islets have been formed  it appears as will be shown in the ensuing chapter that the action of the surf is favourable to the vigorous growth of the stronger corals and that sand or sediment if agitated by the waves is injurious to them  hence it is probable that a reef on a shelving shore like that of mauritius would at first grow up not attached to the actual beach but at some little distance from it and the corals on the outer margin would be the most vigorous  a shallow channel would thus be formed within the reef and as the breakers are prevented acting on the shores of the island and as they do not ordinarily tear up many fragments from the outside and as every streamlet has its bed prolonged in a straight line through the reef this channel could be filled up only very slowly with sediment  but a beach of sand and of fragments of the smaller kinds of coral seems in the case of mauritius to be slowly encroaching on the shallow channel  on many shelving and sandy coasts the breakers tend to form a bar of sand a little way from the beach with a slight increase of depth within it for instance captain grey captain greys journal of two expeditions volume i page 369 states that the west coast of australia in latitude 24 deg is fronted by a sand bar about two hundred yards in width on which there is only two feet of water but within it the depth increases to two fathoms  similar bars more or less perfect occur on other coasts  in these cases i suspect that the shallow channel which no doubt during storms is occasionally obliterated is scooped out by the flowing away of the water thrown beyond the line on which the waves break with the greatest force  at pernambuco a bar of hard sandstone i have described this singular structure in the london and edinburgh phil mag october 1841 which has the same external form and height as a coralreef extends nearly parallel to the coast within this bar currents apparently caused by the water thrown over it during the greater part of each tide run strongly and are wearing away its inner wall  from these facts it can hardly be doubted that within most fringingreefs especially within those lying some distance from the land a return stream must carry away the water thrown over the outer edge and the current thus produced would tend to prevent the channel being filled up with sediment and might even deepen it under certain circumstances  to this latter belief i am led by finding that channels are almost universally present within the fringingreefs of those islands which have undergone recent elevatory movements and this could hardly have been the case if the conversion of the very shallow channel into land had not been counteracted to a certain extent  a fringingreef if elevated in a perfect condition above the level of the sea ought to present the singular appearance of a broad dry moat within a low mound  the author voyage a lisle de france par un officier du roi part i pages 192 200 of an interesting pedestrian tour round the mauritius seems to have met with a structure of this kind he says jobservai que la ou la mer etale independamment des rescifs du large il y a terre une espece deffoncement ou chemin couvert naturel  on y pourrait mettre du canon etc  in another place he adds avant de passer le cap on remarque un gros banc de corail eleve de plus de quinze pieds cest une espece de rescif que la mer abandonne il regne au pied une longue flaque deau dont on pourrait faire un bassin pour de petits vaisseaux  but the margin of the reef although the highest and most perfect part from being most exposed to the surf would generally during a slow rise of the land be either partially or entirely worn down to that level at which corals could renew their growth on its upper edge  on some parts of the coastland of mauritius there are little hillocks of coralrock which are either the last remnants of a continuous reef or of low islets formed on it  i observed that two such hillocks between tamarin bay and the great black river they were nearly twenty feet high about two hundred yards from the present beach and about thirty feet above its level  they rose abruptly from a smooth surface strewed with worn fragments of coral  they consisted in their lower part of hard calcareous sandstone and in their upper of great blocks of several species of astraea and madrepora loosely aggregated they were divided into irregular beds dipping seaward in one hillock at an angle of 8 deg and in the other at 18 deg  i suspect that the superficial parts of the reefs which have been upraised together with the islands they fringe have generally been much more modified by the wearing action of the sea than those of mauritius  many islands are fringed by reefs quite similar to those of mauritius i may give cuba as another instance mr taylor loudons mag of nat hist volume ix page 449 has described a reef several miles in length between gibara and vjaro which extends parallel to the shore at the distance of between half and the third part of a mile and encloses a space of shallow water with a sandy bottom and tufts of coral  outside the edge of the reef which is formed of great branching corals the depth is six and seven fathoms  this coast has been upheaved at no very distant geological period but on coasts where the sea deepens very suddenly the reefs are much narrower and their limited extension seems evidently to depend on the high inclination of the submarine slope a relation which as we have seen does not exist in reefs of the barrier class  the fringingreefs on steep coasts are frequently not more than from fifty to one hundred yards in width they have a nearly smooth hard surface scarcely uncovered at low water and without any interior shoal channel like that within those fringingreefs which lie at a greater distance from the land  the fragments torn up during gales from the outer margin are thrown over the reef on the shores of the island  i may give as instances wateeo where the reef is described by cook as being a hundred yards wide and mauti and elizabeth islands mauti is described by lord byron in the voyage of hms blonde and elizabeth island by captain beechey where it is only fifty yards in width the sea round these islands is very deep  fringingreefs like barrierreefs both surround islands and front the shores of continents  in the charts of the eastern coast of africa by captain owen many extensive fringingreefs are laid down thus for a space of nearly forty miles from latitude 1 deg 15 to 1 deg 45 s a reef fringes the shore at an average distance of rather more than one mile and therefore at a greater distance than is usual in reefs of this class but as the coastland is not lofty and as the bottom shoals very gradually the depth being only from eight to fourteen fathoms at a mile and a half outside the reef its extension thus far from the land offers no difficulty  the external margin of this reef is described as formed of projecting points within which there is a space from six to twelve feet deep with patches of living coral on it  at mukdeesha latitude 2 deg 1 n the port is formed it is said owens africa volume i page 357 from which work the foregoing facts are likewise taken by a long reef extending eastward four or five miles within which there is a narrow channel with ten to twelve feet of water at low springtides it lies at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the shore  again in the plan of mombas latitude 4 deg s a reef extends for thirtysix miles at the distance of from half a mile to one mile and a quarter from the shore within it there is a channel navigable for canoes and small craft between six and fifteen feet deep outside the reef the depth is about thirty fathoms at the distance of nearly half a mile  part of this reef is very symmetrical and has a uniform breadth of two hundred yards  the coast of brazil is in many parts fringed by reefs  of these some are not of coral formation for instance those near bahia and in front of pernambuco but a few miles south of this latter city the reef follows see baron roussins pilote du bresil and accompanying hydrographical memoir so closely every turn of the shore that i can hardly doubt it is of coral it runs at the distance of threequarters of a mile from the land and within it the depth is from ten to fifteen feet  i was assured by an intelligent pilot that at ports frances and maceio the outer part of the reef consists of living coral and the inner of a white stone full of large irregular cavities communicating with the sea  the bottom of the sea off the coast of brazil shoals gradually to between thirty and forty fathoms at the distance of between nine and ten leagues from the land  from the description now given we must conclude that the dimensions and structure of fringingreefs depend entirely on the greater or less inclination of the submarine slope conjoined with the fact that reefbuilding polypifers can exist only at limited depths  it follows from this that where the sea is very shallow as in the persian gulf and in parts of the east indian archipelago the reefs lose their fringing character and appear as separate and irregularly scattered patches often of considerable area  from the more vigorous growth of the coral on the outside and from the conditions being less favourable in several respects within such reefs are generally higher and more perfect in their marginal than in their central parts hence these reefs sometimes assume and this circumstance ought not to be overlooked the appearance of atolls but they differ from atolls in their central expanse being much less deep in their form being less defined and in being based on a shallow foundation  but when in a deep sea reefs fringe banks of sediment which have accumulated beneath the surface round either islands or submerged rocks they are distinguished with difficulty on the one hand from encircling barrierreefs and on the other from atolls  in the west indies there are reefs which i should probably have arranged under both these classes had not the existence of large and level banks lying a little beneath the surface ready to serve as the basis for the attachment of coral been occasionally brought into view by the entire or partial absence of reefs on them and had not the formation of such banks through the accumulation of sediment now in progress been sufficiently evident  fringingreefs sometimes coat and thus protect the foundations of islands which have been worn down by the surf to the level of the sea  according to ehrenberg this has been extensively the case with the islands in the red sea which formerly ranged parallel to the shores of the mainland with deep water within them hence the reefs now coating their bases are situated relatively to the land like barrierreefs although not belonging to that class but there are as i believe in the red sea some true barrierreefs  the reefs of this sea and of the west indies will be described in the appendix  in some cases fringingreefs appear to be considerably modified in outline by the course of the prevailing currents  dr j allan informs me that on the east coast of madagascar almost every headland and low point of sand has a coralreef extending from it in a sw and ne line parallel to the currents on that shore  i should think the influence of the currents chiefly consisted in causing an extension in a certain direction of a proper foundation for the attachment of the coral  round many intertropical islands for instance the abrolhos on the coast of brazil surveyed by captain fitzroy and as i am informed by mr cuming round the philippines the bottom of the sea is entirely coated by irregular masses of coral which although often of large size do not reach the surface and form proper reefs  this must be owing either to insufficient growth or to the absence of those kinds of corals which can withstand the breaking of the waves  the three classes atollformed barrier and fringingreefs together with the modifications just described of the latter include all the most remarkable coral formations anywhere existing  at the commencement of the last chapter in the volume where i detail the principles on which the map plate iii is coloured the exceptional cases will be enumerated   chapter ivon the distribution and growth of coralreefs  in this chapter i will give all the facts which i have collected relating to the distribution of coralreefsto the conditions favourable to their increaseto the rate of their growthand to the depth at which they are formed  these subjects have an important bearing on the theory of the origin of the different classes of coralreefs   section 4ion the distribution of coralreefs and on the conditions favourable to their increase  with regard to the limits of latitude over which coralreefs extend i have nothing new to add  the bermuda islands in 32 deg 15 n is the point furthest removed from the equator in which they appear to exist and it has been suggested that their extension so far northward in this instance is owing to the warmth of the gulf stream  in the pacific the loo choo islands in latitude 27 deg n have reefs on their shores and there is an atoll in 28 deg 30 situated nw of the sandwich archipelago in the red sea there are coralreefs in latitude 30 deg  in the southern hemisphere coralreefs do not extend so far from the equatorial sea  in the southern pacific there are only a few reefs beyond the line of the tropics but houtmans abrolhos on the western shores of australia in latitude 29 deg s are of coral formation  the proximity of volcanic land owing to the lime generally evolved from it has been thought to be favourable to the increase of coralreefs there is however not much foundation for this view for nowhere are coralreefs more extensive than on the shores of new caledonia and of northeastern australia which consist of primary formations and in the largest groups of atolls namely the maldiva chagos marshall gilbert and low archipelagoes there is no volcanic or other kind of rock excepting that formed of coral  the entire absence of coralreefs in certain large areas within the tropical seas is a remarkable fact  thus no coralreefs were observed during the surveying voyages of the beagle and her tender on the west coast of south america south of the equator or round the galapagos islands  it appears also that there are none i have been informed that this is the case by lieutenant ryder rn and others who have had ample opportunities for observation north of the equator mr lloyd who surveyed the isthmus of panama remarked to me that although he had seen corals living in the bay of panama yet he had never observed any reefs formed by them  i at first attributed this absence of reefs on the coasts of peru and of the galapagos islands the mean temperature of the surface sea from observations made by the direction of captain fitzroy on the shores of the galapagos islands between the 16th of september and the 20th of october 1835 was 68 deg fahr  the lowest temperature observed was 585 deg at the southwest end of albemarle island and on the west coast of this island it was several times 62 deg and 63 deg  the mean temperature of the sea in the low archipelago of atolls and near tahiti from similar observations made on board the beagle was although further from the equator 775 deg the lowest any day being 765 deg  therefore we have here a difference of 95 deg in mean temperature and 18 deg in extremes a difference doubtless quite sufficient to affect the distribution of organic beings in the two areas to the coldness of the currents from the south but the gulf of panama is one of the hottest pelagic districts in the world  humboldts personal narrative volume vii page 434  in the central parts of the pacific there are islands entirely free from reefs in some few of these cases i have thought that this was owing to recent volcanic action but the existence of reefs round the greater part of hawaii one of the sandwich islands shows that recent volcanic action does not necessarily prevent their growth  in the last chapter i stated that the bottom of the sea round some islands is thickly coated with living corals which nevertheless do not form reefs either from insufficient growth or from the species not being adapted to contend with the breaking waves  i have been assured by several people that there are no coralreefs on the west coast of africa it might be concluded from a paper by captain owen geographical journal volume ii page 89 that the reefs off cape st anne and the sherboro islands were of coral although the author states that they are not purely coralline  but i have been assured by lieutenant holland rn that these reefs are not of coral or at least that they do not at all resemble those in the west indies or round the islands in the gulf of guinea  this perhaps may be attributed in part to the sediment brought down by the many rivers debouching on that coast and to the extensive mudbanks which line great part of it  but the islands of st helena ascension the cape verdes st pauls and fernando noronha are also entirely without reefs although they lie far out at sea are composed of the same ancient volcanic rocks and have the same general form with those islands in the pacific the shores of which are surrounded by gigantic walls of coralrock  with the exception of bermuda there is not a single coralreef in the central expanse of the atlantic ocean  it will perhaps be suggested that the quantity of carbonate of lime in different parts of the sea may regulate the presence of reefs  but this cannot be the case for at ascension the waves charged to excess precipitate a thick layer of calcareous matter on the tidal rocks and at st jago in the cape verdes carbonate of lime not only is abundant on the shores but it forms the chief part of some upraised posttertiary strata the apparently capricious distribution therefore of coralreefs cannot be explained by any of these obvious causes but as the study of the terrestrial and better known half of the world must convince every one that no station capable of supporting life is lostnay more that there is a struggle for each station between the different orders of naturewe may conclude that in those parts of the intertropical sea in which there are no coralreefs there are other organic bodies supplying the place of the reefbuilding polypifers  it has been shown in the chapter on keeling atoll that there are some species of large fish and the whole tribe of holothuriae which prey on the tenderer parts of the corals  on the other hand the polypifers in their turn must prey on some other organic beings the decrease of which from any cause would cause a proportionate destruction of the living coral  the relations therefore which determine the formation of reefs on any shore by the vigorous growth of the efficient kinds of coral must be very complex and with our imperfect knowledge quite inexplicable  from these considerations we may infer that changes in the condition of the sea not obvious to our senses might destroy all the coralreefs in one area and cause them to appear in another thus the pacific or indian ocean might become as barren of coralreefs as the atlantic now is without our being able to assign any adequate cause for such a change  it has been a question with some naturalists which part of a reef is most favourable to the growth of coral  the great mounds of living porites and of millepora round keeling atoll occur exclusively on the extreme verge of the reef which is washed by a constant succession of breakers and living coral nowhere else forms solid masses  at the marshall islands the larger kinds of coral chiefly species of astraea a genus closely allied to porites which form rocks measuring several fathoms in thickness prefer according to chamisso kotzebues first voyage english translation volume iii pages 142 143 331 the most violent surf  i have stated that the outer margin of the maldiva atolls consists of living corals some of which if not all are of the same species with those at keeling atoll and here the surf is so tremendous that even large ships have been thrown by a single heave of the sea high and dry on the reef all on board thus escaping with their lives  ehrenberg ehrenberg uber die natur und bildung der corallen banke im rothen meere page 49 remarks that in the red sea the strongest corals live on the outer reefs and appear to love the surf he adds that the more branched kinds abound a little way within but that even these in still more protected places become smaller  many other facts having a similar tendency might be adduced  in the west indies as i am informed by captain bird allen rn it is the common belief of those who are best acquainted with the reefs that the coral flourishes most where freely exposed to the swell of the open sea  it has however been doubted by mm quoy and gaimard whether any kind of coral can even withstand much less flourish in the breakers of an open sea annales des sciences naturelles tome vi pages 276 278la ou les ondes sont agitees les lytophytes ne peuvent travailler parce quelles detruiraient leurs fragiles edifices etc they affirm that the saxigenous lithophytes flourish only where the water is tranquil and the heat intense  this statement has passed from one geological work to another nevertheless the protection of the whole reef undoubtedly is due to those kinds of coral which cannot exist in the situations thought by these naturalists to be most favourable to them  for should the outer and living margin perish of any one of the many low coralislands round which a line of great breakers is incessantly foaming the whole it is scarcely possible to doubt would be washed away and destroyed in less than half a century  but the vital energies of the corals conquer the mechanical power of the waves and the large fragments of reef torn up by every storm are replaced by the slow but steady growth of the innumerable polypifers which form the living zone on its outer edge  from these facts it is certain that the strongest and most massive corals flourish where most exposed  the less perfect state of the reef of most atolls on the leeward and less exposed side compared with its state to windward and the analogous case of the greater number of breaches on the near sides of those atolls in the maldiva archipelago which afford some protection to each other are obviously explained by this circumstance  if the question had been under what conditions the greater number of species of coral not regarding their bulk and strength were developed i should answerprobably in the situations described by mm quoy and gaimard where the water is tranquil and the heat intense  the total number of species of coral in the circumtropical seas must be very great in the red sea alone 120 kinds according to ehrenberg ehrenberg uber die natur etc etc page 46 have been observed  the same author has observed that the recoil of the sea from a steep shore is injurious to the growth of coral although waves breaking over a bank are not so  ehrenberg also states that where there is much sediment placed so as to be liable to be moved by the waves there is little or no coral and a collection of living specimens placed by him on a sandy shore died in the course of a few days  ibid page 49  an experiment however will presently be related in which some large masses of living coral increased rapidly in size after having been secured by stakes on a sandbank  that loose sediment should be injurious to the living polypifers appears at first sight probable and accordingly in sounding off keeling atoll and as will hereafter be shown off mauritius the arming of the lead invariably came up clean where the coral was growing vigorously  this same circumstance has probably given rise to a strange belief which according to captain owen captain owen on the geography of the maldiva islands geographical journal volume ii page 88 is general amongst the inhabitants of the maldiva atolls namely that corals have roots and therefore that if merely broken down to the surface they grow up again but if rooted out they are permanently destroyed  by this means the inhabitants keep their harbours clear and thus the french governor of st marys in madagascar cleared out and made a beautiful little port at that place  for it is probable that sand would accumulate in the hollows formed by tearing out the corals but not on the broken and projecting stumps and therefore in the former case the fresh growth of the coral might be thus prevented  in the last chapter i remarked that fringingreefs are almost universally breached where streams enter the sea  lieutenant wellstead and others have remarked that this is the case in the red sea dr ruppell reise in abyss band i page 142 says that there are pearshaped harbours in the upraised coralcoast into which periodical streams enter  from this circumstance i presume we must infer that before the upheaval of the strata now forming the coastland fresh water and sediment entered the sea at these points and the coral being thus prevented growing the pearshaped harbours were produced  most authors have attributed this fact to the injurious effects of the fresh water even where it enters the sea only in small quantity and during a part of the year  no doubt brackish water would prevent or retard the growth of coral but i believe that the mud and sand which is deposited even by rivulets when flooded is a much more efficient check  the reef on each side of the channel leading into port louis at mauritius ends abruptly in a wall at the foot of which i sounded and found a bed of thick mud  this steepness of the sides appears to be a general character in such breaches  cook cooks first voyage volume ii page 271 hawkesworths edition speaking of one at raiatea says like all the rest it is very steep on both sides  now if it were the fresh water mingling with the salt which prevented the growth of coral the reef certainly would not terminate abruptly but as the polypifers nearest the impure stream would grow less vigorously than those farther off so would the reef gradually thin away  on the other hand the sediment brought down from the land would only prevent the growth of the coral in the line of its deposition but would not check it on the side so that the reefs might increase till they overhung the bed of the channel  the breaches are much fewer in number and front only the larger valleys in reefs of the encircling barrier class  they probably are kept open in the same manner as those into the lagoon of an atoll namely by the force of the currents and the drifting outwards of fine sediment  their position in front of valleys although often separated from the land by deep water lagoonchannels which it might be thought would entirely remove the injurious effects both of the fresh water and the sediment will receive a simple explanation when we discuss the origin of barrierreefs  in the vegetable kingdom every different station has its peculiar group of plants and similar relations appear to prevail with corals  we have already described the great difference between the corals within the lagoon of an atoll and those on its outer margin  the corals also on the margin of keeling island occurred in zones thus the porites and millepora complanata grow to a large size only where they are washed by a heavy sea and are killed by a short exposure to the air whereas three species of nullipora also live amidst the breakers but are able to survive uncovered for a part of each tide at greater depths a strong madrepora and millepora alcicornis are the commonest kinds the former appearing to be confined to this part beneath the zone of massive corals minute encrusting corallines and other organic bodies live  if we compare the external margin of the reef at keeling atoll with that on the leeward side of mauritius which are very differently circumstanced we shall find a corresponding difference in the appearance of the corals  at the latter place the genus madrepora is preponderant over every other kind and beneath the zone of massive corals there are large beds of seriatopora there is also a marked difference according to captain moresby captain moresby on the northern maldiva atolls geographical journal volume v page 401 between the great branching corals of the red sea and those on the reefs of the maldiva atolls  these facts which in themselves are deserving of notice bear perhaps not very remotely on a remarkable circumstance which has been pointed out to me by captain moresby namely that with very few exceptions none of the coralknolls within the lagoons of peros banhos diego garcia and the great chagos bank all situated in the chagos group rise to the surface of the water whereas all those with equally few exceptions within solomon and egmont atolls in the same group and likewise within the large southern maldiva atolls reach the surface  i make these statements after having examined the charts of each atoll  in the lagoon of peros banhos which is nearly twenty miles across there is only one single reef which rises to the surface in diego garcia there are seven but several of these lie close to the margin of the lagoon and need scarcely have been reckoned in the great chagos bank there is not one  on the other hand in the lagoons of some of the great southern maldiva atolls although thickly studded with reefs every one without exception rises to the surface and on an average there are less than two submerged reefs in each atoll in the northern atolls however the submerged lagoonreefs are not quite so rare the submerged reefs in the chagos atolls generally have from one to seven fathoms water on them but some have from seven to ten  most of them are small with very steep sides some of these statements were not communicated to me verbally by captain moresby but are taken from the ms account before alluded to of the chagos group at peros banhos they rise from a depth of about thirty fathoms and some of them in the great chagos bank from above forty fathoms they are covered captain moresby informs me with living and healthy coral two and three feet high consisting of several species  why then have not these lagoonreefs reached the surface like the innumerable ones in the atolls above named  if we attempt to assign any difference in their external conditions as the cause of this diversity we are at once baffled  the lagoon of diego garcia is not deep and is almost wholly surrounded by its reef peros banhos is very deep much larger with many wide passages communicating with the open sea  on the other hand of those atolls in which all or nearly all the lagoonreefs have reached the surface some are small others large some shallow others deep some wellenclosed and others open  captain moresby informs me that he has seen a french chart of diego garcia made eighty years before his survey and apparently very accurate and from it he infers that during this interval there has not been the smallest change in the depth on any of the knolls within the lagoon  it is also known that during the last fiftyone years the eastern channel into the lagoon has neither become narrower nor decreased in depth and as there are numerous small knolls of living coral within it some change might have been anticipated  moreover as the whole reef round the lagoon of this atoll has been converted into landan unparalleled case i believe in an atoll of such large sizeand as the strip of land is for considerable spaces more than half a mile widealso a very unusual circumstancewe have the best possible evidence that diego garcia has remained at its present level for a very long period  with this fact and with the knowledge that no sensible change has taken place during eighty years in the coralknolls and considering that every single reef has reached the surface in other atolls which do not present the smallest appearance of being older than diego garcia and peros banhos and which are placed under the same external conditions with them one is led to conclude that these submerged reefs although covered with luxuriant coral have no tendency to grow upwards and that they would remain at their present levels for an almost indefinite period  from the number of these knolls from their position size and form many of them being only one or two hundred yards across with a rounded outline and precipitous sidesit is indisputable that they have been formed by the growth of coral and this makes the case much more remarkable  in peros banhos and in the great chagos bank some of these almost columnar masses are 200 feet high and their summits lie only from two to eight fathoms beneath the surface therefore a small proportional amount more of growth would cause them to attain the surface like those numerous knolls which rise from an equally great depth within the maldiva atolls  we can hardly suppose that time has been wanting for the upward growth of the coral whilst in diego garcia the broad annular strip of land formed by the continued accumulation of detritus shows how long this atoll has remained at its present level  we must look to some other cause than the rate of growth and i suspect it will be found in the reefs being formed of different species of corals adapted to live at different depths  the great chagos bank is situated in the centre of the chagos group and the pitt and speaker banks at its two extreme points  these banks resemble atolls except in their external rim being about eight fathoms submerged and in being formed of dead rock with very little living coral on it a portion nine miles long of the annular reef of peros banhos atoll is in the same condition  these facts as will hereafter be shown render it very probable that the whole group at some former period subsided seven or eight fathoms and that the coral perished on the outer margin of those atolls which are now submerged but that it continued alive and grew up to the surface on those which are now perfect  if these atolls did subside and if from the suddenness of the movement or from any other cause those corals which are better adapted to live at a certain depth than at the surface once got possession of the knolls supplanting the former occupants they would exert little or no tendency to grow upwards  to illustrate this i may observe that if the corals of the upper zone on the outer edge of keeling atoll were to perish it is improbable that those of the lower zone would grow to the surface and thus become exposed to conditions for which they do not appear to be adapted  the conjecture that the corals on the submerged knolls within the chagos atolls have analogous habits with those of the lower zone outside keeling atoll receives some support from a remark by captain moresby namely that they have a different appearance from those on the reefs in the maldiva atolls which as we have seen all rise to the surface he compares the kind of difference to that of the vegetation under different climates  i have entered at considerable length into this case although unable to throw much light on it in order to show that an equal tendency to upward growth ought not to be attributed to all coralreefsto those situated at different depthsto those forming the ring of an atoll or those on the knolls within a lagoonto those in one area and those in another  the inference therefore that one reef could not grow up to the surface within a given time because another not known to be covered with the same species of corals and not known to be placed under conditions exactly the same has not within the same time reached the surface is unsound   section 4iion the rate of growth of coralreefs  the remark made at the close of the last section naturally leads to this division of our subject which has not i think hitherto been considered under a right point of view  ehrenberg ehrenberg as before cited pages 39 46 and 50 has stated that in the red sea the corals only coat other rocks in a layer from one to two feet in thickness or at most to a fathom and a half and he disbelieves that in any case they form by their own proper growth great masses stratum over stratum  a nearly similar observation has been made by mm quoy and gaimard annales des sciences nat tom vi page 28 with respect to the thickness of some upraised beds of coral which they examined at timor and some other places ehrenberg ehrenberg ut sup page 42 saw certain large massive corals in the red sea which he imagines to be of such vast antiquity that they might have been beheld by pharaoh and according to mr lyell lyells principles of geology book iii chapter xviii there are certain corals at bermuda which are known by tradition to have been living for centuries  to show how slowly coralreefs grow upwards captain beechey beecheys voyage to the pacific chapter viii has adduced the case of the dolphin reef off tahiti which has remained at the same depth beneath the surface namely about two fathoms and a half for a period of sixtyseven years  there are reefs in the red sea which certainly do not appear ehrenberg ut sup page 43 to have increased in dimensions during the last halfcentury and from the comparison of old charts with recent surveys probably not during the last two hundred years  these and other similar facts have so strongly impressed many with the belief of the extreme slowness of the growth of corals that they have even doubted the possibility of islands in the great oceans having been formed by their agency  others again who have not been overwhelmed by this difficulty have admitted that it would require thousands and tens of thousands of years to form a mass even of inconsiderable thickness but the subject has not i believe been viewed in the proper light  that masses of considerable thickness have been formed by the growth of coral may be inferred with certainty from the following facts  in the deep lagoons of peros banhos and of the great chagos bank there are as already described small steepsided knolls covered with living coral there are similar knolls in the southern maldiva atolls some of which as captain moresby assures me are less than a hundred yards in diameter and rise to the surface from a depth of between two hundred and fifty and three hundred feet  considering their number form and position it would be preposterous to suppose that they are based on pinnacles of any rock not of coral formation or that sediment could have been heaped up into such small and steep isolated cones  as no kind of living coral grows above the height of a few feet we are compelled to suppose that these knolls have been formed by the successive growth and death of many individualsfirst one being broken off or killed by some accident and then another and one set of species being replaced by another set with different habits as the reef rose nearer the surface or as other changes supervened  the spaces between the corals would become filled up with fragments and sand and such matter would probably soon be consolidated for we learn from lieutenant nelson geological transactions volume v page 113 that at bermuda a process of this kind takes place beneath water without the aid of evaporation  in reefs also of the barrier class we may feel sure as i have shown that masses of great thickness have been formed by the growth of the coral in the case of vanikoro judging only from the depth of the moat between the land and the reef the wall of coralrock must be at least three hundred feet in vertical thickness  it is unfortunate that the upraised coralislands in the pacific have not been examined by a geologist  the cliffs of elizabeth island in the low archipelago are eighty feet high and appear from captain beecheys description to consist of a homogeneous coralrock  from the isolated position of this island we may safely infer that it is an upraised atoll and therefore that it has been formed by masses of coral grown together savage island seems from the description of the younger forster forsters voyage round the world with cook volume ii pages 163 167 to have a similar structure and its shores are about forty feet high some of the cook islands also appear williamss narrative of missionary enterprise page 30 to be similarly composed  captain belcher rn in a letter which captain beaufort showed me at the admiralty speaking of bow atoll says i have succeeded in boring fortyfive feet through coralsand when the auger became jammed by the falling in of the surrounding creamy matter  on one of the maldiva atolls captain moresby bored to a depth of twentysix feet when his auger also broke he has had the kindness to give me the matter brought up it is perfectly white and like finely triturated coralrock  in my description of keeling atoll i have given some facts which show that the reef probably has grown outwards and i have found just within the outer margin the great mounds of porites and of millepora with their summits lately killed and their sides subsequently thickened by the growth of the coral a layer also of nullipora had already coated the dead surface  as the external slope of the reef is the same round the whole of this atoll and round many other atolls the angle of inclination must result from an adaption between the growing powers of the coral and the force of the breakers and their action on the loose sediment  the reef therefore could not increase outwards without a nearly equal addition to every part of the slope so that the original inclination might be preserved and this would require a large amount of sediment all derived from the wear of corals and shells to be added to the lower part moreover at keeling atoll and probably in many other cases the different kinds of corals would have to encroach on each other thus the nulliporae cannot increase outwards without encroaching on the porites and millepora complanata as is now taking place nor these latter without encroaching on the strongly branched madreporet the millepora alcicornis and some astraeas nor these again without a foundation being formed for them within the requisite depth by the accumulation of sediment  how slow then must be the ordinary lateral or outward growth of such reefs  but off christmas atoll where the sea is much more shallow than is usual we have good reason to believe that within a period not very remote the reef has increased considerably in width  the land has the extraordinary breadth of three miles it consists of parallel ridges of shells and broken corals which furnish an incontestable proof as observed by cook cooks third voyage book iii chapter x that the island has been produced by accessions from the sea and is in a state of increase  the land is fronted by a coralreef and from the manner in which islets are known to be formed we may feel confident that the reef was not three miles wide when the first or most backward ridge was thrown up and therefore we must conclude that the reef has grown outwards during the accumulation of the successive ridges  here then a wall of coralrock of very considerable breadth has been formed by the outward growth of the living margin within a period during which ridges of shells and corals lying on the bare surface have not decayed  there can be little doubt from the account given by captain beechey that matilda atoll in the low archipelago has been converted in the space of thirtyfour years from being as described by the crew of a wrecked whaling vessel a reef of rocks into a lagoonisland fourteen miles in length with one of its sides covered nearly the whole way with high trees  beecheys voyage to the pacific chapter vii and viii  the islets also on keeling atoll it has been shown have increased in length and since the construction of an old chart several of them have become united into one long islet but in this case and in that of matilda atoll we have no proof and can only infer as probable that the reef that is the foundation of the islets has increased as well as the islets themselves  after these considerations i attach little importance as indicating the ordinary and still less the possible rate of outward growth of coralreefs to the fact that certain reefs in the red sea have not increased during a long interval of time or to other such cases as that of ouluthy atoll in the caroline group where every islet described a thousand years before by cantova was found in the same state by lutke f lutkes voyage autour du monde  in the group elato however it appears that what is now the islet falipi is called in cantovas chart the banc de falipi  it is not stated whether this has been caused by the growth of coral or by the accumulation of sandwithout it could be shown that in these cases the conditions were favourable to the vigorous and unopposed growth of the corals living in the different zones of depth and that a proper basis for the extent of the reef was present  the former conditions must depend on many contingencies and in the deep oceans where coral formations most abound a basis within the requisite depth can rarely be present  nor do i attach any importance to the fact of certain submerged reefs as those off tahiti or those within diego garcia not now being nearer the surface than they were many years ago as an indication of the rate under favourable circumstances of the upward growth of reefs after it has been shown that all the reefs have grown to the surface in some of the chagos atolls but that in neighbouring atolls which appear to be of equal antiquity and to be exposed to the same external conditions every reef remains submerged for we are almost driven to attribute this to a difference not in the rate of growth but in the habits of the corals in the two cases  in an oldstanding reef the corals which are so different in kind on different parts of it are probably all adapted to the stations they occupy and hold their places like other organic beings by a struggle one with another and with external nature hence we may infer that their growth would generally be slow except under peculiarly favourable circumstances  almost the only natural condition allowing a quick upward growth of the whole surface of a reef would be a slow subsidence of the area in which it stood if for instance keeling atoll were to subside two or three feet can we doubt that the projecting margin of live coral about half an inch in thickness which surrounds the dead upper surfaces of the mounds of porites would in this case form a concentric layer over them and the reef thus increase upwards instead of as at present outwards the nulliporae are now encroaching on the porites and millepora but in this case might we not confidently expect that the latter would in their turn encroach on the nulliporae  after a subsidence of this kind the sea would gain on the islets and the great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon would be covered by a sheet of clear water and might we not then expect that these reefs would rise to the surface as they anciently did when the lagoon was less confined by islets and as they did within a period of ten years in the schoonerchannel cut by the inhabitants  in one of the maldiva atolls a reef which within a very few years existed as an islet bearing cocoanut trees was found by lieutenant prentice entirely covered with live coral and madrepore  the natives believe that the islet was washed away by a change in the currents but if instead of this it had quietly subsided surely every part of the island which offered a solid foundation would in a like manner have become coated with living coral  through steps such as these any thickness of rock composed of a singular intermixture of various kinds of corals shells and calcareous sediment might be formed but without subsidence the thickness would necessarily be determined by the depth at which the reefbuilding polypifers can exist if it be asked at what rate in years i suppose a reef of coral favourably circumstanced could grow up from a given depth i should answer that we have no precise evidence on this point and comparatively little concern with it  we see in innumerable points over wide areas that the rate has been sufficient either to bring up the reefs from various depths to the surface or as is more probable to keep them at the surface during progressive subsidences and this is a much more important standard of comparison than any cycle of years  it may however be inferred from the following facts that the rate in years under favourable circumstances would be very far from slow  dr allan of forres has in his ms thesis deposited in the library of the edinburgh university extracts from which i owe to the kindness of dr malcolmson the following account of some experiments which he tried during his travels in the years 1830 to 1832 on the east coast of madagascar  to ascertain the rise and progress of the coralfamily and fix the number of species met with at foul point latitude 17 deg 40 twenty species of coral were taken off the reef and planted apart on a sandbank three feet deep at low water  each portion weighed ten pounds and was kept in its place by stakes  similar quantities were placed in a clump and secured as the rest  this was done in december 1830  in july following each detached mass was nearly level with the sea at low water quite immovable and several feet long stretching as the parent reef with the coast current from north to south  the masses accumulated in a clump were found equally increased but some of the species in such unequal ratios as to be growing over each other  the loss of dr allans magnificent collection by shipwreck unfortunately prevents its being known to what genera these corals belonged but from the numbers experimented on it is certain that all the more conspicuous kinds must have been included dr allan informs me in a letter that he believes it was a madrepora which grew most vigorously  one may be permitted to suspect that the level of the sea might possibly have been somewhat different at the two stated periods nevertheless it is quite evident that the growth of the tenpound masses during the six or seven months at the end of which they were found immovably fixed it is stated by de la beche geological manual page 143 on the authority of mr lloyd who surveyed the isthmus of panama that some specimens of polypifers placed by him in a sheltered pool of water were found in the course of a few days firmly fixed by the secretion of a stony matter to the bottom and several feet in length must have been very great  the fact of the different kinds of coral when placed in one clump having increased in extremely unequal ratios is very interesting as it shows the manner in which a reef supporting many species of coral would probably be affected by a change in the external conditions favouring one kind more than another  the growth of the masses of coral in n and s lines parallel to the prevailing currents whether due to the drifting of sediment or to the simple movement of the water is also a very interesting circumstance  a fact communicated to me by lieutenant wellstead in in some degree corroborates the result of dr allans experiments it is that in the persian gulf a ship had her copper bottom encrusted in the course of twenty months with a layer of coral two feet in thickness which it required great force to remove when the vessel was docked it was not ascertained to what order this coral belonged  the case of the schoonerchannel choked up with coral in an interval of less than ten years in the lagoon of keeling atoll should be here borne in mind  we may also infer from the trouble which the inhabitants of the maldiva atolls take to root out as they express it the coralknolls from their harbours that their growth can hardly be very slow  mr stutchbury west of england journal no i page 50 has described a specimen of agaricia weighing 2 lbs 9 oz which surrounds a species of oyster whose age could not be more than two years and yet is completely enveloped by this dense coral  i presume that the oyster was living when the specimen was procured otherwise the fact tells nothing  mr stutchbury also mentions an anchor which had become entirely encrusted with coral in fifty years other cases however are recorded of anchors which have long remained amidst coralreefs without having become coated  the anchor of the beagle in 1832 after having been down exactly one month at rio de janeiro was so thickly coated by two species of tubularia that large spaces of the iron were entirely concealed the tufts of this horny zoophyte were between two and three inches in length  it has been attempted to compute but i believe erroneously the rate of growth of a reef from the fact mentioned by captain beechey of the chama gigas being embedded in coralrock  but it should be remembered that some species of this genus invariably live both whilst young and old in cavities which the animal has the power of enlarging with its growth  i saw many of these shells thus embedded in the outer flat of keeling atoll which is composed of dead rock and therefore the cavities in this case had no relation whatever with the growth of coral  m lesson also speaking of this shell partie zoolog voyage de la coquille has remarked que constamment ses valves etaient engages completement dans la masse des madrepores  from the facts given in this section it may be concluded first that considerable thicknesses of rock have certainly been formed within the present geological area by the growth of coral and the accumulation of its detritus and secondly that the increase of individual corals and of reefs both outwards or horizontally and upwards or vertically under the peculiar conditions favourable to such increase is not slow when referred either to the standard of the average oscillations of level in the earths crust or to the more precise but less important one of a cycle of years   section 4iiion the depths at which reefbuilding polypifers can live  i have already described in detail which might have appeared trivial the nature of the bottom of the sea immediately surrounding keeling atoll and i will now describe with almost equal care the soundings off the fringingreefs of mauritius  i have preferred this arrangement for the sake of grouping together facts of a similar nature  i sounded with the wide bellshaped lead which captain fitzroy used at keeling island but my examination of the bottom was confined to a few miles of coast between port louis and tomb bay on the leeward side of the island  the edge of the reef is formed of great shapeless masses of branching madrepores which chiefly consist of two speciesapparently m corymbosa and pocillifera mingled with a few other kinds of coral  these masses are separated from each other by the most irregular gullies and cavities into which the lead sinks many feet  outside this irregular border of madrepores the water deepens gradually to twenty fathoms which depth generally is found at the distance of from half to threequarters of a mile from the reef  a little further out the depth is thirty fathoms and thence the bank slopes rapidly into the depths of the ocean  this inclination is very gentle compared with that outside keeling and other atolls but compared with most coasts it is steep  the water was so clear outside the reef that i could distinguish every object forming the rugged bottom  in this part and to a depth of eight fathoms i sounded repeatedly and at each cast pounded the bottom with the broad lead nevertheless the arming invariably came up perfectly clean but deeply indented  from eight to fifteen fathoms a little calcareous sand was occasionally brought up but more frequently the arming was simply indented  in all this space the two madrepores above mentioned and two species of astraea with rather large stars seemed the commonest kinds since the preceding pages were printed off i have received from mr lyell a very interesting pamphlet entitled remarks upon coral formations etc by j couthouy boston united states 1842 there is a statement page 6 on the authority of the rev j williams corroborating the remarks made by ehrenberg and lyell page 71 of this volume on the antiquity of certain individual corals in the red sea and at bermuda namely that at upolu one of the navigator islands particular clumps of coral are known to the fishermen by name derived from either some particular configuration or tradition attached to them and handed down from time immemorial  with respect to the thickness of masses of coralrock it clearly appears from the descriptions given by mr couthouy pages 34 58 that mangaia and aurora islands are upraised atolls composed of coral rock the level summit of the former is about three hundred feet and that of aurora island is two hundred feet above the sealevel and it must be noticed that twice at the depth of fifteen fathoms the arming was marked with a clean impression of an astraea besides these lithophytes some fragments of the millepora alcicornis which occurs in the same relative position at keeling island were brought up and in the deeper parts there were large beds of a seriatopora different from s subulata but closely allied to it  on the beach within the reef the rolled fragments consisted chiefly of the corals just mentioned and of a massive porites like that at keeling atoll of a meandrina pocillopora verrucosa and of numerous fragments of nullipora from fifteen to twenty fathoms the bottom was with few exceptions either formed of sand or thickly covered with seriatopora this delicate coral seems to form at these depths extensive beds unmingled with any other kind at twenty fathoms one sounding brought up a fragment of madrepora apparently m pocillifera and i believe it is the same species for i neglected to bring specimens from both stations which mainly forms the upper margin of the reef if so it grows in depths varying from 0 to 20 fathoms  between 20 and 23 fathoms i obtained several soundings and they all showed a sandy bottom with one exception at 30 fathoms when the arming came up scooped out as if by the margin of a large caryophyllia beyond 33 fathoms i sounded only once and from 86 fathoms at the distance of one mile and a third from the edge of the reef the arming brought up calcareous sand with a pebble of volcanic rock  the circumstance of the arming having invariably come up quite clean when sounding within a certain number of fathoms off the reefs of mauritius and keeling atoll eight fathoms in the former case and twelve in the latter and of its having always come up with one exception smoothed and covered with sand when the depth exceeded twenty fathoms probably indicates a criterion by which the limits of the vigorous growth of coral might in all cases be readily ascertained  i do not however suppose that if a vast number of soundings were obtained round these islands the limit above assigned would be found never to vary but i conceive the facts are sufficient to show that the exceptions would be few  the circumstance of a gradual change in the two cases from a field of clean coral to a smooth sandy bottom is far more important in indicating the depth at which the larger kinds of coral flourish than almost any number of separate observations on the depth at which certain species have been dredged up  for we can understand the gradation only as a prolonged struggle against unfavourable conditions if a person were to find the soil clothed with turf on the banks of a stream of water but on going to some distance on one side of it he observed the blades of grass growing thinner and thinner with intervening patches of sand until he entered a desert of sand he would safely conclude especially if changes of the same kind were noticed in other places that the presence of the water was absolutely necessary to the formation of a thick bed of turf so may we conclude with the same feeling of certainty that thick beds of coral are formed only at small depths beneath the surface of the sea  i have endeavoured to collect every fact which might either invalidate or corroborate this conclusion  captain moresby whose opportunities for observation during his survey of the maldiva and chagos archipelagoes have been unrivalled informs me that the upper part or zone of the steepsided reefs on the inner and outer coasts of the atolls in both groups invariably consists of coral and the lower parts of sand  at seven or eight fathoms depth the bottom is formed as could be seen through the clear water of great living masses of coral which at about ten fathoms generally stand some way apart from each other with patches of white sand between them and at a little greater depth these patches become united into a smooth steep slope without any coral  captain moresby also informs me in support of his statement that he found only decayed coral on the padua bank northern part of the laccadive group which has an average depth between twentyfive and thirtyfive fathoms but that on some other banks in the same group with only ten or twelve fathoms water on them for instance the tillacapeni bank the coral was living  with regard to the coralreefs in the red sea ehrenberg has the following passagethe living corals do not descend there into great depths  on the edges of islets and near reefs where the depth was small very many lived but we found no more even at six fathoms  the pearlfishers at yemen and massaua asserted that there was no coral near the pearlbanks at nine fathoms depth but only sand  we were not able to institute any more special researches  ehrenberg uber die natur etc page 50  i am however assured both by captain moresby and lieutenant wellstead that in the more northern parts of the red sea there are extensive beds of living coral at a depth of twentyfive fathoms in which the anchors of their vessels were frequently entangled  captain moresby attributes the less depth at which the corals are able to live in the places mentioned by ehrenberg to the greater quantity of sediment there and the situations where they were flourishing at the depth of twentyfive fathoms were protected and the water was extraordinarily limpid  on the leeward side of mauritius where i found the coral growing at a somewhat greater depth than at keeling atoll the sea owing apparently to its tranquil state was likewise very clear  within the lagoons of some of the marshall atolls where the water can be but little agitated there are according to kotzebue living beds of coral in twentyfive fathoms  from these facts and considering the manner in which the beds of clean coral off mauritius keeling island the maldiva and chagos atolls graduated into a sandy slope it appears very probable that the depth at which reefbuilding polypifers can exist is partly determined by the extent of inclined surface which the currents of the sea and the recoiling waves have the power to keep free from sediment  mm quoy and gaimard annales des sci nat tom vi believe that the growth of coral is confined within very limited depths and they state that they never found any fragment of an astraea the genus they consider most efficient in forming reefs at a depth above twentyfive or thirty feet but we have seen that in several places the bottom of the sea is paved with massive corals at more than twice this depth and at fifteen fathoms or twice this depth off the reefs of mauritius the arming was marked with the distinct impression of a living astraea  millepora alcicornis lives in from 0 to 12 fathoms and the genera madrepora and seriatopora from 0 to 20 fathoms  captain moresby has given me a specimen of sideropora scabra porites of lamarck brought up alive from 17 fathoms  mr couthouy remarks on coral formations page 12 states that he has dredged up on the bahama banks considerable masses of meandrina from 16 fathoms and he has seen this coral growing in 20 fathoms  a caryophyllia half an inch in diameter was dredged up alive from 80 fathoms off juan fernandez latitude 33 deg s by captain pp king i am indebted to mr stokes for having kindly communicated this fact to me together with much other valuable information this is the most remarkable fact with which i am acquainted showing the depth at which a genus of corals often found on reefs can exist  we ought however to feel less surprise at this fact as caryophyllia alone of the lamelliform genera ranges far beyond the tropics it is found in zetland flemings british animals genus caryophyllia in latitude 60 deg n in deep water and i procured a small species from tierra del

stokes writing to me from the nw coast of australia says that a strongly branched coral was procured there from thirty fathoms unfortunately it is not known to what genera these corals belong  i will record in the form of a note all the facts that i have been able to collect on the depths both within and without the tropics at which those corals and corallines can live which there is no reason to suppose ever materially aid in the construction of a reef  in the following list the name of the zoophyte is followed by the depth in fathoms the country and degrees s latitude and the authority

of this fact in a letter  ellis nat hist of coralline page 96 states that ombellularia was procured in latitude 79 deg n sticking to a line from the depth of 236 fathoms hence this coral either must have been floating loose or was entangled in stray line at the bottom  off keeling atoll a compound ascidia sigillina was brought up from 39 fathoms and a piece of sponge apparently living from 70 and a fragment of nullipora also apparently living from 92 fathoms  at a greater depth than 90 fathoms off this coral island the bottom was thickly strewed with joints of halimeda and small fragments of other nulliporae but all dead  captain b allen rn informs me that in the survey of the west indies it was noticed that between the depth of 10 and 200 fathoms the sounding lead very generally came up coated with the dead joints of a halimeda of which he showed me specimens  off pernambuco in brazil in about twelve fathoms the bottom was covered with fragments dead and alive of a dull red nullipora and i infer from roussins chart that a bottom of this kind extends over a wide area  on the beach within the coralreefs of mauritius vast quantities of fragments of nulliporae were piled up  from these facts it appears that these simply organized bodies are amongst the most abundant productions of the sea  although the limit of depth at which each particular kind of coral ceases to exist is far from being accurately known yet when we bear in mind the manner in which the clumps of coral gradually became infrequent at about the same depth and wholly disappeared at a greater depth than twenty fathoms on the slope round keeling atoll on the leeward side of the mauritius and at rather less depth both without and within the atolls of the maldiva and chagos archipelagoes and when we know that the reefs round these islands do not differ from other coral formations in their form and structure we may i think conclude that in ordinary cases reefbuilding polypifers do not flourish at greater depths than between twenty and thirty fathoms  it has been argued journal of the royal geographical society 1831 page 218 that reefs may possibly rise from very great depths through the means of small corals first making a platform for the growth of the stronger kinds  this however is an arbitrary supposition it is not always remembered that in such cases there is an antagonist power in action namely the decay of organic bodies when not protected by a covering of sediment or by their own rapid growth  we have moreover no right to calculate on unlimited time for the accumulation of small organic bodies into great masses  every fact in geology proclaims that neither the land nor the bed of the sea retain for indefinite periods the same level  as well might it be imagined that the british seas would in time become choked up with beds of oysters or that the numerous small corallines off the inhospitable shores of tierra del fuego would in time form a solid and extensive

have visited the pacific seem to have had their attention riveted by the lagoonislands or atollsthose singular rings of coralland which rise abruptly out of the unfathomable oceanand have passed over almost unnoticed the scarcely less wonderful encircling barrierreefs  the theory most generally received on the formation of atolls is that they are based on submarine craters but where can we find a crater of the shape of bow atoll which is five times as long as it is broad plate i figure 4 or like that of menchikoff island plate ii figure 3 with its three loops together sixty miles in length or like rimsky korsacoff narrow crooked and fiftyfour miles long or like the northern maldiva atolls made up of numerous ringformed reefs placed on the margin of a discone of which discs is eightyeight miles in length and only from ten to twenty in breadth  it is also not a little improbable that there should have existed as many craters of immense size crowded together beneath the sea as there are now in some parts atolls but this theory lies under a greater difficulty as will be evident when we consider on what foundations the atolls of the larger archipelagoes rest nevertheless if the rim of a crater afforded a basis at the proper depth i am far from denying that a reef like a perfectly characterised atoll might not be formed some such perhaps now exist but i cannot believe in the possibility of the greater number having thus originated  an earlier and better theory was proposed by chamisso kotzebues first voyage volume iii page 331 he supposes that as the more massive kinds of corals prefer the surf the outer portions in a reef rising from a submarine basis would first reach the surface and consequently form a ring  but on this view it must be assumed that in every case the basis consists of a flat bank for if it were conically formed like a mountainous mass we can see no reason why the coral should spring up from the flanks instead of from the central and highest parts considering the number of the atolls in the pacific and indian oceans this assumption is very improbable  as the lagoons of atolls are sometimes even more than forty fathoms deep it must also be assumed on this view that at a depth at which the waves do not break the coral grows more vigorously on the edges of a bank than on its central part and this is an assumption without any evidence in support of it  i remarked in the third chapter that a reef growing on a detached bank would tend to assume an atolllike structure if therefore corals were to grow up from a bank with a level surface some fathoms submerged having steep sides and being situated in a deep sea a reef not to be distinguished from an atoll might be formed i believe some such exist in the west indies  but a difficulty of the same kind with that affecting the crater theory runners as we shall presently see this view inapplicable to the greater number of atolls  no theory worthy of notice has been advanced to account for those barrierreefs which encircle islands of moderate dimensions  the great reef which fronts the coast of australia has been supposed but without any special facts to rest on the edge of a submarine precipice extending parallel to the shore  the origin of the third class or of fringingreefs presents i believe scarcely any difficulty and is simply consequent on the polypifers not growing up from great depths and their not flourishing close to gently shelving beaches where the water is often turbid  what cause then has given to atolls and barrierreefs their characteristic forms  let us see whether an important deduction will not follow from the consideration of these two circumstances first the reefbuilding corals flourishing only at limited depths and secondly the vastness of the areas interspersed with coralreefs and coralislets none of which rise to a greater height above the level of the sea than that attained by matter thrown up by the waves and winds  i do not make this latter statement vaguely i have carefully sought for descriptions of every island in the intertropical seas and my task has been in some degree abridged by a map of the pacific corrected in 1834 by mm durville and lottin in which the low islands are distinguished from the high ones even from those much less than a hundred feet in height by being written without a capital letter i have detected a few errors in this map respecting the height of some of the islands which will be noticed in the appendix where i treat of coral formations in geographical order  to the appendix also i must refer for a more particular account of the data on which the statements on the next page are grounded  i have ascertained and chiefly from the writings of cook kotzebue bellinghausen duperrey beechey and lutke regarding the pacific and from moresby see also captain owens and lieutenant woods papers in the geographical journal on the maldiva and laccadive archipelagoes  these officers particularly refer to the lowness of the islets but i chiefly ground my assertion respecting these two groups and the chagos group from information communicated to me by captain moresby with respect to the indian ocean that in the following cases the term low island strictly means land of the height commonly attained by matter thrown up by the winds and the waves of an open sea  if we draw a line the plan i have always adopted joining the external atolls of that part of the low archipelago in which the islands are numerous the figure will be a pointed ellipse reaching from hood to lazaref island of which the longer axis is 840 geographical miles and the shorter 420 miles in this space i find from mr couthouys pamphlet page 58 that aurora island is about two hundred feet in height it consists of coralrock and seems to have been formed by the elevation of an atoll  it lies northeast of tahiti close without the line bounding the space coloured dark blue in the map appended to this volume  honden island which is situated in the extreme northwest part of the low archipelago according to measurements made on board the beagle whilst sailing by is 114 feet from the summit of the trees to the waters edge this island appeared to resemble the other atolls of the group none of the innumerable islets united into great rings rise above the stated level the gilbert group is very narrow and 300 miles in length  in a prolonged line from this group at the distance of 240 miles is the marshall archipelago the figure of which is an irregular square one end being broader than the other its length is 520 miles with an average width of 240 these two groups together are 1040 miles in length and all their islets are low  between the southern end of the gilbert and the northern end of low archipelago the ocean is thinly strewed with islands all of which as far as i have been able to ascertain are low so that from nearly the southern end of the low archipelago to the northern end of the marshall archipelago there is a narrow band of ocean more than 4000 miles in length containing a great number of islands all of which are low  in the western part of the caroline archipelago there is a space of 480 miles in length and about 100 broad thinly interspersed with low islands  lastly in the indian ocean the archipelago of the maldivas is 470 miles in length and 60 in breadth that of the laccadives is 150 by 100 miles as there is a low island between these two groups they may be considered as one group of 1000 miles in length  to this may be added the chagos group of low islands situated 280 miles distant in a line prolonged from the southern extremity of the maldivas  this group including the submerged banks is 170 miles in length and 80 in breadth so striking is the uniformity in direction of these three archipelagoes all the islands of which are low that captain moresby in one of his papers speaks of them as parts of one great chain nearly 1500 miles long  i am then fully justified in repeating that enormous spaces both in the pacific and indian oceans are interspersed with islands of which not one rises above that height to which the waves and winds in an open sea can heap up matter  on what foundations then have these reefs and islets of coral been constructed  a foundation must originally have been present beneath each atoll at that limited depth which is indispensable for the first growth of the reefbuilding polypifers  a conjecture will perhaps be hazarded that the requisite bases might have been afforded by the accumulation of great banks of sediment which owing to the action of superficial currents aided possibly by the undulatory movement of the sea did not quite reach the surfaceas actually appears to have been the case in some parts of the west indian sea  but in the form and disposition of the groups of atolls there is nothing to countenance this notion and the assumption without any proof that a number of immense piles of sediment have been heaped on the floor of the great pacific and indian oceans in their central parts far remote from land and where the dark blue colour of the limpid water bespeaks its purity cannot for one moment be admitted  the many widelyscattered atolls must therefore rest on rocky bases  but we cannot believe that the broad summit of a mountain lies buried at the depth of a few fathoms beneath every atoll and nevertheless throughout the immense areas abovenamed with not one point of rock projecting above the level of the sea for we may judge with some accuracy of mountains beneath the sea by those on the land and where can we find a single chain several hundred miles in length and of considerable breadth much less several such chains with their many broad summits attaining the same height within from 120 to 180 feet  if the data be thought insufficient on which i have grounded my belief respecting the depth at which the reefbuilding polypifers can exist and it be assumed that they can flourish at a depth of even one hundred fathoms yet the weight of the above argument is but little diminished for it is almost equally improbable that as many submarine mountains as there are low islands in the several great and widely separated areas above specified should all rise within six hundred feet of the surface of the sea and not one above it as that they should be of the same height within the smaller limit of one or two hundred feet  so highly improbable is this supposition that we are compelled to believe that the bases of the many atolls did never at any one period all lie submerged within the depth of a few fathoms beneath the surface but that they were brought into the requisite position or level some at one period and some at another through movements in the earths crust  but this could not have been effected by elevation for the belief that points so numerous and so widely separated were successively uplifted to a certain level but that not one point was raised above that level is quite as improbable as the former supposition and indeed differs little from it it will probably occur to those who have read ehrenbergs account of the reefs of the red sea that many points in these great areas may have been elevated but that as soon as raised the protuberant parts were cut off by the destroying action of the waves a moments reflection however on the basinlike form of the atolls will show that this is impossible for the upheaval and subsequent abrasion of an island would leave a flat disc which might become coated with coral but not a deeply concave surface moreover we should expect to see in some parts at least the rock of the foundation brought to the surface  if then the foundations of the many atolls were not uplifted into the requisite position they must of necessity have subsided into it and this at once solves every difficulty the additional difficulty on the crater hypothesis before alluded to will now be evident for on this view the volcanic action must be supposed to have formed within the areas specified a vast number of craters all rising within a few fathoms of the surface and not one above it  the supposition that the craters were at different times upraised above the surface and were there abraded by the surf and subsequently coated by corals is subject to nearly the same objections with those given above in this paragraph but i consider it superfluous to detail all the arguments opposed to such a notion  chamissos theory from assuming the existence of so many banks all lying at the proper depth beneath the water is also vitally defective  the same observation applies to an hypothesis of lieutenant nelsons geolog trans volume v page 122 who supposes that the ringformed structure is caused by a greater number of germs of corals becoming attached to the declivity than to the central plateau of a submarine bank it likewise applies to the notion formerly entertained forsters observ page 151 that lagoonislands owe their peculiar form to the instinctive tendencies of the polypifers  according to this latter view the corals on the outer margin of the reef instinctively expose themselves to the surf in order to afford protection to corals living in the lagoon which belong to other genera and to other families for we may safely infer from the facts given in the last chapter that during a gradual subsidence the corals would be favourably circumstanced for building up their solid frame works and reaching the surface as island after island slowly disappeared  thus areas of immense extent in the central and most profound parts of the great oceans might become interspersed with coralislets none of which would rise to a greater height than that attained by detritus heaped up by the sea and nevertheless they might all have been formed by corals which absolutely required for their growth a solid foundation within a few fathoms of the surface  it would be out of place here to do more than allude to the many facts showing that the supposition of a gradual subsidence over large areas is by no means improbable  we have the clearest proof that a movement of this kind is possible in the upright trees buried under the strata many thousand feet in thickness we have also every reason for believing that there are now large areas gradually sinking in the same manner as others are rising  and when we consider how many parts of the surface of the globe have been elevated within recent geological periods we must admit that there have been subsidences on a corresponding scale for otherwise the whole globe would have swollen  it is very remarkable that mr lyell principles of geology sixth edition volume iii page 386 even in the first edition of his principles of geology inferred that the amount of subsidence in the pacific must have exceeded that of elevation from the area of land being very small relatively to the agents there tending to form it namely the growth of coral and volcanic action  but it will be asked are there any direct proofs of a subsiding movement in those areas in which subsidence will explain a phenomenon otherwise inexplicable this however can hardly be expected for it must ever be most difficult excepting in countries long civilised to detect a movement the tendency of which is to conceal the part affected  in barbarous and semicivilised nations how long might not a slow movement even of elevation such as that now affecting scandinavia have escaped attention  mr williams williamss narrative of missionary enterprise page 31 insists strongly that the traditions of the natives which he has taken much pains in collecting do not indicate the appearance of any new islands but on the theory of a gradual subsidence all that would be apparent would be the water sometimes encroaching slowly on the land and the land again recovering by the accumulation of detritus its former extent and perhaps sometimes the conversion of an atoll with coral islets on it into a bare or into a sunken annular reef  such changes would naturally take place at the periods when the sea rose above its usual limits during a gale of more than ordinary strength and the effects of the two causes would be hardly distinguishable  in kotzebues voyage there are accounts of islands both in the caroline and marshall archipelagoes which have been partly washed away during hurricanes and kadu the native who was on board one of the russian vessels said he saw the sea at radack rise to the feet of the cocoanut trees but it was conjured in time  kotzebues first voyage volume iii page 168  a storm lately entirely swept away two of the caroline islands and converted them into shoals it partly also destroyed two other islands  m desmoulins in comptes rendus 1840 page 837  according to a tradition which was communicated to captain fitzroy it is believed in the low archipelago that the arrival of the first ship caused a great inundation which destroyed many lives  mr stutchbury relates that in 1825 the western side of chain atoll in the same group was completely devastated by a hurricane and not less than 300 lives lost in this instance it was evident even to the natives that the hurricane alone was not sufficient to account for the violent agitation of the ocean  west of england journal no i page 35  that considerable changes have taken place recently in some of the atolls in the low archipelago appears certain from the case already given of matilda island with respect to whitsunday and gloucester islands in this same group we must either attribute great inaccuracy to their discoverer the famous circumnavigator wallis or believe that they have undergone a considerable change in the period of fiftynine years between his voyage and that of captain beecheys whitsunday island is described by wallis as about four miles long and three wide now it is only one mile and a half long  the appearance of gloucester island in captain beecheys words beecheys voyage to the pacific chapter vii and walliss voyage in the dolphin chapter iv has been accurately described by its discoverer but its present form and extent differ materially  blenheim reef in the chagos group consists of a waterwashed annular reef thirteen miles in circumference surrounding a lagoon ten fathoms deep on its surface there were a few worn patches of conglomerate coralrock of about the size of hovels and these captain moresby considered as being without doubt the last remnants of islets so that here an atoll has been converted into an atollformed reef  the inhabitants of the maldiva archipelago as long ago as 1605 declared that the high tides and violent currents were diminishing the number of the islands  see an extract from pyrards voyage in captain owens paper on the maldiva archipelago in the geographical journal volume ii page 84 and i have already shown on the authority of captain moresby that the work of destruction is still in progress but that on the other hand the first formation of some islets is known to the present inhabitants  in such cases it would be exceedingly difficult to detect a gradual subsidence of the foundation on which these mutable structures rest  some of the archipelagoes of low coralislands are subject to earthquakes captain moresby informs me that they are frequent though not very strong in the chagos group which occupies a very central position in the indian ocean and is far from any land not of coral formation  one of the islands in this group was formerly covered by a bed of mould which after an earthquake disappeared and was believed by the residents to have been washed by the rain through the broken masses of underlying rock the island was thus rendered unproductive  chamisso see chamisso in kotzebues first voyage volume iii pages 182 and 136 states that earthquakes are felt in the marshall atolls which are far from any high land and likewise in the islands of the caroline archipelago  on one of the latter namely oulleay atoll admiral lutke as he had the kindness to inform me observed several straight fissures about a foot in width running for some hundred yards obliquely across the whole width of the reef  fissures indicate a stretching of the earths crust and therefore probably changes in its level but these coralislands which have been shaken and fissured certainly have not been elevated and therefore probably they have subsided  in the chapter on keeling atoll i attempted to show by direct evidence that the island underwent a movement of subsidence during the earthquakes lately felt there  the facts stand thusthere are many large tracts of ocean without any high land interspersed with reefs and islets formed by the growth of those kinds of corals which cannot live at great depths and the existence of these reefs and low islets in such numbers and at such distant points is quite inexplicable excepting on the theory that the bases on which the reefs first became attached slowly and successively sank beneath the level of the sea whilst the corals continued to grow upwards  no positive facts are opposed to this view and some general considerations render it probable  there is evidence of change in form whether or not from subsidence on some of these coralislands and there is evidence of subterranean disturbances beneath them  will then the theory to which we have thus been led solve the curious problemwhat has given to each class of reef its peculiar form  plate woodcut no 4  aaouter edge of the reef at the

lagoonchannel is exaggerated  let us in imagination place within one of the subsiding areas an island surrounded by a fringingreefthat kind which alone offers no difficulty in the explanation of its origin  let the unbroken lines and the oblique shading in the woodcut no 4 represent a vertical section through such an island and the horizontal shading will represent the section of the reef  now as the island sinks down either a few feet at a time or quite insensibly we may safely infer from what we know of the conditions favourable to the growth of coral that the living masses bathed by the surf on the margin of the reef will soon regain the surface  the water however will encroach little by little on the shore the island becoming lower and smaller and the space between the edge of the reef and the beach proportionately broader  a section of the reef and island in this state after a subsidence of several hundred feet is given by the dotted lines coralislets are supposed to have been formed on the new reef and a ship is anchored in the lagoonchannel  this section is in every respect that of an encircling barrierreef it is in fact a section taken the section has been made from the chart given in the atlas of the voyage of the coquille  the scale is 57 of an inch to a mile  the height of the island according to m lesson is 4026 feet  the deepest part of the lagoonchannel is 162 feet its depth is exaggerated in the woodcut for the sake of clearness east and west through the highest point of the encircled island of bolabola of which a plan is given in plate i figure 5  the same section is more clearly shown in the following woodcut no 5 by the unbroken lines  the width of the reef and its slope both on the outer and inner side will have been determined by the growing powers of the coral under the conditions for instance the force of the breakers and of the currents to which it has been exposed and the lagoonchannel will be deeper or shallower in proportion to the growth of the delicately branched corals within the reef and to the accumulation of sediment relatively also to the rate of subsidence and the length of the intervening stationary periods  it is evident in this section that a line drawn perpendicularly down from the outer edge of the new reef to the foundation of solid rock exceeds by as many feet as there have been feet of subsidence that small limit of depth at which the effective polypifers can livethe corals having grown up as the whole sank down from a basis formed of other corals and their consolidated fragments  thus the difficulty on this head which before seemed so great disappears  as the space between the reef and the subsiding shore continued to increase in breadth and depth and as the injurious effects of the sediment and fresh water borne down from the land were consequently lessened the greater number of the channels with which the reef in its fringing state must have been breached especially those which fronted the smaller streams will have become choked up with the growth of coral on the windward side of the reef where the coral grows most vigorously the breaches will probably have first been closed  in barrierreefs therefore the breaches kept open by draining the tidal waters of the lagoonchannel will generally be placed on the leeward side and they will still face the mouths of the larger streams although removed beyond the influence of their sediment and fresh waterand this it has been shown is commonly the case  referring to the diagram shown above in which the newly formed barrierreef is represented by unbroken lines instead of by dots as in the former woodcut let the work of subsidence go on and the doubly pointed hill will form two small islands or more according to the number of the hills included within one annular reef  let the island continue subsiding and the coralreef will continue growing up on its own foundation whilst the water gains inch by inch on the land until the last and highest pinnacle is covered and there remains a perfect atoll  a vertical section of this atoll is shown in the woodcut by the dotted linesa ship is anchored in its lagoon but islets are not supposed yet to have been formed on the reef  the depth of the lagoon and the width and slope of the reef will depend on the circumstances just referred to under barrierreefs  any further subsidence will produce no change in the atoll except perhaps a diminution in its size from the reef not growing vertically upwards but should the currents of the sea act violently upon it and should the corals perish on part or on the whole of its margin changes would result during subsidence which will be presently noticed  i may here observe that a bank either of rock or of hardened sediment level with the surface of the sea and fringed with living coral would if not so small as to allow the central space to be quickly filled up with detritus by subsidence be converted immediately into an atoll without passing as in the case of a reef fringing the shore of an island through the intermediate form of a barrierreef  if such a bank lay a few fathoms submerged the simple growth of the coral as remarked in the third chapter without the aid of subsidence would produce a structure scarcely to be distinguished from a true atoll for in all cases the corals on the outer margin of a reef from having space and being freely exposed to the open sea will grow vigorously and tend to form a continuous ring whilst the growth of the less massive kinds on the central expanse will be checked by the sediment formed there and by that washed inwards by the breakers and as the space becomes shallower their growth will also be checked by the impurities of the water and probably by the small amount of food brought by the enfeebled currents in proportion to the surface of living reefs studded with innumerable craving mouths the subsidence of a reef based on a bank of this kind would give depth to its central expanse or lagoon steepness to its flanks and through the free growth of the coral symmetry to its outlinei may here repeat that the larger groups of atolls in the pacific and indian oceans cannot be supposed to be founded on banks of this nature  if instead of the island in the diagram the shore of a continent fringed by a reef had subsided a great barrierreef like that on the northeast coast of australia would have necessarily resulted and it would have been separated from the main land by a deepwater channel broad in proportion to the amount of subsidence and to the less or greater inclination of the neighbouring coastline  the effect of the continued subsidence of a great barrierreef of this kind and its probable conversion into a chain of separate atolls will be noticed when we discuss the apparent progressive disseverment of the larger maldiva atolls  we now are able to perceive that the close similarity in form dimensions structure and relative position which latter point will hereafter be more fully noticed between fringing and encircling barrierreefs and between these latter and atolls is the necessary result of the transformation during subsidence of the one class into the other  on this view the three classes of reefs ought to graduate into each other  reefs having intermediate character between those of the fringing and barrier classes do exist for instance on the southwest coast of madagascar a reef extends for several miles within which there is a broad channel from seven to eight fathoms deep but the sea does not deepen abruptly outside the reef such cases however are open to some doubts for an old fringingreef which had extended itself a little on a basis of its own formation would hardly be distinguishable from a barrierreef produced by a small amount of subsidence and with its lagoonchannel nearly filled up with sediment during a long stationary period  between barrierreefs encircling either one lofty island or several small low ones and atolls including a mere expanse of water a striking series can be shown in proof of this i need only refer to the first plate in this volume which speaks more plainly to the eye than any description could to the ear  the authorities from which the charts have been engraved together with some remarks on them and descriptive of the plates are given above  at new caledonia plate ii figure 5 the barrierreefs extend for 150 miles on each side of the submarine prolongation of the island and at their northern extremity they appear broken up and converted into a vast atollformed reef supporting a few low coralislets we may imagine that we here see the effects of subsidence actually in progress the water always encroaching on the northern end of the island towards which the mountains slope down and the reefs steadily building up their massive fabrics in the lines of their ancient growth  we have as yet only considered the origin of barrierreefs and atolls in their simplest form but there remain some peculiarities in structure and some special cases described in the two first chapters to be accounted for by our theory  these consistin the inclined ledge terminated by a wall and sometimes succeeded by a second ledge with a wall round the shores of certain lagoons and lagoonchannels a structure which cannot as i endeavoured to show be explained by the simple growing powers of the coralsin the ring or basinlike forms of the central reefs as well as of the separate marginal portions of the northern maldiva atollsin the submerged condition of the whole or of parts of certain barrier and atollformed reefs where only a part is submerged this being generally to leewardin the apparent progressive disseverment of some of the maldiva atollsin the existence of irregularly formed atolls some being tied together by linear reefs and others with spurs projecting from themand lastly in the structure and origin of the great chagos bank  stepformed ledges round certain lagoons  if we suppose an atoll to subside at an extremely slow rate it is difficult to follow out the complex results  the living corals would grow up on the outer margin and likewise probably in the gullies and deeper parts of the bare surface of the annular reef the water would encroach on the islets but the accumulation of fresh detritus might possibly prevent their entire submergence  after a subsidence of this very slow nature the surface of the annular reef sloping gently into the lagoon would probably become united with the irregular reefs and banks of sand which line the shores of most lagoons  should however the atoll be carried down by a more rapid movement the whole surface of the annular reef where there was a foundation of solid matter would be favourably circumstanced for the fresh growth of coral but as the corals grew upwards on its exterior margin and the waves broke heavily on this part the increase of the massive polypifers on the inner side would be checked from the want of water  consequently the exterior parts would first reach the surface and the new annular reef thus formed on the old one would have its summit inclined inwards and be terminated by a subaqueous wall formed by the upward growth of the coral before being much checked from the inner edge of the solid parts of the old reef  the inner portion of the new reef from not having grown to the surface would be covered by the waters of the lagoon  should a subsidence of the same kind be repeated the corals would again grow up in a wall from all the solid parts of the resunken reef and therefore not from within the sandy shores of the lagoon and the inner part of the new annular reef would from being as before checked in its upward growth be of less height than the exterior parts and therefore would not reach the surface of the lagoon  in this case the shores of the lagoon would be surrounded by two inclined ledges one beneath the other and both abruptly terminated by subaqueous cliffs  according to mr couthouy page 26 the external reef round many atolls descends by a succession of ledges or terraces  he attempts i doubt whether successfully to explain this structure somewhat in the same manner as i have attempted with respect to the internal ledges round the lagoons of some atolls  more facts are wanted regarding the nature both of the interior and exterior steplike ledges are all the ledges or only the upper ones covered with living coral  if they are all covered are the kinds different on the ledges according to the depth  do the interior and exterior ledges occur together in the same atolls if so what is their total width and is the intervening surfacereef narrow etc  the ring or basinformed reefs of the northern maldiva atolls  i may first observe that the reefs within the lagoons of atolls and within lagoonchannels would if favourably circumstanced grow upwards during subsidence in the same manner as the annular rim and therefore we might expect that such lagoonreefs when not surrounded and buried by an accumulation of sediment more rapid than the rate of subsidence would rise abruptly from a greater depth than that at which the efficient polypifers can flourish we see this well exemplified in the small abruptlysided reefs with which the deep lagoons of the chagos and southern maldiva atolls are studded  with respect to the ring or basinformed reefs of the northern maldiva atolls it is evident from the perfectly continuous series which exists that the marginal rings although wider than the exterior or bounding reef of ordinary atolls are only modified portions of such a reef it is also evident that the central rings although wider than the knolls or reefs which commonly occur in lagoons occupy their place the ringlike structure has been shown to be contingent on the breaches into the lagoon being broad and numerous so that all the reefs which are bathed by the waters of the lagoon are placed under nearly the same conditions with the outer coast of an atoll standing in the open sea hence the exterior and living margins of these reefs must have been favourably circumstanced for growing outwards and increasing beyond the usual breadth and they must likewise have been favourably circumstanced for growing vigorously upwards during the subsiding movements to which by our theory the whole archipelago has been subjected and subsidence with this upward growth of the margins would convert the central space of each little reef into a small lagoon  this however could only take place with those reefs which had increased to a breadth sufficient to prevent their central spaces from being almost immediately filled up with the sand and detritus driven inwards from all sides hence it is that few reefs which are less than half a mile in diameter even in the atolls where the basinlike structure is most strikingly exhibited include lagoons  this remark i may add applies to all coralreefs wherever found  the basinformed reefs of the maldiva archipelago may in fact be briefly described as small atolls formed during subsidence over the separate portions of large and broken atolls in the same manner as these latter were formed over the barrierreefs which encircled the islands of a large archipelago now wholly submerged  submerged and dead reefs  in the second section of the first chapter i have shown that there are in the neighbourhood of atolls some deeply submerged banks with level surfaces that there are others less deeply but yet wholly submerged having all the characters of perfect atolls but consisting merely of dead coralrock that there are barrierreefs and atolls with merely a portion of their reef generally on the leeward side submerged and that such portions either retain their perfect outline or they appear to be quite effaced their former place being marked only by a bank conforming in outline with that part of the reef which remains perfect  these several cases are i believe intimately related together and can be explained by the same means  there perhaps exist some submerged reefs covered with living coral and growing upwards but to these i do not here refer  as we see that in those parts of the ocean where coralreefs are most abundant one island is fringed and another neighbouring one is not fringed as we see in the same archipelago that all the reefs are more perfect in one part of it than in another for instance in the southern half compared with the northern half of the maldiva archipelago and likewise on the outer coasts compared with the inner coasts of the atolls in this same group which are placed in a double row as we know that the existence of the innumerable polypifers forming a reef depends on their sustenance and that they are preyed on by other organic beings and lastly as we know that some inorganic causes are highly injurious to the growth of coral it cannot be expected that during the round of change to which earth air and water are exposed the reefbuilding polypifers should keep alive for perpetuity in any one place and still less can this be expected during the progressive subsidences perhaps at some periods more rapid than at others to which by our theory these reefs and islands have been subjected and are liable  it is then not improbable that the corals should sometimes perish either on the whole or on part of a reef if on part the dead portion after a small amount of subsidence would still retain its proper outline and position beneath the water  after a more prolonged subsidence it would probably form owing to the accumulation of sediment only the margin of a flat bank marking the limits of the former lagoon  such dead portions of reef would generally lie on the leeward side mr lyell in the first edition of his principles of geology offered a somewhat different explanation of this structure  he supposes that there has been subsidence but he was not aware that the submerged portions of reef were in most cases if not in all dead and he attributes the difference in height in the two sides of most atolls chiefly to the greater accumulation of detritus to windward than to leeward  but as matter is accumulated only on the backward part of the reef the front part would remain of the same height on both sides  i may here observe that in most cases for instance at peros banhos the gambier group and the great chagos bank and i suspect in all cases the dead and submerged portions do not blend or slope into the living and perfect parts but are separated from them by an abrupt line  in some instances small patches of living reef rise to the surface from the middle of the submerged and dead parts for the impure water and fine sediment would more easily flow out from the lagoon over this side of the reef where the force of the breakers is less than to windward and therefore the corals would be less vigorous on this side and be less able to resist any destroying agent  it is likewise owing to this same cause that reefs are more frequently breached to leeward by narrow channels serving as by shipchannels than to windward if the corals perished entirely or on the greater part of the circumference of an atoll an atollshaped bank of dead rock more or less entirely submerged would be produced and further subsidence together with the accumulation of sediment would often obliterate its atolllike structure and leave only a bank with a level surface  in the chagos group of atolls within an area of 160 miles by 60 there are two atollformed banks of dead rock besides another very imperfect one entirely submerged a third with merely two or three very small pieces of living reef rising to the surface and a fourth namely peros banhos plate i figure 9 with a portion nine miles in length dead and submerged  as by our theory this area has subsided and as there is nothing improbable in the death either from changes in the state of the surrounding sea or from the subsidence being great or sudden of the corals on the whole or on portions of some of the atolls the case of the chagos group presents no difficulty  so far indeed are any of the abovementioned cases of submerged reefs from being inexplicable that their occurrence might have been anticipated on our theory and as fresh atolls are supposed to be in progressive formation by the subsidence of encircling barrierreefs a weighty objection namely that the number of atolls must be increasing infinitely might even have been raised if proofs of the occasional destruction and loss of atolls could not have been adduced  the disseverment of the larger maldiva atolls  the apparent progressive disseverment in the maldiva archipelago of large atolls into smaller ones is in many respects an important consideration and requires an explanation  the graduated series which marks as i believe this process can be observed only in the northern half of the group where the atolls have exceedingly imperfect margins consisting of detached basinformed reefs  the currents of the sea flow across these atolls as i am informed by captain moresby with considerable force and drift the sediment from side to side during the monsoons transporting much of it seaward yet the currents sweep with greater force round their flanks  it is historically known that these atolls have long existed in their present state and we can believe that even during a very slow subsidence they might thus remain the central expanse being kept at nearly its original depth by the accumulation of sediment  but in the action of such nicely balanced forces during a progressive subsidence like that to which by our theory this archipelago has been subjected it would be strange if the currents of the sea should never make a direct passage across some one of the atolls through the many wide breaches in their margins  if this were once effected a deepwater channel would soon be formed by the removal of the finer sediment and the check to its further accumulation and the sides of the channel would be worn into a slope like that on the outer coasts which are exposed to the same force of the currents  in fact a channel precisely like that bifurcating one which divides mahlos mahdoo plate ii figure 4 would almost necessarily be formed  the scattered reefs situated near the borders of the new oceanchannel from being favourably placed for the growth of coral would by their extension tend to produce fresh margins to the dissevered portions such a tendency is very evident as may be seen in the large published chart in the elongated reefs on the borders of the two channels intersecting mahlos mahdoo  such channels would become deeper with continued subsidence and probably from the reefs not growing up perpendicularly somewhat broader  in this case and more especially if the channels had been formed originally of considerable breadth the dissevered portions would become perfect and distinct atolls like ari and ross atolls plate ii figure 6 or like the two nillandoo atolls which must be considered as distinct although related in form and position and separated from each other by channels which though deep have been sounded further subsidence would render such channels unfathomable and the dissevered portions would then resemble phaleedoo and moluque atolls or mahlos mahdoo and horsburgh atolls plate ii figure 4 which are related to each other in no respect except in proximity and position  hence on the theory of subsidence the disseverment of large atolls which have imperfect margins for otherwise their disseverment would be scarcely possible and which are exposed to strong currents is far from being an improbable event and the several stages from close relation to entire isolation in the atolls of the maldiva archipelago are readily explicable  we might go even further and assert as not improbable that the first formation of the maldiva archipelago was due to a barrierreef of nearly the same dimensions with that of new caledonia plate ii figure 5 for if in imagination we complete the subsidence of that great island we might anticipate from the present broken condition of the northern portion of the reef and from the almost entire absence of reefs on the eastern coast that the barrierreef after repeated subsidences would become during its upward growth separated into distinct portions and these portions would tend to assume an atolllike structure from the coral growing with vigour round their entire circumferences when freely exposed to an open sea  as we have some large islands partly submerged with barrierreefs marking their former limits such as new caledonia so our theory makes it probable that there should be other large islands wholly submerged and these we may now infer would be surmounted not by one enormous atoll but by several large elongated ones like the atolls in the maldiva group and these again during long periods of subsidence would sometimes become dissevered into smaller atolls  i may add that both in the marshall and caroline archipelagoes there are atolls standing close together which have an evident relationship in form we may suppose in such cases either that two or more encircled islands originally stood close together and afforded bases for two or more atolls or that one atoll has been dissevered  from the position as well as form of three atolls in the caroline archipelago the namourrek and elato group which are placed in an irregular circle i am strongly tempted to believe that they have originated by the process of disseverment  the same remark is perhaps applicable to the islands of ollap fanadik and tamatam in the caroline archipelago of which charts are given in the atlas of duperreys voyage a line drawn through the linear reefs and lagoons of these three islands forms a semicircle  consult also the atlas of lutkes voyage and for the marshall group that of kotzebue for the gilbert group consult the atlas of duperreys voyage  most of the points here referred to may however be seen in krusensterns general atlas of the pacific  irregularly formed atolls  in the marshall group musquillo atoll consists of two loops united in one point and menchikoff atoll is formed of three loops two of which as may be seen in figure 3 plate ii are connected by a mere ribbonshaped reef and the three together are sixty miles in length  in the gilbert group some of the atolls have narrow strips of reef like spurs projecting from them  there occur also in parts of the open sea a few linear and straight reefs standing by themselves and likewise some few reefs in the form of crescents with their extremities more or less curled inwards  now the upward growth of a barrierreef which fronted only one side of an island or one side of an elongated island with its extremities of which cases exist would produce after the complete subsidence of the land mere strips or crescent or hookformed reefs if the island thus partially fronted became divided during subsidence into two or more islands these islands would be united together by linear reefs and from the further growth of the coral along their shores together with subsidence reefs of various forms might ultimately be produced either atolls united together by linear reefs or atolls with spurs projecting from them  some however of the more simple forms above specified might as we have seen be equally well produced by the coral perishing during subsidence on part of the circumference of an atoll whilst on the other parts it continued to grow up till it reached the surface  the great chagos bank  i have already shown that the submerged condition of the great chagos bank plate ii figure 1 with its section figure 2 and of some other banks in the chagos group may in all probability be attributed to the coral having perished before or during the movements of subsidence to which this whole area by our theory has been subjected  the external rim or upper ledge shaded in the chart consists of dead coralrock thinly covered with sand it lies at an average depth of between five and eight fathoms and perfectly resembles in form the annular reef of an atoll  the banks of the second level the boundaries of which are marked by dotted lines in the chart lie from about fifteen to twenty fathoms beneath the surface they are several miles broad and terminate in a very steep slope round the central expanse  this central expanse i have already described as consisting of a level muddy flat between thirty and forty fathoms deep the banks of the second level might at first sight be thought analogous to the internal steplike ledge of coralrock which borders the lagoons of some atolls but their much greater width and their being formed of sand are points of essential difference  on the eastern side of the atoll some of the banks are linear and parallel resembling islets in a great river and pointed directly towards a great breach on the opposite side of the atoll these are best seen in the large published chart  i inferred from this circumstance that strong currents sometimes set directly across this vast bank and i have since heard from captain moresby that this is the case  i observed also that the channels or breaches through the rim were all of the same depth as the central lagoonlike space into which they lead whereas the channels into the other atolls of the chagos group and as i believe into most other large atolls are not nearly as deep as their lagoons for instance at peros banhos the channels are only of the same depth namely between ten and twenty fathoms as the bottom of the lagoon for a space about a mile and a half in width round its shores whilst the central expanse of the lagoon is from thirtyfive to forty fathoms deep now if an atoll during a gradual subsidence once became entirely submerged like the great chagos bank and therefore no longer exposed to the surf very little sediment could be formed from it and consequently the channels leading into the lagoon from not being filled up with drifted sand and coral detritus would continue increasing in depth as the whole sank down  in this case we might expect that the currents of the open sea instead of any longer sweeping round the submarine flanks would flow directly through the breaches across the lagoon removing in their course the finer sediment and preventing its further accumulation  we should then have the submerged reef forming an external and upper rim of rock and beneath this portion of the sandy bottom of the old lagoon intersected by deepwater channels or breaches and thus formed into separate marginal banks and these would be cut off by steep slopes overhanging the central space worn down by the passage of the oceanic currents  by these means i have scarcely any doubt that the great chagos bank has originateda structure which at first appeared to me far more anomalous than any i had met with  the process of formation is nearly the same with that by which mahlos mahdoo had been trisected but in the chagos bank the channels of the oceanic currents entering at several different quarters have united in a central space  this great atollformed bank appears to be in an early stage of disseverment should the work of subsidence go on from the submerged and dead condition of the whole reef and the imperfection of the southeast quarter a mere wreck would probably be left  the pitts bank situated not far southward appears to be precisely in this state it consists of a moderately level oblong bank of sand lying from 10 to 20 fathoms beneath the surface with two sides protected by a narrow ledge of rock which is submerged between 5 and 8 fathoms  a little further south at about the same distance as the southern rim of the great chagos bank is from the northern rim there are two other small banks with from 10 to 20 fathoms on them and not far eastward soundings were struck on a sandy bottom with between 110 and 145 fathoms  the northern portion with its ledgelike margin closely resembles any one segment of the great chagos bank between two of the deepwater channels and the scattered banks southward appear to be the last wrecks of less perfect portions  i have examined with care the charts of the indian and pacific oceans and have now brought before the reader all the examples which i have met with of reefs differing from the type of the class to which they belong and i think it has been satisfactorily shown that they are all included in our theory modified by occasional accidents which might have been anticipated as probable  in this course we have seen that in the lapse of ages encircling barrierreefs are occasionally converted into atolls the name of atoll being properly applicable at the moment when the last pinnacle of encircled land sinks beneath the surface of the sea  we have also seen that large atolls during the progressive subsidence of the areas in which they stand sometimes become dissevered into smaller ones at other times the reefbuilding polypifers having entirely perished atolls are converted into atollformed banks of dead rock and these again through further subsidence and the accumulation of sediment modified by the force of the oceanic currents pass into level banks with scarcely any distinguishing character  thus may the history of an atoll be followed from its first origin through the occasional accidents of its existence to its destruction and final obliteration  objections to the theory of the formation of atolls and barrierreefs  the vast amount of subsidence both horizontally or in area and vertically or in depth necessary to have submerged every mountain even the highest throughout the immense spaces of ocean interspersed with atolls will probably strike most people as a formidable objection to my theory  but as continents as large as the spaces supposed to have subsided have been raised above the level of the seaas whole regions are now rising for instance in scandinavia and south americaand as no reason can be assigned why subsidences should not have occurred in some parts of the earths crust on as great a scale both in extent and amount as those of elevation objections of this nature strike me as of little force  the remarkable point is that movements to such an extent should have taken place within a period during which the polypifers have continued adding matter on and above the same reefs  another and less obvious objection to the theory will perhaps be advanced from the circumstance of the lagoons within atolls and within barrierreefs never having become in any one instance during prolonged subsidences of a greater depth than sixty fathoms and seldom more than forty fathoms but we already admit if the theory be worth considering that the rate of subsidence has not exceeded that of the upward growth of the coral on the exterior margin we are therefore only further required to admit that the subsidence has not exceeded in rate the filling up of the interior spaces by the growth of the corals living there and by the accumulation of sediment  as this filling up must take place very slowly within barrierreefs lying far from the land and within atolls which are of large dimensions and which have open lagoons with very few reefs we are led to conclude that the subsidence thus counterbalanced must have been slow in an extraordinary degree a conclusion which accords with our only means namely with what is known of the rate and manner of recent elevatory movements of judging by analogy what is the probable rate of subsidence  in this chapter it has i think been shown that the theory of subsidence which we were compelled to receive from the necessity of giving to the corals in certain large areas foundations at the requisite depth explains both the normal structure and the less regular forms of those two great classes of reefs which have justly excited the astonishment of all persons who have sailed through the pacific and indian oceans  but further to test the truth of the theory a crowd of questions will occur to the reader do the different kinds of reefs which have been produced by the same kind of movement generally lie within the same areas  what is their relation of form and positionfor instance do adjoining groups of atolls and the separate atolls in these groups bear the same relation to each other which islands do in common archipelagoes  have we reason to believe that where there are fringingreefs there has not lately been subsidence or for it is almost our only way of ascertaining this point are there frequently proofs of recent elevation  can we by this means account for the presence of certain classes of reefs in some large areas and their entire absence in others  do the areas which have subsided as indicated by the presence of atolls and barrierreefs and the areas which have remained stationary or have been upraised as shown by fringingreefs bear any determinate relation to each other and are the dimensions of these areas such as harmonise with the greatness of the subterranean changes which it must be supposed have lately taken place beneath them is there any connection between the movements thus indicated and recent volcanic action  all these questions ought to receive answers in accordance with the theory and if this can be satisfactorily shown not only is the theory confirmed but as deductions the answers are in themselves important  under this latter point of view these questions will be chiefly considered in the following chapter  i may take this opportunity of briefly considering the appearances which would probably be presented by a vertical and deep section across a coral formation referring chiefly to an atoll formed by the upward growth of coral during successive subsidences  this is a subject worthy of attention as a means of comparison with ancient coralstrata  the circumferential parts would consist of massive species in a vertical position with their interstices filled up with detritus but this would be the part most subject to subsequent denudation and removal  it is useless to speculate how large a portion of the exterior annular reef would consist of upright coral and how much of fragmentary rock for this would depend on many contingenciessuch as on the rate of subsidence occasionally allowing a fresh growth of coral to cover the whole surface and on the breakers having force sufficient to throw fragments over this same space the conglomerate which composes the base of the islets would if not removed by denudation together with the exterior reef on which it rests be conspicuous from the size of the fragmentsthe different degrees in which they have been roundedthe presence of fragments of conglomerate torn up rounded and recementedand from the oblique stratification  the corals which lived in the lagoonreefs at each successive level would be preserved upright and they would consist of many kinds generally much branched  in this part however a very large proportion of the rock and in some cases nearly all of it would be formed of sedimentary matter either in an excessively fine or in a moderately coarse state and with the particles almost blended together  the conglomerate which was formed of rounded pieces of the branched corals on the shores of the lagoon would differ from that formed on the islets and derived from the outer coast yet both might have accumulated very near each other  i have seen a conglomerate limestone from devonshire like a conglomerate now forming on the shores of the maldiva atolls  the stratification taken as a whole would be horizontal but the conglomerate beds resting on the exterior reef and the beds of sandstone on the shores of the lagoon and no doubt on the external flanks would probably be divided as at keeling atoll and at mauritius by numerous layers dipping at considerable angles in different directions  the calcareous sandstone and coralrock would almost necessarily contain innumerable shells echini and the bones of fish turtle and perhaps of birds possibly also the bones of small saurians as these animals find their way to the islands far remote from any continent  the large shells of some species of tridacna would be found vertically imbedded in the solid rock in the position in which they lived we might expect also to find a mixture of the remains of pelagic and littoral animals in the strata formed in the lagoon for pumice and the seeds of plants are floated from distant countries into the lagoons of many atolls on the outer coast of keeling atoll near the mouth of the lagoon the case of a pelagic pteropodous animal was brought up on the arming of the sounding lead  all the loose blocks of coral on keeling atoll were burrowed by vermiform animals and as every cavity no doubt ultimately becomes filled with spathose limestone slabs of the rock taken from a considerable depth would if polished probably exhibit the excavations of such burrowing animals  the conglomerate and finegrained beds of coralrock would be hard sonorous white and composed of nearly pure calcareous matter in some few parts judging from the specimens at keeling atoll they would probably contain a small quantity of iron  floating pumice and scoriae and occasionally stones transported in the root of trees see my journal of researches page 549 appear the only sources through which foreign matter is brought to coralformations standing in the open ocean the area over which sediment is transported from coralreefs must be considerable captain moresby informs me that during the change of monsoons the sea is discoloured to a considerable distance off the maldiva and chagos atolls  the sediment of fringing and barrier coralreefs must be mingled with the mud which is brought down from the land and is transported seaward through the breaches which occur in front of almost every valley  if the atolls of the larger archipelagoes were upraised the bed of the ocean being converted into land they would form flattopped mountains varying in diameter from a few miles the smallest atolls being worn away to sixty miles and from being horizontally stratified and of similar composition they would as mr lyell has remarked falsely appear as if they had originally been united into one vast continuous mass  such great strata of coralrock would rarely be associated with erupted volcanic matter for this could only take place as may be inferred from what follows in the next chapter when the area in which they were situated commenced to rise or at least ceased to subside  during the enormous period necessary to effect an elevation of the kind just alluded to the surface would necessarily be denuded to a great thickness hence it is highly improbable that any fringingreef or even any barrierreef at least of those encircling small islands would be preserved  from this same cause the strata which were formed within the lagoons of atolls and lagoonchannels of barrierreefs and which must consist in a large part of sedimentary matter would more often be preserved to future ages than the exterior solid reef composed of massive corals in an upright position although it is on this exterior part that the present existence and further growth of atolls and barrierreefs entirely depend   chapter vion the distribution of

larger chart would have been desirable but small as the adjoined one is it is the result of many months labour  i have consulted as far as i was able every original voyage and map and the colours were first laid down on charts on a larger scale  the same blue colour with merely a difference in the depth of tint is used for atolls or lagoonislands and barrierreefs for we have seen that as far as the actual coralformation is concerned they have no distinguishing character fringingreefs have been coloured red for between them on the one hand and barrierreefs and atolls on the other there is an important distinction with respect to the depth beneath the surface at which we are compelled to believe their foundations lie  the two distinct colours therefore mark two great types of structure  the dark blue colour represented by 3 in our plate represents atolls and submerged annular reefs with deep water in their centres  i have coloured as atolls a few low and small coralislands without lagoons but this has been done only when it clearly appeared that they originally contained lagoons since filled up with sediment when there were not good grounds for this belief they have been left uncoloured  the pale blue colour represented by 2 represents barrierreefs  the most obvious character of reefs of this class is the broad and deepwater moat within the reef but this like the lagoons of small atolls is liable to become filled up with detritus and with reefs of delicately branched corals when therefore a reef round the entire circumference of an island extends very far into a profoundly deep sea so that it can hardly be confounded with a fringingreef which must rest on a foundation of rock within a small depth it has been coloured pale blue although it does not include a deepwater moat but this has only been done rarely and each case is distinctly mentioned in the appendix  the red colour 4 represents reefs fringing the land quite closely where the sea is deep and where the bottom is gently inclined extending to a moderate distance from it but not having a deepwater moat or lagoonlike space parallel to the shore  it must be remembered that fringingreefs are frequently breached in front of rivers and valleys by deepish channels where mud has been deposited  a space of thirty miles in width has been coloured round or in front of the reefs of each class in order that the colours might be conspicuous on the appended map which is reduced to so small a scale  the vermillion spots and streaks 1 represent volcanoes now in action or historically known to have

fernandez according to observations collected during the voyage of the beagle geological transactions volume v page 601  i have added a volcano to albemarle island one of the galapagos archipelago the authors journal of researches page 457 in the sandwich group there are no active volcanoes except at hawaii but the rev w ellis informs me there are streams of lava apparently modern on maui having a

nor are there any known in the samoa or navigator group although some of the streams of lava and craters there appear recent  in the friendly group the rev j williams says narrative of missionary enterprise page 29 that toofoa and proby islands are active volcanoes i infer from hamiltons voyage in the pandora page 95 that proby island is synonymous with onouafou but i have not ventured to colour it there can be no doubt respecting toofoa and captain edwards von buch page 386 found the lava of recent eruption at amargura still smoking berghaus marks four active volcanoes actually within

temperature of the water in the crater may be ranked as active berghaus vorbemerk ii lief s 56  malte brun volume xii page 231 says that there is a volcano near port st vincent in new caledonia  i believe this to be an error arising from a smoke seen on the opposite coast by cook second voyage volume ii page 23 which smoke went out at night  the mariana islands especially the northern ones contain many craters see freycinets hydrog descript which are not active  von buch however states page 462 on the authority of la peyrouse that there are no less than seven volcanoes between these islands and japan  gemelli creri churchills collect volume iv page 458 says there are two active volcanoes in latitude 23 deg 30 and in latitude 24 deg but i have not coloured them  from the

in a letter that when he was at joanna he saw at night flames apparently volcanic issuing from the chief comoro island and that the arabs assured him that they were volcanic adding that the volcano burned more during the wet season  i have marked this as a volcano though with some hesitation on account of the possibility of the flame arising from gaseous sources  the uncoloured coasts consist first and chiefly of those where there are no coralreefs or such small portions as to be quite insignificant secondly of those coasts where there are reefs but where the sea is very shallow for in this case the reefs generally lie far from the land and become very irregular in their forms where they have not become irregular they have been coloured  thirdly if i had the means of ascertaining the fact i should not colour a reef merely coating the edges of a submarine crater or of a level submerged bank for such superficial formations differ essentially even when not in external appearance from reefs whose foundations as well as superficies have been wholly formed by the growth of coral  fourthly in the red sea and within some parts of the east indian archipelago if the imperfect charts of the latter can be trusted there are many scattered reefs of small size represented in the chart by mere dots which rise out of deep water these cannot be arranged under either of the three classes in the red sea however some of these little reefs from their position seem once to have formed parts of a continuous barrier  there exist also scattered in the open ocean some linear and irregularly formed strips of coralreef which as shown in the last chapter are probably allied in their origin to atolls but as they do not belong to that class they have not been coloured they are very few in number and of insignificant dimensions  lastly some reefs are left uncoloured from the want of information respecting them and some because they are of an intermediate structure between the barrier and fringing classes  the value of the map is lessened in proportion to the number of reefs which i have been obliged to leave uncoloured although in a theoretical point of view few of them present any great difficulty but their number is not very great as will be found by comparing the map with the statements in the appendix  i have experienced more difficulty in colouring fringingreefs than in colouring barrierreefs as the former from their much less dimensions have less attracted the attention of navigators  as i have had to seek my information from all kinds of sources and often from indirect ones i do not venture to hope that the map is free from many errors  nevertheless i trust it will give an approximately correct view of the general distribution of the coralreefs over the whole world with the exception of some fringingreefs on the coast of brazil not included within the limits of the map and of their arrangement into the three great classes which though necessarily very imperfect from the nature of the objects classified have been adopted by most voyagers  i may further remark that the dark blue colour represents land entirely composed of coralrock the pale blue land with a wide and thick border of coralrock and the red a mere narrow fringe of coralrock  looking now at the map under the theoretical point of view indicated in the last chapter the two blue tints signify that the foundations of the reefs thus coloured have subsided to a considerable amount at a slower rate than that of the upward growth of the corals and that probably in many cases they are still subsiding  the red signifies that the shores which support fringingreefs have not subsided at least to any considerable amount for the effects of a subsidence on a small scale would in no case be distinguishable but that they have remained nearly stationary since the period when they first became fringed by reefs or that they are now rising or have been upraised with new lines of reefs successively formed on them these latter alternatives are obviously implied as newly formed lines of shore after elevations of the land would be in the same state with respect to the growth of fringingreefs as stationary coasts  if during the prolonged subsidence of a shore coralreefs grew for the first time on it or if an old barrierreef were destroyed and submerged and new reefs became attached to the land these would necessarily at first belong to the fringing class and therefore be coloured red although the coast was sinking but i have no reason to believe that from this source of error any coast has been coloured wrongly with respect to movement indicated well characterised atolls and encircling barrierreefs where several occur in a group or a single barrierreef if of large dimensions leave scarcely any doubt on the mind respecting the movement by which they have been produced and even a small amount of subsequent elevation is soon betrayed the evidence from a single atoll or a single encircling barrierreef must be received with some caution for the former may possibly be based upon a submerged crater or bank and the latter on a submerged margin of sediment or of worndown rock  from these remarks we may with greater certainty infer that the spaces especially the larger ones tinted blue in the map have subsided than that the red spaces have remained stationary or have been upraised  on the grouping of the different classes of reefs  having made these preliminary remarks i will consider first how far the grouping of the different kinds of coralislands and reefs is corroborative of the truth of the theory  a glance at the map shows that the reefs coloured blue and red produced under widely different conditions are not indiscriminately mixed together  atolls and barrierreefs on the other hand as may be seen by the two blue tints generally lie near each other and this would be the natural result of both having been produced during the subsidence of the areas in which they stand  thus the largest group of encircled islands is that of the society archipelago and these islands are surrounded by atolls and only separated by a narrow space from the large group of low atolls  in the midst of the caroline atolls there are three fine encircled islands  the northern point of the barrierreef of new caledonia seems itself as before remarked to form a complete large atoll  the great australian barrier is described as including both atolls and small encircled islands  captain king sailing directions appended to volume ii of his surveying voyage to australia mentions many atollformed and encircling coralreefs some of which lie within the barrier and others may be said for instance between latitude 16 deg and 13 deg to form part of it  flinders voyage to terra australis volume ii page 336 has described an atollformed reef in latitude 10 deg seven miles long and from one to three broad resembling a boot in shape with apparently very deep water within  eight miles westward of this and forming part of the barrier lie the murray islands which are high and are encircled  in the corallian sea between the two great barriers of australia and new caledonia there are many low islets and coralreefs some of which are annular or horseshoe shaped  observing the smallness of the scale of the map the parallels of latitude being nine hundred miles apart we see that none of the large groups of reefs and islands supposed to have been produced by longcontinued subsidence lie near extensive lines of coast coloured red which are supposed to have remained stationary since the growth of their reefs or to have been upraised and new lines of reefs formed on them  where the red and blue circles do occur near each other i am able in several instances to show that there have been oscillations of level subsidence having preceded the elevation of the red spots and elevation having preceded the subsidence of the blue spots and in this case the juxtaposition of reefs belonging to the two great types of structure is little surprising  we may therefore conclude that the proximity in the same areas of the two classes of reefs which owe their origin to the subsidence of the earths crust and their separation from those formed during its stationary or uprising condition holds good to the full extent which might have been anticipated by our theory  as groups of atolls have originated in the upward growth at each fresh sinking of the land of those reefs which primarily fringed the shores of one great island or of several smaller ones so we might expect that these rings of coralrock like so many rude outline charts will still retain some traces of the general form or at least general range of the land round which they were first modelled  that this is the case with the atolls in the southern pacific as far as their range is concerned seems highly probable when we observe that the three principal groups are directed in northwest and southeast lines and that nearly all the land in the s pacific ranges in this same direction namely n western australia new caledonia the northern half of new zealand the new hebrides saloman navigator society marquesas and austral archipelagoes in the northern pacific the caroline atolls abut against the northwest line of the marshall atolls much in the same manner as the east and west line of islands from ceram to new britain do on new ireland in the indian ocean the laccadive and maldiva atolls extend nearly parallel to the western and mountainous coast of india  in most respects there is a perfect resemblance with ordinary islands in the grouping of atolls and in their form thus the outline of all the larger groups is elongated and the greater number of the individual atolls are elongated in the same direction with the group in which they stand  the chagos group is less elongated than is usual with other groups and the individual atolls in it are likewise but little elongated this is strikingly seen by comparing them with the neighbouring maldiva atolls  in the marshall and maldiva archipelagoes the atolls are ranged in two parallel lines like the mountains in a great double mountainchain  some of the atolls in the larger archipelagoes stand so near to each other and have such an evident relationship in form that they compose little subgroups in the caroline archipelago one such subgroup consists of pouynipete a lofty island encircled by a barrierreef and separated by a channel only four miles and a half wide from andeema atoll with a second atoll a little further off in all these respects an examination of a series of charts will show how perfectly groups of atolls resemble groups of common islands  on the direct evidence of the blue spaces in the map having subsided during the upward growth of the reefs so coloured and of the red spaces having remained stationary or having been upraised  with respect to subsidence i have shown in the last chapter that we cannot expect to obtain in countries inhabited only by semicivilised races demonstrative proofs of a movement which invariably tends to conceal its own evidence  but on the coralislands supposed to have been produced by subsidence we have proofs of changes in their external appearanceof a round of decay and renovationof the last vestiges of land on someof its first commencement on others we hear of storms desolating them to the astonishment of their inhabitants we know by the great fissures with which some of them are traversed and by the earthquakes felt under others that subterranean disturbances of some kind are in progress  these facts if not directly connected with subsidence as i believe they are at least show how difficult it would be to discover proofs of such movement by ordinary means  at keeling atoll however i have described some appearances which seem directly to show that subsidence did take place there during the late earthquakes  vanikoro according to chevalier dillon see captain dillons voyage in search of la peyrouse  m cordier in his report on the voyage of the astrolabe page cxi volume i speaking of vanikoro says the shores are surrounded by reefs of madrepore quon assure etre de formation toutafait moderne  i have in vain endeavoured to learn some further particulars about this remarkable passage  i may here add that according to our theory the island of pouynipete plate i figure 7 in the caroline archipelago being encircled by a barrierreef must have subsided  in the new s wales lit advert february 1835 which i have seen through the favour of dr lloghtsky there is an account of this island subsequently confirmed by mr campbell in which it is said at the ne end at a place called tamen there are ruins of a town now only accessible by boats the waves reaching to the steps of the houses judging from this passage one would be tempted to conclude that the island must have subsided since these houses were built  i may also here append a statement in malte brun volume ix page 775 given without any authority that the sea gains in an extraordinary manner on the coast of cochin china which lies in front and near the subsiding coralreefs in the china sea as the coast is granitic and not alluvial it is scarcely possible that the encroachment of the sea can be owing to the washing away of the land and if so it must be due to subsidence is often violently shaken by earthquakes and there the unusual depth of the channel between the shore and the reefthe almost entire absence of islets on the reef its walllike structure on the inner side and the small quantity of low alluvial land at the foot of the mountains all seem to show that this island has not remained long at its present level with the lagoonchannel subjected to the accumulation of sediment and the reef to the wear and tear of the breakers  at the society archipelago on the other hand where a slight tremor is only rarely felt the shoaliness of the lagoonchannels round some of the islands the number of islets formed on the reefs of others and the broad belt of low land at the foot of the mountains indicate that although there must have been great subsidence to have produced the barrierreefs there has since elapsed a long stationary period  mr couthouy states remarks page 44 that at tahiti and eimeo the space between the reef and the shore has been nearly filled up by the extension of those coralreefs which within most barrierreefs merely fringe the land  from this circumstance he arrives at the same conclusion as i have done that the society islands since their subsidence have remained stationary during a long period but he further believes that they have recently commenced rising as well as the whole area of the low archipelago  he does not give any detailed proofs regarding the elevation of the society islands but i shall refer to this subject in another part of this chapter  before making some further comments i may observe how satisfactory it is to me to find mr couthouy affirming that having personally examined a large number of coralislands and also residing eight months among the volcanic class having shore and partially encircling reefs i may be permitted to state that my own observations have impressed a conviction of the correctness of the theory of mr darwin  this gentleman believes that subsequently to the subsidence by which the atolls in the low archipelago were produced the whole area has been elevated to the amount of a few feet this would indeed be a remarkable fact but as far as i am able to judge the grounds of his conclusion are not sufficiently strong  he states that he found in almost every atoll which he visited the shores of the lagoon raised from eighteen to thirty inches above the sealevel and containing imbedded tridacnae and corals standing as they grew some of the corals were dead in their upper parts but below a certain line they continued to flourish  in the lagoons also he frequently met with clusters of madrepore with their extremities standing from one inch to a foot above the surface of the water  now these appearances are exactly what i should have expected without any subsequent elevation having taken place and i think mr couthouy has not borne in mind the indisputable fact that corals when constantly bathed by the surf can exist at a higher level than in quite tranquil water as in a lagoon  as long therefore as the waves continued at low water to break entirely over parts of the annular reef of an atoll submerged to a small depth the corals and shells attached on these parts might continue living at a level above the smooth surface of the lagoon into which the waves rolled but as soon as the outer edge of the reef grew up to its utmost possible height or if the reef were very broad nearly to that height the force of the breakers would be checked and the corals and shells on the inner parts near the lagoon would occasionally be left dry and thus be partially or wholly destroyed  even in atolls which have not lately subsided if the outer margin of the reef continued to increase in breadth seaward each fresh zone of corals rising to the same vertical height as at keeling atoll the line where the waves broke most heavily would advance outwards and therefore the corals which when living near the margin were washed by the breaking waves during the whole of each tide would cease being so and would therefore be left on the backward part of the reef standing exposed and dead  the case of the madrepores in the lagoons with the tops of their branches exposed seems to be an analogous fact to the great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon of keeling atoll a condition of things which i have endeavoured to show has resulted from the lagoon having become more and more enclosed and choked up with reefs so that during high winds the rising of the tide as observed by the inhabitants is checked and the corals which had formerly grown to the greatest possible height are occasionally exposed and thus are killed and this is a condition of things towards which almost every atoll in the intervals of its subsidence must be tending  or if we look to the state of an atoll directly after a subsidence of some fathoms the waves would roll heavily over the entire circumference of the reef and the surface of the lagoon would like the ocean never be quite at rest and therefore the corals in the lagoon from being constantly laved by the rippling water might extend their branches to a little greater height than they could when the lagoon became enclosed and protected  christmas atoll 2 deg n latitude which has a very shallow lagoon and differs in several respects from most atolls possibly may have been elevated recently but its highest part appears couthouy page 46 to be only ten feet above the sealevel the facts of a second class adduced by mr couthouy in support of the alleged recent elevation of the low archipelago are not all especially those referring to a shelf of rock quite intelligible to me he believes that certain enormous fragments of rock on the reef must have been moved into their present position when the reef was at a lower level but here again the force of the breakers on any inner point of the reef being diminished by its outward growth without any change in its level has not i think been borne in mind  we should also not overlook the occasional agency of waves caused by earthquakes and hurricanes  mr couthouy further argues that since these great fragments were deposited and fixed on the reef they have been elevated he infers this from the greatest amount of erosion not being near their bases where they are unceasingly washed by the reflux of the tides but at some height on their sides near the line of highwater mark as shown in an accompanying diagram  my former remark again applies here with this further observation that as the waves have to roll over a wide space of reef before they reach the fragments their force must be greatly increased with the increasing depth of water as the tide rises and therefore i should have expected that the chief line of present erosion would have coincided with the line of highwater mark and if the reef had grown outwards that there would have been lines of erosion at greater heights  the conclusion to which i am finally led by the interesting observations of mr couthouy is that the atolls in the low archipelago have like the society islands remained at a stationary level for a long period and this probably is the ordinary course of events subsidence supervening after long intervals of rest  turning now to the red colour as on our map the areas which have sunk slowly downwards to great depths are many and large we might naturally have been led to conjecture that with such great changes of level in progress the coasts which have been fringed probably for ages for we have no reason to believe that coralreefs are of short duration would not have remained all this time stationary but would frequently have undergone movements of elevation  this supposition we shall immediately see holds good to a remarkable extent and although a stationary condition of the land can hardly ever be open to proof from the evidence being only negative we are in some degree enabled to ascertain the correctness of the parts coloured red on the map by the direct testimony of upraised organic remains of a modern date  before going into the details on this head printed in small type i may mention that when reading a memoir on coral formations by mm quoy and gaimard annales des sciences nat tom vi page 279 etc i was astonished to find for i knew that they had crossed both the pacific and indian oceans that their descriptions were applicable only to reefs of the fringing class but my astonishment ended satisfactorily when i discovered that by a strange chance all the islands which these eminent naturalists had visited though several in number namely the mauritius timor new guinea the mariana and sandwich archipelagoes could be shown by their own statements to have been elevated within a recent geological era  in the eastern half of the pacific the sandwich islands are all fringed and almost every naturalist who has visited them has remarked on the abundance of elevated corals and shells apparently identical with living species  the rev w ellis informs me that he has noticed round several parts of hawaii beds of coraldetritus about twenty feet above the level of the sea and where the coast is low they extend far inland  upraised coralrock forms a considerable part of the borders of oahu and at elizabeth island zoology of captain beecheys voyage page 176  see also mm quoy and gaimard in annales de scien nat tom vi it composes three strata each about ten feet thick  nihau which forms the northern as hawaii does the southern end of the group 350 miles in length likewise seems to consist of coral and volcanic rocks  mr couthouy remarks on coral formations page 51 has lately described with interesting details several upraised beaches ancient reefs with their surfaces perfectly preserved and beds of recent shells and corals at the islands of maui morokai oahu and tauai or kauai in this group  mr pierce an intelligent resident at oahu is convinced from changes which have taken place within his memory during the last sixteen years that the elevation is at present going forward at a very perceptible rate  the natives at kauai state that the land is there gaining rapidly on the sea and mr couthouy has no doubt from the nature of the strata that this has been effected by an elevation of the land  in the southern part of the low archipelago elizabeth island is described by captain beechey beecheys voyage in the pacific page 46 4to edition as being quite flat and about eighty feet in height it is entirely composed of dead corals forming a honeycombed but compact rock in cases like this of an island having exactly the appearance which the elevation of any one of the smaller surrounding atolls with a shallow lagoon would present one is led to conclude with little better reason however than the improbability of such small and low fabrics lasting for an immense period exposed to the many destroying agents of nature that the elevation has taken place at an epoch not geologically remote  when merely the surface of an island of ordinary formation is strewed with marine bodies and that continuously or nearly so from the beach to a certain height and not above that height it is exceedingly improbable that such organic remains although they may not have been specially examined should belong to any ancient period  it is necessary to bear these remarks in mind in considering the evidence of the elevatory movements in the pacific and indian oceans as it does not often rest on specific determinations and therefore should be received with caution six of the cook and austral islands sw of the society group are fringed of these five were described to me by the rev j williams as formed of coralrock associated with some basalt in mangaia and the sixth as lofty and basaltic  mangaia is nearly three hundred feet high with a level summit and according to mr s wilson couthouys remarks page 34 it is an upraised reef and there are in the central hollow formerly the bed of the lagoon many scattered patches of coralrock some of them raised to a height of forty feet  these knolls of coralrock were evidently once separate reefs in the lagoon of an atoll  mr martens at sydney informed me that this island is surrounded by a terracelike plain at about the height of a hundred feet which probably marks a pause in its elevation  from these facts we may infer perhaps that the cook and austral islands have been upheaved at a period probably not very remote  savage island se of the friendly group is about forty feet in height forster observations made during voyage round the world page 147 describes the plants as already growing out of the dead but still upright and spreading trees of coral and the younger forster voyage volume ii page 163 believes that an ancient lagoon is now represented by a central plain here we cannot doubt that the elevatory forces have recently acted  the same conclusion may be extended though with somewhat less certainty to the islands of the friendly group which have been well described in the second and third voyages of cook  the surface of tongatabou is low and level but with some parts a hundred feet high the whole consists of coralrock which yet shows the cavities and irregularities worn into it by the action of the tides  cooks third voyage 4to edition volume i page 314  on eoua the same appearances were noticed at an elevation of between two hundred and three hundred feet vavao also at the opposite or northern end of the group consists according to the rev j williams of coralrock  tongatabou with its northern extensive reefs resembles either an upraised atoll with one half originally imperfect or one unequally elevated and anamouka an atoll equally elevated  this latter island contains ibid volume i page 235 in its centre a saltwater lake about a mileandahalf in diameter without any communication with the sea and around it the land rises gradually like a bank the highest part is only between twenty and thirty feet but on this part as well as on the rest of the land which as cook observes rises above the height of true lagoonislands coralrock like that on the beach was found  in the navigator archipelago mr couthouy remarks on coralformations page 50 found on manua many and very large fragments of coral at the height of eighty feet on a steep hillside rising half a mile inland from a low sandy plain abounding in marine remains  the fragments were embedded in a mixture of decomposed lava and sand  it is not stated whether they were accompanied by shells or whether the corals resembled recent species as these remains were embedded they possibly may belong to a remote epoch but i presume this was not the opinion of mr couthouy  earthquakes are very frequent in this archipelago  still proceeding westward we come to the new hebrides on these islands mr g bennett author of wanderings in new south wales informs me he found much coral at a great altitude which he considered of recent origin respecting santa cruz and the solomon archipelago i have no information but at new ireland which forms the northern point of

cannot be a higher authority on the geology of india informs me that he suspects that these beds may have been formed by the mere action of the waves and currents accumulating sediment  from analogy i should much incline to dr benzas opinion  mauritius has certainly been upraised within the recent period as i have stated in the chapter on fringingreefs  the northern extremity of madagascar is described by captain owen owens africa volume ii page 37 for madagascar and for s africa volume i pages 412 and 426 lieutenant botelers narrative contains fuller particulars regarding the coralrock volume i page 174 and volume ii pages 41 and 54  see also ruschenbergers voyage round the world volume i page 60 as formed of madreporitic rock as likewise are the shores and outlying islands along an immense space of eastern africa from a little north of the equator for nine hundred miles southward  nothing can be more vague than the expression madreporitic rock but at the same time it is i think scarcely possible to look at the chart of the linear islets which rise to a greater height than can be accounted for by the growth of coral in front of the coast from the equator to 2 deg s without feeling convinced that a line of fringingreefs has been elevated at a period so recent that no great changes have since taken place on the surface of this part of the globe  some also of the higher islands of madreporitic rock on this coast for instance pemba have very singular forms which seem to show the combined effect of the growth of coral round submerged banks and their subsequent upheaval  dr allan informs me that he never observed any elevated organic remains on the seychelles which come under our fringed class  the nature of the formations round the shores of the red sea as described by several authors shows that the whole of this large area has been elevated within a very recent tertiary epoch  a part of this space in the appended map is coloured blue indicating the presence of barrierreefs on which circumstance i shall presently make some remarks  ruppell ruppell reise in abyssinien band i s 141 states that the tertiary formation of which he has examined the organic remains forms a fringe along the shores with a uniform height of from thirty and forty feet from the mouth of the gulf of suez to about latitude 26 deg but that south of 26 deg the beds attain only the height of from twelve to fifteen feet this however can hardly be quite accurate although possibly there may be a decrease in the elevation of the shores in the middle parts of the red sea for dr malcolmson as he informs me collected from the cliffs of camaran island latitude 15 deg 30 s shells and corals apparently recent at a height between thirty and forty feet and mr salt travels in abyssinia describes a similar formation a little southward on the opposite shore at amphila  moreover near the mouth of the gulf of suez although on the coast opposite to that on which dr ruppell says that the modern beds attain a height of only thirty to forty feet mr burton lyells principles of geology 5th edition volume iv page 25 found a deposit replete with existing species of shells at the height of 200 feet  in an admirable series of drawings by captain moresby i could see how continuously the cliffbounded low plains of this formation extended with a nearly equable height both on the eastern and western shores  the southern coast of arabia seems to have been subjected to the same elevatory movement for dr malcolmson found at sahar low cliffs containing shells and corals apparently of recent species  the persian gulf abounds with coralreefs but as it is difficult to distinguish them from sandbanks in this shallow sea i have coloured only some near the mouth towards the head of the gulf mr ainsworth ainsworths assyria and babylon page 217 says that the land is worn into terraces and that the beds contain organic remains of existing forms the west indian archipelago of fringed islands alone remains to be mentioned evidence of an elevation within a late tertiary epoch of nearly the whole of this great area may be found in the works of almost all the naturalists who have visited it  i will give some of the principal references in a note  on florida and the north shores of the gulf of mexico rogers report to brit assoc volume iii page 14on the shores of mexico humboldt polit essay

page 142cuba taylor in lond and edin mag volume xi page 17  dr daubeny also at a meeting of the geolog soc orally described some very modern beds lying on the nw parts of cuba  i might have added many other less important references  it is very remarkable on reviewing these details to observe in how many instances fringingreefs round the shores have coincided with the existence on the land of upraised organic remains which seem from evidence more or less satisfactory to belong to a late tertiary period it may however be objected that similar proofs of elevation perhaps occur on the coasts coloured blue in our map but this certainly is not the case with the few following and doubtful exceptions  the entire area of the red sea appears to have been upraised within a modern period nevertheless i have been compelled though on unsatisfactory evidence as given in the appendix to class the reefs in the middle part as barrierreefs should however the statements prove accurate to the less height of the tertiary bed in this middle part compared with the northern and southern districts we might well suspect that it had subsided subsequently to the general elevation by which the whole area has been upraised  several authors ellis in his polynesian researches was the first to call attention to these remains volume i page 38 and the tradition of the natives concerning them  see also williams nar of missionary enterprise page 21 also tyerman and g bennett journal of voyage volume i page 213 also mr couthouys remarks page 51 but this principal fact namely that there is a mass of upraised coral on the narrow peninsula of tiarubu is from hearsay evidence also mr stutchbury west of england journal no i page 54  there is a passage in von zach corres astronom volume x page 266 inferring an uprising at tahiti from a footpath now used which was formerly impassable but i particularly inquired from several native chiefs whether they knew of any change of this kind and they were unanimous in giving me an answer in the negative have stated that they have observed shells and corals high up on the mountains of the society islandsa group encircled by barrierreefs and therefore supposed to have subsided at tahiti mr stutchbury found on the apex of one of the highest mountains between 5000 and 7000 feet above the level of the sea a distinct and regular stratum of semifossil coral  at tahiti however other naturalists as well as myself have searched in vain at a low level near the coast for upraised shells or masses of coralreef where if present they could hardly have been overlooked  from this fact i concluded that probably the organic remains strewed high up on the surface of the land had originally been embedded in the volcanic strata and had subsequently been washed out by the rain  i have since heard from the rev w ellis that the remains which he met with were as he believes interstratified with an argillaceous tuff this likewise was the case with the shells observed by the rev d tyerman at huaheine  these remains have not been specifically examined they may therefore and especially the stratum observed by mr stutchbury at an immense height be contemporaneous with the first formation of the society islands and be of any degree of antiquity or they may have been deposited at some subsequent but probably not very recent period of elevation for if the period had been recent the entire surface of the coast land of these islands where the reefs are so extensive would have been coated with upraised coral which certainly is not the case  two of the harvey or cook islands namely aitutaki and manouai are encircled by reefs which extend so far from the land that i have coloured them blue although with much hesitation as the space within the reef is shallow and the outline of the land is not abrupt  these two islands consist of coralrock but i have no evidence of their recent elevation besides the improbability of mangaia a fringed island in the same group but distant 170 miles having retained its nearly perfect atolllike structure during any immense lapse of time after its upheaval  the red sea therefore is the only area in which we have clear proofs of the recent elevation of a district which by our theory although the barrierreefs are there not well characterised has lately subsided  but we have no reason to be surprised at oscillation of level of this kind having occasionally taken place  there can be scarcely any doubt that savage aurora aurora island is described by mr couthouy remarks page 58 it lies 120 miles northeast of tahiti it is not coloured in the appended map because it does not appear to be fringed by living reefs  mr couthouy describes its summit as presenting a broad tableland which declines a few feet towards the centre where we may suppose the lagoon to have been placed  it is about two hundred feet in height and consists of reefrock and conglomerate with existing species of coral embedded in it  the island has been elevated at two successive periods the cliffs being marked halfway up with a horizontal waterworn line of deep excavations  aurora island seems closely to resemble in structure elizabeth island at the southern end of the low archipelago and mangaia islands and several of the islands in the friendly group existed originally as atolls and these have undoubtedly since been upraised to some height above the level of the sea so that by our theory there has here also been an oscillation of level elevation having succeeded subsidence instead of as in the middle part of the red sea and at the harvey islands subsidence having probably succeeded recent elevation  it is an interesting fact that fais which from its composition form height and situation at the western end of the caroline archipelago one is strongly induced to believe existed before its upheaval as an atoll lies exactly in the prolongation of the curved line of the mariana group which we know to be a line of recent elevation  i may add that elizabeth island in the southern part of the low archipelago which seems to have had the same kind of origin as fais lies near pitcairn island the only one in this part of the ocean which is high and at the same time not surrounded by an encircling barrierreef  on the absence of active volcanoes in the areas of subsidence and on their frequent presence in the areas of elevation  before making some concluding remarks on the relations of the spaces coloured blue and red it will be convenient to consider the position on our map of the volcanoes historically known to have been in action  it is impossible not to be struck first with the absence of volcanoes in the great areas of subsidence tinted pale and dark bluenamely in the central parts of the indian ocean in the china sea in the sea between the barriers of australia and new caledonia in the caroline marshall gilbert and low archipelagoes and secondly with the coincidence of the principal volcanic chains with the parts coloured red which indicates the presence of fringingreefs and as we have just seen the presence in most cases of upraised organic remains of a modern date  i may here remark that the reefs were all coloured before the volcanoes were added to the map or indeed before i knew of the existence of several of them  the volcano in torres strait at the northern point of australia is that which lies nearest to a large subsiding area although situated 125 miles within the outer margin of the actual barrierreef  the great comoro island which probably contains a volcano is only twenty miles distant from the barrierreef of mohila ambil volcano in the philippines is distant only a little more than sixty miles from the atollformed appoo reef and there are two other volcanoes in the map within ninety miles of circles coloured blue  these few cases which thus offer partial exceptions to the rule of volcanoes being placed remote from the areas of subsidence lie either near single and isolated atolls or near small groups of encircled islands and these by our theory can have in few instances subsided to the same amount in depth or area as groups of atolls  there is not one active volcano within several hundred miles of an archipelago or even a small group of atolls  it is therefore a striking fact that in the friendly archipelago which owes its origin to the elevation of a group of atolls two volcanoes and perhaps others are known to be in action on the other hand on several of the encircled islands in the pacific supposed by our theory to have subsided there are old craters and streams of lava which show the effects of past and ancient eruptions  in these cases it would appear as if the volcanoes had come into action and had become extinguished on the same spots according as the elevating or subsiding movements prevailed  there are some other coasts on the map where volcanoes in a state of action concur with proofs of recent elevation besides those coloured red from being fringed by coralreefs  thus i hope to show in a future volume that nearly the whole line of the west coast of south america which forms the greatest volcanic chain in the world from near the equator for a space of between 2000 and 3000 miles southward has undergone an upward movement during a late geological period  the islands on the northwestern shores of the pacific which form the second greatest volcanic chain are very imperfectly known but luzon in the philippines and the loo choo islands have been recently elevated and at kamtschatka at sedanka in latitude 58 deg n von buchs descrip des isles canaries page 455 in a forthcoming part i shall give the evidence referred to with respect to the elevation of new zealand there are extensive tertiary beds of modern date  evidence of the same nature but not very satisfactory may be detected in northern new zealand where there are two volcanoes  the coexistence in other parts of the world of active volcanoes with upraised beds of a modern tertiary origin will occur to every geologist  during the subterranean disturbances which took place in chile in 1835 i have shown geolog trans 2nd ser vol v page 606 that at the same moment that a large district was upraised volcanic matter burst forth at widely separated points through both new and old vents  nevertheless until it could be shown that volcanoes were inactive or did not exist in subsiding areas the conclusion that their distribution depended on the nature of the subterranean movements in progress would have been hazardous  but now viewing the appended map it may i think be considered as almost established that volcanoes are often not necessarily always present in those areas where the subterranean motive power has lately forced or is now forcing outwards the crust of the earth but that they are invariably absent in those where the surface has lately subsided or is still subsiding  we may infer from this rule that in any old deposit which contains interstratified beds of erupted matter there was at the period and in the area of its formation a tendency to an upward movement in the earths surface and certainly no movement of subsidence  on the relations of the areas of subsidence and elevation  the immense surfaces on the map which both by our theory and by the plain evidence of upraised marine remains have undergone a change of level either downwards or upwards during a late period is a most remarkable fact  the existence of continents shows that the areas have been immense which at some period have been upraised in south america we may feel sure and on the northwestern shores of the indian ocean we may suspect that this rising is either now actually in progress or has taken place quite recently  by our theory we may conclude that the areas are likewise immense which have lately subsided or judging from the earthquakes occasionally felt and from other appearances are now subsiding  the smallness of the scale of our map should not be overlooked each of the squares on it contains not allowing for the curvature of the earth 810000 square miles  look at the space of ocean from near the southern end of the low archipelago to the northern end of the marshall archipelago a length of 4500 miles in which as far as is known every island except aurora which lies just without the low archipelago is atollformed  the eastern and western boundaries of our map are continents and they are rising areas the central spaces of the great indian and pacific oceans are mostly subsiding between them north of australia lies the most broken land on the globe and there the rising parts are surrounded and penetrated by areas of subsidence i suspect that the arru and timorlaut islands present an included small area of subsidence like that of the china sea but i have not ventured to colour them from my imperfect information as given in the appendix so that the prevailing movements now in progress seem to accord with the actual states of surface of the great divisions of the world  the blue spaces on the map are nearly all elongated but it does not necessarily follow from this a caution for which i am indebted to mr lyell that the areas of subsidence were likewise elongated for the subsidence of a long narrow space of the bed of the ocean including in it a transverse chain of mountains surmounted by atolls would only be marked on the map by a transverse blue band  but where a chain of atolls and barrierreefs lies in an elongated area between spaces coloured red which therefore have remained stationary or have been upraised this must have resulted either from the area of subsidence having originally been elongated owing to some tendency in the earths crust thus to subside or from the subsiding area having originally been of an irregular figure or as broad as long and having since been narrowed by the elevation of neighbouring districts  thus the areas which subsided during the formation of the great north and south lines of atolls in the indian oceanof the east and west line of the caroline atollsand of the northwest and southeast line of the barrierreefs of new caledonia and louisiade must have originally been elongated or if not so they must have since been made elongated by elevations which we know to belong to a recent period  i infer from mr hopkins researches researches in physical geology transact cambridge phil soc volume vi part i that for the formation of a long chain of mountains with few lateral spurs an area elongated in the same direction with the chain must have been subjected to an elevatory movement  mountainchains however when already formed although running in very different directions it seems for instance in s america from latitude 34 deg for very many degrees southward there are upraised beds containing recent species of shells on both the atlantic and pacific side of the continent and from the gradual ascent of the land although with very unequal slopes on both sides towards the cordillera i think it can hardly be doubted that the entire width has been upraised in mass within the recent period  in this case the two wnw and ese mountainlines namely the sierra ventana and the s tapalguen and the great north and south line of the cordillera have been together raised  in the west indies the n and s line of the eastern antilles and the e and w line of jamaica appear both to have been upraised within the latest geological period may be raised together by a widelyacting force so perhaps mountainchains may subside together  hence we cannot tell whether the caroline and marshall archipelagoes two groups of atolls running in different directions and meeting each other have been formed by the subsidence of two areas or of one large area including two distinct lines of mountains  we have however in the southern prolongation of the mariana islands probable evidence of a line of recent elevation having intersected one of recent subsidence  a view of the map will show that generally there is a tendency to alternation in the parallel areas undergoing opposite kinds of movement as if the sinking of one area balanced the rising of another  the existence in many parts of the world of high tableland proves that large surfaces have been upraised in mass to considerable heights above the level of the ocean although the highest points in almost every country consist of upturned strata or erupted matter and from the immense spaces scattered with atolls which indicate that land originally existed there although not one pinnacle now remains above the level of the sea we may conclude that wide areas have subsided to an amount sufficient to bury not only any formerly existing tableland but even the heights formed by fractured strata and erupted matter  the effects produced on the land by the later elevatory movements namely successively rising cliffs lines of erosion and beds of literal shells and pebbles all requiring time for their production prove that these movements have been very slow we can however infer this with safety only with respect to the few last hundred feet of rise  but with reference to the whole vast amount of subsidence necessary to have produced the many atolls widely scattered over immense spaces it has already been shown and it is perhaps the most interesting conclusion in this volume that the movements must either have been uniform and exceedingly slow or have been effected by small steps separated from each other by long intervals of time during which the reefconstructing polypifers were able to bring up their solid frameworks to the surface  we have little means of judging whether many considerable oscillations of level have generally occurred during the elevation of large tracts but we know from clear geological evidence that this has frequently taken place and we have seen on our map that some of the same islands have both subsided and been upraised  i conclude however that most of the large blue spaces have subsided without many and great elevatory oscillations because only a few upraised atolls have been observed the supposition that such elevations have taken place but that the upraised parts have been worn down by the surf and thus have escaped observation is overruled by the very considerable depth of the lagoons of all the larger atolls for this could not have been the case if they had suffered repeated elevations and abrasion  from the comparative observations made in these latter pages we may finally conclude that the subterranean changes which have caused some large areas to rise and others to subside have acted in a very similar manner  recapitulation  in the three first chapters the principal kinds of coralreefs were described in detail and they were found to differ little as far as relates to the actual surface of the reef  an atoll differs from an encircling barrierreef only in the absence of land within its central expanse and a barrierreef differs from a fringingreef in being placed at a much greater distance from the land with reference to the probable inclination of its submarine foundation and in the presence of a deepwater lagoonlike space or moat within the reef  in the fourth chapter the growing powers of the reefconstructing polypifers were discussed and it was shown that they cannot flourish beneath a very limited depth  in accordance with this limit there is no difficulty respecting the foundations on which fringingreefs are based whereas with barrierreefs and atolls there is a great apparent difficulty on this head in barrierreefs from the improbability of the rock of the coast or of banks of sediment extending in every instance so far seaward within the required depthand in atolls from the immensity of the spaces over which they are interspersed and the apparent necessity for believing that they are all supported on mountainsummits which although rising very near to the surfacelevel of the sea in no one instance emerge above it  to escape this latter most improbable admission which implies the existence of submarine chains of mountains of almost the same height extending over areas of many thousand square miles there is but one alternative namely the prolonged subsidence of the foundations on which the atolls were primarily based together with the upward growth of the reefconstructing corals  on this view every difficulty vanishes fringing reefs are thus converted into barrierreefs and barrierreefs when encircling islands are thus converted into atolls the instant the last pinnacle of land sinks beneath the surface of the ocean  thus the ordinary forms and certain peculiarities in the structure of atolls and barrierreefs can be explainednamely the walllike structure on their inner sides the basin or ringlike shape both of the marginal and central reefs in the maldiva atollsthe union of some atolls as if by a ribbonthe apparent disseverment of othersand the occurrence in atolls as well as in barrierreefs of portions of reef and of the whole of some reefs in a dead and submerged state but retaining the outline of living reefs  thus can be explained the existence of breaches through barrierreefs in front of valleys though separated from them by a wide space of deep water thus also the ordinary outline of groups of atolls and the relative forms of the separate atolls one to another thus can be explained the proximity of the two kinds of reefs formed during subsidence and their separation from the spaces where fringingreefs abound  on searching for other evidence of the movements supposed by our theory we find marks of change in atolls and in barrierreefs and of subterranean disturbances under them but from the nature of things it is scarcely possible to detect any direct proofs of subsidence although some appearances are strongly in favour of it  on the fringed coasts however the presence of upraised marine bodies of a recent epoch plainly show that these coasts instead of having remained stationary which is all that can be directly inferred from our theory have generally been elevated  finally when the two great types of structure namely barrierreefs and atolls on the one hand and fringingreefs on the other were laid down in colours on our map a magnificent and harmonious picture of the movements which the crust of the earth has within a late period undergone is presented to us  we there see vast areas rising with volcanic matter every now and then bursting forth through the vents or fissures with which they are traversed  we see other wide spaces slowly sinking without any volcanic outburst and we may feel sure that this sinking must have been immense in amount as well as in area thus to have buried over the broad face of the ocean every one of those mountains above which atolls now stand like monuments marking the place of their former existence reflecting how powerful an agent with respect to denudation and consequently to the nature and thickness of the deposits in accumulation the sea must ever be when acting for prolonged periods on the land during either its slow emergence or subsidence reflecting also on the final effects of these movements in the interchange of land and oceanwater on the climate of the earth and on the distribution of organic beings i may be permitted to hope that the conclusions derived from the study of coralformations originally attempted merely to explain their peculiar forms may be thought worthy of the attention of geologists   appendix  containing a detailed description of the reefs and islands in plate iii  in the beginning of the last chapter i stated the principles on which the map is coloured  there only remains to be said that it is an exact copy of one by m c gressier published by the depot general de la marine in 1835  the names have been altered into english and the longitude has been reduced to that of greenwich  the colours were first laid down on accurate charts on a large scale  the data on which the volcanoes historically known to have been in action have been marked with vermillion were given in a note to the last chapter  i will commence my description on the eastern side of the map and will describe each group of islands consecutively proceeding westward across the pacific and indian oceans but ending with the west indies  the western shores of america appear to be entirely without coralreefs south of the equator the survey of the beagle and north of it the published charts show that this is the case  even in the bay of panama where corals flourish there are no true coralreefs as i have been informed by mr lloyd  there are no coralreefs in the galapagos archipelago as i know from personal inspection and i believe there are none on the cocos revillagigedo and other neighbouring islands clipperton rock 10 deg n 109 deg w has lately been surveyed by captain belcher in form it is like the crater of a volcano  from a drawing appended to the ms plan in the admiralty it evidently is not an atoll the eastern parts of the pacific present an enormous area without any islands except easter and sala and gomez islands which do not appear to be surrounded by reefs  the low archipelago  this group consists of about eighty atolls it will be quite superfluous to refer to descriptions of each  in durville and lottins chart one island wolchonsky is written with a capital letter signifying as explained in a former chapter that it is a high island but this must be a mistake as the original chart by bellinghausen shows that it is a true atoll  captain beechey says of the thirtytwo groups which he examined of the greater number of which i have seen beautiful ms charts in the admiralty that twentynine now contain lagoons and he believes the other three originally did  bellinghausen see an account of his russian voyage in the biblioth des voyages 1834 page 443 says that the seventeen islands which he discovered resembled each other in structure and he has given charts on a large scale of all of them  kotzebue has given plans of several cook and bligh mention others a few were seen during the voyage of the beagle and notices of other atolls are scattered through several publications  the actaeon group in this archipelago has lately been discovered geographical journal volume vii page 454 it consists of three small and low islets one of which has a lagoon  another lagoonisland has been discovered naut mag 1839 page 770 in 22 deg 4 s and 136 deg 20 w  towards the se part of the group there are some islands of different formation elizabeth island is described by beechey page 46 4to edition as fringed by reefs at the distance of between two and three hundred yards coloured red  pitcairn island in the immediate neighbourhood according to the same authority has no reefs of any kind although numerous pieces of coral are thrown up on the beach the sea close to its shore is very deep see zool of beecheys voyage page 164 it is left uncoloured  gambier islands see plate i figure 8 are encircled by a barrierreef the greatest depth within is thirtyeight fathoms coloured pale blue  aurora island which lies ne of tahiti close to the large space coloured dark blue in the map has been already described in a note page 71 on the authority of mr couthouy it is an upraised atoll but as it does not appear to be fringed by living reefs it is left uncoloured  the society archipelago is separated by a narrow space from the low archipelago and in their parallel direction they manifest some relation to each other  i have already described the general character of the reefs of these fine encircled islands  in the atlas of the coquilles voyage there is a good general chart of the group and separate plans of some of the islands  tahiti the largest island in the group is almost surrounded as seen in cooks chart by a reef from half a mile to a mile and a half from the shore with from ten to thirty fathoms within it  some considerable submerged reefs lying parallel to the shore with a broad and deep space within have lately been discovered naut mag 1836 page 264 on the ne coast of the island where none are laid down by cook  at eimeo the reef which like a ring surrounds it is in some places one or two miles distant from the shore in others united to the beach ellis polynesian researches volume i page 18 12mo edition  cook found deep water twenty fathoms in some of the harbours within the reef  mr couthouy however states remarks page 45 that both at tahiti and eimeo the space between the barrierreef and the shore has been almost filled upa nearly continuous fringingreef surrounding the island and varying from a few yards to rather more than a mile in width the lagoons merely forming canals between this and the seareef that is the barrierreef  tapamanoa is surrounded by a reef at a considerable distance from the shore from the island being small it is breached as i am informed by the rev w ellis only by a narrow and crooked boat channel  this is the lowest island in the group its height probably not exceeding 500 feet  a little way north of tahiti the low coralislets of teturoa are situated from the description of them given me by the rev j williams the author of the narrative of missionary enterprise i should have thought they had formed a small atoll and likewise from the description given by the rev d tyerman and g bennett journal of voyage and travels volume i page 183 who say that ten low coralislets are comprehended within one general reef and separated from each other by interjacent lagoons but as mr stutchbury west of england journal volume i page 54 describes it as consisting of a mere narrow ridge i have left it uncoloured  maitea eastward of the group is classed by forster as a high encircled island but from the account given by the rev d tyerman and g bennett volume i page 57 it appears to be an exceedingly abrupt cone rising from the sea without any reef i have left it uncoloured  it would be superfluous to describe the northern islands in this group as they may be well seen in the chart accompanying the 4to edition of cooks voyages and in the atlas of the coquilles voyage  maurua is the only one of the northern islands in which the water within the reef is not deep being only four and a half fathoms but the great width of the reef stretching three miles and a half southward of the land which is represented in the drawing in the atlas of the coquilles voyage as descending abruptly to the water shows on the principle explained in the beginning of the last chapter that it belongs to the barrier class  i may here mention from information communicated to me by the rev w ellis that on the ne side of huaheine there is a bank of sand about a quarter of a mile wide extending parallel to the shore and separated from it by an extensive and deep lagoon this bank of sand rests on coralrock and undoubtedly was originally a living reef  north of bolabola lies the atoll of toubai motouiti of the coquilles atlas which is coloured dark blue the other islands surrounded by barrierreefs are pale blue three of them are represented in figures 3 4 and 5 in plate i  there are three low coralgroups lying a little e of the society archipelago and almost forming part of it namely bellinghausen which is said by kotzebue second voyage volume ii page 255 to be a lagoonisland mopeha which from cooks description second voyage book iii chapter i no doubt is an atoll and the scilly islands which are said by wallis voyage chapter ix to form a group of low islets and shoals and therefore probably they compose an atoll the two former have been coloured blue but not the latter  mendana or marquesas group  these islands are entirely without reefs as may be seen in krusensterns atlas making a remarkable contrast with the adjacent group of the society islands  mr fd bennett has given some account of this group in the seventh volume of the geographical journal  he informs me that all the islands have the same general character and that the water is very deep close to their shores  he visited three of them namely dominicana christiana and roapoa their beaches are strewed with rounded masses of coral and although no regular reefs exist yet the shore is in many places lined by coralrock so that a boat grounds on this formation  hence these islands ought probably to come within the class of fringed islands and be coloured red but as i am determined to err on the cautious side i have left them uncoloured  cook or harvey and austral island  palmerston island is minutely described as an atoll by captain cook during his voyage in 1774 coloured blue  aitutaki was partially surveyed by the beagle see map accompanying voyages of adventure and beagle the land is hilly sloping gently to the beach the highest point is 360 feet on the southern side the reef projects five miles from the land off this point the beagle found no bottom with 270 fathoms the reef is surmounted by many low coralislets  although within the reef the water is exceedingly shallow not being more than a few feet deep as i am informed by the rev j williams nevertheless from the great extension of this reef into a profoundly deep ocean this island probably belongs on the principle lately adverted to to the barrier class and i have coloured it pale blue although with much hesitationmanouai or harvey island  the highest point is about fifty feet the rev j williams informs me that the reef here although it lies far from the shore is less distant than at aitutaki but the water within the reef is rather deeper i have also coloured this pale blue with many doubtsround mitiaro island as i am informed by mr williams the reef is attached to the shore coloured red mauki or maouti the reef round this island under the name of

size and extends in a nw and se line very few islets have been formed on it  the lagoon seems to be shallow at least the deepest part which was surveyed was only three fathoms  mr couthouy remarks page 38 describes this island under the name of ocean island  considerable doubts should be entertained regarding the nature of a reef of this kind with a very shallow lagoon and standing far from any other atoll on account of the possibility of a crater or flat bank of rock lying at the proper depth beneath the surface of the water thus affording a foundation for a ringformed coralreef  i have however thought myself compelled from its large size and symmetrical outline to colour it blue  samoa or navigator group  kotzebue in his second voyage contrasts the structure of these islands with many others in the pacific in not being furnished with harbours for ships formed by distant coralreefs  the rev j williams however informs me that coralreefs do occur in irregular patches on the shores of these islands but that they do not form a continuous band as round mangaia and other such perfect cases of fringed islands  from the charts accompanying la peyrouses voyage it appears that the north shore of savaii maouna orosenga and manua are fringed by reefs  la peyrouse speaking of maouna page 126 says that the coralreef surrounding its shores almost touches the beach and is breached in front of the little coves and streams forming passages for canoes and probably even for boats  further on page 159 he extends the same observation to all the islands which he visited  mr williams in his narrative speaks of a reef going round a small island attached to oyolava and returning again to it all these islands have been coloured reda chart of rose island at the extreme west

by a very few low islets the lagoon is very shallow and is strewed with numerous large boulders of volcanic rock  this island therefore probably consists of a bank of rock a few feet submerged with the outer margin of its upper surface fringed with reefs hence it cannot be properly classed with atolls in which the foundations are always supposed to lie at a depth greater than that at which the

4000 feet  most of the islands are surrounded by reefs lying far from the land and outside of which the ocean appears very deep  the astrolabe sounded with ninety fathoms in several places about a mile from the reefs and found no bottom  although the depth within the reef is not laid down it is evident from several expressions that captain durville believes that ships could anchor within if passages existed through the outer barriers  the chevallier dillon informs me that this is the case hence i have coloured this group blue  in the se part lies batoa or turtle island of cook second

original documents concerning this island  from the plans given by captains eeg and khremtshenko and from the detailed account given by the former it appears that it is a narrow coralisland about two miles long containing a small lagoon  the sea is very deep close to the shore which is fronted by sharp coralrocks captain eeg compares the lagoon with that of other coralislands and he distinctly says the land is very low  i have therefore coloured it blue  admiral krusenstern memoir on the pacific append 1835 states that its shores are eighty feet high this probably arose from the height of

without reefs presenting a remarkable contrast with those of new caledonia on the one hand and the fidji group on the other nevertheless i have been assured by mr g bennett that coral grows vigorously on their shores as indeed will be further shown in some of the following notices  as therefore these islands are not encircled and as coral grows vigorously on their shores we might almost conclude without further evidence that they were fringed and hence i have applied the red colour with rather greater freedom than in other instancesmatthews rock an active volcano some way south of the group

i met with any detailed account of their shores or seen plans on a large scale and it will be evident that a fringingreef of only thirty or even a few hundred yards in width is of so little importance

bigali and of freycinet hydrog memoir luranie voyage page 188 regarding tamatam ollap etc it will be seen that the artist must have represented the land incorrectly  the most southern island in the

that there are many extensive coralreefs skirting often at considerable distances the nw shores and encompassing the small adjoining islets  deep water in no instance is represented in the charts between these reefs and the land and therefore they probably belong to the fringing class  but as they extend far into the sea which is generally shallow even in places where the land seems to be somewhat precipitous i have not coloured them  houtmans abrolhos latitude 28 deg s on west coast have lately been surveyed by captain wickham as described in naut mag 1841 page 511 they lie on the

to fifteen fathoms and in one spot with twentythree fathoms  the greater part of the island has been formed on their inland sides by the accumulation of fragments of coral the seaward face consisting of nearly bare ledges of rock  some of the specimens brought home by captain wickham contained fragments of marine shells but others did not and these closely resembled a formation at king georges sound principally due to the action of the wind on calcareous dust which i shall describe in a forthcoming part from the extreme irregularity of these reefs with their lagoons and from their position on a bank the usual depth of which is only thirty fathoms i have not ventured to class them with atolls and hence have left them uncolouredrowley shoals  these lie some way from the nw coast of

from horsburgh volume ii page 602 that a coralflat bounds the shores of sapy bay  from the same authority it appears page 610 that reefs fringe the island of timoryoung on the n shore of sumbawa and likewise page 600 that bally town in lombock is fronted by a reef stretching along the shore at a distance of a hundred fathoms with channels through it for boats these places therefore have been coloured redbally island  in a dutch ms chart on a large scale of java which was brought from that island by dr horsfield who had the kindness to show it me at the india house its western northern and southern shores appear very regularly fringed by a reef see also horsburgh volume ii page 593 and as coral is found abundantly there i have not the least doubt that the reef is of coral and therefore have coloured it red  java  my information regarding the reefs of this great island is derived from the chart just mentioned  the greater part of maduara is represented in it as regularly fringed and likewise portions of the coast of java immediately south of it  dr horsfield informs me that coral is very abundant near sourabaya  the islets and parts of the n coast of java west of point buang or japara are fringed by reefs said to be of coral  lubeck or bavian islands lying at some distance from the shore of java are regularly fringed by coralreefs  carimon java appears equally so though it is not directly said that the reefs are of coral there is a depth between thirty and forty fathoms round these islands  parts of the shores of sunda strait where the water is from forty to eighty fathoms deep and the islets near batavia appear in several charts to be fringed  in the dutch chart the southern shore in the narrowest part of the island is in two places fringed by reefs of coral  west of segorrowodee bay and the extreme se and e portions are likewise fringed by coralreefs all the abovementioned places coloured red  macassar strait  the east coast of borneo appears in most parts free from reefs and where they occur as on the east coast of pamaroong the sea is very shallow hence no part is coloured  in macassar strait itself in about latitude 2 deg s there are many small islands with coralshoals projecting far from them  there are also old charts by dalrymple numerous little flats of coral not rising to the surface of the water and shelving suddenly from five fathoms to no bottom with fifty fathoms they do not appear to have a lagoonlike structure  there are similar coralshoals a little farther south and in latitude 4 deg 55 there are two which are engraved from modern surveys in a manner which might represent an annular reef with deep water inside captain moresby however who was formerly in this sea doubts this fact so that i have left them uncoloured at the same time i may remark that these two shoals make a nearer approach to the atolllike structure than any other within the e indian archipelago  southward of these shoals there are other low islands and irregular coralreefs and in the space of sea north of the great volcanic chain from timor to java we have also other islands such as the postillions kalatoa tokanbessees etc which are chiefly low and are surrounded by very irregular and distant reefs  from the imperfect charts i have seen i have not been able to decide whether they belong to the atoll or barrierclasses or whether they merely fringe submarine banks and gently sloping land  in the bay of bonin between the two southern arms of celebes there are numerous coral reefs but none of them seem to have an atolllike structure  i have therefore not coloured any of the islands in this part of the sea i think it however exceedingly probable that some of them ought to be blue  i may add that there is a harbour on the se coast of bouton which according to an old chart is formed by a reef parallel to the shore with deep water within and in the voyage of the coquille some neighbouring islands are represented with reefs a good way distant but i do not know whether with deep water within  i have not thought the evidence sufficient to permit me to colour them  sumatra  commencing with the west coast and outlying islands

frequently speak of the numerous reefs and banks of coral on the west coast of sumatra but these nowhere have the structure of a barrierreef and marsden history of sumatra states that where the coast is flat the fringingreefs extend furthest from it  the northern and southern points and the greater part of the east coast are low and faced with mud banks and therefore without coral  nicobar islands  the chart represents the islands of this group as fringed by reefs  with regard to great nicobar captain moresby informs me that it is fringed by reefs of coral extending between two and three hundred yards from the shore  the northern nicobars appear so regularly fringed in the published charts that i have no doubt the reefs are of coral  this group therefore is coloured red  andaman islands  from an examination of the ms chart on a large scale of this island by captain arch blair in the admiralty several portions of the coast appear fringed and as horsburgh speaks of coralreefs being numerous in the vicinity of these islands i should have coloured them red had not some expressions in a paper in the asiatic researches volume iv page 402 led me to doubt the existence of reefs uncoloured  the coast of malacca tenasserim and the coasts northward appear in the greater part to be low and muddy where reefs occur as in parts of malacca straits and near singapore they are of the fringing kind but the water is so shoal that i have not coloured them  in the sea however between malacca and the west coast of borneo where there is a greater depth from forty to fifty fathoms i have coloured red some of the groups which are regularly fringed  the northern natunas and the anambas islands are represented in the charts on a large scale published in the atlas of the voyage of the

carimata but as the sea is confined and shallow and the reefs not very regular i have left them uncoloured  the water shoals gradually towards the whole west coast of borneo i cannot make out that it has any reefs of coral  the islands however off the northern extremity and near the sw end of palawan are fringed by very distant coralreefs thus the reefs in the case of balabac are no less than five miles from the land but the sea in the whole of this district is so shallow that the reefs might be expected to extend very far from the land  i have not therefore thought myself authorised to colour them the ne point of borneo where the water is very shoal is connected with magindanao by a chain of islands called the sooloo archipelago about which i have been able to obtain very little information pangootaran although ten miles long entirely consists of a bed of coralrock notices of e indian arch page 58 i believe from horsburgh that the island is low not colouredtahow bank in some

basselan some of the islets in the chart accompanying forrests voyage appear fringed with reefs hence i have coloured though unwillingly parts of the sooloo group red  the sea between sooloo and palawan near the shoal coast of borneo is interspersed with irregular reefs and shoal patches not coloured but in the northern part of this sea there are two low islets cagayanes and cavilli surrounded by extensive coralreefs the breakers round the latter horsburgh volume ii page 513 extend five or six miles from a sandbank which forms the only dry part these breakers are steep to outside there appears to be an opening through them on one side with four or five fathoms within from this description i strongly suspect that cavilli ought to be considered an atoll but as i have not seen any chart of it on even a moderately large scale i have not coloured it  the islets off the northern end of palawan are in the same case as those off the southern end namely they are fringed by reefs some way distant from the shore but the water is exceedingly shallow uncoloured  the western shore of palawan will be treated of under the head of china sea  philippine archipelago  a chart on a large

puebla iba and mansinglor  in the neighbourhood of solonsolon bay the shore is lined horsburgh ii page 439 by coralreefs stretching out a great way there are also reefs about the islets off solamague and as i am informed by mr cuming near st catalina and a little north of it  the same gentleman informs me there are reefs on the se point of this island in front of samar extending from malalabon to bulusan  these appear to be the principal fringingreefs on the coasts of luzon and they have all been coloured red mr cuming informs me that none of them have deep water within although it appears from horsburgh that some few extend to a considerable distance from the shore  within the philippine archipelago the shores of the islands do not appear to be commonly fringed with the exception of the s shore of masbate and nearly the whole of bohol which are both coloured red  on the s shore of magindanao bunwoot island is surrounded according to forrest voyage page 253 by a coralreef which in the chart appears one of the fringing class  with respect to the eastern coasts of the whole archipelago i have not been able to obtain any account  babuyan islands  horsburgh says volume ii page 442

the group volume ii page 445 says the shores of both islands are fortified by a reef and through some of the gaps in it the natives can pass in their boats in fine weather the bottom near the land is coralrock  from the published charts it is evident that several of these islands are most regularly fringed coloured red  the northern islands are left uncoloured as i have been unable to find any account of themformosa  the shores especially the western one seem chiefly composed of mud and sand and i cannot make out that they are anywhere lined by reefs except in a harbour horsburgh volume ii

described by captain broughton voy to the n pacific page 191 he says the boats with some difficulty found a passage through the coralreefs which extend along the coast nearly half a mile off it  the boats were well sheltered within the reef but it does not appear that the water is deep there outside the reef the depth is very irregular varying from five to fifty fathoms the form of the land is not very abrupt coloured redtaypin san from the description given page 195 by the same author it appears that a very irregular reef extends to the distance of several miles from the southern island but whether it encircles a space of deep water is not evident nor indeed whether these outlying reefs are connected with those more immediately adjoining the land left uncoloured  i may here just add that the shore of kumi lying west of patchow has a narrow reef attached to it in the plan of it in la peyrouses atlas but it does not appear in the account of the voyage that it is of coral uncolouredloo choo the greater part of the coast of this moderately hilly island is skirted by reefs which do not extend far from the shore and which do not leave a channel of deep water within them as may be seen in the charts accompanying captain b halls voyage to loo choo see also remarks in appendix pages xxi and xxv  there are however some ports with deep water formed by reefs in front of valleys in the same manner as happens at mauritius  captain beechey in a letter to me compares these reefs with those encircling the society islands but there appears to me a marked difference between them in the less distance at which the loo choo reefs lie from the land with relation to the probable submarine inclination and in the absence of an interior deep watermoat or channel parallel to the land  hence i have classed these reefs with fringingreefs and coloured them redpescadores west of formosa  dampier volume i page 416 has compared the appearance of the land to the southern parts of england the islands are interlaced with coralreefs but as the water is very shoal and as spits of sand and gravel horsburgh volume ii page 450 extend far out from them it is impossible to draw any inferences regarding the nature of the reefs  china seaproceeding from north to south we first meet the pratas shoal latitude 20 deg n which according to horsburgh volume ii page 335 is composed of coral is of a circular form and has a low islet on it the reef is on a level with the waters edge and when the sea runs high there are breakers mostly all round but the water within seems pretty deep in some places although steepto in most parts outside there appear to be several parts where a ship might find anchorage outside the breakers coloured bluethe paracells have been accurately surveyed by captain d ross and charts on a large scale published but few low islets have been formed on these shoals and this seems to be a general circumstance in the china sea the sea close outside the reefs is very deep several of them have a lagoonlike structure or separate islets prattle robert drummond etc are so arranged round a moderately shallow space as to appear as if they had once formed one large atoll bombay shoal one of the paracells has the form of an annular reef and is apparently deep within it seems to have an entrance horsburgh volume ii page 332 on its west side it is very steep

some parts of the bank are level with a sandy bottom but generally the depth is very irregular  it is intersected by deep cuts or channels  i am not able to perceive in the published charts its limits however are not very accurately known whether the central part is deeper which i suspect is the case as in the great chagos bank in the indian ocean not colouredscarborough shoal this coralshoal is

through them not coloureda bank gradually shoaling to the depth of thirty fathoms extends to a distance of about twenty miles from the northern part of borneo and to thirty miles from the northern part of palawan  near the land this bank appears tolerably free from danger but a little further out it is thickly studded with coralshoals which do not generally rise quite to the surface some of them are very steepto and others have a fringe of shoalwater round them  i should have thought that these shoals had level surfaces had it not been for the statement made by horsburgh that most of the shoals hereabouts are formed of a belt of coral  but perhaps that expression was more particularly applied to the shoals further in the offing  if these reefs of coral have a lagoonlike structure they should have been coloured blue and they would have formed an imperfect barrier in front of palawan and the northern part of borneo  but as the water is not very deep these reefs may have grown up from inequalities on the bank i have not coloured themthe coast of china tonquin and cochinchina forming the western boundary of the china sea appear to be without reefs with regard to the two

person who passed it any reefs at allceylon a space about eighty miles in length of the southwestern and southern shores of these islands has been described by mr twynam naut mag 1836 pages 365 and 518 parts of this space appear to be very regularly fringed by coralreefs which extend from a quarter to half a mile from the shore  these reefs are in places breached and afford safe anchorage for

fringingreefs in several parts of the southeastern shores which i have also coloured redat venloos bay the shore is likewise fringed north of trincomalee there are also reefs of the same kind  the sea off the northern part of ceylon is exceedingly shallow and therefore i have not coloured the reefs which fringe portions of its shores and the adjoining islets as well as the indian promontory of madura  chagos maldiva and laccadive archipelagoes  these three great groups which have already been often noticed are now wellknown from the admirable surveys of captain moresby and lieutenant powell  the published charts which are worthy of the most attentive examination at once show that the chagos and maldiva groups are entirely formed of great atolls or lagoonformed reefs surmounted by islets  in the laccadive group this structure is less evident the islets are low not exceeding the usual height of coralformations see lieutenant woods account geographical journal volume vi page 29 and most of the reefs are circular as may be seen in the published charts and within several of them as i am informed by captain moresby there is deepish water these therefore have been coloured blue  directly north and almost forming part of this group there is a long narrow slightly curved bank rising out of the depths of the ocean composed of sand shells and decayed coral with from twentythree to thirty fathoms on it  i have no doubt that it has had the same origin with the other laccadive banks but as it does not deepen towards the centre i have not coloured it  i might have referred to other authorities regarding these three archipelagoes but after the publication of the charts by captain moresby to whose personal kindness in giving me much information i am exceedingly indebted it would have been superfluous  sahia de malha bank consists of a series of narrow banks with from eight to sixteen fathoms on them they are arranged in a semicircular manner round a space about forty fathoms deep which slopes on the se quarter to unfathomable depths they are steepto on both sides but more especially on the oceanside  hence this bank closely resembles in structure and i may add from captain moresbys information in composition the pitts bank in the chagos group and the pitts bank must after what has been shown of the great chagos bank be considered as a sunken halfdestroyed atoll hence coloured bluecargados carajos bank  its southern portion consists of a large curved coralshoal with some low islets on its eastern edge and likewise some on the western side between which there is a depth of about twelve fathoms  northward a great bank extends i cannot probably owing to the want of perfect charts refer this reef and bank to any classtherefore not colouredile de sable is a

exceedingly extensive in one part they project even five miles from the shore  as far as i can make out there is no deepwater moat within them and the sea outside does not deepen very suddenly  the outline however of the land appears to be life of sir j makintosh volume ii page 165 hilly and rugged  i am unable to decide whether these reefs belong to the barrier class as seems probable from their great extension or to the fringing class uncoloured bourbon  the greater part of the shores of this island are without reefs but captain carmichael hookers bot misc states that a portion fifteen miles in length on the se side is imperfectly fringed with coral reefs i have not thought this sufficient to colour the island  seychelles  the rocky islands of primary formation composing this group rise from a very extensive and tolerably level bank having a depth between twenty and forty fathoms  in captain owens chart and in that in the atlas of the voyage of the favourite it appears that the east side of mahe and the adjoining islands of st anne and cerf are regularly fringed by coralreefs a portion of the se part of curieuse island the n and part of the sw shore of praslin island and the whole west side of digue island appear fringed  from a ms account of these islands by captain f moresby in the admiralty it appears that silhouette is also fringed he states that all these islands are formed of granite and quartz that they rise abruptly from the sea and that coralreefs have grown round them and project for some distance  dr allan of forres who visited these islands informs me that there is no deep water between the reefs and the shore  the above specified points have been coloured red  amirantes islands the small islands of this neighbouring group according to the ms account of them by captain f moresby are situated on an extensive bank they consist of the debris of corals and shells are only about twenty feet in height and are environed by reefs some attached to the shore and some rather distant from iti have taken great pains to procure plans and information regarding the several islands lying between se and sw of the amirantes and the seychelles relying chiefly on captain f moresby and dr allan it appears that the greater number namelyplatte alphonse coetivi galega providence st pierre astova assomption and glorioso are low formed of sand or coralrock and irregularly shaped they are situated on very extensive banks and are connected with great coralreefs  galega is said by dr allan to be rather higher than the other islands and st pierre is described by captain f moresby as being cavernous throughout and as not consisting of either limestone or granite  these islands as well as the amirantes certainly are not atollformed and they differ as a group from every other group with which i am acquainted i have not coloured them but probably the reefs belong to the fringing class  their formation is attributed both by dr allan and captain f moresby to the action of the currents here exceedingly violent on banks which no doubt have had an independent geological origin  they resemble in many respects some islands and banks in the west indies which owe their origin to a similar agency in conjunction with an elevation of the entire area  in close vicinity to the several islands there are three others of an apparently different nature first juan de nova which appears from some plans and accounts to be an atoll but from others does not appear to be so not coloured  secondly cosmoledo this group consists of a ring of coral ten leagues in

generally speaking it is flat horsburgh says volume i page 214 the water is profoundly deep close to the shore from which expression i presume some parts are without reefs from this description i apprehend the reef belongs to the barrier class but i have not coloured it as most of the charts which i have seen represent the reefs round it as very much less extensive than round the other islands

tullear harbour directly n of it is formed by a narrow reef ten miles long extending parallel to the shore with from four to ten fathoms within it  if this reef had been more extensive it must have been classed as a barrierreef but as the line of coast falls inwards here a submarine bank perhaps extends parallel to the shore which has offered a foundation for the growth of the coral i have left

the part above specified is engraved on a large scale and as in the charts on rather a smaller scale the same fringe of reef extends as far as latitude 33 deg 15 i have coloured the whole of this part of the coast red  the islands of juan de nova in latitude 17 deg s appear in the charts on a large scale to be fringed but i have not been able to ascertain whether the reefs are of coral uncoloured  the main part of the west coast appears to be low with outlying sandbanks which lieutenant boteler volume ii page 106 says are faced on the edge of deep water by a line of sharppointed coralrocks  nevertheless i have not coloured this part as i cannot make out by the charts that the coast itself is fringed  the headlands of narrenda and passandava bays 14 deg 40 and the islands in front of radama harbour are represented in the plans as regularly fringed and have accordingly been coloured red  with respect to the east coast of madagascar dr allan informs me in a letter that the whole line of coast from tamatave in 18 deg 12 to c amber at the extreme northern point of the island is bordered by coralreefs  the land is low uneven and gradually rising from the coast  from captain owens charts also the existence of these reefs which evidently belong to the fringing class on some parts namely n of british sound and near ngoncy of the above line of coast might have been inferred  lieutenant boteler volume i page 155 speaks of the reef surrounding the island of st marys at a small distance from the shore  in a previous chapter i have described from the information of dr allan the manner in which the reefs extend in ne lines from the headlands on this coast thus sometimes forming rather deep channels within them this seems caused by the action of the currents and the reefs spring up from the submarine prolongations of the sandy headlands  the above specified portion of the coast is coloured red  the remaining se portions do not appear in any published chart to possess reefs of any kind and the rev w ellis whose means of information regarding this side of madagascar have been extensive informs me he believes there are none  east coast of africa  proceeding from the northern part the coast appears for a considerable space without reefs  my information i may here observe is derived from the survey by captain owen together with his narrative and that by lieutenant boteler  at mukdeesha 10 deg 1 n there is a coralreef extending four or five miles along the shore owens narr volume i page 357 which in the chart lies at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the shore and has within it from six to ten feet water this then is a fringingreef and is coloured red  from juba a little s of the equator to lamoo in 2 deg 20 s the coast and islands are formed of madrepore owens narrative volume i page 363  the chart of this part entitled dundas islands presents an extraordinary appearance the coast of the mainland is quite straight and it is fronted at the average distance of two miles by exceedingly narrow straight islets fringed with reefs within the chain of islets there are extensive tidal flats and muddy bays into which many rivers enter the depths of these spaces varies from one to four fathomsthe latter depth not being common and about twelve feet the average  outside the chain of islets the sea at the distance of a mile varies in depth from eight to fifteen fathoms  lieutenant boteler narr volume i page 369 describes the muddy bay of patta which seems to resemble other parts of this coast as fronted by small narrow level islets formed of decomposing coral the margin of which is seldom of greater height than twelve feet overhanging the rocky surface from which the islets rise  knowing that the islets are formed of coral it is i think scarcely possible to view the coast and not at once conclude that we here see a fringingreef which has been upraised a few feet the unusual depth of from two to four fathoms within some of these islets is probably due to muddy rivers having prevented the growth of coral near the shore  there is however one difficulty on this view namely that before the elevation took place which converted the reef into a chain of islets the water must apparently have been still deeper on the other hand it may be supposed that the formation of a nearly perfect barrier in front of so large an extent of coast would cause the currents especially in front of the rivers to deepen their muddy beds  when describing in the chapter on fringingreefs those of mauritius i have given my reasons for believing that the shoal spaces within reefs of this kind must in many instances have been deepened  however this may be as several parts of this line of coast are undoubtedly fringed by living reefs i have coloured it

generally have extensive reefs projecting from them which are dry at low water and which on the outside rise abruptly from a deep sea on their insides they are separated from the continent by a channel or rather a succession of bays with an average depth of ten fathoms  the small headlands on the continent also have coralbanks attached to them and the querimba islands and banks are placed on the lines of prolongation of these headlands and are separated from them by very shallow channels  it is evident that whatever cause whether the drifting of sediment or subterranean movements produced the headlands likewise produced as might have been expected submarine prolongations to them and these towards their outer extremities have since afforded a favourable basis for the growth of coralreefs and subsequently for the formation of islets  as these reefs clearly belong to the fringing class the querimba islands have been coloured redmonabila 13 deg 32 s  in the plan of this

this line of coast are of coralformation but from their small size and lowness it is not possible from the charts to know whether they are truly fringed  hence this portion of coast is left uncoloured as are likewise those parts more northward of which no mention has been made in the foregoing pages from the want of information  persian gulf  from the charts lately published on a large scale by the east india company it appears that several parts especially the southern shores of this gulf are fringed by coralreefs but as the water is very shallow and as there are numerous sandbanks which are difficult to distinguish on the chart from reefs i have not coloured the upper part red  towards the mouth however where the water is rather deeper the islands of ormuz and larrack appear so regularly fringed that i have coloured them red  there are certainly no atolls in the persian gulf  the shores of immaum and of the promontory forming the southern headland of the persian gulf seem to be without reefs  the whole sw part except one or two small patches of arabia felix and the shores of socotra appear from the charts and memoir of captain haines geographical journal 1839 page 125 to be without any reefs  i believe there are no extensive coralreefs on any part of the coasts of india except on the low promontory of madura as already mentioned in front of ceylon  red sea  my information is chiefly derived from the admirable charts published by the east india company in 1836 from personal communication with captain moresby one of the surveyors and from the excellent memoir uber die natur der corallenbanken des rothen meeres by ehrenberg  the plains immediately bordering the red sea seem chiefly to consist of a sedimentary formation of the newer tertiary period  the shore is with the exception of a few parts fringed by coralreefs  the water is generally profoundly deep close to the shore but this fact which has attracted the attention of most voyagers seems to have no necessary connection with the presence of reefs for captain moresby particularly observed to me that in latitude 24 deg 10 on the eastern side there is a piece of coast with very deep water close to it without any reefs but not differing in other respects from the usual nature of the coastline  the most remarkable feature in the red sea is the chain of submerged banks reefs and islands lying some way from the shore chiefly on the eastern side the space within being deep enough to admit a safe navigation in small vessels  the banks are generally of an oval form and some miles in width but some of them are very long in proportion to their width  captain moresby informs me that any one who had not made actual plans of them would be apt to think that they were much more elongated than they really are  many of them rise to the surface but the greater number lie from five to thirty fathoms beneath it with irregular soundings on them  they consist of sand and living coral coral on most of them according to captain moresby covering the greater part of their surface  they extend parallel to the shore and they are not unfrequently connected in their middle parts by short transverse banks with the mainland  the sea is generally profoundly deep quite close to them as it is near most parts of the coast of the mainland but this is not universally the case for between latitude 15 deg and 17 deg the water deepens quite gradually from the banks both on the eastern and western shores towards the middle of the sea  islands in many parts arise from these banks they are low flattopped and consist of the same horizontally stratified formation with that forming the plainlike margin of the mainland  some of the smaller and lower islands consist of mere sand  captain moresby informs me that small masses of rock the remnants of islands are left on many banks where there is now no dry land ehrenberg also asserts that most of the islets even the lowest have a flat abraded basis composed of the same tertiary formation he believes that as soon as the surf wears down the protuberant parts of a bank just beneath the level of the sea the surface becomes protected from further abrasion by the growth of coral and he thus accounts for the existence of so many banks standing on a level with the surface of this sea  it appears that most of the islands are certainly decreasing in size  the form of the banks and islands is most singular in the part just referred to namely from latitude 15 deg to 17 deg where the sea deepens quite gradually the dhalac group on the western coast is surrounded by an intricate archipelago of islets and shoals the main island is very irregularly shaped and it includes a bay seven miles long by four across in which no bottom was found with 252 feet there is only one entrance into this bay half a mile wide and with an island in front of it  the submerged banks on the eastern coast within the same latitudes round farsan island are likewise penetrated by many narrow creeks of deep water one is twelve miles long in the form of a hatchet in which close to its broad upper end soundings were not struck with 360 feet and its entrance is only half a mile wide in another creek of the same nature but even with a more irregular outline there was no bottom with 480 feet the island of farsan itself has as singular a form as any of its surrounding banks  the bottom of the sea round the dhalac and farsan islands consists chiefly of sand and agglutinated fragments but in the deep and narrow creeks it consists of mud the islands themselves consist of thin horizontally stratified modern tertiary beds containing but little broken coral ruppell reise in abyssinie band i s 247 their shores are fringed by living coralreefs  from the account given by ruppell ibid s 245 of the manner in which dhalac has been rent by fissures the opposite sides of which have been unequally elevated in one instance to the amount of fifty feet it seems probable that its irregular form as well as probably that of farsan may have been partly caused by unequal elevations but considering the general form of the banks and of the deepwater creeks together with the composition of the land i think their configuration is more probably due in great part to strong currents having drifted sediment over an uneven bottom it is almost certain that their form cannot be attributed to the growth of coral  whatever may have been the precise origin of the dhalac and farsan archipelagoes the greater number of the banks on the eastern side of the red sea seem to have originated through nearly similar means i judge of this from their similarity in configuration in proof of which i may instance a bank on the east coast in latitude 22 deg and although it is true that the northern banks generally have a less complicated outline and from their similarity in composition as may be observed in their upraised portions  the depth within the banks northward of latitude 17 deg is usually greater and their outer sides shelve more abruptly circumstances which seem to go together than in the dhalac and farsan archipelagoes but this might easily have been caused by a difference in the action of the currents during their formation moreover the greater quantity of living coral which according to captain moresby exists on the northern banks would tend to give them steeper margins  from this account brief and imperfect as it is we can see that the great chain of banks on the eastern coast and on the western side in the southern portion differ greatly from true barrierreefs wholly formed by the growth of coral  it is indeed the direct conclusion of ehrenberg uber die etc pages 45 and 51 that they are connected in their origin quite secondarily with the growth of coral and he remarks that the islands off the coast of norway if worn down level with the sea and merely coated with living coral would present a nearly similar appearance i cannot however avoid suspecting from information given me by dr malcolmson and captain moresby that ehrenberg has rather underrated the influence of corals in some places at least on the formation of the tertiary deposits of the red sea  the west coast of the red sea between latitude 19 deg and 22 deg  there are in this space reefs which if i had known nothing of those in other parts of the red sea i should unhesitatingly have considered as barrierreefs and after deliberation i have come to the same conclusion one of these reefs in 20 deg 15 is twenty miles long less than a mile in width but expanding at the northern end into a disc slightly sinuous and extending parallel to the mainland at the distance of five miles from it with very deep water within in one spot soundings were not obtained with 205 fathoms  some leagues further south there is another linear reef very narrow ten miles long with other small portions of reef north and south almost connected with it and within this line of reefs as well as outside the water is profoundly deep  there are also some small linear and sickleformed reefs lying a little way out at sea  all these reefs are covered as i am informed by captain moresby by living corals  here then we have all the characters of reefs of the barrier class and in some outlying reefs we have an approach to the structure of atolls  the source of my doubts about the classification of these reefs arises from having observed in the dhalac and farsan groups the narrowness and straightness of several spits of sand and rock one of these spits in the dhalac group is nearly fifteen miles long only two broad and it is bordered on each side with deep water so that if worn down by the surf and coated with living corals it would form a reef nearly similar to those within the space under consideration  there is also in this space latitude 21 deg a peninsula bordered by cliffs with its extremity worn down to the level of the sea and its basis fringed with reefs in the line of prolongation of this peninsula there lies the island of macowa formed according to captain moresby of the usual tertiary deposit and some smaller islands large parts of which likewise appear to have been worn down and are now coated with living corals  if the removal of the strata in these several cases had been more complete the reefs thus formed would have nearly resembled those barrierlike ones now under discussion  notwithstanding these facts i cannot persuade myself that the many very small isolated and sickleformed reefs and others long nearly straight and very narrow with the water unfathomably deep close round them could possibly have been formed by corals merely coating banks of sediment or the abraded surfaces of irregularly shaped islands  i feel compelled to believe that the foundations of these reefs have subsided and that the corals during their upward growth have given to these reefs their present forms i may remark that the subsidence of narrow and irregularlyshaped peninsulas and islands such as those existing on the coasts of the red sea would afford the requisite foundations for the reefs in question  the west coast from latitude 22 deg to 24 deg  this part of the coast north of the space coloured blue on the map is fronted by an irregularly shelving bank from about ten to thirty fathoms deep numerous little reefs some of which have the most singular shapes rise from this bank  it may be observed respecting one of them in latitude 23 deg 10 that if the promontory in latitude 24 deg were worn down to the level of the sea and coated with corals a very similar and grotesquely formed reef would be produced  many of the reefs on this part of the coast may thus have originated but there are some sickle and almost atollformed reefs lying in deep water off the promontory in latitude 24 deg which lead me to suppose that all these reefs are more probably allied to the barrier or atoll classes  i have not however ventured to colour this portion of coast  on the west coast from latitude 19 deg to 17 deg south of space coloured blue on the map there are many low islets of very small dimensions not much elongated and rising out of great depths at a distance from the coast these cannot be classed either with atolls or barrier or fringingreefs  i may here remark that the outlying reefs on the west coast between latitude 19 deg and 24 deg are the only ones in the red sea which approach in structure to the true atolls of the indian and pacific oceans but they present only imperfect miniature likenesses of them  eastern coast  i have felt the greatest doubt about colouring any portion of this coast north of the fringingreefs round the farsan islands in 16 deg 10  there are many small outlying coralreefs along the whole line of coast but as the greater number rise from banks not very deeply submerged the formation of which has been shown to be only secondarily connected with the growth of coral their origin may be due simply to the growth of knolls of corals from an irregular foundation situated within a limited depth  but between latitude 18 deg and 20 deg there are so many linear elliptic and extremely small reefs rising abruptly out of profound depths that the same reasons which led me to colour blue a portion of the west coast have induced me to do the same in this part  there exist some small outlying reefs rising from deep water north of latitude 20 deg the northern limit coloured blue on the east coast but as they are not very numerous and scarcely any of them linear i have thought it right to leave them uncoloured  in the southern parts of the red sea considerable spaces of the mainland and of some of the dhalac islands are skirted by reefs which as i am informed by captain moresby are of living coral and have all the characters of the fringing class  as in these latitudes there are no outlying linear or sickleformed reefs rising out of unfathomable depths i have coloured these parts of the coast red  on similar grounds i have coloured red the northern parts of the western coast north of latitude 24 deg 30 and likewise the shores of the chief part of the gulf of suez in the gulf of acaba as i am informed by captain moresby there are no coralreefs and the water is profoundly deep  west indies  my information regarding the reefs of this area is derived from various sources and from an examination of numerous charts especially of those lately executed during the survey under captain owen rn  i lay under particular obligation to captain bird allen rn one of the members of the late survey for many personal communications on this subject  as in the case of the red sea it is necessary to make some preliminary remarks on the submerged banks of the west indies which are in some degree connected with coralreefs and cause considerable doubts in their classification  that large accumulations of sediment are in progress on the west indian shores will be evident to any one who examines the charts of that sea especially of the portion north of a line joining yucutan and florida  the area of deposition seems less intimately connected with the debouchement of the great rivers than with the course of the seacurrents as is evident from the vast extension of the banks from the promontories of yucutan and mosquito  besides the coastbanks there are many of various dimensions which stand quite isolated these closely resemble each other they lie from two or three to twenty or thirty fathoms under water and are composed of sand sometimes firmly agglutinated with little or no coral their surfaces are smooth and nearly level shelving only to the amount of a few fathoms very gradually all round towards their edges where they plunge abruptly into the unfathomable sea  this steep inclination of their sides which is likewise characteristic of the coastbanks is very remarkable i may give as an instance the misteriosa bank on the edges of which the soundings change in 250 fathoms horizontal distance from 11 to 210 fathoms off the northern point of the bank of old providence in 200 fathoms horizontal distance the change is from 19 to 152 fathoms off the great bahama bank in 160 fathoms horizontal distance the inclination is in many places from 10 fathoms to no bottom with 190 fathoms  on coasts in all parts of the world where sediment is accumulating something of this kind may be observed the banks shelve very gently far out to sea and then terminate abruptly  the form and composition of the banks standing in the middle parts of the w indian sea clearly show that their origin must be chiefly attributed to the accumulation of sediment and the only obvious explanation of their isolated position is the presence of a nucleus round which the currents have collected fine drift matter  any one who will compare the character of the bank surrounding the hilly island of old providence with those banks in its neighbourhood which stand isolated will scarcely doubt that they surround submerged mountains  we are led to the same conclusion by examining the bank called thunder knoll which is separated from the great mosquito bank by a channel only seven miles wide and 145 fathoms deep  there cannot be any doubt that the mosquito bank has been formed by the accumulation of sediment round the promontory of the same name and thunder knoll resembles the mosquito bank in the state of its surface submerged twenty fathoms in the inclinations of its sides in composition and in every other respect  i may observe although the remark is here irrelevant that geologists should be cautious in concluding that all the outlyers of any formation have once been connected together for we here see that deposits doubtless of exactly the same nature may be deposited with large valleylike spaces between them  linear strips of coralreefs and small knolls project from many of the isolated as well as coastbanks sometimes they occur quite irregularly placed as on the mosquito bank but more generally they form crescents on the windward side situated some little distance within the outer edge of the banksthus on the serranilla bank they form an interrupted chain which ranges between two and three miles within the windward margin generally they occur as on roncador courtown and anegada banks nearer the line of deep water  their occurrence on the windward side is conformable to the general rule of the efficient kinds of corals flourishing best where most exposed but their position some way within the line of deep water i cannot explain without it be that a depth somewhat less than that close to the outer margin of the banks is most favourable to their growth  where the corals have formed a nearly continuous rim close to the windward edge of a bank some fathoms submerged the reef closely resembles an atoll but if the bank surrounds an island as in the case of old providence the reef resembles an encircling barrierreef  i should undoubtedly have classed some of these fringed banks as imperfect atolls or barrierreefs if the sedimentary nature of their foundations had not been evident from the presence of other neighbouring banks of similar forms and of similar composition but without the crescentlike marginal reef in the third chapter i observed that probably some atolllike reefs did exist which had originated in the manner here supposed  proofs of elevation within recent tertiary periods abound as referred to in the sixth chapter over nearly the whole area of the west indies  hence it is easy to understand the origin of the low land on the coasts where sediment is now accumulating for instance on the northern part of yucutan and on the ne part of mosquito where the land is low and where extensive banks appear to be in progressive formation  hence also the origin of the great bahama banks which are bordered on their western and southern edges by very narrow long singularly shaped islands formed of sand shells and coralrock and some of them about a hundred feet in height is easily explained by the elevation of banks fringed on their windward western and southern sides by coralreefs  on this view however we must suppose either that the chief part of the surfaces of the great bahama sandbanks were all originally deeply submerged and were brought up to their present level by the same elevatory action which formed the linear islands or that during the elevation of the banks the superficial currents and swell of the waves continued wearing them down and keeping them at a nearly uniform level the level is not quite uniform for in proceeding from the nw end of the bahama group towards the se end the depth of the banks increases and the area of land decreases in a very gradual and remarkable manner  the latter view namely that these banks have been worn down by the currents and swell during their elevation seems to me the most probable one  it is also i believe applicable to many banks situated in widely distant parts of the west indian sea which are wholly submerged for on any other view we must suppose that the elevatory forces have acted with astonishing uniformity  the shores of the gulf of mexico for the space of many hundred miles is formed by a chain of lagoons from one to twenty miles in breadth columbian navigator page 178 etc containing either fresh or salt water and separated from the sea by linear strips of sand  great spaces of the shores of southern brazil in the london and edinburgh philosophical journal 1841 page 257 i have described a singular bar of sandstone lying parallel to the coast off pernambuco in brazil which probably is an analogous formation and of the united states from long island as observed by professor rogers to florida have the same character  professor rogers in his report to the british association volume iii page 13 speculates on the origin of these low sandy linear islets he states that the layers of which they are composed are too homogeneous and contain too large a proportion of shells to permit the common supposition of their formation being simply due to matter thrown up where it now lies by the surf he considers these islands as upheaved bars or shoals which were deposited in lines where opposed currents met it is evident that these islands and spits of sand parallel to the coast and separated from it by shallow lagoons have no necessary connection with coralformations  but in southern florida from the accounts i have received from persons who have resided there the upraised islands seem to be formed of strata containing a good deal of coral and they are extensively fringed by living reefs the channels within these islands are in some places between two and three miles wide and five or six fathoms deep though generally in the ordinary seacharts no lagoons appear on the coast of florida north of 26 deg but major whiting sillimans journal volume xxxv page 54 says that many are formed by sand thrown up along the whole line of coast from st augustines to jupiter inlet they are less in depth than width  after having seen how frequently banks of sediment in the west indian sea are fringed by reefs we can readily conceive that bars of sediment might be greatly aided in their formation along a line of coast by the growth of corals and such bars would in that case have a deceptive resemblance with true barrierreefs  having now endeavoured to remove some sources of doubt in classifying the reefs of the west indies i will give my authorities for colouring such portions of the coast as i have thought myself warranted in doing  captain bird allen informs me that most of the islands on the bahama banks are fringed especially on their windward sides with living reefs and hence i have coloured those which are thus represented in captain owens late chart red  the same officer informs me that the islands along the southern part of florida are similarly fringed coloured red  cuba proceeding along the northern coast at the distance of forty miles from the extreme se point the shores are fringed by reefs which extend westward for a space of 160 miles with only a few breaks  parts of these reefs are represented in the plans of the harbours on this coast by captain owen and an excellent description is given of them by mr taylor loudons mag of nat hist volume ix page 449 he states that they enclosed a space called the baxo from half to threequarters of a mile in width with a sandy bottom and a little coral  in most parts people can wade at low water to the reef but in some parts the depth is between two and three fathoms  close outside the reef the depth is between six and seven fathoms these wellcharacterised fringingreefs are coloured red westward of longitude 77 deg 30 on the northern side of cuba a great bank commences which extends along the coast for nearly four degrees of longitude  in the place of its commencement in its structure and in the cays or low islands on its edge there is a marked correspondence as observed by humboldt pers narr volume vii page 88 between it and the great bahama and sal banks which lie directly in front  hence one is led to attribute the same origin to both these sets of banks namely the accumulation of sediment conjoined with an elevatory movement and the growth of coral on their outward edges those parts which appear fringed by living reefs are coloured red  westward of these banks there is a portion of coast apparently without reefs except in the harbours the shores of which seem in the published plans to be fringed  the colorado shoals see captain owens charts and the low land at the western end of cuba correspond as closely in relative position and structure to the banks at the extreme point of florida as the banks above described on the north side of cuba do to the bahamas the depth within the islets and reefs on the outer edge of the colorados is generally between two and three fathoms increasing to twelve fathoms in the southern part where the bank becomes nearly open without islets or coralreefs the portions which are fringed are coloured red  the southern shore of cuba is deeply concave and the included space is filled up with mud and sandbanks low islands and coralreefs  between the mountainous isle of pines and the southern shore of cuba the general depth is only between two and three fathoms and in this part small islands formed of fragmentary rock and broken madrepores humboldt pers narr volume vii pages 51 86 to 90 291 309 320 rise abruptly and just reach the surface of the sea  from some expressions used in the columbian navigator volume i part ii page 94 it appears that considerable spaces along the outer coast of southern cuba are bounded by cliffs of coralrock formed probably by the upheaval of coralreefs and sandbanks  the charts represent the southern part of the isle of pines as fringed by reefs which the columb navig says extend some way from the coast but have only from nine to twelve feet water on them these are coloured redi have not been able to procure any detailed description of the large groups of banks and cays further eastward on the southern side of cuba within them there is a large expanse with a muddy bottom from eight to twelve fathoms deep although some parts of this line of coast are represented in the general charts of the west indies as fringed i have not thought it prudent to colour them the remaining portion of the south coast of cuba appears to be without coralreefs  yucutan  the ne part of the promontory appears in captain owens charts to be fringed coloured red  the eastern coast from 20 deg to 18 deg is fringed  south of latitude 18 deg there commences the most remarkable reef in the west indies it is about one hundred and thirty miles in length ranging in a n and s line at an average distance of fifteen miles from the coast  the islets on it are all low as i have been informed by captain b allen the water deepens suddenly on the outside of the reef but not more abruptly than off many of the sedimentary banks within its southern extremity off honduras the depth is twentyfive fathoms but in the more northern parts the depth soon increases to ten fathoms and within the northernmost part for a space of twenty miles the depth is only from one to two fathoms  in most of these respects we have the characteristics of a barrierreef nevertheless from observing first that the channel within the reef is a continuation of a great irregular bay which penetrates the mainland to the depth of fifty miles and secondly that considerable spaces of this barrierlike reef are described in the charts for instance in latitude 16 deg 45 and 16 deg 12 as formed of pure sand and thirdly from knowing that sediment is accumulating in many parts of the west indies in banks parallel to the shore i have not ventured to colour this reef as a barrier without further evidence that it has really been formed by the growth of corals and that it is not merely in parts a spit of sand and in other parts a worn down promontory partially coated and fringed by reefs i lean however to the probability of its being a barrierreef produced by subsidence  to add to my doubts immediately on the outside of this barrierlike reef turneffe lighthouse and glover reefs are situated and these reefs have so completely the form of atolls that if they had occurred in the pacific i should not have hesitated about colouring them blue  turneffe reef seems almost entirely filled up with low mud islets and the depth within the other two reefs is only from one to three fathoms from this circumstance and from their similarity in form structure and relative position both to the bank called northern triangles on which there is an islet between seventy and eighty feet and to cozumel island the level surface of which is likewise between seventy and eighty feet in height i consider it more probable that the three foregoing banks are the worn down bases of upheaved shoals fringed with corals than that they are true atolls wholly produced by the growth of coral during subsidence left uncoloured  in front of the eastern mosquito coast there are between latitude 12 deg and 16 deg some extensive banks already mentioned page 148 with high islands rising from their centres and there are other banks wholly submerged both of which kinds of banks are bordered near their windward margins by crescentshaped coralreefs  but it can hardly be doubted as was observed in the preliminary remarks that these banks owe their origin like the great bank extending from the mosquito promontory almost entirely to the accumulation of sediment and not to the growth of corals hence i have not coloured them  cayman island this island appears in the charts to be fringed and captain b allen informs me that the reefs extend about a mile from the shore and have only from five to twelve feet water within them coloured redjamaica judging from the charts about fifteen miles of the se extremity and about twice that length on the sw extremity and some portions on the s side near kingston and port royal are regularly fringed and therefore are coloured red  from the plans of some harbours on the n side of jamaica parts of the coast appear to be fringed but as these are not represented in the charts of the whole island i have not coloured themst domingo i have not been able to obtain sufficient information either from plans of the harbours or from general charts to enable me to colour any part of the coast except sixty miles from port de plata westward which seems very regularly fringed many other parts however of the coast are probably fringed especially towards the eastern end of the islandpuerto rico considerable portions of the southern western and eastern coasts and some parts of the northern coast appear in the charts to be fringed coloured redsome miles in length of the southern side of the island of st thomas is fringed most of the virgin gorda islands as i am informed by mr schomburgk are fringed the shores of anegada as well as the bank on which it stands are likewise fringed these islands have been coloured red  the greater part of the southern side of santa cruz appears in the danish survey to be fringed see also prof hoveys account of this island in sillimans journal volume xxxv page 74 the reefs extend along the shore for a considerable space and project rather more than a mile the depth within the reef is three fathoms coloured redthe antilles as remarked by von buch descrip iles canaries page 494 may be divided into two linear groups the western row being volcanic and the eastern of modern calcareous origin my information is very defective on the whole group  of the eastern islands barbuda and the western coasts of antigua and mariagalante appear to be fringed this is also the case with barbadoes as i have been informed by a resident these islands are coloured red  on the shores of the western antilles of volcanic origin very few coralreefs appear to exist  the island of martinique of which there are beautifully executed french charts on a very large scale alone presents any appearance worthy of special notice  the southwestern southern and eastern coasts together forming about half the circumference of the island are skirted by very irregular banks projecting generally rather less than a mile from the shore and lying from two to five fathoms submerged  in front of almost every valley they are breached by narrow crooked steepsided passages the french engineers ascertained by boring that these submerged banks consisted of madreporitic rocks which were covered in many parts by thin layers of mud or sand  from this fact and especially from the structure of the narrow breaches i think there can be little doubt that these banks once formed living reefs which fringed the shores of the island and like other reefs probably reached the surface  from some of these submerged banks reefs of living coral rise abruptly either in small detached patches or in lines parallel to but some way within the outer edges of the banks on which they are based  besides the above banks which skirt the shores of the island there is on the eastern side a range of linear banks similarly constituted twenty miles in length extending parallel to the coast line and separated from it by a space between two and four miles in width and from five to fifteen fathoms in depth  from this range of detached banks some linear reefs of living coral likewise rise abruptly and if they had been of greater length for they do not front more than a sixth part of the circumference of the island they would necessarily from their position have been coloured as barrierreefs as the case stands they are left uncoloured  i suspect that after a small amount of subsidence the corals were killed by sand and mud being deposited on them and the reefs being thus prevented from growing upwards the banks of madreporitic rock were left in their present submerged condition  the bermuda islands have been carefully described by lieutenant nelson in an excellent memoir in the geological transactions volume v part i page 103  in the form of the bank or reef on one side of which the islands stand there is a close general resemblance to an atoll but in the following respects there is a considerable differencefirst in the margin of the reef not forming as i have been informed by mr chaffers rn a flat solid surface laid bare at low water and regularly bounding the internal space of shallow water or lagoon secondly in the border of gradually shoaling water nearly a mile and a half in width which surrounds the entire outside of the reef as is laid down in captain hurds chart and thirdly in the size height and extraordinary form of the islands which present little resemblance to the long narrow simple islets seldom exceeding half a mile in breadth which surmount the annular reefs of almost all the atolls in the indian and pacific oceans  moreover there are evident proofs nelson ibid page 118 that islands similar to the existing ones formerly extended over other parts of the reef  it would i believe be difficult to find a true atoll with land exceeding thirty feet in height whereas mr nelson estimates the highest point of the bermuda islands to be 260 feet if however mr nelsons view that the whole of the land consists of sand drifted by the winds and agglutinated together were proved correct this difference would be immaterial but from his own account page 118 there occur in one place five or six layers of red earth interstratified with the ordinary calcareous rock and including stones too heavy for the wind to have moved without having at the same time utterly dispersed every grain of the accompanying drifted matter  mr nelson attributes the origin of these several layers with their embedded stones to as many violent catastrophes but further investigation in such cases has generally succeeded in explaining phenomena of this kind by ordinary and simpler means  finally i may remark that these islands have a considerable resemblance in shape to barbuda in the west indies and to pemba on the eastern coast of africa which latter island is about two hundred feet in height and consists of coralrock  i believe that the bermuda islands from being fringed by living reefs ought to have been coloured red but i have left them uncoloured on account of their general resemblance in external form to a lagoonisland or atoll   index  the names not in capitals are all names of places and refer exclusively to the appendix in welldefined archipelagoes or groups of
