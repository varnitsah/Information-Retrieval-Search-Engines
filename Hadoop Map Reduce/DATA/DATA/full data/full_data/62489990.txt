   the adventures of chatterer the red squirrel  i chatterer the red squirrel runs for his life   chatterer the red squirrel had been scolding because there was no excitement he had even tried to make some excitement by waking bobby coon and making him so angry that bobby had threatened to eat him alive it had been great fun to dance around and call bobby names and make fun of him oh yes it had been great fun you see he knew all the time that bobby couldnt catch him if he should try but now things were different chatterer had all the excitement that he wanted indeed he had more than he wanted the truth is chatterer was running for his life and he knew it  it is a terrible thing a very terrible thing to have to run for ones life peter rabbit knows all about it he has run for his life often sometimes it has been reddy fox behind him sometimes bowser the hound and once or twice old man coyote peter has known that on his long legs his life has depended and more than once a terrible fear has filled his heart but peter has also known that if he could reach the old stone wall or the dear old briarpatch first he would be safe and he always has reached it so when he has been running with that terrible fear in his heart there has always been hope there too  but chatterer the red squirrel was running without hope yes sir there was nothing but fear terrible fear in his heart for he knew not where to go the hollow tree or the holes in the old stone wall where he would be safe from any one else even farmer browns boy offered him no safety now for the one who was following him with hunger in his angerred eyes could go anywhere that he could gocould go into any hole big enough for him to squeeze into you see it was shadow the weasel from whom chatterer was running and shadow is so slim that he can slip in and out of places that even chatterer cannot get through  chatterer knew all this and so because it was of no use to run to his usual safe hiding places he ran in just the other direction he didnt know where he was going he had just one thought to run and run as long as he could and then well he would try to fight though he knew it would be of no use  oh dear oh dear he sobbed as he ran out on the branch of a tree and leaped across to the next tree i wish i had minded my own business i wish i had kept my tongue still shadow the weasel wouldnt have known where i was if he hadnt heard my voice oh dear oh dear me what can i do what can i do  now in his great fright chatterer had run and jumped so hard that he was beginning to grow very tired presently he found that he must make a very long jump to reach the next tree he had often made as long a jump as this and thought nothing of it but now he was so tired that the distance looked twice as great as it really was he didnt dare stop to run down the tree and scamper across so he took a long breath ran swiftly along the branch and leaped his hands just touched the tip of the nearest branch of the other tree he tried his very best to hold on but he couldnt then down down down he fell he spread himself out as flat as he could and that saved him a little but still it was a dreadful fall and when he landed it seemed for just a minute as if all the breath was gone from his body but it wasnt quite and in another minute he was scrambling up the tree     ii chatterers last chance   chatterer still running for his life and without the least hope suddenly saw a last chance to escape from shadow the weasel that is he saw something that might offer him a chance he couldnt be sure until he had tried and even then he might escape from one danger only to run right into another equally great what chatterer saw was a big brown bunch near the top of a tall chestnuttree and he headed for that tree as fast as ever he could go what was that big brown bunch why it was redtail the hawk who was dozing there with his head drawn down between his shoulders dreaming  now old redtail is one of chatterers deadliest enemies he is quite as fond of red squirrel as is shadow the weasel though he doesnt often try to catch one because there are other things to eat much easier to get chatterer had had more than one narrow escape from old redtail and was very much afraid of him yet here he was running up the very tree in which redtail was sitting you see a very daring idea had come into his head he had seen at once that redtail was dozing and hadnt seen him at all he knew that redtail would just as soon have shadow the weasel for dinner as himself and a very daring plan had popped into his head  i may as well be caught by redtail as shadow he thought as he ran up the tree but if my plan works out right i wont be caught by either anyway it is my very last chance  up the tree he scrambled and after him went shadow the weasel shadow had been so intent on catching chatterer that he had not noticed old redtail which was just as chatterer had hoped up up he scrambled straight past old redtail but as he passed he pulled one of redtails long tail feathers and then ran on to the top of the tree and with the last bit of strength he had left leaped to a neighboring sprucetree where hidden by the thick branches he stopped to rest and see what would happen  of course when he felt his tail pulled old redtail was wide awake in a flash and of course he looked down to see who had dared to pull his tail there just below him was shadow the weasel who had just that minute discovered who was sitting there old redtail hissed sharply and the feathers on the top of his head stood up in a way they do when he is angry and he was angryvery angry  shadow the weasel stopped short then like a flash he dodged around to the other side of the tree he had no thought of chatterer now things were changed all in an instant quite changed instead of the hunter he was now the hunted old redtail circled in the air just overhead and every time he caught sight of shadow he swooped at him with great cruel claws spread to clutch him shadow dodged around the trunk of the tree he was more angry than frightened for his sharp eyes had spied a little hollow in a branch of the chestnuttree and he knew that once inside of that he would have nothing to fear but he was angry clear through to think that he should be cheated out of that dinner he had been so sure of only a few minutes before so he screeched angrily at old redtail and then watching his chance scampered out to the hollow and whisked inside just in the nick of time  chatterer watching from the sprucetree gave a great sigh of relief he saw redtail the hawk post himself on the top of a tall tree where he could keep watch of that hollow in which shadow had disappeared and he knew that it would be a long time before shadow would dare poke even his nose outside then as soon as he was rested chatterer stole softly oh so softly away through the treetops until he was sure that redtail could not see him then he hurried he wanted to get just as far away from shadow the weasel as he could     iii chatterer tells sammy jay about shadow the weasel   chatterer hurried through the green forest he didnt know just where he was going he had but one thought and that was to get as far away from shadow the weasel as he could it made him have cold shivers all over every time he thought of shadow  seems to me you are in a great hurry said a voice from a pinetree he was passing  chatterer knew that voice without looking to see who was speaking everybody in the green forest knows that voice it was the voice of sammy jay  it looks to me as if you were running away from some one jeered sammy  chatterer wanted to stop and pick a quarrel with sammy as he usually did when they met but the fear of shadow the weasel was still upon him  iiam he said in a very low voice  sammy looked as if he thought he hadnt heard right never before had he known chatterer to admit that he was afraid for you know chatterer is a great boaster it must be something very serious to frighten chatterer like that  whats that sammy asked sharply i always knew you to be a coward but this is the first time i have ever known you to admit it who are you running away from  illustration whats that sammy asked sharply  shadow the weasel replied chatterer still in a very low voice as if he were afraid of being overheard shadow the weasel is back in the green forest and i have just had such a narrow escape  ho cried sammy this is important i thought shadow was up in the old pasture if he has come back to the green forest folks ought to know it where is he now  chatterer stopped and told sammy all about his narrow escape and how he had left shadow the weasel in a hollow of a chestnuttree with redtail the hawk watching for him to come out sammys eyes sparkled when chatterer told how he had pulled the tail of old redtail and he doesnt know now who did it he thinks it was shadow concluded chatterer with a weak little grin  ho ho ho ha ha ha laughed sammy jay i wish i had been there to see it  then he suddenly grew grave other folks certainly ought to know that shadow is back in the green forest said he so that they may be on their guard then if they get caught it is their own fault i think ill go spread the news you see for all his mean ways sammy jay does have some good in him just as everybody does and he dearly loves to tell important news  ii wish you would go first of all and tell my cousin happy jack the gray squirrel said chatterer speaking in a hesitating way  sammy jay leaned over and looked at chatterer sharply i thought you and happy jack were not friends said he you always seem to be quarreling  chatterer looked a little confused but he is very quick with his tongue is chatterer thats just it he replied quickly thats just it if anything should happen to happy jack i wouldnt have him to quarrel with and it is such fun to see him get mad  now of course the real reason why chatterer wanted happy jack warned was because down inside he was ashamed of a dreadful thought that had come to him of leading shadow the weasel to happy jacks house so that he himself might escape it had been a dreadful thought a cowardly thought and chatterer had been really ashamed that he should have ever had such a thought he thought now that if he could do something for happy jack he would feel better about it  sammy jay promised to go straight to happy jack and warn him that shadow the weasel was back in the green forest and off he started screaming the news as he flew so that all the little people in the green forest might know chatterer listened a few minutes and then started on  where shall i go he muttered where shall i go i dont dare stay in the green forest for now shadow will never rest until he catches me     iv chatterer leaves the green forest   chatterer was in a peck of trouble yes sir he was in a peck of trouble there was no doubt about it oh dear oh dear if only i had kept my tongue still if only i had kept my tongue still he kept saying over and over to himself as he hurried through the green forest you see chatterer was just beginning to realize what a lot of trouble an unruly tongue can get one into here it was cold weather the very edge of winter and chatterer didnt dare stay in the green forest where he had always made his home his storehouses were full of nuts and seeds and corn enough and more than enough to keep him in comfort all winter and now he must turn his back on them and go he didnt know where and all because of his mean disposition and bad tongue  if he hadnt called bobby coon names that morning at the top of his voice shadow the weasel might not have found him he knew that shadow has a long memory and that he would never forget the trick by which chatterer had escaped and so the only way chatterer would ever be able to have a moments peace would be to leave the green forest for as long as shadow the weasel chose to stay there chatterer shivered inside his warm red fur coat as he thought of the long cold winter and how hard it would be to find enough to eat was ever any one else in such a dreadful fix  presently he came to the edge of the green forest he sat down to rest in the top of a tree where he could look off over the green meadows far far away he could see the purple hills behind which jolly round red mr sun goes to bed every night he could see the old stone wall that separates farmer browns cornfield from the green meadows he could see farmer browns house and barn and near them the old orchard where johnny chuck had spent the summer with polly chuck and their baby chucks he knew every nook and corner in the old stone wall and many times he had been to the old orchard it was there that he had stolen the eggs of drummer the woodpecker he grinned at the thought of those eggs and how he had stolen them and then he shivered as he remembered how he had finally been caught and how sharp the bills of drummer and mrs drummer were  but all that was in the past and thinking about it wasnt going to help him now he had got to do something right away perhaps he might find a place to live in the old stone wall and there might there just might be enough grains of corn scattered over the ground of the cornfield for him to lay up a supply if he worked very hard and fast anyway he would have a look so he hurried down from the tree and out along the old stone wall his spirits began to rise as he whisked along peering into every hole and jumping from stone to stone it really seemed as though he might find a snug home somewhere here then he remembered something that made his heart sink again he remembered having seen shadow the weasel more than once exploring that very wall just as likely as not he would do it again for it was so very near the green forest no the old stone wall wouldnt do  just then along came peter rabbit peter saw right away that something was wrong with chatterer and he wanted to know what it was chatterer told him he felt that he had just got to tell some one peter looked thoughtful he scratched his long left ear with his long right hind foot  you know there is another old stone wall up there by the old orchard said he it is pretty near farmer browns house and black pussy hunts there a great deal but you ought to be smart enough to keep out of her clutches  i should hope so exclaimed chatterer scornfully i have never seen a cat yet that i was afraid of believe ill go over and have a look at that old wall peter rabbit  ill go with you said peter and off they started together     v chatterer finds a home       when your plans are upset and all scattered about     just make up your mind that youll find a way out  peter rabbit went straight over to the old stone wall on the edge of the old orchard lippertylippertylip so fast that it didnt take him long to get there but chatterer the red squirrel never feels really safe on the ground unless there is something to climb close at hand so he went a long way round by way of the rail fence he always did like to run along a rail fence and he wouldnt have minded it a bit this morning if he hadnt been in such a hurry it seemed to him that he never would get there but of course he did  when he did get there he found peter rabbit sitting on johnny chucks doorstep staring down johnny chucks long hall theyre asleep said he as chatterer came up all out of breath ive thumped and thumped and thumped but it isnt the least bit of use they are asleep and theyll stay asleep until mistress spring arrives i cant understand it at all no sir i cant understand how anybody can be willing to miss this splendid cold weather  peter shook his head in a puzzled way and continued to stare down the long empty hall of course he was talking about johnny and polly chuck who had gone to sleep for the winter that sleeping business always puzzles peter it seems to him like a terrible waste of time but chatterer had too much on his mind to waste time wondering how other people could sleep all winter he couldnt himself and now that he had been driven away from his own home in the green forest by fear of shadow the weasel he couldnt waste a minute he must find a new home and then spend every minute of daytime laying up a new store of food for the days when everything would be covered with snow  up and down the length of the stone wall he scampered looking for a place to make a home but nothing suited him you know he likes best to make his home in a tree he isnt like striped chipmunk who lives in the ground poor chatterer he just couldnt see how he was going to live in the old stone wall he sat on top of a big stone to rest and think it over he was discouraged life didnt seem worth the living just then he felt as if his heart had gone way down to his toes just then his eyes saw something that made his heart come up again with a great bound right where it ought to be and just then peter rabbit came hopping along  have you found a new home yet asked peter  yes replied chatterer i think i have  thats good replied peter i was sure you would find one over here where is it  illustration have you found a new home yet asked peter  chatterer opened his mouth to tell peter and then closed it with a snap he remembered just in time how hard it is for peter to keep a secret if he should tell peter it would be just like peter to tell some one else without meaning to and then it might get back to shadow the weasel  im not going to tell you now peter rabbit said he you see i dont want anybody to know where it is until i am sure that it will do but ill tell you this much he added as he saw how disappointed peter looked im going to live right here  peter brightened up right away you see he thought that of course chatterer meant that he had found a hole in the old stone wall and he felt very sure that he could find it by keeping watch thats good he said again ill come see you often but watch out for black pussy her claws are very sharp now i think ill be going back to the old briarpatch  dont tell where i am called chatterer     vi peter rabbit listens to the wrong voice   peter rabbit didnt play fair no sir peter didnt play fair people who have too much curiosity about other peoples affairs seldom do play fair he didnt mean to be unfair oh my no peter didnt mean to be unfair when he left chatterer the red squirrel sitting on the old stone wall on the edge of farmer browns old orchard he intended to go straight home to the dear old briarpatch he was a little disappointed was peter that chatterer hadnt told him just where his new house was not that it really mattered he just wanted to know that was all with every jump away from the old stone wall that desire to know just where chatterers new house was seemed to grow peter stopped and looked back he couldnt see chatterer now because the bushes hid him and if he couldnt see chatterer why of course chatterer couldnt see him  peter sat down and began to pull his whiskers in a way he has when he is trying to decide something it seemed as if two little voices were quarreling inside him go along home like the good fellow you are and mind your own business said one steal back to the old wall and watch chatterer and so find out just where his new house is hell never know anything about it and therell be no harm done said the other little voice it was louder than the first voice and peter liked the sound of it  i believe i will said he and without waiting to hear what the first little voice would say to that he turned about and very carefully and softly tiptoed back to the old stone wall right near it was a thick little bush it seemed to peter that it must have grown there just to give him a hiding place he crawled under it and lay very flat he could see along the old stone wall in both directions chatterer was sitting just where he had left him he was looking in the direction that peter had gone when he had said goodby peter chuckled to himself hes waiting to make sure i have gone before he goes to that new house of his thought peter this is the time ill fool him  you ought to be ashamed of yourself peter rabbit this is none of your business said that little small voice  youre not doing a bit of harm chatterer has no business to try to keep his new house a secret anyway said the other little voice inside and because of his dreadful curiosity peter liked the sound of that voice best and listened to it and after a while the first voice grew discouraged and stopped  chatterer sat where he was for what seemed to peter a very long time but by and by he gave a sudden funny little flirt of his tail and ran along the old wall a little way then with a hasty look around he disappeared in a hole a minute later he popped his head out for another look around and then disappeared again he did this two or three times as if anxious  peter chuckled to himself thats his new house right there said he to himself and now that i know where it is i think ill hurry along home to the dear old briarpatch he was just getting ready to start when chatterer popped out of his hole and sat up on a big stone he was talking out loud and peter listened then his long ears began to burn for this is what he heard      im glad that peters not a spy       for spies are hateful as can be     its dreadful how some people try       affairs of other folks to see  chatterer whisked out of sight and peter hurried to get away his ears still burned and somehow he didnt feel so tickled over the thought that he had discovered chatterers secret as he had thought he would and over in the hole in the old stone wall chatterer the red squirrel was laughing as if there was some great joke there was and the joke was on peter rabbit you see he hadnt discovered chatterers new house at all     vii how chatterer had fooled peter rabbit   chatterer the red squirrel is a scamp himself and not to be trusted nobody in the green forest or on the green meadows trusts him and people who cannot be trusted themselves never trust any one else chatterer never does he is always suspicious so when peter rabbit had said goodby and started for the dear old briarpatch without knowing where chatterers new house was chatterer had made up his mind right away that peter would never be satisfied until he knew or thought he knew where that new house was you see he knew all about peters dreadful curiosity  he watched peter out of sight then he slipped down out of sight himself between the stones of the old wall i know what peter will do said he to himself peter will come sneaking back and hide where he can watch me and so find out where my new house is ill just stay here long enough to give him a chance to hide and then ill fool him  you see chatterer knew that if he had been in peters place he would have done just that thing so he waited a little while and then went back to the place where peter had left him there he sat and pretended to be looking in the direction in which peter had gone as if to make sure that peter was really on his way home but all the time chatterer was watching out of the corners of his eyes to see if peter was hiding anywhere near he didnt see peter but he didnt have the least doubt that peter was somewhere about  after a while he ran over to a hole between the stones of the old wall and pretended to be very busy there just as if it really were the new house he had found he kept popping in and out and looking around as if afraid that some one was watching him he even got some dry leaves and took them inside as if to make a bed all the time although he hadnt seen a sign of peter he didnt have the least doubt in the world that peter was watching him when he grew tired a new idea popped into his shrewd little head he popped out of the hole and sat up on the wall then he said aloud that verse which had made peters ears burn so he had meant to make peters ears burn he said that verse just as if he really did believe that peter was not spying on him and was glad of it when he had finished he whisked out of sight again to give peter a chance to get away but this time chatterer did some peeking himself he hid where peter couldnt see him but where he himself could see both ways along the old stone wall and so it was that he saw peter crawl out from under the little bush where he had been hiding and sneak away in the direction of the old briarpatch and he knew that this time peter had gone for good  then chatterer laughed and laughed to think how he had fooled peter rabbit and wished that he could pat himself on the back for being so smart he didnt once think of how dishonest and mean it was of peter to spy on him because you see he would have done the same thing himself one has to have ones wits very sharp these days to keep a secret chuckled chatterer  but over in the old briarpatch that afternoon peter rabbit sat very thoughtful and very much ashamed the thought that he had found out where chatterers new house was didnt give him the pleasure that he had thought it would his ears still burned for he thought that chatterer supposed him honest when he wasnt  i believe ill go over tomorrow and tell chatterer all about it and how mean i have been said he at last and when he had made up his mind to do this he felt better  and all the time he hadnt found chatterers new house at all you see it was the old home of drummer the woodpecker in an old appletree which chatterer had decided to live in     viii chatterer grows careless       when you grow careless even though       it be in matters small     old mr trouble you will find       is bound to make a call  some people never seem to learn that you would suppose that after all the trouble and worry chatterer the red squirrel had had he would have learned a lesson for a while it seemed as if he had morning after morning before anybody was up in farmer browns house he visited farmer browns corncrib taking the greatest care not to be seen and to get back to his home in the old orchard before it was time for farmer browns boy to come out and do his mornings work and in the corncrib he took the greatest care to steal only where what he took would not be missed the empty cobs from which he had eaten the corn he hid in the darkest corner behind the great pile of yellow corn where they would not be found until nearly all the corn had been taken from the crib oh he was very sly and crafty was chatterer the red squirrelat first  but after a while when nothing happened chatterer grew careless at first it had seemed very dangerous to go over to the corncrib but after he had been there often it didnt seem dangerous at all once inside he would just give himself up to having a good time he raced about over the great pile of beautiful yellow corn and found the loveliest hiding places in it down in a dark corner he made a splendid bed from pieces of husk which hadnt been stripped from some of the ears it was quite the nicest place he had ever dreamed of was farmer browns corncrib he got to feeling that it was his own and not farmer browns at all  the more that feeling grew the more careless chatterer became he dropped a grain of corn now and then and was too lazy to go down and pick it up or else didnt think anything about it farmer browns boy coming every morning for corn for the hens noticed these grains but supposed they were some that had been rubbed from the ears during the handling of them then one morning chatterer dropped a cob from which he had eaten all the corn he meant to get it and hide it as he had hidden other cobs but he didnt want to do it just then and laterwell then he forgot all about it yes sir he forgot all about it until he had reached his home in the old orchard  oh well thought chatterer it doesnt matter i can get it and hide it tomorrow morning  now a corncob is a very simple thing farmer browns boy knew where there was a whole pile of them he added to that pile every day after shelling enough corn for the biddies so it would seem that there was nothing about a corncob to make him open his eyes as he did that morning when he saw the one left by chatterer the red squirrel but you see he knew that a bare corncob had no business inside the corncrib and suddenly those scattered grains of corn had a new meaning for him  ha ha he exclaimed a thief has been here after all i thought we were safe from rats and mice and i dont see now how they got in for i dont i really dont see how they could climb the stone legs of the corncrib but some one with sharp teeth certainly has been in here it must be that i have left the door open some time and a rat has slipped in ill just have to get after you mr rat or mr mouse we cant have you in our corncrib  with that he went into the house presently he came back and in one hand was a rattrap and in the other a mousetrap     ix chatterer grows too curious   everybody knows how curious peter rabbit is he is forever poking his wobbly little nose in where it has no business to be and as a result peter is forever getting into trouble whenever chatterer the red squirrel has heard a new story about peter and the scrapes his curiosity has got him into chatterer has said that peter got no more than he deserved as for himself he might be curious about a thing he saw for the first time but he had too much sense to meddle with it until he knew all about it so chatterer has come to be thought very smart quite too smart to be caught in a trapat least to be caught in an ordinary trap  now a great many people manage to make their neighbors think they are a great deal smarter than they really are and chatterer is one of this kind if some of his neighbors could have peeped into farmer browns corncrib the morning after farmer browns boy found the telltale corncob so carelessly dropped by chatterer they would have been surprised yes sir they would have been surprised they would have seen chatterer the red squirrel the boaster he of the sharp wits showing quite as much curiosity as ever possessed peter rabbit  chatterer had come over to the corncrib as usual to get his daily supply of corn as usual he had raced about over the great pile of yellow corn quite suddenly his sharp eyes spied something that they hadnt seen before it was down on the floor of the corncrib quite near the door chatterer was sure that it hadnt been there the day before it was a very queer looking thing very queer indeed and then he spied another queer looking thing near it only this was very much smaller what could they be he looked at them suspiciously they looked harmless enough they didnt move he ran a few steps towards them and scolded just as he scolds at anything new he finds out of doors still they didnt move he ran around on a little ledge where he could look right down on the queer things he was sure now that they were not alive the biggest one he could see all through inside was something to eat the littlest thing was round and flat with funny bits of wire on top it looked as if it were made of wood and in the sides were little round holes too small for him to put his head through  leave them alone said a small voice inside of chatterer  but i want to see what they are and find out all about them said chatterer  no good ever comes of meddling with things you dont know about said the small voice  but they are such queer looking things and theyre not alive they cant hurt me said chatterer  nevertheless he ran back to the pile of corn and tried to eat somehow he had lost his appetite he couldnt take his eyes off those two queer things down on the floor  better keep away warned the small voice inside  it wont do any harm to have a closer look at them said chatterer  so once more he scrambled down from the pile of corn and little by little drew nearer to the two queer things the nearer he got the more harmless they looked finally he reached out and smelled of the smallest then he turned up his nose  smells of mice muttered chatterer just common barn mice then he reached out a paw and touched it pooh said he its nothing to be afraid of just then he touched one of the little wires and there was a sudden snap it frightened chatterer so that he scurried away but he couldnt stay away that snap was such a funny thing and it hadnt done any harm you see he hadnt put his paw in at one of the little holes or it might have done some harm  pretty soon he was back again meddling with those little wires on top every once in a while there would be a snap and he would scamper away it was very scary and great fun by and by the thing wouldnt snap any more and then chatterer grew tired of his queer plaything and began to wonder about the other queer thing no harm had come from the first one and so he was sure no harm could come from the other     x old mr trouble gets chatterer at last   of course you have guessed what it was that chatterer had been meddling with it was a mousetrap and he had sprung it without getting hurt chatterer didnt know that it was a trap he ought to have known but he didnt you see it was not at all like the traps farmer browns boy had sometimes set for him in the green forest he knew all about those traps and never never went near them now that there was nothing more exciting about the mousetrap chatterer turned his attention to the other queer thing he walked all around it and looked at it from every side it certainly was queer yes sir it certainly was queer it looked something like a little house only he could see all through it he put one paw out and touched it nothing happened he tried it again then he jumped right on top of it still nothing happened he tried his sharp teeth on it but he couldnt bite it you see it was made of stout wire  inside was something that looked good to eat it smelled good too chatterer began to wonder what it would taste like the more he wondered the more he wanted to know there must be some way of getting in and if he could get in of course he could get out again he jumped down to the floor and ran all around the queer little wire house at each end was a sort of little wire hallway chatterer stuck his head in one it seemed perfectly safe he crept a little way in and then backed out in a hurry nothing happened he tried it again still nothing happened  better keep away said a small voice down inside of him  pooh whos afraid said chatterer this thing cant hurt me  then he crept a little farther in right in front of him was a little round doorway with a little wire door chatterer pushed the little door with his nose and it opened a teeny weeny bit he drew back suspiciously then he tried it again and this time pushed the little door a little farther open he did this two or three times until finally he had his head quite inside and there right down below him was that food he so wanted to taste  i can hop right down and get it and then hop right up again thought chatterer  dont do it said the small voice inside corn is plenty good enough besides it is time you were getting back to the old orchard  it wont take but a minute said chatterer and i really must know what that tastes like  with that he jumped down snap chatterer looked up the little wire door had closed old mr trouble had got chatterer at last yes sir he certainly had got chatterer this time you see he couldnt open that little wire door from the inside he was in a trapthe wire rattrap set by farmer browns boy     xi what happened next to chatterer   were you ever terribly terribly frightened that was the way chatterer felt he was caught there was no doubt about it his sharp teeth were of no use at all on those hard wires he could look out between them but he couldnt get out he was too frightened to think his heart pounded against his sides until it hurt he forgot all about that queer food he had so wanted to taste and which was right before him now indeed he felt as if he never never would want to eat again what was going to happen to him now what would farmer browns boy do to him when he found him there  hark what was that it was a step just outside the door of the corncrib farmer browns boy was coming chatterer raced around his little wire prison and bit savagely at the hard wires but it was of no use no use at all it only hurt his mouth cruelly then the door of the corncrib swung open a flood of light poured in and with it came farmer browns boy  hello exclaimed farmer browns boy as he caught sight of chatterer so you are the thief who has been stealing our corn and i thought it was a rat or a mouse well well you little red rascal didnt you know that thieves come to no good end youre pretty smart for i never once thought of you but you were not so smart as you thought now i wonder what we had better do with you  he picked up the trap with chatterer in it and stepped out into the beautiful great outofdoors chatterer could see across the dooryard to the old orchard and the familiar old stone wall along which he had scampered so often they looked just the same as ever and yetwell they didnt look just the same for he couldnt look at them without seeing those cruel wires which were keeping him from them  farmer browns boy put the trap down on the ground and then began to call puss puss puss called farmer browns boy chatterers heart which had been thumping so almost stopped beating with fright there was black pussy whom he had so often teased and made fun of her yellow eyes had a hungry gleam as she walked around the trap and sniffed and sniffed never had chatterer heard such a terrible sound as those hungry sniffs so close to him black pussy tried to put a paw between the wires and chatterer saw the great cruel claws but black pussy couldnt get her paw between the wires  how would you like him for breakfast asked farmer browns boy  meow said black pussy arching her back and rubbing against his legs  i suppose that means that you would like him very much laughed farmer browns boy do you think you can catch him if i let him out  meow replied black pussy again and to poor chatterer it seemed the awfullest sound he ever had heard  well well see about it by and by said farmer browns boy theres the breakfast bell and i havent fed the biddies yet     xii chatterer is sure that this is his last day   there was no hope not the teeniest weeniest ray of hope in the heart of chatterer as farmer browns boy picked up the wire rattrap and started for the house black pussy the cat following at his heels and looking up at chatterer with cruel hungry eyes chatterer took a farewell look at the old orchard and way beyond it the green forest from which he had been driven by fear of shadow the weasel then the door of the farmhouse closed and shut it all out if there had been any hope in chatterers heart the closing of that door would have shut the last bit out but there wasnt any hope chatterer was sure that he was to be given to black pussy for her breakfast  farmer browns boy put the trap on a table what have you there called a great voice it was the voice of farmer brown himself who was eating his breakfast  ive got the thief who has been stealing our corn in the crib replied farmer browns boy and who do you think it is  one of those pesky rats replied farmer brown im afraid youve been careless and left the door open some time and that is how the rats have got in there  but it isnt a rat and i dont believe that there is a rat there replied farmer browns boy in triumph its that little scamp of a red squirrel weve seen racing along the wall at the edge of the old orchard lately i cant imagine how he got in there but there he was and now here he is  what are you going to do with him asked farmer brown coming over to look at chatterer  i dont know replied farmer browns boy unless i give him to black puss for her breakfast she has been teasing me for him ever since i found him  farmer browns boy looked over to the other side of the table as he said this and his eyes twinkled with mischief  oh you mustnt do that that would be cruel cried a soft voice you must take him down to the green forest and let him go a gentle face with pitying eyes was bent above the trap just see how frightened the poor little thing is you must take him straight down to the green forest right after breakfast  isnt that just like mother cried farmer browns boy i believe it would be just the same with the ugliest old rat that ever lived she would try to think of some excuse for letting it go  god made all the little people who wear fur and they must have some place in his great plan said mrs brown  farmer brown laughed a big hearty laugh true enough mother said he the trouble is they get out of place now this little rascals place is down in the green forest and not up in our corncrib  then put him back in his right place was the prompt reply and they all laughed  now all this time poor chatterer was thinking that this surely was his last day you see he knew that he had been a thief and he knew that farmer browns boy knew it he just crouched down in a little ball too miserable to do anything but tremble every time any one came near he was sure that he had seen for the last time the green forest and the green meadows and jolly mr sun and all the other beautiful things he loved so and it seemed as if his heart would burst with despair     xiii chatterer is put in prison       who ever does a deed thats wrong       will surely find some day     that for that naughty act of his       hell surely have to pay  that was the way with chatterer of course he had had no business to steal corn from farmer browns corncrib to be sure he had felt that he had just as much right to that corn as farmer brown had you see the little people of the green meadows and the green forest feel that everything that grows belongs to them if they want it and are smart enough to get it before some one else does but it is just there that chatterer went wrong farmer brown had harvested that corn and stored it in his corncrib and so of course no one else had any right to it right down deep in his heart chatterer knew this if he hadnt known it he wouldnt have been so sly in taking what he wanted he knew all the time that he was stealing but he tried to make himself believe that it was all right so he had kept on stealing and stealing until at last he was caught in a trap and now he had got to pay for his wrongdoing  chatterer was very miserable so miserable and frightened that he could do nothing but sit huddled up in a little shivery ball he hadnt the least doubt in the world that this was his very last day and that farmer browns boy would turn him over to cruel black pussy for her breakfast farmer browns boy had left him in the trap in the house and had gone out for a long time chatterer could hear pounding out in the woodshed and farmer browns boy was whistling as he pounded chatterer wondered how he could whistle and seem so happy when he meant to do such a dreadful thing as to give him to black pussy after what seemed a very long time ages and ages farmer browns boy came back he had with him a queer looking box  there said he is a new home for you you little red imp i guess it will keep you out of trouble for a while  he slid back a little door in the top of the box and then putting on a stout glove and opening a little door in the trap he put in his big hand and closed it around chatterer  poor little chatterer he was sure now that this was the end and that he was to be given to black pussy who was looking on with hungry yellow eyes he struggled and did his best to bite but the thick glove gave his sharp little teeth no chance to hurt the hand that held him even in his terror he noticed that that big hand tried to be gentle and squeezed him no tighter than was necessary then he was lifted out of the trap and dropped through the little doorway in the top of the queer box and the door was fastened nothing terrible had happened after all  at first chatterer just sulked in one corner he still felt sure that something terrible was going to happen farmer browns boy took the box out into the shed and put it where the sun shone into it for a little while he stayed watching but chatterer still sulked and sulked by and by he went away taking black pussy with him and chatterer was alone  when he was quite sure that no one was about chatterer began to wonder what sort of a place he was in and if there wasnt some way to get out he found that one side and the top were of fine stout wire through which he could look out and that the other sides and the bottom were of wood covered with wire so that there was no chance for his sharp teeth to gnaw a way out in one corner was a stout piece of an appletree with two little stubby branches to sit on and half way up a little round hole very cautiously chatterer peeped inside the hole inside was a splendid hollow on the floor of the box was a little heap of shavings and bits of rag and there was a little pile of yellow corn how chatterer did hate the sight of that corn you see it was corn that had got him into all this trouble at least that is the way chatterer felt about it when he had examined everything he knew that there was no way out chatterer was in a prison though that is not what farmer browns boy called it he said it was a cage  illustration very cautiously chatterer peeped inside the hole     xiv chatterer decides to live   at first chatterer decided that he had rather die than live in a prison no matter how nice that prison might be it was a very foolish thing to do but he made up his mind that he just wouldnt eat he wouldnt touch that nice yellow corn farmer browns boy had put in his prison for him he would starve himself to death yes sir he would starve himself to death so when he found that there was no way to get out of his prison he curled up in the little hollow stump in his prison where no one could see him and made up his mind that he would stay there until he died life wasnt worth living if he had got to spend all the rest of his days in a prison he wouldnt even make himself comfortable there was that little heap of nice shavings and bits of rag for him to make a nice comfortable bed of but he didnt touch them no sir he just tried to make himself miserable  not once that long day did he poke so much as the tip of his nose out of his little round doorway ever so many times farmer browns boy came to see him and whistled and called softly to him but chatterer didnt make a sound at last night came and the woodshed where his prison was grew dark and darker and very still now it was about this time that chatterers stomach began to make itself felt chatterer tried not to notice it but his stomach would be noticed and chatterer couldnt help himself his stomach was empty and it kept telling him so  im going to starve to death said chatterer to himself over and over  im empty and there is plenty of food to fill me up if youll only stop being silly whispered his stomach  the more chatterer tried not to think of how good something to eat would taste the more he did think of it it made him restless and uneasy he twisted and squirmed and turned at last he decided that he would have one more look to see if he couldnt find some way to get out of his prison he poked his head out of the little round doorway all was still and dark he listened but not a sound could he hear then he softly crept out and hurriedly examined all the inside of his prison once more it was of no use there wasnt a single place where he could use his sharp teeth  theres that little pile of corn waiting for me whispered his stomach  ill never touch it said chatterer fiercely  just then he hit something with his foot and it rolled he picked it up and then put it down again it was a nut a plump hickory nut two or three times he picked it up and put it down and each time it was harder than before to put it down  iiid like to taste one more nut before i starve to death muttered chatterer and almost without knowing it he began to gnaw the hard shell when that nut was finished he found another and when that was gone still another then he just had to taste a grain of corn the first thing chatterer knew the nuts and the corn were all gone and his stomach was full somehow he felt ever so much better he didnt feel like starving to death now  ii believe ill wait a bit and see what happens said he to himself and while im waiting i may as well be comfortable  with that he began to carry the shavings and rags into the hollow stump and soon had as comfortable a bed as ever he had slept on chatterer had decided to live     xv farmer browns boy tries to make friends       nobody lives whos wholly bad       some good youll find in every heart     your enemies will be your friends       if only you will do your part  all his life chatterer the red squirrel had looked on farmer browns boy as his enemy just as did all the other little people of the green meadows the green forest and the smiling pool they feared him and because they feared him they hated him so whenever he came near they ran away now at first farmer browns boy used to run after them for just one thingbecause he wanted to make friends with them and he couldnt see how ever he was going to do it unless he caught them after a while when he found that he couldnt catch them by running after them he made up his mind that they didnt want to be his friends and so then he began to hunt them because he thought it was fun to try to outwit them of course when he began to do that they hated him and feared him all the more you see they didnt understand that really he had one of the kindest hearts in the world and he didnt understand that they hated him just because they didnt know him  so when chatterer had been caught in the trap in farmer browns corncrib he hadnt doubted in the least that farmer browns boy would give him to black pussy or do something equally cruel and even when he found that he was only to be kept a prisoner in a very comfortable prison with plenty to eat and drink he wasnt willing to believe any good of farmer browns boy indeed he hated him more than ever if that were possible  but farmer browns boy was very patient he came to chatterers prison ever so many times a day and whistled and clucked and talked to chatterer and he brought good things to eat it seemed as if he were all the time trying to think of some new treat for chatterer he never came without bringing something at first chatterer would hide in his hollow stump as soon as he saw farmer browns boy coming and wouldnt so much as peek out until he had gone away when he was sure that the way was clear he would come out again and always he found some delicious fat nuts or some other dainty waiting for him after a little as soon as he saw farmer browns boy coming chatterer would begin to wonder what good thing he had brought this time and would grow terribly impatient for farmer browns boy to go away so that he could find out  by and by it got so that he couldnt wait but would slyly peep out of his little round doorway to see what had been brought for him then one day farmer browns boy didnt come at all chatterer tried to make himself believe that he was glad he told himself that he hated farmer browns boy and he hoped that he never never would see him again but all the time he knew that it wasnt true it was the longest day since chatterer had been a prisoner early the next morning before chatterer was out of bed he heard a step in the woodshed and before he thought what he was doing he was out of his hollow stump to see if it really was farmer browns boy it was and he had three great fat nuts which he dropped into chatterers cage it seemed to chatterer that he just couldnt wait for farmer browns boy to go away finally he darted forward and seized one then he scampered to the shelter of his hollow stump to eat it when it was finished he just had to have another farmer browns boy was still watching but somehow chatterer didnt feel so much afraid this time he sat up on one of the little branches of the stump and ate it in plain sight farmer browns boy smiled and it was a pleasant smile  i believe we shall be friends after all said he     xvi chatterer has a pleasant surprise   chatterer the red squirrel the mischief maker of the green forest had never been more comfortable in his life no matter how rough brother north wind roared across the green meadows and through the green forest piling the snow in great drifts he couldnt send so much as one tiny shiver through the little red coat of chatterer and always right at hand was plenty to eatcorn and nuts and other good things such as chatterer loves no he never had been so comfortable in all his life but he wasnt happy not truly happy you see he was in prison and no matter how nice a prison may be no one can be truly happy there  since he had been a prisoner chatterer had learned to think very differently of farmer browns boy from what he used to think in fact he and farmer browns boy had become very good friends for farmer browns boy was always very gentle and always brought him something good to eat  he isnt at all like what i had thought said chatterer and if i were free i wouldnt be afraid of him at all iid like to tell some of the other little green forest people about him if only  chatterer didnt finish instead a great lump filled his throat you see he was thinking of the green forest and the old orchard and how he used to race through the treetops and along the stone wall half the fun in life had been in running and jumping and now there wasnt room in this little prison to stretch his legs if only he could runrun as hard as ever he knew howonce in a while he felt that his prison wouldnt be quite so hard to put up with  that very afternoon while chatterer was taking a nap in his bed in the hollow stump something was slipped over his little round doorway and chatterer awoke in a terrible fright to find himself a prisoner inside his hollow stump there was nothing he could do about it but just lie there in his bed and shake with fright and wonder what dreadful thing was going to happen next he could hear farmer browns boy very busy about something in his cage after a long long time his little round doorway let in the light once more the door had been opened at first chatterer didnt dare go out but he heard the soft little whistle with which farmer browns boy always called him when he had something especially nice for him to eat so at last he peeped out there on the floor of the cage were some of the nicest nuts chatterer came out at once then his sharp eyes discovered something else it was a queer looking thing made of wire at one end of his cage  chatterer looked at it with great suspicion could it be a new kind of trap but what would a trap be doing there when he was already a prisoner he ate all the nuts all the time watching this new queer looking thing it seemed harmless enough he went a little nearer finally he hopped into it it moved of course that frightened him and he started to run up but he didnt go up no sir he didnt go up you see he was in a wire wheel and as he ran the wheel went around chatterer was terribly frightened and the faster he tried to run the faster the wheel went around finally he had to stop because he was out of breath and too tired to run another step when he stopped the wheel stopped  little by little chatterer began to understand farmer browns boy had made that wheel to give him a chance to run all he wanted to and whenever he wanted to when he understood this chatterer was as nearly happy as he could be in a prison it was such a pleasant surprise he would race and race in it until he just had to stop for breath farmer browns boy looked on and laughed to see how much happier he had made chatterer     xvii sammy jays sharp eyes   everybody knows that sammy jay has sharp eyes in fact there are very few of the little forest people whose eyes are as sharp as sammys that is because he uses them so much a long time ago he found out that the more he used his eyes the sharper they became and so there are very few minutes when sammy is awake that he isnt trying to see something he is always looking that is the reason he always knows so much about what is going on in the green forest and on the green meadows  now of course chatterer the red squirrel couldnt disappear without being missed particularly by sammy jay and of course sammy couldnt miss chatterer and not wonder what had become of him at first sammy thought that chatterer was hiding but after peeking and peering and watching in the old orchard for a few days he was forced to think that either chatterer had once more moved or else that something had happened to him  perhaps shadow the weasel has caught him after all thought sammy and straightway flew to a certain place in the green forest where he might find shadow the weasel sure enough shadow was there now of course it wouldnt do to ask right out if shadow had caught chatterer and sammy was smart enough to know it  illustration you tell chatterer that ill get him yet snarled shadow  chatterer the red squirrel sends his respects and hopes you are enjoying your hunt for him called sammy  shadow looked up at sammy and anger blazed in his little red eyes you tell chatterer that ill get him yet snarled shadow  sammys eyes sparkled with mischief he had made shadow angry and he had found out what he wanted to know he was sure that shadow had not caught chatterer  but what can have become of him thought sammy ive got no love for him but just the same i miss him i really must find out yes sir i really must  so every minute that he could spare sammy jay spent trying to find chatterer he asked every one he met if they had seen chatterer he peeked and peered into every hollow and hiding place he could think of but look as he would and ask as he would he could find no trace of chatterer at last he happened to think of farmer browns corncrib could it be that chatterer had moved over there or had come to some dreadful end there very early the next morning sammy flew over to the corncrib he looked it all over with his sharp eyes and listened for sounds of chatterer inside but not a sound could he hear then he remembered the hole under the edge of the roof through which chatterer used to go in and out sammy hurried to look at it it was closed by a stout board nailed across it then sammy knew that farmer browns boy had found it  hes killed chatterer thats what hes done cried sammy and flew over to the old orchard filled with sad thoughts he meant to wait until farmer browns boy came out and then tell him what he thought of him after that he would fly through the green forest and over the green meadows to spread the sad news  after a while the door of the farmhouse opened and farmer browns boy stepped out sammy had his mouth open to scream when his sharp eyes saw something queer farmer browns boy had a queer looking box in his arms which he put on a shelf where the sun would shine on it it looked to sammy as if something moved inside that box he forgot to scream and say the bad things he had planned to say he waited until farmer browns boy had gone to the barn then sammy flew where he could look right into the queer box there was chatterer the red squirrel     xviii chatterer is made fun of   ha ha ha ho ho ho smarty caught at last sammy jay fairly shrieked with glee as he peered down from the top of an appletree at chatterer in the cage farmer browns boy had made for him sammy was so relieved to think that chatterer was not dead and he was so tickled to think that chatterer who always thought himself so smart should have been caught that he just had to torment chatterer by laughing at him and saying mean things to him until chatterer lost his temper and said things back quite in the old way this tickled sammy more than ever for it sounded so exactly like chatterer when he had been a free little imp of mischief in the green forest that sammy felt sure that chatterer had nothing the matter with him  but he couldnt stop very long to make fun of poor chatterer in the first place farmer browns boy had put his head out the barn door to see what all the fuss was about in the second place sammy fairly ached all over to spread the news through the green forest and over the green meadows you know he is a great gossip and this was such unusual news sammy knew very well that no one would believe him he knew that they just couldnt believe that smart mr chatterer had really been caught and no one did believe it  all right sammy would reply it doesnt make the least bit of difference in the world to me whether you believe it or not you can go up to farmer browns house and see him in prison yourself just as i did  so late that afternoon when all was quiet around the farmyard chatterer saw something very familiar behind the old stone wall at the edge of the old orchard it bobbed up and then dropped out of sight again then it bobbed up again only to drop out of sight just as quickly  it looks to me very much as if peter rabbit is over there and feeling very nervous said chatterer to himself and then he called sharply just as when he was free in the green forest right away peters head bobbed up for all the world like a jackinthebox and this time it stayed up peters eyes were round with surprise as he stared across at chatterers prison  oh its true gasped peter as if it were as hard work to believe his own eyes as it was to believe sammy jay i must go right away and see what can be done to get chatterer out of trouble and then because it was broad daylight and he really didnt dare stay another minute peter waved goodby to chatterer and started for the green forest as fast as his long legs could take him  a little later who should appear peeping over the stone wall but reddy fox it seemed very bold of reddy but really it wasnt nearly as bold as it seemed you see reddy knew that farmer browns boy and bowser the hound were over in the old pasture and that he had nothing to fear he grinned at chatterer in the most provoking way it made chatterer angry just to see him      smarty smarty mr smarty     glad to see you looking hearty     weathers fine as you can see     wont you take a walk with me  so said reddy fox knowing all the time that chatterer couldnt take a walk with any one at first chatterer scolded and called reddy all the bad names he could think of but after a little he didnt feel so much like scolding in fact he didnt half hear the mean things reddy fox said to him you see it was coming over him more and more that nothing could take the place of freedom he had a comfortable home plenty to eat and was safe from every harm but he was a prisoner and having these visitors made him realize it more than ever something very like tears filled his eyes and he crept into his hollow stump where he couldnt see or be seen     xix peter rabbit tries to help   peter rabbit is one of the kindest hearted little people of the green forest or the green meadows he is happygolucky and his dreadful curiosity is forever getting him into all kinds of trouble perhaps it is because he has been in so many scrapes himself that he always feels sorry for others who get into trouble anyway no sooner does peter hear of some one in trouble than he begins to wonder how he can help them so just as soon as he found out for himself that sammy jay had told the truth about chatterer the red squirrel and that chatterer really was in a prison at farmer browns house he began to think and think to find some way to help chatterer  now of course peter didnt know what kind of a prison chatterer was in he remembered right away how prickly porky the porcupine had gnawed a great hole in the box in which johnny chucks lost baby was kept by farmer browns boy why shouldnt prickly porky do as much for chatterer he would go see him at once the trouble with peter is that he doesnt think of all sides of a question he is impulsive that is he goes right ahead and does the thing that comes into his head first and sometimes this isnt the wisest or best thing to do so now he scampered down into the green forest as fast as his long legs would carry him to hunt for prickly porky it was no trouble at all to find him for he had only to follow the line of trees that had been stripped of their bark  good afternoon prickly porky have you heard the news about chatterer said peter talking very fast for he was quite out of breath  yes replied prickly porky serves him right i hope it will teach him a lesson  peters heart sank dont you think it is dreadful he asked just think he will never never be able to run and play in the green forest again unless we can get him out  so much the better grunted prickly porky so much the better he always was a nuisance never did see such a fellow for making trouble for other people no sir i never did the rest of us can have some peace now serves him right prickly porky went on chewing bark as if chatterers trouble was no concern of his  peters heart sank lower still he scratched one long ear slowly with a long hind foot which is a way he has when he is thinking very hard he was so busy thinking that he didnt see the twinkle in the dull little eyes of prickly porky who really was not so hardhearted as his words sounded after a long time during which peter thought and thought and prickly porky ate and ate the latter spoke again  what have you got on your mind peter he asked  ii was just thinking how perfectly splendid it would be if you would go up there and gnaw a way out of his prison for chatterer replied peter timidly  huh grunted prickly porky huh some folks think my wits are pretty slow but even i know better than that put on your thinking cap again peter rabbit  why cant you you are not afraid of bowser the hound or farmer browns boy and everybody else is excepting jimmy skunk persisted peter  for the very good reason that if i could gnaw into his prison chatterer could gnaw out if he cant gnaw his way out with those sharp teeth of his i certainly cant gnaw in wheres your common sense peter rabbit  thats so i hadnt thought of that replied peter slowly and sorrowfully i must try to think of some other way to help chatterer  id be willing to try if it was of any use but it isnt said prickly porky who didnt want peter to think that he really was as hardhearted as he had seemed at first  illustration id be willing to try it if it was of any use but it isnt said prickly porky  so peter bade prickly porky goodby and started for the dear old briarpatch to try to think of some other way to help chatterer on the way he waked up unc billy possum and bobby coon but they couldnt give him any help there really doesnt seem to be any way i can help sighed peter and there really wasnt     xx chatterer has another great surprise   chatterer had never had so many surprisesgood surprisesin all his life as since the day he had been caught in a trap in farmer browns corncrib in the first place it had been a great surprise to him that he had not been given to black pussy as he had fully expected to be then had come the even greater surprise of finding that farmer browns boy was ever and ever so much nicer than he had thought a later surprise had been the wire wheel in his cage so that he could run to his hearts content it was such a pleasant and wholly unexpected surprise that it had quite changed chatterers feelings towards farmer browns boy  the fact is chatterer could have been truly happy but for one thinghe was a prisoner yes sir he was a prisoner and he couldnt forget it for one minute while he was awake he used to watch farmer browns boy and wish with all his might that he could make him understand how dreadful it was to be in a prison but farmer browns boy couldnt understand what chatterer said no matter how hard chatterer tried to make him he seemed to think that chatterer was happy he just didnt understand that not all the good things in the world could make up for loss of freedomthat it is better to be free though hungry and cold than in a prison with every comfort  chatterer had stood it pretty well and made the best of things until sammy jay had found him and reddy fox had made fun of him and peter rabbit had peeped at him from behind the old stone wall the very sight of them going where they pleased and when they pleased had been too much for chatterer and such a great longing for the green forest and the old orchard filled his heart that he could think of nothing else he just sat in a corner of his cage and looked as miserable as he felt he lost his appetite in vain farmer browns boy brought him the fattest nuts and other dainties he couldnt eat for the great longing for freedom that filled his heart until it seemed ready to burst he no longer cared to run in the new wire wheel which had given him so much pleasure at first he was homesick terribly homesick and he just couldnt help it  farmer browns boy noticed it and his face grew sober and thoughtful he watched chatterer when the latter didnt know that he was about and if he couldnt understand chatterers talk he could understand chatterers actions he knew that he was unhappy and guessed why one morning chatterer did not come out of his hollow stump as he usually did when his cage was placed on the shelf outside the farmhouse door he just didnt feel like it he stayed curled up in his bed for a long long time too sad and miserable to move at last he crawled up and peeped out of his little round doorway chatterer gave a little gasp and rubbed his eyes was he dreaming he scrambled out in a hurry and peeped through the wires of his cage then he rubbed his eyes again and rushed over to the other side of the cage for another look his cage wasnt on the usual shelf at all it was on the snowcovered stone wall at the edge of the old orchard  chatterer was so excited he didnt know what to do he raced around the cage then he jumped into the wire wheel and made it spin round and round as never before when he was too tired to run any more he jumped out and right then he discovered something he hadnt noticed before the little door in the top of his cage was open it must be that farmer browns boy had forgotten to close it when he put in chatterers breakfast chatterer forgot that he was tired like a little red flash he was outside and whisking along the snowcovered stone wall straight for his home in the old orchard  chickaree chickaree chickaree he shouted as he ran     xxi chatterer hears the small voice   the very first of the little meadow and forest people to see chatterer after he had safely reached the old orchard was tommy tit the chickadee it just happened that tommy was very busy in the very appletree in which was the old home of drummer the woodpecker when chatterer reached it you know chatterer had moved into it for the winter just a little while before he had been caught in the corncrib by farmer browns boy  yes sir tommy was very busy indeed he was so busy that sharp as his bright little eyes are he had not seen chatterer racing along the snowcovered old stone wall it wasnt until he heard chatterers claws on the trunk of the appletree that tommy saw him at all then he was so surprised that he lost his balance and almost turned a somersault in the air before he caught another twig you see he knew all about chatterer and how he had been kept a prisoner by farmer browns boy  why whyee is this really you chatterer he exclaimed however did you get out of your prison im glad ever and ever so glad that you got away  chatterer flirted his tail in the saucy way he has and his eyes twinkled here was just the best chance ever to boast and brag he could tell tommy tit how smart he had beensmart enough to get away from farmer browns boy tommy tit would tell the other little people and then everybody would think him just as smart as unc billy possum and you know unc billy really was smart enough to get away from farmer browns boy after being caught everybody knew that he had been a prisoner and now that he was free everybody would believe whatever he told them about how he got away was there ever such a chance to make his friends and neighbors say what a smart fellow he is  ii chatterer stopped then he began again you see it was this way ii somehow chatterer couldnt say what he had meant to say it seemed as if tommy tits bright merry eyes were looking right into his head and heart and could see his very thoughts of course they couldnt the truth is that little small voice inside which chatterer had so often refused to listen to when he was tempted to do wrong was talking again it was saying for shame chatterer for shame tell the truth tell the truth it was that little small voice that made chatterer hesitate and stop  you dont mean to say that you were smart enough to fool farmer browns boy and get out of that stout little prison he made for you do you asked tommy tit  no replied chatterer almost before he thought no i didnt the fact is tommy tit he left the door open purposely he let me go farmer browns boy isnt half so bad as some people think  dee dee dee laughed tommy tit ive been telling a lot of you fellows that for a long time but none of you would believe me now i guess you know it why im not the least bit afraid of farmer browns boynot the least little bit in the world if all the little forest and meadow people would only trust him instead of running away from him he would be the very best friend we have  perhaps so replied chatterer doubtfully he was very good to me while i was in his prison andand im not so very much afraid of him now just the same i dont mean to let him get hands on me again  pooh said tommy tit pooh id just as soon eat out of his hand  thats all very well for you to say when you are flying around free but i dont believe you dare go up to his house and prove it retorted chatterer  cant now replied tommy ive got too much to do for him right now but some day ill show you dee dee dee chickadee im wasting my time talking when there is such a lot to be done i am clearing his appletrees of insect eggs  ha ha ha go it you little red scamp shouted a voice behind him  then chatterer knew that farmer browns boy had not left the little door open by mistake but had given him his freedom and right then he knew that they were going to be the best of friends     xxii tommy tit makes good his boast   dee dee dee chickadee see me see me tommy tit the chickadee kept saying this over and over as he flew from the green forest up through the old orchard on his way to farmer browns dooryard and his voice was merry in fact his voice was the merriest cheeriest sound to be heard that bright snapping cold morning to be sure there were other voices but they were not merry nor were they cheery there was the voice of sammy jay but it sounded peevish and discontented and there was the voice of blacky the crow but it sounded harsh and unpleasant and there was the voice of chatterer the red squirrel but chatterer was scolding just from habit and his voice was not pleasant to hear  so every one who heard tommy tits cheery voice that cold winter morning just had to smile yes sir they just had to smile even sammy jay and blacky the crow they just couldnt help themselves when tommy reached the stone wall that separated the old orchard from farmer browns dooryard his sharp eyes were not long in finding peter rabbit and happy jack the gray squirrel and chatterer hiding in the old wall where they could peep out and see all that happened in farmer browns dooryard looking back through the old orchard he saw what looked like a little bit of the blue blue sky flitting silently from tree to tree it was sammy jay over in the very top of a tall mapletree a long way off was a spot of black tommy didnt need to be told that it was blacky the crow who didnt dare come any nearer  tommy fairly bubbled over with joy he knew what it all meant he knew that peter rabbit and happy jack and chatterer and sammy jay and blacky the crow had come to see him make good his boast to chatterer that he would eat from the hand of farmer browns boy and that not one of them really believed that he would do it he tickled all over and cut up all sorts of capers just for pure joy finally he flew over to the mapletree that grows close by farmer browns house  dee dee dee chickadee see me see me called tommy tit and his voice sounded cheerier than ever and merrier than ever  then the door of farmer browns house opened and out stepped farmer browns boy and looked up at tommy tit and the look in his eyes was gentle and good to see he pursed up his lips and from them came the softest sweetest whistle and it sounded like phoebe  peter rabbit pinched himself to be sure that he was awake for it was tommy tits own love note and if peter had not been looking straight at farmer browns boy he would have been sure that it was tommy himself who had whistled  phoebe whistled farmer browns boy again  phoebe replied tommy tit and it was hard to say which whistle was the softest and sweetest  phoebe whistled farmer browns boy once more and held out his hand in it was a cracked hickory nut  dee dee dee see me see me cried tommy tit and flitted down from the mapletree right on to the hand of farmer browns boy and his bright little eyes twinkled merrily as he helped himself to a bit of nut meat  peter rabbit looked at happy jack and happy jack looked at chatterer and all three acted as if they couldnt believe their own eyes then they looked back at farmer browns boy and there on his head sat tommy tit  dee dee dee chickadee see me see me called tommy tit and his voice was merrier than ever for he had made good his boast     xxiii chatterer grows very very bold   im not afraid i am afraid im not afraid i am afraid im not afraid  chatterer kept saying these two things over and over and over again to himself you see he really was afraid and he was trying to make himself believe that he wasnt afraid he thought that perhaps if he said ever and ever so many times that he wasnt afraid he might actually make himself believe it the trouble was that every time he said it a little voice a little truthful voice down inside seemed to speak right up and tell him that he was afraid  poor chatterer it hurt his pride to have to own to himself that he wasnt as brave as little tommy tit the chickadee his common sense told him that there was no reason in the world why he shouldnt be tommy tit went every day and took food from the hand of farmer browns boy it seemed to chatterer and to happy jack the gray squirrel and to peter rabbit and to sammy jay and to blacky the crow all of whom had seen him do it as if it were the very bravest thing they ever had seen and their respect for tommy tit grew wonderfully  but tommy tit himself didnt think it brave at all no sir tommy knew better you see he has a great deal of common sense under the little black cap he wears  it may have been brave of me to do it the first time thought he to himself when the others told him how brave they thought him but it isnt brave of me now because i know that no harm is going to come to me from farmer browns boy there isnt any bravery about it and it might be just the same way with chatterer and all the other little forest and meadow people if only they would think so and give farmer browns boy half a chance  chatterer was beginning to have some such thoughts himself as he tried to make himself think that he wasnt afraid he heard the door of farmer browns house slam and peeped out from the old stone wall there was farmer browns boy with a big fat hickory nut held out in the most tempting way and farmer browns boy was whistling the same gentle little whistle he had used when chatterer was his prisoner and he had brought good things for chatterer to eat of course chatterer knew perfectly well that that whistle was a call for him and that that big fat hickory nut was intended for him almost before he thought he had left the old stone wall and was half way over to farmer browns boy then he stopped short it seemed as if that little voice inside had fairly shouted in his ears i am afraid  it was true he was afraid he was right on the very point of turning to scurry back to the old stone wall when he heard another voice this time it wasnt a voice inside no indeed it was a voice from the top of one of the appletrees in the old orchard and this is what it said  coward coward coward  it was sammy jay speaking  now it is one thing to tell yourself that you are afraid and it is quite another thing to be told by some one else that you are afraid  no such thing no such thing im not afraid scolded chatterer and then to prove it he suddenly raced forward snatched the fat hickory nut from the hand of farmer browns boy and was back in the old stone wall it was hard to tell which was the most surprisedchatterer himself farmer browns boy or sammy jay  i did it i did it i did it boasted chatterer  you dont dare do it again though said sammy jay in the most provoking and unpleasant way  i do too snapped chatterer and he did it and with the taking of that second fat nut from the hand of farmer browns boy the very last bit of fear of him left chatterer and he knew that tommy tit the chickadee had been right all the time when he insisted that there was nothing to fear from farmer browns boy  why thought chatterer if i would have let him he would have been my friend long ago and so he would have  and this is all about chatterer the red squirrel for now sammy jay insists that it is his turn now and so the next book will be about his adventures   the end
