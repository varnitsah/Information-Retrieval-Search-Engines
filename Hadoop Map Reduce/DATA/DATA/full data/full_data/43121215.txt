43121215	after dark  by wilkie collins     preface to after dark  i have taken some pains to string together the various stories contained in this volume on a single thread of interest which so far as i know has at least the merit of not having been used before  the pages entitled leahs diary are however intended to fulfill another purpose besides that of serving as the framework for my collection of tales in this part of the book and subsequently in the prologues to the stories it has been my object to give the reader one more glimpse at that artistlife which circumstances have afforded me peculiar opportunities of studying and which i have already tried to represent under another aspect in my fiction hideandseek this time i wish to ask some sympathy for the joys and sorrows of a poor traveling portraitpainterpresented from his wifes point of view in leahs diary and supposed to be briefly and simply narrated by himself in the prologues to the stories i have purposely kept these two portions of the book within certain limits only giving in the one case as much as the wife might naturally write in her diary at intervals of household leisure and in the other as much as a modest and sensible man would be likely to say about himself and about the characters he met with in his wanderings if i have been so fortunate as to make my idea intelligible by this brief and simple mode of treatment and if i have at the same time achieved the necessary object of gathering several separate stories together as neatlyfitting parts of one complete whole i shall have succeeded in a design which i have for some time past been very anxious creditably to fulfill  of the tales themselves taken individually i have only to say by way of necessary explanation that the lady of glenwith grange is now offered to the reader for the first time and that the other stories have appeared in the columns of household words my best thanks are due to mr charles dickens for his kindness in allowing me to set them in their present framework  i must also gratefully acknowledge an obligation of another kind to the accomplished artist mr w s herrick to whom i am indebted for the curious and interesting facts on which the tales of the terribly strange bed and the yellow mask are founded  although the statement may appear somewhat superfluous to those who know me it may not be out of place to add in conclusion that these stories are entirely of my own imagining constructing and writing the fact that the events of some of my tales occur on foreign ground and are acted out by foreign personages appears to have suggested in some quarters the inference that the stories themselves might be of foreign origin let me once for all assure any readers who may honor me with their attention that in this and in all other cases they may depend on the genuineness of my literary offspring the little children of my brain may be weakly enough and may be sadly in want of a helping hand to aid them in their first attempts at walking on the stage of this great world but at any rate they are not borrowed children the members of my own literary family are indeed increasing so fast as to render the very idea of borrowing quite out of the question and to suggest serious apprehension that i may not have done adding to the large bookpopulation on my own sole responsibility even yet     after dark    leaves from leahs diary  26th february 1827the doctor has just called for the third time to examine my husbands eyes thank god there is no fear at present of my poor william losing his sight provided he can be prevailed on to attend rigidly to the medical instructions for preserving it these instructions which forbid him to exercise his profession for the next six months at least are in our case very hard to follow they will but too probably sentence us to poverty perhaps to actual want but they must be borne resignedly and even thankfully seeing that my husbands forced cessation from work will save him from the dreadful affliction of loss of sight i think i can answer for my own cheerfulness and endurance now that we know the worst can i answer for our children also surely i can when there are only two of them it is a sad confession to make but now for the first time since my marriage i feel thankful that we have no more  17tha dread came over me last night after i had comforted william as well as i could about the future and had heard him fall off to sleep that the doctor had not told us the worst medical men do sometimes deceive their patients from what has always seemed to me to be misdirected kindness of heart the mere suspicion that i had been trifled with on the subject of my husbands illness caused me such uneasiness that i made an excuse to get out and went in secret to the doctor fortunately i found him at home and in three words i confessed to him the object of my visit  he smiled and said i might make myself easy he had told us the worst  and that worst i said to make certain is that for the next six months my husband must allow his eyes to have the most perfect repose  exactly the doctor answered mind i dont say that he may not dispense with his green shade indoors for an hour or two at a time as the inflammation gets subdued but i do most positively repeat that he must not employ his eyes he must not touch a brush or pencil he must not think of taking another likeness on any consideration whatever for the next six months his persisting in finishing those two portraits at the time when his eyes first began to fail was the real cause of all the bad symptoms that we have had to combat ever since i warned him if you remember mrs kerby when he first came to practice in our neighborhood  i know you did sir i replied but what was a poor traveling portraitpainter like my husband who lives by taking likenesses first in one place and then in another to do our bread depended on his using his eyes at the very time when you warned him to let them have a rest  have you no other resources no money but the money mr kerby can get by portraitpainting asked the doctor  none i answered with a sinking at my heart as i thought of his bill for medical attendance  will you pardon me he said coloring and looking a little uneasy or rather will you ascribe it to the friendly interest i feel in you if i ask whether mr kerby realizes a comfortable income by the practice of his profession dont he went on anxiously before i could replypray dont think i make this inquiry from a motive of impertinent curiosity  i felt quite satisfied that he could have no improper motive for asking the question and so answered it at once plainly and truly  my husband makes but a small income i said famous london portraitpainters get great prices from their sitters but poor unknown artists who only travel about the country are obliged to work hard and be contented with very small gains after we have paid all that we owe here i am afraid we shall have little enough left to retire on when we take refuge in some cheaper place  in that case said the good doctor i am so glad and proud to remember that i always liked him from the first in that case dont make yourself anxious about my bill when you are thinking of clearing off your debts here i can afford to wait till mr kerbys eyes are well again and i shall then ask him for a likeness of my little daughter by that arrangement we are sure to be both quits and both perfectly satisfied  he considerately shook hands and bade me farewell before i could say half the grateful words to him that were on my lips never never shall i forget that he relieved me of my two heaviest anxieties at the most anxious time of my life the merciful warmhearted man i could almost have knelt down and kissed his doorstep as i crossed it on my way home  18thif i had not resolved after what happened yesterday to look only at the cheerful side of things for the future the events of today would have robbed me of all my courage at the very outset of our troubles first there was the casting up of our bills and the discovery when the amount of them was balanced against all the money we have saved up that we shall only have between three and four pounds left in the cashbox after we have got out of debt then there was the sad necessity of writing letters in my husbands name to the rich people who were ready to employ him telling them of the affliction that had overtaken him and of the impossibility of his executing their orders for portraits for the next six months to come and lastly there was the heartbreaking business for me to go through of giving our landlord warning just as we had got comfortably settled in our new abode if william could only have gone on with his work we might have stopped in this town and in these clean comfortable lodgings for at least three or four months we have never had the use of a nice empty garret before for the children to play in and i never met with any landlady so pleasant to deal with in the kitchen as the landlady here and now we must leave all this comfort and happiness and goi hardly know where william in his bitterness says to the workhouse but that shall never be if i have to go out to service to prevent it the darkness is coming on and we must save in candles or i could write much more ah me what a day this has been i have had but one pleasant moment since it began and that was in the morning when i set my little emily to work on a bead purse for the kind doctors daughter my child young as she is is wonderfully neathanded at stringing beads and even a poor little empty purse as a token of our gratitude is better than nothing at all  19tha visit from our best friendour only friend herethe doctor after he had examined williams eyes and had reported that they were getting on as well as can be hoped at present he asked where we thought of going to live i said in the cheapest place we could find and added that i was about to make inquiries in the bystreets of the town that very day put off those inquiries he said till you hear from me again i am going now to see a patient at a farmhouse five miles off you neednt look at the children mrs kerby its nothing infectiousonly a clumsy lad who has broken his collarbone by a fall from a horse they receive lodgers occasionally at the farmhouse and i know no reason why they should not be willing to receive you if you want to be well housed and well fed at a cheap rate and if you like the society of honest hearty people the farm of appletreewick is the very place for you dont thank me till you know whether i can get you these new lodgings or not and in the meantime settle all your business affairs here so as to be able to move at a moments notice with those words the kindhearted gentleman nodded and went out pray heaven he may succeed at the farmhouse we may be sure of the childrens health at least if we live in the country talking of the children i must not omit to record that emily has nearly done one end of the bead purse already  20tha note from the doctor who is too busy to call such good news they will give us two bedrooms and board us with the family at appletreewick for seventeen shillings a week by my calculations we shall have three pounds sixteen shillings left after paying what we owe here that will be enough at the outset for four weeks living at the farmhouse with eight shillings to spare besides by embroiderywork i can easily make nine shillings more to put to that and there is a fifth week provided for surely in five weeks timeconsidering the number of things i can turn my hand towe may hit on some plan for getting a little money this is what i am always telling my husband and what by dint of constantly repeating it i am getting to believe myself william as is but natural poor fellow does not take so lighthearted view of the future as i do he says that the prospect of sitting idle and being kept by his wife for months to come is something more wretched and hopeless than words can describe i try to raise his spirits by reminding him of his years of honest hard work for me and the children and of the doctors assurance that his eyes will get the better in good time of their present helpless state but he still sighs and murmursbeing one of the most independent and high spirited of menabout living a burden on his wife i can only answer what in my heart of hearts i feel that i took him for better and for worse that i have had many years of the better and that even in our present trouble the worse shows no signs of coming yet  the bead purse is getting on fast red and blue in a pretty striped pattern  21sta busy day we go to appletreewick tomorrow paying bills and packing up all poor williams new canvases and paintingthings huddled together into a packingcase he looked so sad sitting silent with his green shade on while his old familiar working materials were disappearing around him as if he and they were never to come together again that the tears would start into my eyes though i am sure i am not one of the crying sort luckily the green shade kept him from seeing me and i took good care though the effort nearly choked me that he should not hear i was crying at any rate  the bead purse is done how are we to get the steel rings and tassels for it i am not justified now in spending sixpence unnecessarily even for the best of purposes  22d  23d the farm of appletreewicktoo tired after our move yesterday to write a word in my diary about our journey to this delightful place but now that we are beginning to get settled i can manage to make up for past omissions  my first occupation on the morning of the move had oddly enough nothing to do with our departure for the farmhouse the moment breakfast was over i began the day by making emily as smart and nicelooking as i could to go to the doctors with the purse she had her best silk frock on showing the mending a little in some places i am afraid and her straw hat trimmed with my bonnet ribbon her fathers neckscarf turned and joined so that nobody could see it made a nice mantilla for her and away she went to the doctors with her little determined step and the purse in her hand such a pretty hand that it is hardly to be regretted i had no gloves for her they were delighted with the pursewhich i ought to mention was finished with some white beads we found them in rummaging among our boxes and they made beautiful rings and tassels contrasting charmingly with the blue and red of the rest of the purse the doctor and his little girl were as i have said delighted with the present and they gave emily in return a workbox for herself and a box of sugarplums for her baby sister the child came back all flushed with the pleasure of the visit and quite helped to keep up her fathers spirits with talking to him about it so much for the highly interesting history of the bead purse  toward the afternoon the light cart from the farmhouse came to fetch us and our things to appletreewick it was quite a warm spring day and i had another pang to bear as i saw poor william helped into the cart looking so sickly and sad with his miserable green shade in the cheerful sunlight god only knows leah how this will succeed with us he said as we started then sighed and fell silent again  just outside the town the doctor met us good luck go with you he cried swinging his stick in his usual hasty way i shall come and see you as soon as you are all settled at the farmhouse goodby sir says emily struggling up with all her might among the bundles in the bottom of the cart goodby and thank you again for the workbox and the sugarplums that was my child all over she never wants telling the doctor kissed his hand and gave another flourish with his stick so we parted  how i should have enjoyed the drive if william could only have looked as i did at the young firs on the heath bending beneath the steady breeze at the shadows flying over the smooth fields at the high white clouds moving on and on in their grand airy procession over the gladsome blue sky it was a hilly road and i begged the lad who drove us not to press the horse so we were nearly an hour at our slow rate of going before we drew up at the gate of appletreewick  24th february to 2d marchwe have now been here long enough to know something of the place and the people first as to the place where the farmhouse now is there was once a famous priory the tower is still standing and the great room where the monks ate and drankused at present as a granary the house itself seems to have been tacked on to the ruins anyhow no two rooms in it are on the same level the children do nothing but tumble about the passages because there always happens to be a step up or down just at the darkest part of every one of them as for staircases there seems to me to be one for each bedroom i do nothing but lose my wayand the farmer says drolling that he must have signposts put up for me in every corner of the house from top to bottom on the groundfloor besides the usual domestic offices we have the best parlora dark airless expensively furnished solitude never invaded by anybody the kitchen and a kind of hall with a fireplace as big as the drawingroom at our town lodgings here we live and take our meals here the children can racket about to their hearts content here the dogs come lumbering in whenever they can get loose here wages are paid visitors are received bacon is cured cheese is tasted pipes are smoked and naps are taken every evening by the male members of the family never was such a comfortable friendly dwellingplace devised as this hall i feel already as if half my life had been passed in it  outofdoors looking beyond the flowergarden lawn back yards pigeonhouses and kitchengardens we are surrounded by a network of smooth grazingfields each shut off from the other by its neat hedgerow and its sturdy gate beyond the fields the hills seem to flow away gently from us into the far blue distance till they are lost in the bright softness of the sky at one point which we can see from our bedroom windows they dip suddenly into the plain and show over the rich marshy flat a strip of distant seaa strip sometimes blue sometimes gray sometimes when the sun sets a streak of fire sometimes on showery days a flash of silver light  the inhabitants of the farmhouse have one great and rare meritthey are people whom you can make friends with at once between not knowing them at all and knowing them well enough to shake hands at first sight there is no ceremonious interval or formal gradation whatever they received us on our arrival exactly as if we were old friends returned from some long traveling expedition before we had been ten minutes in the hall william had the easiest chair and the snuggest corner the children were eating breadandjam on the windowseat and i was talking to the farmers wife with the cat on my lap of the time when emily had the measles  the family numbers seven exclusive of the indoor servants of course first came the farmer and his wifehe is a tall sturdy loudvoiced active old manshe the easiest plumpest and gayest woman of sixty i ever met with they have three sons and two daughters the two eldest of the young men are employed on the farm the third is a sailor and is making holidaytime of it just now at appletreewick the daughters are pictures of health and freshness i have but one complaint to make against themthey are beginning to spoil the children already  in this tranquil place and among these genial natural people how happily my time might be passed were it not for the saddening sight of williams affliction and the wearing uncertainty of how we are to provide for future necessities it is a hard thing for my husband and me after having had the day made pleasant by kind words and friendly offices to feel this one anxious thought always forcing itself on us at night shall we have the means of stopping in our new home in a months time  3da rainy day the children difficult to manage william miserably despondent perhaps he influenced me or perhaps i felt my little troubles with the children more than usual but however it was i have not been so heavyhearted since the day when my husband first put on the green shade a listless hopeless sensation would steal over me but why write about it better to try and forget it there is always tomorrow to look to when today is at the worst  4thtomorrow has proved worthy of the faith i put in it sunshine again outofdoors and as clear and true a reflection of it in my own heart as i can hope to have just at this time oh that month that one poor month of respite what are we to do at the end of the month  5thi made my short entry for yesterday in the afternoon just before teatime little thinking of events destined to happen with the evening that would be really worth chronicling for the sake of the excellent results to which they are sure to lead my tendency is to be too sanguine about everything i know but i am nevertheless firmly persuaded that i can see a new way out of our present difficultiesa way of getting money enough to keep us all in comfort at the farmhouse until williams eyes are well again  the new project which is to relieve us from all uncertainties for the next six months actually originated with me it has raised me many inches higher in my own estimation already if the doctor only agrees with my view of the case when he comes tomorrow william will allow himself to be persuaded i know and then let them say what they please i will answer for the rest  this is how the new idea first found its way into my head  we had just done tea william in much better spirits than usual was talking with the young sailor who is jocosely called here by the very ugly name of foulweather dick the farmer and his two eldest sons were composing themselves on the oaken settles for their usual nap the dame was knitting the two girls were beginning to clear the teatable and i was darning the childrens socks to all appearance this was not a very propitious state of things for the creation of new ideas and yet my idea grew out of it for all that talking with my husband on various subjects connected with life in ships the young sailor began giving us a description of his hammock telling us how it was slung how it was impossible to get into it any other way than stern foremost whatever that may mean how the rolling of the ship made it rock like a cradle and how on rough nights it sometimes swayed to and fro at such a rate as to bump bodily against the ships side and wake him up with the sensation of having just received a punch on the head from a remarkably hard fist hearing all this i ventured to suggest that it must be an immense relief to him to sleep on shore in a good motionless solid fourpost bed but to my surprise he scoffed at the idea said he never slept comfortably out of his hammock declared that he quite missed his occasional punch on the head from the ships side and ended by giving a most comical account of all the uncomfortable sensations he felt when he slept in a fourpost bed the odd nature of one of the young sailors objections to sleeping on shore reminded my husband as indeed it did me too of the terrible story of a bed in a french gamblinghouse which he once heard from a gentleman whose likeness he took  youre laughing at me says honest foulweather dick seeing william turn toward me and smileno indeed says my husband that last objection of yours to the fourpost beds on shore seems by no means ridiculous to me at any rate i once knew a gentleman dick who practically realized your objection  excuse me sir says dick after a pause and with an appearance of great bewilderment and curiosity but could you put practically realized into plain english so that a poor man like me might have a chance of understanding youcertainly says my husband laughing i mean that i once knew a gentleman who actually saw and felt what you say in jest you are afraid of seeing and feeling whenever you sleep in a fourpost bed do you understand that foulweather dick understood it perfectly and begged with great eagerness to hear what the gentlemans adventure really was the dame who had been listening to our talk backed her sons petition the two girls sat down expectant at the halfcleared teatable even the farmer and his drowsy sons roused themselves lazily on the settlemy husband saw that he stood fairly committed to the relation of the story so he told it without more ado  i have often heard him relate that strange adventure william is the best teller of a story i ever met with to friends of all ranks in many different parts of england and i never yet knew it fail of producing an effect the farmhouse audience were i may almost say petrified by it i never before saw people look so long in the same direction and sit so long in the same attitude as they did even the servants stole away from their work in the kitchen and unrebuked by master or mistress stood quite spellbound in the doorway to listen observing all this in silence while my husband was going on with his narrative the thought suddenly flashed across me why should william not get a wider audience for that story as well as for others which he has heard from time to time from his sitters and which he has hitherto only repeated in private among a few friends people tell stories in books and get money for them what if we told our stories in a book and what if the book sold why freedom surely from the one great anxiety that is now preying on us money enough to stop at the farmhouse till williams eyes are fit for work again i almost jumped up from my chair as my thought went on shaping itself in this manner when great men make wonderful discoveries do they feel sensations like mine i wonder was sir isaac newton within an ace of skipping into the air when he first found out the law of gravitation did friar bacon long to dance when he lit the match and heard the first charge of gunpowder in the world go off with a bang  i had to put a strong constraint on myself or i should have communicated all that was passing in my mind to william before our friends at the farmhouse but i knew it was best to wait until we were alone and i did wait what a relief it was when we all got up at last to say goodnight  the moment we were in our own room i could not stop to take so much as a pin out of my dress before i began my dear said i i never heard you tell that gamblinghouse adventure so well before what an effect it had upon our friends what an effect indeed it always has wherever you tell it  so far he did not seem to take much notice he just nodded and began to pour out some of the lotion in which he always bathes his poor eyes the last thing at night  and as for that william i went on all your stories seem to interest people what a number you have picked up first and last from different sitters in the fifteen years of your practice as a portraitpainter have you any idea how many stories you really do know  no he could not undertake to say how many just then he gave this answer in a very indifferent tone dabbing away all the time at his eyes with the sponge and lotion he did it so awkwardly and roughly as it seemed to me that i took the sponge from him and applied the lotion tenderly myself  do you think said i if you turned over one of your stories carefully in your mind beforehandsay the one you told tonight for examplethat you could repeat it all to me so perfectly and deliberately that i should be able to take it down in writing from your lips  yes of course he could but why ask that question  because i should like to have all the stories that you have been in the habit of relating to our friends set down fairly in writing by way of preserving them from ever being forgotten  would i bathe his left eye now because that felt the hottest tonight i began to forbode that his growing indifference to what i was saying would soon end in his fairly going to sleep before i had developed my new idea unless i took some means forthwith of stimulating his curiosity or in other words of waking him into a proper state of astonishment and attention william said i without another syllable of preface i have got a new plan for finding all the money we want for our expenses here  he jerked his head up directly and looked at me what plan  this the state of your eyes prevents you for the present from following your profession as an artist does it not very well what are you to do with your idle time my dear turn author and how are you to get the money we want by publishing a book  good gracious leah are you out of your senses he exclaimed  i put my arm round his neck and sat down on his knee the course i always take when i want to persuade him to anything with as few words as possible  now william listen patiently to me i said an artist lies under this great disadvantage in case of accidentshis talents are of no service to him unless he can use his eyes and fingers an author on the other hand can turn his talents to account just as well by means of other peoples eyes and fingers as by means of his own in your present situation therefore you have nothing for it as i said before but to turn author wait and hear me out the book i want you to make is a book of all your stories you shall repeat them and i will write them down from your dictation our manuscript shall be printed we will sell the book to the public and so support ourselves honorably in adversity by doing the best we can to interest and amuse others  while i was saying all thisi suppose in a very excitable mannermy husband looked as our young sailorfriend would phrase it quite taken aback you were always quick at contriving leah he said but how in the world came you to think of this plan  i thought of it while you were telling them the gamblinghouse adventure downstairs i answered  it is an ingenious idea and a bold idea he went on thoughtfully but it is one thing to tell a story to a circle of friends and another thing to put it into a printed form for an audience of strangers consider my dear that we are neither of us used to what is called writing for the press  very true said i but nobody is used to it when they first begin and yet plenty of people have tried the hazardous literary experiment successfully besides in our case we have the materials ready to our hands surely we can succeed in shaping them presentably if we aim at nothing but the simple truth  who is to do the eloquent descriptions and the striking reflections and all that part of it said william perplexedly shaking his head  nobody i replied the eloquent descriptions and the striking reflections are just the parts of a storybook that people never read whatever we do let us not if we can possibly help it write so much as a single sentence that can be conveniently skipped come come i continued seeing him begin to shake his head again no more objections william i am too certain of the success of my plan to endure them if you still doubt let us refer the new project to a competent arbitrator the doctor is coming to see you tomorrow i will tell him all that i have told you and if you will promise on your side i will engage on mine to be guided entirely by his opinion  william smiled and readily gave the promise this was all i wanted to send me to bed in the best spirits for of course i should never have thought of mentioning the doctor as an arbitrator if i had not known beforehand that he was sure to be on my side  6ththe arbitrator has shown that he deserved my confidence in him he ranked himself entirely on my side before i had half done explaining to him what my new project really was as to my husbands doubts and difficulties the dear good man would not so much as hear them mentioned no objections he cried gayly set to work mr kerby and make your fortune i always said your wife was worth her weight in goldand here she is now all ready to get into the booksellers scales and prove it set to work set to work  with all my heart said william beginning at last to catch the infection of our enthusiasm but when my part of the work and my wifes has been completed what are we to do with the produce of our labor  leave that to me answered the doctor finish your book and send it to my house i will show it at once to the editor of our country newspaper he has plenty of literary friends in london and he will be just the man to help you bytheby added the doctor addressing me you think of everything mrs kerby pray have you thought of a name yet for the new book  at that question it was my turn to be taken aback the idea of naming the book had never once entered my head  a good title is of vast importance said the doctor knitting his brows thoughtfully we must all think about that what shall it be eh mrs kerby what shall it be  perhaps something may strike us after we have fairly set to work my husband suggested talking of work he continued turning to me how are you to find time leah with your nursery occupations for writing down all the stories as i tell them  i have been thinking of that this morning said i and have come to the conclusion that i shall have but little leisure to write from your dictation in the daytime what with dressing and washing the children teaching them giving them their meals taking them out to walk and keeping them amused at hometo say nothing of sitting sociably at work with the dame and her two girls in the afternooni am afraid i shall have few opportunities of doing my part of the book between breakfast and teatime but when the children are in bed and the farmer and his family are reading or dozing i should have at least three unoccupied hours to spare so if you dont mind putting off our workingtime till after dark  theres the title shouted the doctor jumping out of his chair as if he had been shot  where cried i looking all round me in the surprise of the moment as if i had expected to see the title magically inscribed for us on the walls of the room  in your last words to be sure rejoined the doctor you said just now that you would not have leisure to write from mr kerbys dictation till after dark what can we do better than name the book after the time when the book is written call it boldly after dark stop before anybody says a word for or against it let us see how the name looks on paper  i opened my writingdesk in a great flutter the doctor selected the largest sheet of paper and the broadestnibbed pen he could find and wrote in majestic roundtext letters with alternate thin and thick strokes beautiful to see the two cabalistic words                       after dark  we all three laid our heads together over the paper and in breathless silence studied the effect of the roundtext william raising his green shade in the excitement of the moment and actually disobeying the doctors orders about not using his eyes in the doctors own presence after a good long stare we looked round solemnly in each others faces and nodded there was no doubt whatever on the subject after seeing the roundtext in one happy moment the doctor had hit on the right name  i have written the titlepage said our good friend taking up his hat to go and now i leave it to you two to write the book  since then i have mended four pens and bought a quire of letterpaper at the village shop william is to ponder well over his stories in the daytime so as to be quite ready for me after dark we are to commence our new occupation this evening my heart beats fast and my eyes moisten when i think of it how many of our dearest interests depend upon the one little beginning that we are to make tonight  prologue to the first story  before i begin by the aid of my wifes patient attention and ready pen to relate any of the stories which i have heard at various times from persons whose likenesses i have been employed to take it will not be amiss if i try to secure the readers interest in the following pages by briefly explaining how i became possessed of the narrative matter which they contain  of myself i have nothing to say but that i have followed the profession of a traveling portraitpainter for the last fifteen years the pursuit of my calling has not only led me all through england but has taken me twice to scotland and once to ireland in moving from district to district i am never guided beforehand by any settled plan sometimes the letters of recommendation which i get from persons who are satisfied with the work i have done for them determine the direction in which i travel sometimes i hear of a new neighborhood in which there is no resident artist of ability and remove thither on speculation sometimes my friends among the picturedealers say a good word on my behalf to their rich customers and so pave the way for me in the large towns sometimes my prosperous and famous brotherartists hearing of small commissions which it is not worth their while to accept mention my name and procure me introductions to pleasant country houses thus i get on now in one way and now in another not winning a reputation or making a fortune but happier perhaps on the whole than many men who have got both the one and the other so at least i try to think now though i started in my youth with as high an ambition as the best of them thank god it is not my business here to speak of past times and their disappointments a twinge of the old hopeless heartache comes over me sometimes still when i think of my student days  one peculiarity of my present way of life is that it brings me into contact with all sorts of characters i almost feel by this time as if i had painted every civilized variety of the human race upon the whole my experience of the world rough as it has been has not taught me to think unkindly of my fellowcreatures i have certainly received such treatment at the hands of some of my sitters as i could not describe without saddening and shocking any kindhearted reader but taking one year and one place with another i have cause to remember with gratitude and respectsometimes even with friendship and affectiona very large proportion of the numerous persons who have employed me  some of the results of my experience are curious in a moral point of view for example i have found women almost uniformly less delicate in asking me about my terms and less generous in remunerating me for my services than men on the other hand men within my knowledge are decidedly vainer of their personal attractions and more vexatiously anxious to have them done full justice to on canvas than women taking both sexes together i have found young people for the most part more gentle more reasonable and more considerate than old and summing up in a general way my experience of different ranks which extends let me premise all the way down from peers to publicans i have met with most of my formal and ungracious receptions among rich people of uncertain social standing the highest classes and the lowest among my employers almost always contrivein widely different ways of course to make me feel at home as soon as i enter their houses  the one great obstacle that i have to contend against in the practice of my profession is not as some persons may imagine the difficulty of making my sitters keep their heads still while i paint them but the difficulty of getting them to preserve the natural look and the everyday peculiarities of dress and manner people will assume an expression will brush up their hair will correct any little characteristic carelessness in their apparelwill in short when they want to have their likenesses taken look as if they were sitting for their pictures if i paint them under these artificial circumstances i fail of course to present them in their habitual aspect and my portrait as a necessary consequence disappoints everybody the sitter always included when we wish to judge of a mans character by his handwriting we want his customary scrawl dashed off with his common workaday pen not his best smalltext traced laboriously with the finest procurable crowquill point so it is with portraitpainting which is after all nothing but a right reading of the externals of character recognizably presented to the view of others  experience after repeated trials has proved to me that the only way of getting sitters who persist in assuming a set look to resume their habitual expression is to lead them into talking about some subject in which they are greatly interested if i can only beguile them into speaking earnestly no matter on what topic i am sure of recovering their natural expression sure of seeing all the little precious everyday peculiarities of the man or woman peep out one after another quite unawares the long maundering stories about nothing the wearisome recitals of petty grievances the local anecdotes unrelieved by the faintest suspicion of anything like general interest which i have been condemned to hear as a consequence of thawing the ice off the features of formal sitters by the method just described would fill hundreds of volumes and promote the repose of thousands of readers on the other hand if i have suffered under the tediousness of the many i have not been without my compensating gains from the wisdom and experience of the few to some of my sitters i have been indebted for information which has enlarged my mindto some for advice which has lightened my heartto some for narratives of strange adventure which riveted my attention at the time which have served to interest and amuse my fireside circle for many years past and which are now i would fain hope destined to make kind friends for me among a wider audience than any that i have yet addressed  singularly enough almost all the best stories that i have heard from my sitters have been told by accident i only remember two cases in which a story was volunteered to me and although i have often tried the experiment i cannot call to mind even a single instance in which leading questions as the lawyers call them on my part addressed to a sitter ever produced any result worth recording over and over again i have been disastrously successful in encouraging dull people to weary me but the clever people who have something interesting to say seem so far as i have observed them to acknowledge no other stimulant than chance for every story which i propose including in the present collection excepting one i have been indebted in the first instance to the capricious influence of the same chance something my sitter has seen about me something i have remarked in my sitter or in the room in which i take the likeness or in the neighborhood through which i pass on my way to work has suggested the necessary association or has started the right train of recollections and then the story appeared to begin of its own accord occasionally the most casual notice on my part of some very unpromising object has smoothed the way for the relation of a long and interesting narrative i first heard one of the most dramatic of the stories that will be presented in this book merely through being carelessly inquisitive to know the history of a stuffed poodledog  it is thus not without reason that i lay some stress on the desirableness of prefacing each one of the following narratives by a brief account of the curious manner in which i became possessed of it as to my capacity for repeating these stories correctly i can answer for it that my memory may be trusted i may claim it as a merit because it is after all a mechanical one that i forget nothing and that i can call longpassed conversations and events as readily to my recollection as if they had happened but a few weeks ago of two things at least i feel tolerably certain beforehand in meditating over the contents of this book first that i can repeat correctly all that i have heard and secondly that i have never missed anything worth hearing when my sitters were addressing me on an interesting subject although i cannot take the lead in talking while i am engaged in painting i can listen while others speak and work all the better for it  so much in the way of general preface to the pages for which i am about to ask the readers attention let me now advance to particulars and describe how i came to hear the first story in the present collection i begin with it because it is the story that i have oftenest rehearsed to borrow a phrase from the stage wherever i go i am sooner or later sure to tell it only last night i was persuaded into repeating it once more by the inhabitants of the farmhouse in which i am now staying    not many years ago on returning from a short holiday visit to a friend settled in paris i found professional letters awaiting me at my agents in london which required my immediate presence in liverpool without stopping to unpack i proceeded by the first conveyance to my new destination and calling at the picturedealers shop where portraitpainting engagements were received for me found to my great satisfaction that i had remunerative employment in prospect in and about liverpool for at least two months to come i was putting up my letters in high spirits and was just leaving the picturedealers shop to look out for comfortable lodgings when i was met at the door by the landlord of one of the largest hotels in liverpoolan old acquaintance whom i had known as manager of a tavern in london in my student days  mr kerby he exclaimed in great astonishment what an unexpected meeting the last man in the world whom i expected to see and yet the very man whose services i want to make use of  what more work for me said i are all the people in liverpool going to have their portraits painted  i only know of one replied the landlord a gentleman staying at my hotel who wants a chalk drawing done for him i was on my way here to inquire of any artist whom our picturedealing friend could recommend how glad i am that i met you before i had committed myself to employing a stranger  is this likeness wanted at once i asked thinking of the number of engagements that i had already got in my pocket  immediatelytodaythis very hour if possible said the landlord mr faulkner the gentleman i am speaking of was to have sailed yesterday for the brazils from this place but the wind shifted last night to the wrong quarter and he came ashore again this morning he may of course be detained here for some time but he may also be called on board ship at half an hours notice if the wind shifts back again in the right direction this uncertainty makes it a matter of importance that the likeness should be begun immediately undertake it if you possibly can for mr faulkners a liberal gentleman who is sure to give you your own terms  i reflected for a minute or two the portrait was only wanted in chalk and would not take long besides i might finish it in the evening if my other engagements pressed hard upon me in the daytime why not leave my luggage at the picturedealers put off looking for lodgings till night and secure the new commission boldly by going back at once with the landlord to the hotel i decided on following this course almost as soon as the idea occurred to meput my chalks in my pocket and a sheet of drawing paper in the first of my portfolios that came to handand so presented myself before mr faulkner ready to take his likeness literally at five minutes notice  i found him a very pleasant intelligent man young and handsome he had been a great traveler had visited all the wonders of the east and was now about to explore the wilds of the vast south american continent thus much he told me goodhumoredly and unconstrainedly while i was preparing my drawing materials  as soon as i had put him in the right light and position and had seated myself opposite to him he changed the subject of conversation and asked me a little confusedly as i thought if it was not a customary practice among portraitpainters to gloss over the faults in their sitters faces and to make as much as possible of any good points which their features might possess  certainly i answered you have described the whole art and mystery of successful portraitpainting in a few words  may i beg then said he that you will depart from the usual practice in my case and draw me with all my defects exactly as i am the fact is he went on after a moments pause the likeness you are now preparing to take is intended for my mother my roving disposition makes me a great anxiety to her and she parted from me this last time very sadly and unwillingly i dont know how the idea came into my head but it struck me this morning that i could not better employ the time while i was delayed here on shore than by getting my likeness done to send to her as a keepsake she has no portrait of me since i was a child and she is sure to value a drawing of me more than anything else i could send to her i only trouble you with this explanation to prove that i am really sincere in my wish to be drawn unflatteringly exactly as i am  secretly respecting and admiring him for what he had just said i promised that his directions should be implicitly followed and began to work immediately before i had pursued my occupation for ten minutes the conversation began to flag and the usual obstacle to my success with a sitter gradually set itself up between us quite unconsciously of course mr faulkner stiffened his neck shut his month and contracted his eyebrowsevidently under the impression that he was facilitating the process of taking his portrait by making his face as like a lifeless mask as possible all traces of his natural animated expression were fast disappearing and he was beginning to change into a heavy and rather melancholylooking man  this complete alteration was of no great consequence so long as i was only engaged in drawing the outline of his face and the general form of his features i accordingly worked on doggedly for more than an hourthen left off to point my chalks again and to give my sitter a few minutes rest thus far the likeness had not suffered through mr faulkners unfortunate notion of the right way of sitting for his portrait but the time of difficulty as i well knew was to come it was impossible for me to think of putting any expression into the drawing unless i could contrive some means when he resumed his chair of making him look like himself again i will talk to him about foreign parts thought i and try if i cant make him forget that he is sitting for his picture in that way  while i was pointing my chalks mr faulkner was walking up and down the room he chanced to see the portfolio i had brought with me leaning against the wall and asked if there were any sketches in it i told him there were a few which i had made during my recent stay in paris in paris he repeated with a look of interest may i see them  i gave him the permission he asked as a matter of course sitting down he took the portfolio on his knee and began to look through it he turned over the first five sketches rapidly enough but when he came to the sixth i saw his face flush directly and observed that he took the drawing out of the portfolio carried it to the window and remained silently absorbed in the contemplation of it for full five minutes after that he turned round to me and asked very anxiously if i had any objection to part with that sketch  it was the least interesting drawing of the collectionmerely a view in one of the streets running by the backs of the houses in the palais royal some four or five of these houses were comprised in the view which was of no particular use to me in any way and which was too valueless as a work of art for me to think of selling it i begged his acceptance of it at once he thanked me quite warmly and then seeing that i looked a little surprised at the odd selection he had made from my sketches laughingly asked me if i could guess why he had been so anxious to become possessed of the view which i had given him  probably i answered there is some remarkable historical association connected with that street at the back of the palais royal of which i am ignorant  no said mr faulkner at least none that i know of the only association connected with the place in my mind is a purely personal association look at this house in your drawingthe house with the waterpipe running down it from top to bottom i once passed a night therea night i shall never forget to the day of my death i have had some awkward traveling adventures in my time but that adventure well never mind suppose we begin the sitting i make but a bad return for your kindness in giving me the sketch by thus wasting your time in mere talk  come come thought i as he went back to the sitters chair i shall see your natural expression on your face if i can only get you to talk about that adventure it was easy enough to lead him in the right direction at the first hint from me he returned to the subject of the house in the back street without i hope showing any undue curiosity i contrived to let him see that i felt a deep interest in everything he now said after two or three preliminary hesitations he at last to my great joy fairly started on the narrative of his adventure in the interest of his subject he soon completely forgot that he was sitting for his portraitthe very expression that i wanted came over his faceand my drawing proceeded toward completion in the right direction and to the best purpose at every fresh touch i felt more and more certain that i was now getting the better of my grand difficulty and i enjoyed the additional gratification of having my work lightened by the recital of a true story which possessed in my estimation all the excitement of the most exciting romance  this as i recollect it is how mr faulkner told me his adventure     the travelers story of a terribly strange bed  shortly after my education at college was finished i happened to be staying at paris with an english friend we were both young men then and lived i am afraid rather a wild life in the delightful city of our sojourn one night we were idling about the neighborhood of the palais royal doubtful to what amusement we should next betake ourselves my friend proposed a visit to frascatis but his suggestion was not to my taste i knew frascatis as the french saying is by heart had lost and won plenty of fivefranc pieces there merely for amusements sake until it was amusement no longer and was thoroughly tired in fact of all the ghastly respectabilities of such a social anomaly as a respectable gamblinghouse for heavens sake said i to my friend let us go somewhere where we can see a little genuine blackguard povertystricken gaming with no false gingerbread glitter thrown over it all let us get away from fashionable frascatis to a house where they dont mind letting in a man with a ragged coat or a man with no coat ragged or otherwise very well said my friend we neednt go out of the palais royal to find the sort of company you want heres the place just before us as blackguard a place by all report as you could possibly wish to see in another minute we arrived at the door and entered the house the back of which you have drawn in your sketch  when we got upstairs and had left our hats and sticks with the doorkeeper we were admitted into the chief gamblingroom we did not find many people assembled there but few as the men were who looked up at us on our entrance they were all typeslamentably true typesof their respective classes  we had come to see blackguards but these men were something worse there is a comic side more or less appreciable in all blackguardismhere there was nothing but tragedymute weird tragedy the quiet in the room was horrible the thin haggard longhaired young man whose sunken eyes fiercely watched the turning up of the cards never spoke the flabby fatfaced pimply player who pricked his piece of pasteboard perseveringly to register how often black won and how often rednever spoke the dirty wrinkled old man with the vulture eyes and the darned greatcoat who had lost his last sou and still looked on desperately after he could play no longernever spoke even the voice of the croupier sounded as if it were strangely dulled and thickened in the atmosphere of the room i had entered the place to laugh but the spectacle before me was something to weep over i soon found it necessary to take refuge in excitement from the depression of spirits which was fast stealing on me unfortunately i sought the nearest excitement by going to the table and beginning to play still more unfortunately as the event will show i wonwon prodigiously won incredibly won at such a rate that the regular players at the table crowded round me and staring at my stakes with hungry superstitious eyes whispered to one another that the english stranger was going to break the bank  the game was rouge et noir i had played at it in every city in europe without however the care or the wish to study the theory of chancesthat philosophers stone of all gamblers and a gambler in the strict sense of the word i had never been i was heartwhole from the corroding passion for play my gaming was a mere idle amusement i never resorted to it by necessity because i never knew what it was to want money i never practiced it so incessantly as to lose more than i could afford or to gain more than i could coolly pocket without being thrown off my balance by my good luck in short i had hitherto frequented gamblingtablesjust as i frequented ballrooms and operahousesbecause they amused me and because i had nothing better to do with my leisure hours  but on this occasion it was very differentnow for the first time in my life i felt what the passion for play really was my success first bewildered and then in the most literal meaning of the word intoxicated me incredible as it may appear it is nevertheless true that i only lost when i attempted to estimate chances and played according to previous calculation if i left everything to luck and staked without any care or consideration i was sure to winto win in the face of every recognized probability in favor of the bank at first some of the men present ventured their money safely enough on my color but i speedily increased my stakes to sums which they dared not risk one after another they left off playing and breathlessly looked on at my game  still time after time i staked higher and higher and still won the excitement in the room rose to fever pitch the silence was interrupted by a deepmuttered chorus of oaths and exclamations in different languages every time the gold was shoveled across to my side of the tableeven the imperturbable croupier dashed his rake on the floor in a french fury of astonishment at my success but one man present preserved his selfpossession and that man was my friend he came to my side and whispering in english begged me to leave the place satisfied with what i had already gained i must do him the justice to say that he repeated his warnings and entreaties several times and only left me and went away after i had rejected his advice i was to all intents and purposes gambling drunk in terms which rendered it impossible for him to address me again that night  shortly after he had gone a hoarse voice behind me cried permit me my dear sirpermit me to restore to their proper place two napoleons which you have dropped wonderful luck sir i pledge you my word of honor as an old soldier in the course of my long experience in this sort of thing i never saw such luck as yoursnever go on sirsacre mille bombes go on boldly and break the bank  i turned round and saw nodding and smiling at me with inveterate civility a tall man dressed in a frogged and braided surtout  if i had been in my senses i should have considered him personally as being rather a suspicious specimen of an old soldier he had goggling bloodshot eyes mangy mustaches and a broken nose his voice betrayed a barrackroom intonation of the worst order and he had the dirtiest pair of hands i ever saweven in france these little personal peculiarities exercised however no repelling influence on me in the mad excitement the reckless triumph of that moment i was ready to fraternize with anybody who encouraged me in my game i accepted the old soldiers offered pinch of snuff clapped him on the back and swore he was the honestest fellow in the worldthe most glorious relic of the grand army that i had ever met with go on cried my military friend snapping his fingers in ecstasygo on and win break the bankmille tonnerres my gallant english comrade break the bank  and i did go onwent on at such a rate that in another quarter of an hour the croupier called out gentlemen the bank has discontinued for tonight all the notes and all the gold in that bank now lay in a heap under my hands the whole floating capital of the gamblinghouse was waiting to pour into my pockets  tie up the money in your pockethandkerchief my worthy sir said the old soldier as i wildly plunged my hands into my heap of gold tie it up as we used to tie up a bit of dinner in the grand army your winnings are too heavy for any breechespockets that ever were sewed there thats itshovel them in notes and all credie what luck stop another napoleon on the floor ah sacre petit polisson de napoleon have i found thee at last now then sirtwo tight double knots each way with your honorable permission and the moneys safe feel it feel it fortunate sir hard and round as a cannonballah bah if they had only fired such cannonballs at us at austerlitznom dune pipe if they only had and now as an ancient grenadier as an exbrave of the french army what remains for me to do i ask what simply this to entreat my valued english friend to drink a bottle of champagne with me and toast the goddess fortune in foaming goblets before we part  excellent exbrave convivial ancient grenadier champagne by all means an english cheer for an old soldier hurrah hurrah another english cheer for the goddess fortune hurrah hurrah hurrah  bravo the englishman the amiable gracious englishman in whose veins circulates the vivacious blood of france another glass ah bahthe bottle is empty never mind vive le vin i the old soldier order another bottle and half a pound of bonbons with it  no no exbrave neverancient grenadier your bottle last time my bottle this behold it toast away the french army the great napoleon the present company the croupier the honest croupiers wife and daughtersif he has any the ladies generally everybody in the world  by the time the second bottle of champagne was emptied i felt as if i had been drinking liquid firemy brain seemed all aflame no excess in wine had ever had this effect on me before in my life was it the result of a stimulant acting upon my system when i was in a highly excited state was my stomach in a particularly disordered condition or was the champagne amazingly strong  exbrave of the french army cried i in a mad state of exhilaration i am on fire how are you you have set me on fire do you hear my hero of austerlitz let us have a third bottle of champagne to put the flame out  the old soldier wagged his head rolled his goggleeyes until i expected to see them slip out of their sockets placed his dirty forefinger by the side of his broken nose solemnly ejaculated coffee and immediately ran off into an inner room  the word pronounced by the eccentric veteran seemed to have a magical effect on the rest of the company present with one accord they all rose to depart probably they had expected to profit by my intoxication but finding that my new friend was benevolently bent on preventing me from getting dead drunk had now abandoned all hope of thriving pleasantly on my winnings whatever their motive might be at any rate they went away in a body when the old soldier returned and sat down again opposite to me at the table we had the room to ourselves i could see the croupier in a sort of vestibule which opened out of it eating his supper in solitude the silence was now deeper than ever  a sudden change too had come over the exbrave he assumed a portentously solemn look and when he spoke to me again his speech was ornamented by no oaths enforced by no fingersnapping enlivened by no apostrophes or exclamations  listen my dear sir said he in mysteriously confidential toneslisten to an old soldiers advice i have been to the mistress of the house a very charming woman with a genius for cookery to impress on her the necessity of making us some particularly strong and good coffee you must drink this coffee in order to get rid of your little amiable exaltation of spirits before you think of going homeyou must my good and gracious friend with all that money to take home tonight it is a sacred duty to yourself to have your wits about you you are known to be a winner to an enormous extent by several gentlemen present tonight who in a certain point of view are very worthy and excellent fellows but they are mortal men my dear sir and they have their amiable weaknesses need i say more ah no no you understand me now this is what you must dosend for a cabriolet when you feel quite well againdraw up all the windows when you get into itand tell the driver to take you home only through the large and welllighted thoroughfares do this and you and your money will be safe do this and tomorrow you will thank an old soldier for giving you a word of honest advice  just as the exbrave ended his oration in very lachrymose tones the coffee came in ready poured out in two cups my attentive friend handed me one of the cups with a bow i was parched with thirst and drank it off at a draught almost instantly afterwards i was seized with a fit of giddiness and felt more completely intoxicated than ever the room whirled round and round furiously the old soldier seemed to be regularly bobbing up and down before me like the piston of a steamengine i was half deafened by a violent singing in my ears a feeling of utter bewilderment helplessness idiocy overcame me i rose from my chair holding on by the table to keep my balance and stammered out that i felt dreadfully unwellso unwell that i did not know how i was to get home  my dear friend answered the old soldierand even his voice seemed to be bobbing up and down as he spokemy dear friend it would be madness to go home in your state you would be sure to lose your money you might be robbed and murdered with the greatest ease i am going to sleep here do you sleep here toothey make up capital beds in this housetake one sleep off the effects of the wine and go home safely with your winnings tomorrowtomorrow in broad daylight  i had but two ideas left one that i must never let go hold of my handkerchief full of money the other that i must lie down somewhere immediately and fall off into a comfortable sleep so i agreed to the proposal about the bed and took the offered arm of the old soldier carrying my money with my disengaged hand preceded by the croupier we passed along some passages and up a flight of stairs into the bedroom which i was to occupy the exbrave shook me warmly by the hand proposed that we should breakfast together and then followed by the croupier left me for the night  i ran to the washhand stand drank some of the water in my jug poured the rest out and plunged my face into it then sat down in a chair and tried to compose myself i soon felt better the change for my lungs from the fetid atmosphere of the gamblingroom to the cool air of the apartment i now occupied the almost equally refreshing change for my eyes from the glaring gaslights of the salon to the dim quiet flicker of one bedroomcandle aided wonderfully the restorative effects of cold water the giddiness left me and i began to feel a little like a reasonable being again my first thought was of the risk of sleeping all night in a gamblinghouse my second of the still greater risk of trying to get out after the house was closed and of going home alone at night through the streets of paris with a large sum of money about me i had slept in worse places than this on my travels so i determined to lock bolt and barricade my door and take my chance till the next morning  accordingly i secured myself against all intrusion looked under the bed and into the cupboard tried the fastening of the window and then satisfied that i had taken every proper precaution pulled off my upper clothing put my light which was a dim one on the hearth among a feathery litter of woodashes and got into bed with the handkerchief full of money under my pillow  i soon felt not only that i could not go to sleep but that i could not even close my eyes i was wide awake and in a high fever every nerve in my body trembledevery one of my senses seemed to be preternaturally sharpened i tossed and rolled and tried every kind of position and perseveringly sought out the cold corners of the bed and all to no purpose now i thrust my arms over the clothes now i poked them under the clothes now i violently shot my legs straight out down to the bottom of the bed now i convulsively coiled them up as near my chin as they would go now i shook out my crumpled pillow changed it to the cool side patted it flat and lay down quietly on my back now i fiercely doubled it in two set it up on end thrust it against the board of the bed and tried a sitting posture every effort was in vain i groaned with vexation as i felt that i was in for a sleepless night  what could i do i had no book to read and yet unless i found out some method of diverting my mind i felt certain that i was in the condition to imagine all sorts of horrors to rack my brain with forebodings of every possible and impossible danger in short to pass the night in suffering all conceivable varieties of nervous terror  i raised myself on my elbow and looked about the roomwhich was brightened by a lovely moonlight pouring straight through the windowto see if it contained any pictures or ornaments that i could at all clearly distinguish while my eyes wandered from wall to wall a remembrance of le maistres delightful little book voyage autour de ma chambre occurred to me i resolved to imitate the french author and find occupation and amusement enough to relieve the tedium of my wakefulness by making a mental inventory of every article of furniture i could see and by following up to their sources the multitude of associations which even a chair a table or a washhand stand may be made to call forth  in the nervous unsettled state of my mind at that moment i found it much easier to make my inventory than to make my reflections and thereupon soon gave up all hope of thinking in le maistres fanciful trackor indeed of thinking at all i looked about the room at the different articles of furniture and did nothing more  there was first the bed i was lying in a fourpost bed of all things in the world to meet with in parisyes a thorough clumsy british fourposter with the regular top lined with chintzthe regular fringed valance all roundthe regular stifling unwholesome curtains which i remembered having mechanically drawn back against the posts without particularly noticing the bed when i first got into the room then there was the marbletopped washhand stand from which the water i had spilled in my hurry to pour it out was still dripping slowly and more slowly on to the brick floor then two small chairs with my coat waistcoat and trousers flung on them then a large elbowchair covered with dirtywhite dimity with my cravat and shirt collar thrown over the back then a chest of drawers with two of the brass handles off and a tawdry broken china inkstand placed on it by way of ornament for the top then the dressingtable adorned by a very small lookingglass and a very large pincushion then the windowan unusually large window then a dark old picture which the feeble candle dimly showed me it was a picture of a fellow in a high spanish hat crowned with a plume of towering feathers a swarthy sinister ruffian looking upward shading his eyes with his hand and looking intently upwardit might be at some tall gallows at which he was going to be hanged at any rate he had the appearance of thoroughly deserving it  this picture put a kind of constraint upon me to look upward tooat the top of the bed it was a gloomy and not an interesting object and i looked back at the picture i counted the feathers in the mans hatthey stood out in reliefthree white two green i observed the crown of his hat which was of conical shape according to the fashion supposed to have been favored by guido fawkes i wondered what he was looking up at it couldnt be at the stars such a desperado was neither astrologer nor astronomer it must be at the high gallows and he was going to be hanged presently would the executioner come into possession of his conical crowned hat and plume of feathers i counted the feathers againthree white two green  while i still lingered over this very improving and intellectual employment my thoughts insensibly began to wander the moonlight shining into the room reminded me of a certain moonlight night in englandthe night after a picnic party in a welsh valley every incident of the drive homeward through lovely scenery which the moonlight made lovelier than ever came back to my remembrance though i had never given the picnic a thought for years though if i had tried to recollect it i could certainly have recalled little or nothing of that scene long past of all the wonderful faculties that help to tell us we are immortal which speaks the sublime truth more eloquently than memory here was i in a strange house of the most suspicious character in a situation of uncertainty and even of peril which might seem to make the cool exercise of my recollection almost out of the question nevertheless remembering quite involuntarily places people conversations minute circumstances of every kind which i had thought forgotten forever which i could not possibly have recalled at will even under the most favorable auspices and what cause had produced in a moment the whole of this strange complicated mysterious effect nothing but some rays of moonlight shining in at my bedroom window  i was still thinking of the picnicof our merriment on the drive homeof the sentimental young lady who would quote childe harold because it was moonlight i was absorbed by these past scenes and past amusements when in an instant the thread on which my memories hung snapped asunder my attention immediately came back to present things more vividly than ever and i found myself i neither knew why nor wherefore looking hard at the picture again  looking for what  good god the man had pulled his hat down on his brows no the hat itself was gone where was the conical crown where the feathersthree white two green not there in place of the hat and feathers what dusky object was it that now hid his forehead his eyes his shading hand  was the bed moving  i turned on my back and looked up was i mad drunk dreaming giddy again or was the top of the bed really moving downsinking slowly regularly silently horribly right down throughout the whole of its length and breadthright down upon me as i lay underneath  my blood seemed to stand still a deadly paralysing coldness stole all over me as i turned my head round on the pillow and determined to test whether the bedtop was really moving or not by keeping my eye on the man in the picture  the next look in that direction was enough the dull black frowzy outline of the valance above me was within an inch of being parallel with his waist i still looked breathlessly and steadily and slowlyvery slowlyi saw the figure and the line of frame below the figure vanish as the valance moved down before it  i am constitutionally anything but timid i have been on more than one occasion in peril of my life and have not lost my selfpossession for an instant but when the conviction first settled on my mind that the bedtop was really moving was steadily and continuously sinking down upon me i looked up shuddering helpless panicstricken beneath the hideous machinery for murder which was advancing closer and closer to suffocate me where i lay  i looked up motionless speechless breathless the candle fully spent went out but the moonlight still brightened the room down and down without pausing and without sounding came the bedtop and still my panicterror seemed to bind me faster and faster to the mattress on which i laydown and down it sank till the dusty odor from the lining of the canopy came stealing into my nostrils  at that final moment the instinct of selfpreservation startled me out of my trance and i moved at last there was just room for me to roll myself sidewise off the bed as i dropped noiselessly to the floor the edge of the murderous canopy touched me on the shoulder  without stopping to draw my breath without wiping the cold sweat from my face i rose instantly on my knees to watch the bedtop i was literally spellbound by it if i had heard footsteps behind me i could not have turned round if a means of escape had been miraculously provided for me i could not have moved to take advantage of it the whole life in me was at that moment concentrated in my eyes  it descendedthe whole canopy with the fringe round it came downdownclose down so close that there was not room now to squeeze my finger between the bedtop and the bed i felt at the sides and discovered that what had appeared to me from beneath to be the ordinary light canopy of a fourpost bed was in reality a thick broad mattress the substance of which was concealed by the valance and its fringe i looked up and saw the four posts rising hideously bare in the middle of the bedtop was a huge wooden screw that had evidently worked it down through a hole in the ceiling just as ordinary presses are worked down on the substance selected for compression the frightful apparatus moved without making the faintest noise there had been no creaking as it came down there was now not the faintest sound from the room above amid a dead and awful silence i beheld before mein the nineteenth century and in the civilized capital of francesuch a machine for secret murder by suffocation as might have existed in the worst days of the inquisition in the lonely inns among the hartz mountains in the mysterious tribunals of westphalia still as i looked on it i could not move i could hardly breathe but i began to recover the power of thinking and in a moment i discovered the murderous conspiracy framed against me in all its horror  my cup of coffee had been drugged and drugged too strongly i had been saved from being smothered by having taken an overdose of some narcotic how i had chafed and fretted at the fever fit which had preserved my life by keeping me awake how recklessly i had confided myself to the two wretches who had led me into this room determined for the sake of my winnings to kill me in my sleep by the surest and most horrible contrivance for secretly accomplishing my destruction how many men winners like me had slept as i had proposed to sleep in that bed and had never been seen or heard of more i shuddered at the bare idea of it  but ere long all thought was again suspended by the sight of the murderous canopy moving once more after it had remained on the bedas nearly as i could guessabout ten minutes it began to move up again the villains who worked it from above evidently believed that their purpose was now accomplished slowly and silently as it had descended that horrible bedtop rose towards its former place when it reached the upper extremities of the four posts it reached the ceiling too neither hole nor screw could be seen the bed became in appearance an ordinary bed againthe canopy an ordinary canopyeven to the most suspicious eyes  now for the first time i was able to moveto rise from my kneesto dress myself in my upper clothingand to consider of how i should escape if i betrayed by the smallest noise that the attempt to suffocate me had failed i was certain to be murdered had i made any noise already i listened intently looking towards the door  no no footsteps in the passage outsideno sound of a tread light or heavy in the room aboveabsolute silence everywhere besides locking and bolting my door i had moved an old wooden chest against it which i had found under the bed to remove this chest my blood ran cold as i thought of what its contents might be without making some disturbance was impossible and moreover to think of escaping through the house now barred up for the night was sheer insanity only one chance was left methe window i stole to it on tiptoe  my bedroom was on the first floor above an entresol and looked into a back street which you have sketched in your view i raised my hand to open the window knowing that on that action hung by the merest hairbreadth my chance of safety they keep vigilant watch in a house of murder if any part of the frame cracked if the hinge creaked i was a lost man it must have occupied me at least five minutes reckoning by timefive hours reckoning by suspenseto open that window i succeeded in doing it silentlyin doing it with all the dexterity of a housebreakerand then looked down into the street to leap the distance beneath me would be almost certain destruction next i looked round at the sides of the house down the left side ran a thick waterpipe which you have drawnit passed close by the outer edge of the window the moment i saw the pipe i knew i was saved my breath came and went freely for the first time since i had seen the canopy of the bed moving down upon me  to some men the means of escape which i had discovered might have seemed difficult and dangerous enoughto me the prospect of slipping down the pipe into the street did not suggest even a thought of peril i had always been accustomed by the practice of gymnastics to keep up my schoolboy powers as a daring and expert climber and knew that my head hands and feet would serve me faithfully in any hazards of ascent or descent i had already got one leg over the windowsill when i remembered the handkerchief filled with money under my pillow i could well have afforded to leave it behind me but i was revengefully determined that the miscreants of the gamblinghouse should miss their plunder as well as their victim so i went back to the bed and tied the heavy handkerchief at my back by my cravat  just as i had made it tight and fixed it in a comfortable place i thought i heard a sound of breathing outside the door the chill feeling of horror ran through me again as i listened no dead silence still in the passagei had only heard the night air blowing softly into the room the next moment i was on the windowsilland the next i had a firm grip on the waterpipe with my hands and knees  i slid down into the street easily and quietly as i thought i should and immediately set off at the top of my speed to a branch prefecture of police which i knew was situated in the immediate neighborhood a subprefect and several picked men among his subordinates happened to be up maturing i believe some scheme for discovering the perpetrator of a mysterious murder which all paris was talking of just then when i began my story in a breathless hurry and in very bad french i could see that the subprefect suspected me of being a drunken englishman who had robbed somebody but he soon altered his opinion as i went on and before i had anything like concluded he shoved all the papers before him into a drawer put on his hat supplied me with another for i was bareheaded ordered a file of soldiers desired his expert followers to get ready all sorts of tools for breaking open doors and ripping up brick flooring and took my arm in the most friendly and familiar manner possible to lead me with him out of the house i will venture to say that when the subprefect was a little boy and was taken for the first time to the play he was not half as much pleased as he was now at the job in prospect for him at the gamblinghouse  away we went through the streets the subprefect crossexamining and congratulating me in the same breath as we marched at the head of our formidable posse comitatus sentinels were placed at the back and front of the house the moment we got to it a tremendous battery of knocks was directed against the door a light appeared at a window i was told to conceal myself behind the policethen came more knocks and a cry of open in the name of the law at that terrible summons bolts and locks gave way before an invisible hand and the moment after the subprefect was in the passage confronting a waiter halfdressed and ghastly pale this was the short dialogue which immediately took place  we want to see the englishman who is sleeping in this house  he went away hours ago  he did no such thing his friend went away he remained show us to his bedroom  i swear to you monsieur le sousprefect he is not here he  i swear to you monsieur le garcon he is he slept herehe didnt find your bed comfortablehe came to us to complain of ithere he is among my menand here am i ready to look for a flea or two in his bedstead renaudin calling to one of the subordinates and pointing to the waiter collar that man and tie his hands behind him now then gentlemen let us walk upstairs  every man and woman in the house was securedthe old soldier the first then i identified the bed in which i had slept and then we went into the room above  no object that was at all extraordinary appeared in any part of it the subprefect looked round the place commanded everybody to be silent stamped twice on the floor called for a candle looked attentively at the spot he had stamped on and ordered the flooring there to be carefully taken up this was done in no time lights were produced and we saw a deep raftered cavity between the floor of this room and the ceiling of the room beneath through this cavity there ran perpendicularly a sort of case of iron thickly greased and inside the case appeared the screw which communicated with the bedtop below extra lengths of screw freshly oiled levers covered with felt all the complete upper works of a heavy pressconstructed with infernal ingenuity so as to join the fixtures below and when taken to pieces again to go into the smallest possible compasswere next discovered and pulled out on the floor after some little difficulty the subprefect succeeded in putting the machinery together and leaving his men to work it descended with me to the bedroom the smothering canopy was then lowered but not so noiselessly as i had seen it lowered when i mentioned this to the subprefect his answer simple as it was had a terrible significance my men said he are working down the bedtop for the first timethe men whose money you won were in better practice  we left the house in the sole possession of two police agentsevery one of the inmates being removed to prison on the spot the subprefect after taking down my proces verbal in his office returned with me to my hotel to get my passport do you think i asked as i gave it to him that any men have really been smothered in that bed as they tried to smother me  i have seen dozens of drowned men laid out at the morgue answered the subprefect in whose pocketbooks were found letters stating that they had committed suicide in the seine because they had lost everything at the gaming table do i know how many of those men entered the same gamblinghouse that you entered won as you won took that bed as you took it slept in it were smothered in it and were privately thrown into the river with a letter of explanation written by the murderers and placed in their pocketbooks no man can say how many or how few have suffered the fate from which you have escaped the people of the gamblinghouse kept their bedstead machinery a secret from useven from the police the dead kept the rest of the secret for them goodnight or rather goodmorning monsieur faulkner be at my office again at nine oclockin the meantime au revoir  the rest of my story is soon told i was examined and reexamined the gamblinghouse was strictly searched all through from top to bottom the prisoners were separately interrogated and two of the less guilty among them made a confession i discovered that the old soldier was the master of the gamblinghousejustice discovered that he had been drummed out of the army as a vagabond years ago that he had been guilty of all sorts of villainies since that he was in possession of stolen property which the owners identified and that he the croupier another accomplice and the woman who had made my cup of coffee were all in the secret of the bedstead there appeared some reason to doubt whether the inferior persons attached to the house knew anything of the suffocating machinery and they received the benefit of that doubt by being treated simply as thieves and vagabonds as for the old soldier and his two head myrmidons they went to the galleys the woman who had drugged my coffee was imprisoned for i forget how many years the regular attendants at the gamblinghouse were considered suspicious and placed under surveillance and i became for one whole week which is a long time the head lion in parisian society my adventure was dramatized by three illustrious playmakers but never saw theatrical daylight for the censorship forbade the introduction on the stage of a correct copy of the gamblinghouse bedstead  one good result was produced by my adventure which any censorship must have approved it cured me of ever again trying rouge et noir as an amusement the sight of a green cloth with packs of cards and heaps of money on it will henceforth be forever associated in my mind with the sight of a bed canopy descending to suffocate me in the silence and darkness of the night    just as mr faulkner pronounced these words he started in his chair and resumed his stiff dignified position in a great hurry bless my soul cried he with a comic look of astonishment and vexation while i have been telling you what is the real secret of my interest in the sketch you have so kindly given to me i have altogether forgotten that i came here to sit for my portrait for the last hour or more i must have been the worst model you ever had to draw from  on the contrary you have been the best said i i have been trying to catch your likeness and while telling your story you have unconsciously shown me the natural expression i wanted to insure my success  note by mrs kerby  i cannot let this story end without mentioning what the chance saying was which caused it to be told at the farmhouse the other night our friend the young sailor among his other quaint objections to sleeping on shore declared that he particularly hated fourpost beds because he never slept in one without doubting whether the top might not come down in the night and suffocate him i thought this chance reference to the distinguishing feature of williams narrative curious enough and my husband agreed with me but he says it is scarcely worth while to mention such a trifle in anything so important as a book i cannot venture after this to do more than slip these lines in modestly at the end of the story if the printer should notice my few last words perhaps he may not mind the trouble of putting them into some outoftheway corner  l k     prologue to the second story  the beginning of an excellent connection which i succeeded in establishing in and around that respectable wateringplace tidburyonthemarsh was an order for a lifesize oil portrait of a great local celebrityone mr boxsious a solicitor who was understood to do the most thriving business of any lawyer in the town  the portrait was intended as a testimonial expressive to use the language of the circular forwarded to me at the time of the eminent services of mr boxsious in promoting and securing the prosperity of the town it had been subscribed for by the municipal authorities and resident inhabitants of tidburyonthemarsh and it was to be presented when done to mrs boxsious as a slight but sincere tokenand so forth a timely recommendation from one of my kindest friends and patrons placed the commission for painting the likeness in my lucky hands and i was instructed to attend on a certain day at mr boxsiouss private residence with all my materials ready for taking a first sitting  on arriving at the house i was shown into a very prettily furnished morningroom the bowwindow looked out on a large inclosed meadow which represented the principal square in tidbury on the opposite side of the meadow i could see the new hotel with a wing lately added and close by the old hotel obstinately unchanged since it had first been built then further down the street the doctors house with a colored lamp and a small doorplate and the bankers office with a plain lamp and a big doorplatethen some dreary private lodginghousesthen at right angles to these a street of shops the cheesemongers very small the chemists very smart the pastrycooks very dowdy and the greengrocers very dark i was still looking out at the view thus presented when i was suddenly apostrophized by a glib disputatious voice behind me  now then mr artist cried the voice do you call that getting ready for work where are your paints and brushes and all the rest of it my names boxsious and im here to sit for my picture  i turned round and confronted a little man with his legs astraddle and his hands in his pockets he had lightgray eyes red all round the lids bristling peppercolored hair an unnaturally rosy complexion and an eager impudent clever look i made two discoveries in one glance at him first that he was a wretched subject for a portrait secondly that whatever he might do or say it would not be of the least use for me to stand on my dignity with him  i shall be ready directly sir said i  ready directly repeated my new sitter what do you mean mr artist by ready directly im ready now what was your contract with the town council who have subscribed for this picture to paint the portrait and what was my contract to sit for it here am i ready to sit and there are you not ready to paint me according to all the rules of law and logic you are committing a breach of contract already stop lets have a look at your paints are they the best quality if not i warn you sir theres a second breach of contract brushes too why theyre old brushes by the lord harry the town council pays you well mr artist why dont you work for them with new brushes what you work best with old i contend sir that you cant does my housemaid clean best with an old broom do my clerks write best with old pens dont color up and dont look as if you were going to quarrel with me you cant quarrel with me if you were fifty times as irritable a man as you look you couldnt quarrel with me im not young and im not touchyim boxsious the lawyer the only man in the world who cant be insulted try it how you like  he chuckled as he said this and walked away to the window it was quite useless to take anything he said seriously so i finished preparing my palette for the mornings work with the utmost serenity of look and manner that i could possibly assume  there he went on looking out of the window do you see that fat man slouching along the parade with a snuffy nose thats my favorite enemy dunball he tried to quarrel with me ten years ago and he has done nothing but bring out the hidden benevolence of my character ever since look at him look how he frowns as he turns this way and now look at me i can smile and nod to him i make a point of always smiling and nodding to himit keeps my hand in for other enemies goodmorning ive cast him twice in heavy damages goodmorning mr dunball he bears malice you see he wont speak hes short in the neck passionate and four times as fat as he ought to be he has fought against my amiability for ten mortal years when he cant fight any longer hell die suddenly and i shall be the innocent cause of it  mr boxsious uttered this fatal prophecy with extraordinary complacency nodding and smiling out of the window all the time at the unfortunate man who had rashly tried to provoke him when his favorite enemy was out of sight he turned away and indulged himself in a brisk turn or two up and down the room meanwhile i lifted my canvas on the easel and was on the point of asking him to sit down when he assailed me again  now mr artist he cried quickening his walk impatiently in the interests of the town council your employers allow me to ask you for the last time when you are going to begin  and allow me mr boxsious in the interest of the town council also said i to ask you if your notion of the proper way of sitting for your portrait is to walk about the room  aha well putdevilish well put returned mr boxsious thats the only sensible thing you have said since you entered my house i begin to like you already with these words he nodded at me approvingly and jumped into the high chair that i had placed for him with the alacrity of a young man  i say mr artist he went on when i had put him into the right position he insisted on the front view of his face being taken because the town council would get the most for their money in that way you dont have many such good jobs as this do you  not many i said i should not be a poor man if commissions for lifesize portraits often fell in my way  you poor exclaimed mr boxsious contemptuously i dispute that point with you at the outset why youve got a good cloth coat a clean shirt and a smoothshaved chin youve got the sleek look of a man who has slept between sheets and had his breakfast you cant humbug me about poverty for i know what it is poverty means looking like a scarecrow feeling like a scarecrow and getting treated like a scarecrow that was my luck let me tell you when i first thought of trying the law poverty indeed do you shake in your shoes mr artist when you think what you were at twenty i do i can promise you  he began to shift about so irritably in his chair that in the interests of my work i was obliged to make an effort to calm him  it must be a pleasant occupation for you in your present prosperity said i to look back sometimes at the gradual processes by which you passed from poverty to competence and from that to the wealth you now enjoy  gradual did you say cried mr boxsious it wasnt gradual at all i was sharpdamned sharp and i jumped at my first start in business slap into five hundred pounds in one day  that was an extraordinary step in advance i rejoined i suppose you contrived to make some profitable investment  not a bit of it i hadnt a spare sixpence to invest with i won the money by my brains my hands and my pluck and whats more im proud of having done it that was rather a curious case mr artist some men might be shy of mentioning it i never was shy in my life and i mention it right and left everywherethe whole case just as it happened except the names catch me ever committing myself to mentioning names mums the word sir with yours to command thomas boxsious  as you mention the case everywhere said i perhaps you would not be offended with me if i told you i should like to hear it  man alive havent i told you already that i cant be offended and didnt i say a moment ago that i was proud of the case ill tell you mr artistbut stop ive got the interests of the town council to look after in this business can you paint as well when im talking as when im not dont sneer sir youre not wanted to sneeryoure wanted to give an answeryes or no  yes then i replied in his own sharp way i can always paint the better when i am hearing an interesting story  what do you mean by talking about a story im not going to tell you a story im going to make a statement a statement is a matter of fact therefore the exact opposite of a story which is a matter of fiction what i am now going to tell you really happened to me  i was glad to see that he settled himself quietly in his chair before he began his odd manners and language made such an impression on me at the time that i think i can repeat his statement now almost word for word as he addressed it to me      the lawyers story of a stolen letter  i served my timenever mind in whose officeand i started in business for myself in one of our english country towns i decline stating which i hadnt a farthing of capital and my friends in the neighborhood were poor and useless enough with one exception that exception was mr frank gatliffe son of mr gatliffe member for the county the richest man and the proudest for many a mile round about our parts stop a bit mr artist you neednt perk up and look knowing you wont trace any particulars by the name of gatliffe im not bound to commit myself or anybody else by mentioning names i have given you the first that came into my head  well mr frank was a stanch friend of mine and ready to recommend me whenever he got the chance i had contrived to get him a little timely helpfor a consideration of coursein borrowing money at a fair rate of interest in fact i had saved him from the jews the money was borrowed while mr frank was at college he came back from college and stopped at home a little while and then there got spread about all our neighborhood a report that he had fallen in love as the saying is with his young sisters governess and that his mind was made up to marry her what youre at it again mr artist you want to know her name dont you what do you think of smith  speaking as a lawyer i consider report in a general way to be a fool and a liar but in this case report turned out to be something very different mr frank told me he was really in love and said upon his honor an absurd expression which young chaps of his age are always using he was determined to marry smith the governessthe sweet darling girl as he called her but im not sentimental and i call her smith the governess well mr franks father being as proud as lucifer said no as to marrying the governess when mr frank wanted him to say yes he was a man of business was old gatliffe and he took the proper business course he sent the governess away with a firstrate character and a spanking present and then he looked about him to get something for mr frank to do while he was looking about mr frank bolted to london after the governess who had nobody alive belonging to her to go to but an aunther fathers sister the aunt refuses to let mr frank in without the squires permission mr frank writes to his father and says he will marry the girl as soon as he is of age or shoot himself up to town comes the squire and his wife and his daughter and a lot of sentimentality not in the slightest degree material to the present statement takes places among them and the upshot of it is that old gatliffe is forced into withdrawing the word no and substituting the word yes  i dont believe he would ever have done it though but for one lucky peculiarity in the case the governesss father was a man of good familypretty nigh as good as gatliffes own he had been in the army had sold out set up as a winemerchantfaileddied ditto his wife as to the dying part of it no relation in fact left for the squire to make inquiries about but the fathers sisterwho had behaved as old gatliffe said like a thoroughbred gentlewoman in shutting the door against mr frank in the first instance so to cut the matter short things were at last made up pleasant enough the time was fixed for the wedding and an announcement about itmarriage in high life and all thatput into the county paper there was a regular biography besides of the governesss father so as to stop people from talkinga great flourish about his pedigree and a long account of his services in the army but not a word mind ye of his having turned winemerchant afterward oh nonot a word about that  i knew it though for mr frank told me he hadnt a bit of pride about him he introduced me to his future wife one day when i met him out walking and asked me if i did not think he was a lucky fellow i dont mind admitting that i did and that i told him so ah but she was one of my sort was that governess stood to the best of my recollection five foot four good lissom figure that looked as if it had never been boxed up in a pair of stays eyes that made me feel as if i was under a pretty stiff crossexamination the moment she looked at me fine red kissandcomeagain sort of lips cheeks and complexionno mr artist you wouldnt identify her by her cheeks and complexion if i drew you a picture of them this very moment she has had a family of children since the time im talking of and her cheeks are a trifle fatter and her complexion is a shade or two redder now than when i first met her out walking with mr frank  the marriage was to take place on a wednesday i decline mentioning the year or the month i had started as an attorney on my own accountsay six weeks more or less and was sitting alone in my office on the monday morning before the weddingday trying to see my way clear before me and not succeeding particularly well when mr frank suddenly bursts in as white as any ghost that ever was painted and says hes got the most dreadful case for me to advise on and not an hour to lose in acting on my advice  is this in the way of business mr frank says i stopping him just as he was beginning to get sentimental yes or no mr frank rapping my new office paperknife on the table to pull him up short all the sooner  my dear fellowhe was always familiar with meits in the way of business certainly but friendship  i was obliged to pull him up short again and regularly examine him as if he had been in the witnessbox or he would have kept me talking to no purpose half the day  now mr frank says i i cant have any sentimentality mixed up with business matters you please to stop talking and let me ask questions answer in the fewest words you can use nod when nodding will do instead of words  i fixed him with my eye for about three seconds as he sat groaning and wriggling in his chair when id done fixing him i gave another rap with my paperknife on the table to startle him up a bit then i went on  from what you have been stating up to the present time says i i gather that you are in a scrape which is likely to interfere seriously with your marriage on wednesday  he nodded and i cut in again before he could say a word  the scrape affects your young lady and goes back to the period of a transaction in which her late father was engaged doesnt it  he nods and i cut in once more  there is a party who turned up after seeing the announcement of your marriage in the paper who is cognizant of what he oughtnt to know and who is prepared to use his knowledge of the same to the prejudice of the young lady and of your marriage unless he receives a sum of money to quiet him very well now first of all mr frank state what you have been told by the young lady herself about the transaction of her late father how did you first come to have any knowledge of it  she was talking to me about her father one day so tenderly and prettily that she quite excited my interest about him begins mr frank and i asked her among other things what had occasioned his death she said she believed it was distress of mind in the first instance and added that this distress was connected with a shocking secret which she and her mother had kept from everybody but which she could not keep from me because she was determined to begin her married life by having no secrets from her husband here mr frank began to get sentimental again and i pulled him up short once more with the paperknife  she told me mr frank went on that the great mistake of her fathers life was his selling out of the army and taking to the wine trade he had no talent for business things went wrong with him from the first his clerk it was strongly suspected cheated him  stop a bit says i what was that suspected clerks name  davager says he  davager says i making a note of it go on mr frank  his affairs got more and more entangled says mr frank he was pressed for money in all directions bankruptcy and consequent dishonor as he considered it stared him in the face his mind was so affected by his troubles that both his wife and daughter toward the last considered him to be hardly responsible for his own acts in this state of desperation and misery he here mr frank began to hesitate  we have two ways in the law of drawing evidence off nice and clear from an unwilling client or witness we give him a fright or we treat him to a joke i treated mr frank to a joke  ah says i i know what he did he had a signature to write and by the most natural mistake in the world he wrote another gentlemans name instead of his owneh  it was to a bill says mr frank looking very crestfallen instead of taking the joke his principal creditor wouldnt wait till he could raise the money or the greater part of it but he was resolved if he sold off everything to get the amount and repay  of course says i drop that the forgery was discovered when  before even the first attempt was made to negotiate the bill he had done the whole thing in the most absurdly and innocently wrong way the person whose name he had used was a stanch friend of his and a relation of his wifesa good man as well as a rich one he had influence with the chief creditor and he used it nobly he had a real affection for the unfortunate mans wife and he proved it generously  come to the point says i what did he do in a business way what did he do  he put the false bill into the fire drew a bill of his own to replace it and thenonly thentold my dear girl and her mother all that had happened can you imagine anything nobler asks mr frank  speaking in my professional capacity i cant imagine anything greener says i where was the father off i suppose  ill in bed says mr frank coloring but he mustered strength enough to write a contrite and grateful letter the same day promising to prove himself worthy of the noble moderation and forgiveness extended to him by selling off everything he possessed to repay his money debt he did sell off everything down to some old family pictures that were heirlooms down to the little plate he had down to the very tables and chairs that furnished his drawingroom every farthing of the debt was paid and he was left to begin the world again with the kindest promises of help from the generous man who had forgiven him it was too late his crime of one rash momentatoned for though it had beenpreyed upon his mind he became possessed with the idea that he had lowered himself forever in the estimation of his wife and daughter and  he died i cut in yes yes we know that lets go back for a minute to the contrite and grateful letter that he wrote my experience in the law mr frank has convinced me that if everybody burned everybody elses letters half the courts of justice in this country might shut up shop do you happen to know whether the letter we are now speaking of contained anything like an avowal or confession of the forgery  of course it did says he could the writer express his contrition properly without making some such confession  quite easy if he had been a lawyer says i but never mind that im going to make a guessa desperate guess mind should i be altogether in error if i thought that this letter had been stolen and that the fingers of mr davager of suspicious commercial celebrity might possibly be the fingers which took it  that is exactly what i wanted to make you understand cried mr frank  how did he communicate the interesting fact of the theft to you  he has not ventured into my presence the scoundrel actually had the audacity  aha says i the young lady herself sharp practitioner mr davager  early this morning when she was walking alone in the shrubbery mr frank goes on he had the assurance to approach her and to say that he had been watching his opportunity of getting a private interview for days past he then showed heractually showed herher unfortunate fathers letter put into her hands another letter directed to me bowed and walked off leaving her half dead with astonishment and terror if i had only happened to be there at the time says mr frank shaking his fist murderously in the air by way of a finish  its the greatest luck in the world that you were not says i have you got that other letter  he handed it to me it was so remarkably humorous and short that i remember every word of it at this distance of time it began in this way  to francis gatliffe esq jun  siri have an extremely curious autograph letter to sell the price is a fivehundredpound note the young lady to whom you are to be married on wednesday will inform you of the nature of the letter and the genuineness of the autograph if you refuse to deal i shall send a copy to the local paper and shall wait on your highlyrespected father with the original curiosity on the afternoon of tuesday next having come down here on family business i have put up at the family hotelbeing to be heard of at the gatliffe arms your very obedient servant alfred davager  a clever fellow that says i putting the letter into my private drawer  clever cries mr frank he ought to be horsewhipped within an inch of his life i would have done it myself but she made me promise before she told me a word of the matter to come straight to you  that was one of the wisest promises you ever made says i we cant afford to bully this fellow whatever else we may do with him do you think i am saying anything libelous against your excellent fathers character when i assert that if he saw the letter he would certainly insist on your marriage being put off at the very least  feeling as my father does about my marriage he would insist on its being dropped altogether if he saw this letter says mr frank with a groan but even that is not the worst of it the generous noble girl herself says that if the letter appears in the paper with all the unanswerable comments this scoundrel would be sure to add to it she would rather die than hold me to my engagement even if my father would let me keep it  as he said this his eyes began to water he was a weak young fellow and ridiculously fond of her i brought him back to business with another rap of the paperknife  hold up mr frank says i i have a question or two more did you think of asking the young lady whether to the best of her knowledge this infernal letter was the only written evidence of the forgery now in existence  yes i did think directly of asking her that says he and she told me she was quite certain that there was no written evidence of the forgery except that one letter  will you give mr davager his price for it says i  yes says mr frank quite peevish with me for asking him such a question he was an easy young chap in money matters and talked of hundreds as most men talk of sixpences  mr frank says i you came here to get my help and advice in this extremely ticklish business and you are ready as i know without asking to remunerate me for all and any of my services at the usual professional rate now ive made up my mind to act boldlydesperately if you likeon the hit or miss win all or lose all principlein dealing with this matter here is my proposal im going to try if i cant do mr davager out of his letter if i dont succeed before tomorrow afternoon you hand him the money and i charge you nothing for professional services if i do succeed i hand you the letter instead of mr davager and you give me the money instead of giving it to him its a precious risk for me but im ready to run it you must pay your five hundred any way what do you say to my plan is it yes mr frank or no  hang your questions cries mr frank jumping up you know its yes ten thousand times over only you earn the money and  and you will be too glad to give it to me very good now go home comfort the young ladydont let mr davager so much as set eyes on youkeep quietleave everything to meand feel as certain as you please that all the letters in the world cant stop your being married on wednesday with these words i hustled him off out of the office for i wanted to be left alone to make my mind up about what i should do  the first thing of course was to have a look at the enemy i wrote to mr davager telling him that i was privately appointed to arrange the little business matter between himself and another party no names on friendly terms and begging him to call on me at his earliest convenience at the very beginning of the case mr davager bothered me his answer was that it would not be convenient to him to call till between six and seven in the evening in this way you see he contrived to make me lose several precious hours at a time when minutes almost were of importance i had nothing for it but to be patient and to give certain instructions before mr davager came to my boy tom  there never was such a sharp boy of fourteen before and there never will be again as my boy tom a spy to look after mr davager was of course the first requisite in a case of this kind and tom was the smallest quickest quietest sharpest stealthiest little snake of a chap that ever dogged a gentlemans steps and kept cleverly out of range of a gentlemans eyes i settled it with the boy that he was not to show at all when mr davager came and that he was to wait to hear me ring the bell when mr davager left if i rang twice he was to show the gentleman out if i rang once he was to keep out of the way and follow the gentleman whereever he went till he got back to the inn those were the only preparations i could make to begin with being obliged to wait and let myself be guided by what turned up  about a quarter to seven my gentleman came  in the profession of the law we get somehow quite remarkably mixed up with ugly people blackguard people and dirty people but far away the ugliest and dirtiest blackguard i ever saw in my life was mr alfred davager he had greasy white hair and a mottled face he was low in the forehead fat in the stomach hoarse in the voice and weak in the legs both his eyes were bloodshot and one was fixed in his head he smelled of spirits and carried a toothpick in his mouth how are you ive just done dinner says he and he lights a cigar sits down with his legs crossed and winks at me  i tried at first to take the measure of him in a wheedling confidential way but it was no good i asked him in a facetious smiling manner how he had got hold of the letter he only told me in answer that he had been in the confidential employment of the writer of it and that he had always been famous since infancy for a sharp eye to his own interests i paid him some compliments but he was not to be flattered i tried to make him lose his temper but he kept it in spite of me it ended in his driving me to my last resourcei made an attempt to frighten him  before we say a word about the money i began let me put a case mr davager the pull you have on mr francis gatliffe is that you can hinder his marriage on wednesday now suppose i have got a magistrates warrant to apprehend you in my pocket suppose i have a constable to execute it in the next room suppose i bring you up tomorrowthe day before the marriagecharge you only generally with an attempt to extort money and apply for a days remand to complete the case suppose as a suspicious stranger you cant get bail in this town suppose  stop a bit says mr davager suppose i should not be the greenest fool that ever stood in shoes suppose i should not carry the letter about me suppose i should have given a certain envelope to a certain friend of mine in a certain place in this town suppose the letter should be inside that envelope directed to old gatliffe side by side with a copy of the letter directed to the editor of the local paper suppose my friend should be instructed to open the envelope and take the letters to their right address if i dont appear to claim them from him this evening in short my dear sir suppose you were born yesterday and suppose i wasnt says mr davager and winks at me again  he didnt take me by surprise for i never expected that he had the letter about him i made a pretense of being very much taken aback and of being quite ready to give in we settled our business about delivering the letter and handing over the money in no time i was to draw out a document which he was to sign he knew the document was stuff and nonsense just as well as i did and told me i was only proposing it to swell my clients bill sharp as he was he was wrong there the document was not to be drawn out to gain money from mr frank but to gain time from mr davager it served me as an excuse to put off the payment of the five hundred pounds till three oclock on the tuesday afternoon the tuesday morning mr davager said he should devote to his amusement and asked me what sights were to be seen in the neighborhood of the town when i had told him he pitched his toothpick into my grate yawned and went out  i rang the bell oncewaited till he had passed the windowand then looked after tom there was my jewel of a boy on the opposite side of the street just setting his top going in the most playful manner possible mr davager walked away up the street toward the marketplace tom whipped his top up the street toward the marketplace too  in a quarter of an hour he came back with all his evidence collected in a beautifully clear and compact state mr davager had walked to a publichouse just outside the town in a lane leading to the highroad on a bench outside the publichouse there sat a man smoking he said all right and gave a letter to mr davager who answered all right and walked back to the inn in the hall he ordered hot rumandwater cigars slippers and a fire to be lit in his room after that he went upstairs and tom came away  i now saw my road clear before menot very far on but still clear i had housed the letter in all probability for that night at the gatliffe arms after tipping tom i gave him directions to play about the door of the inn and refresh himself when he was tired at the tartshop opposite eating as much as he pleased on the understanding that he crammed all the time with his eye on the window if mr davager went out or mr davagers friend called on him tom was to let me know he was also to take a little note from me to the head chambermaidan old friend of mineasking her to step over to my office on a private matter of business as soon as her work was done for that night after settling these little matters having half an hour to spare i turned to and did myself a bloater at the office fire and had a drop of ginandwater hot and felt comparatively happy  when the head chambermaid came it turned out as good luck would have it that mr davager had drawn her attention rather too closely to his ugliness by offering her a testimony of his regard in the shape of a kiss i no sooner mentioned him than she flew into a passion and when i added by way of clinching the matter that i was retained to defend the interests of a very beautiful and deserving young lady name not referred to of course against the most cruel underhand treachery on the part of mr davager the head chambermaid was ready to go any lengths that she could safely to serve my cause in a few words i discovered that boots was to call mr davager at eight the next morning and was to take his clothes downstairs to brush as usual if mr d had not emptied his own pockets overnight we arranged that boots was to forget to empty them for him and was to bring the clothes downstairs just as he found them if mr ds pockets were emptied then of course it would be necessary to transfer the searching process to mr ds room under any circumstances i was certain of the head chambermaid and under any circumstances also the head chambermaid was certain of boots  i waited till tom came home looking very puffy and bilious about the face but as to his intellects if anything rather sharper than ever his report was uncommonly short and pleasant the inn was shutting up mr davager was going to bed in rather a drunken condition mr davagers friend had never appeared i sent tom properly instructed about keeping our man in view all the next morning to his shakedown behind the officedesk where i heard him hiccoughing half the night as even the best boys will when overexcited and too full of tarts  at halfpast seven next morning i slipped quietly into bootss pantry  down came the clothes no pockets in trousers waistcoatpockets empty coatpockets with something in them first handkerchief secondly bunch of keys thirdly cigarcase fourthly pocketbook of course i wasnt such a fool as to expect to find the letter there but i opened the pocketbook with a certain curiosity notwithstanding  nothing in the two pockets of the book but some old advertisements cut out of newspapers a lock of hair tied round with a dirty bit of ribbon a circular letter about a loan society and some copies of verses not likely to suit any company that was not of an extremely freeandeasy description on the leaves of the pocketbook peoples addresses scrawled in pencil and bets jotted down in red ink on one leaf by itself this queer inscription  mem 5 along 4 across  i understood everything but those words and figures so of course i copied them out into my own book  then i waited in the pantry till boots had brushed the clothes and had taken them upstairs his report when he came down was that mr d had asked if it was a fine morning being told that it was he had ordered breakfast at nine and a saddlehorse to be at the door at ten to take him to grimwith abbeyone of the sights in our neighborhood which i had told him of the evening before  ill be here coming in by the back way at halfpast ten says i to the head chambermaid  what for says she  to take the responsibility of making mr davagers bed off your hands for this morning only says i  any more orders says she  one more says i i want to hire sam for the morning put it down in the orderbook that hes to be brought round to my office at ten  in case you should think sam was a man id better perhaps tell you he was a pony id made up my mind that it would be beneficial to toms health after the tarts if he took a constitutional airing on a nice hard saddle in the direction of grimwith abbey  anything else says the head chambermaid  only one more favor says i would my boy tom be very much in the way if he came from now till ten to help with the boots and shoes and stood at his work close by this window which looks out on the staircase  not a bit says the head chambermaid  thank you says i and stepped back to my office directly  when i had sent tom off to help with the boots and shoes i reviewed the whole case exactly as it stood at that time  there were three things mr davager might do with the letter he might give it to his friend again before tenin which case tom would most likely see the said friend on the stairs he might take it to his friend or to some other friend after tenin which case tom was ready to follow him on sam the pony and lastly he might leave it hidden somewhere in his room at the innin which case i was all ready for him with a searchwarrant of my own granting under favor always of my friend the head chambermaid so far i had my business arrangements all gathered up nice and compact in my own hands only two things bothered me the terrible shortness of the time at my disposal in case i failed in my first experiments for getting hold of the letter and that queer inscription which i had copied out of the pocketbook  mem 5 along 4 across  it was the measurement most likely of something and he was afraid of forgetting it therefore it was something important querysomething about himself say 5 inches alonghe doesnt wear a wig say 5 feet alongit cant be coat waistcoat trousers or underclothing say 5 yards alongit cant be anything about himself unless he wears round his body the rope that hes sure to be hanged with one of these days then it is not something about himself what do i know of that is important to him besides i know of nothing but the letter can the memorandum be connected with that say yes what do 5 along and 4 across mean then the measurement of something he carries about with him or the measurement of something in his room i could get pretty satisfactorily to myself as far as that but i could get no further  tom came back to the office and reported him mounted for his ride his friend had never appeared i sent the boy off with his proper instructions on sams backwrote an encouraging letter to mr frank to keep him quietthen slipped into the inn by the back way a little before halfpast ten the head chambermaid gave me a signal when the landing was clear i got into his room without a soul but her seeing me and locked the door immediately  the case was to a certain extent simplified now either mr davager had ridden out with the letter about him or he had left it in some safe hidingplace in his room i suspected it to be in his room for a reason that will a little astonish youhis trunk his dressingcase and all the drawers and cupboards were left open i knew my customer and i thought this extraordinary carelessness on his part rather suspicious  mr davager had taken one of the best bedrooms at the gatliffe arms floor carpeted all over walls beautifully papered fourposter and general furniture firstrate i searched to begin with on the usual plan examining everything in every possible way and taking more than an hour about it no discovery then i pulled out a carpenters rule which i had brought with me was there anything in the room whicheither in inches feet or yardsanswered to 5 along and 4 across nothing i put the rule back in my pocketmeasurement was no good evidently was there anything in the room that would count up to 5 one way and 4 another seeing that nothing would measure up to it i had got obstinately persuaded by this time that the letter must be in the roomprincipally because of the trouble i had had in looking after it and persuading myself of that i took it into my head next just as obstinately that 5 along and 4 across must be the right clew to find the letter byprincipally because i hadnt left myself after all my searching and thinking even so much as the ghost of another guide to go by five alongwhere could i count five along the room in any part of it  not on the paper the pattern there was pillars of trelliswork and flowers inclosing a plain green groundonly four pillars along the wall and only two across the furniture there were not five chairs or five separate pieces of any furniture in the room altogether the fringes that hung from the cornice of the bed plenty of them at any rate up i jumped on the counterpane with my penknife in my hand every way that 5 along and 4 across could be reckoned on those unlucky fringes i reckoned on themprobed with my penknifescratched with my nailscrunched with my fingers no use not a sign of a letter and the time was getting onoh lord how the time did get on in mr davagers room that morning  i jumped down from the bed so desperate at my ill luck that i hardly cared whether anybody heard me or not quite a little cloud of dust rose at my feet as they thumped on the carpet  hullo thought i my friend the head chambermaid takes it easy here nice state for a carpet to be in in one of the best bedrooms at the gatliffe arms carpet i had been jumping up on the bed and staring up at the walls but i had never so much as given a glance down at the carpet think of me pretending to be a lawyer and not knowing how to look low enough  the carpet it had been a stout article in its time had evidently began in a drawingroom then descended to a coffeeroom then gone upstairs altogether to a bedroom the ground was brown and the pattern was bunches of leaves and roses speckled over the ground at regular distances i reckoned up the bunches ten along the roomeight across it when i had stepped out five one way and four the other and was down on my knees on the center bunch as true as i sit on this chair i could hear my own heart beating so loud that it quite frightened me  i looked narrowly all over the bunch and i felt all over it with the ends of my fingers and nothing came of that then i scraped it over slowly and gently with my nails my second fingernail stuck a little at one place i parted the pile of the carpet over that place and saw a thin slit which had been hidden by the pile being smoothed over ita slit about half an inch long with a little end of brown thread exactly the color of the carpet ground sticking out about a quarter of an inch from the middle of it just as i laid hold of the thread gently i heard a footstep outside the door  it was only the head chambermaid havent you done yet she whispers  give me two minutes says i and dont let anybody come near the doorwhatever you do dont let anybody startle me again by coming near the door  i took a little pull at the thread and heard something rustle i took a longer pull and out came a piece of paper rolled up tight like those candlelighters that the ladies make i unrolled itand by george there was the letter  the original letter i knew it by the color of the ink the letter that was worth five hundred pounds to me it was all that i could do to keep myself at first from throwing my hat into the air and hurrahing like mad i had to take a chair and sit quiet in it for a minute or two before i could cool myself down to my proper business level i knew that i was safely down again when i found myself pondering how to let mr davager know that he had been done by the innocent country attorney after all  it was not long before a nice little irritating plan occurred to me i tore a blank leaf out of my pocketbook wrote on it with my pencil change for a fivehundredpound note folded up the paper tied the thread to it poked it back into the hidingplace smoothed over the pile of the carpet and then bolted off to mr frank he in his turn bolted off to show the letter to the young lady who first certified to its genuineness then dropped it into the fire and then took the initiative for the first time since her marriage engagement by flinging her arms round his neck kissing him with all her might and going into hysterics in his arms so at least mr frank told me but thats not evidence it is evidence however that i saw them married with my own eyes on the wednesday and that while they went off in a carriageandfour to spend the honeymoon i went off on my own legs to open a credit at the town and county bank with a fivehundredpound note in my pocket  as to mr davager i can tell you nothing more about him except what is derived from hearsay evidence which is always unsatisfactory evidence even in a lawyers mouth  my inestimable boy tom although twice kicked off by sam the pony never lost hold of the bridle and kept his man in sight from first to last he had nothing particular to report except that on the way out to the abbey mr davager had stopped at the publichouse had spoken a word or two to his friend of the night before and had handed him what looked like a bit of paper this was no doubt a clew to the thread that held the letter to be used in case of accidents in every other respect mr d had ridden out and ridden in like an ordinary sightseer tom reported him to me as having dismounted at the hotel about two at halfpast i locked my office door nailed a card under the knocker with not at home till tomorrow written on it and retired to a friends house a mile or so out of the town for the rest of the day  mr davager i have been since given to understand left the gatliffe arms that same night with his best clothes on his back and with all the valuable contents of his dressingcase in his pockets i am not in a condition to state whether he ever went through the form of asking for his bill or not but i can positively testify that he never paid it and that the effects left in his bedroom did not pay it either when i add to these fragments of evidence that he and i have never met luckily for me you will say since i jockeyed him out of his banknote i have about fulfilled my implied contract as maker of a statement with you sir as hearer of a statement observe the expression will you i said it was a statement before i began and i say its a statement now ive done i defy you to prove its a story how are you getting on with my portrait i like you very well mr artist but if you have been taking advantage of my talking to shirk your work as sure as youre alive ill split upon you to the town council   i attended a great many times at my queer sitters house before his likeness was completed to the last he was dissatisfied with the progress i made fortunately for me the town council approved of the portrait when it was done mr boxsious however objected to them as being much too easy to please he did not dispute the fidelity of the likeness but he asserted that i had not covered the canvas with half paint enough for my money to this day for he is still alive he describes me to all inquiring friends as the painterman who jockeyed the town council     prologue to the third story  it was a sad day for me when mr lanfray of rockleigh place discovering that his youngest daughters health required a warm climate removed from his english establishment to the south of france roving from place to place as i am obliged to do though i make many acquaintances i keep but few friends the nature of my calling is i am quite aware mainly answerable for this people cannot be blamed for forgetting a man who on leaving their houses never can tell them for certain when he is likely to be in their neighborhood again  mr lanfray was one of the few exceptional persons who always remembered me i have proofs of his friendly interest in my welfare in the shape of letters which i treasure with grateful care the last of these is an invitation to his house in the south of france there is little chance at present of my being able to profit by his kindness but i like to read his invitation from time to time for it makes me fancy in my happier moments that i may one day really be able to accept it  my introduction to this gentleman in my capacity of portraitpainter did not promise much for me in a professional point of view i was invited to rockleighor to the place as it was more frequently called among the people of the countyto take a likeness in watercolors on a small scale of the french governess who lived with mr lanfrays daughters my first idea on hearing of this was that the governess was about to leave her situation and that her pupils wished to have a memorial of her in the shape of a portrait subsequent inquiry however informed me that i was in error it was the eldest of mr lanfrays daughters who was on the point of leaving the house to accompany her husband to india and it was for her that the portrait had been ordered as a home remembrance of her best and dearest friend besides these particulars i discovered that the governess though still called mademoiselle was an old lady that mr lanfray had been introduced to her many years since in france after the death of his wife that she was absolute mistress in the house and that her three pupils had always looked up to her as a second mother from the time when their father first placed them under her charge  these scraps of information made me rather anxious to see mademoiselle clairfait the governess  on the day appointed for my attendance at the comfortable country house of rockleigh i was detained on the road and did not arrive at my destination until late in the evening the welcome accorded to me by mr lanfray gave an earnest of the unvarying kindness that i was to experience at his hands in afterlife i was received at once on equal terms as if i had been a friend of the family and was presented the same evening to my hosts daughters they were not merely three elegant and attractive young women butwhat means much more than thatthree admirable subjects for pictures the bride particularly her young husband did not strike me much at first sight he seemed rather shy and silent after i had been introduced to him i looked round for mademoiselle clairfait but she was not present and i was soon afterward informed by mr lanfray that she always spent the latter part of the evening in her own room  at the breakfasttable the next morning i again looked for my sitter and once more in vain mamma as we call her said one of the ladies is dressing expressly for her picture mr kerby i hope you are not above painting silk lace and jewelry the dear old lady who is perfection in everything else is perfection also in dress and is bent on being painted in all her splendor  this explanation prepared me for something extraordinary but i found that my anticipations had fallen far below the reality when mademoiselle clairfait at last made her appearance and announced that she was ready to sit for her portrait  never before or since have i seen such perfect dressing and such active old age in combination mademoiselle was short and thin her face was perfectly white all over the skin being puckered up in an infinite variety of the smallest possible wrinkles her bright black eyes were perfect marvels of youthfulness and vivacity they sparkled and beamed and ogled and moved about over everybody and everything at such a rate that the plain gray hair above them looked unnaturally venerable and the wrinkles below an artful piece of masquerade to represent old age as for her dress i remember few harder pieces of work than the painting of it she wore a silvergray silk gown that seemed always flashing out into some new light whenever she moved it was as stiff as a board and rustled like the wind her head neck and bosom were enveloped in clouds of the airiestlooking lace i ever saw disposed about each part of her with the most exquisite grace and propriety and glistening at all sorts of unexpected places with little fairylike toys in gold and precious stones on her right wrist she wore three small bracelets with the hair of her three pupils worked into them and on her left one large bracelet with a miniature let in over the clasp she had a dark crimson and gold scarf thrown coquettishly over her shoulders and held a lovely little featherfan in her hand when she first presented herself before me in this costume with a brisk courtesy and a bright smile filling the room with perfume and gracefully flirting the featherfan i lost all confidence in my powers as a portraitpainter immediately the brightest colors in my box looked dowdy and dim and i myself felt like an unwashed unbrushed unpresentable sloven  tell me my angels said mademoiselle apostrophizing her pupils in the prettiest foreign english am i the cream of all creams this morning do i carry my sixty years resplendently will the savages in india when my own love exhibits my picture among them say ah smart smart this was a great dandy and the gentleman the skillful artist whom it is even more an honor than a happiness to meet does he approve of me for a model does he find me pretty and paintable from top to toe here she dropped me another brisk courtesy placed herself in a languishing position in the sitters chair and asked us all if she looked like a shepherdess in dresden china  the young ladies burst out laughing and mademoiselle as gay as any of them and a great deal shriller joined in the merriment never before had i contended with any sitter half as restless as that wonderful old lady no sooner had i begun than she jumped out of the chair and exclaiming grand dieu i have forgotten to embrace my angels this morning ran up to her pupils raised herself on tiptoe before them in quick succession put the two first fingers of each hand under their ears kissed them lightly on both cheeks and was back again in the chair before an english governess could have said goodmorning my dears i hope you all slept well last night  i began again up jumped mademoiselle for the second time and tripped across the room to a chevalglass no i heard her say to herself i have not discomposed my head in kissing my angels i may come back and pose for my picture  back she came i worked from her for five minutes at the most stop cries mademoiselle jumping up for the third time i must see how this skillful artist is getting on grand dieu why he has done nothing  for the fourth time i began and for the fourth time the old lady started out of her chair now i must repose myself said mademoiselle walking lightly from end to end of the room and humming a french air by way of taking a rest  i was at my wits end and the young ladies saw it they all surrounded my unmanageable sitter and appealed to her compassion for me certainly said mademoiselle expressing astonishment by flinging up both her hands with all the fingers spread out in the air but why apostrophize me thus i am here i am ready i am at the service of this skillful artist why apostrophize me  a fortunate chance question of mine steadied her for some time i inquired if i was expected to draw the whole of my sitters figure as well as her face mademoiselle replied by a comic scream of indignation if i was the brave and gifted man for whom she took me i ought to be ready to perish rather than leave out an inch of her anywhere dress was her passion and it would be an outrage on her sentiments if i did not do full justice to everything she had onto her robe to her lace to her scarf to her fan to her rings her jewels and above all to her bracelets i groaned in spirit at the task before me but made my best bow of acquiescence mademoiselle was not to be satisfied by a mere bow she desired the pleasure of specially directing my attention if i would be so amiable as to get up and approach her to one of her bracelets in particularthe bracelet with the miniature on her left wrist it had been the gift of the dearest friend she ever had and the miniature represented that friends beloved and beautiful face could i make a tiny tiny copy of that likeness in my drawing would i only be so obliging as to approach for one little moment and see if such a thing were possible  i obeyed unwillingly enough expecting from mademoiselles expression to see a commonplace portrait of some unfortunate admirer whom she had treated with unmerited severity in the days of her youth to my astonishment i found that the miniature which was very beautifully painted represented a womans facea young woman with kind sad eyes pale delicate cheeks light hair and such a pure tender lovely expressions that i thought of raphaels madonnas the moment i looked at her portrait  the old lady observed the impression which the miniature produced on me and nodded her head in silence what a beautiful innocent pure face i said  mademoiselle clairfait gently brushed a particle of dust from the miniature with her handkerchief and kissed it i have three angels still left she said looking at her pupils they console me for the fourth who has gone to heaven  she patted the face on the miniature gently with her little withered white fingers as if it had been a living thing sister rose she sighed to herself then looking up again at me said i should like it put into my portrait sir because i have always worn it since i was a young woman for sister roses sake  the sudden change in her manner from the extreme of flighty gayety to the extreme of quiet sadness would have looked theatrical in a woman of any other nation it seemed however perfectly natural and appropriate in her i went back to my drawing rather perplexed who was sister rose not one of the lanfray family apparently the composure of the young ladies when the name was mentioned showed plainly enough that the original of the miniature had been no relation of theirs  i tried to stifle my curiosity on the subject of sister rose by giving myself entirely to my work for a full halfhour mademoiselle clairfait sat quietly before me with her hands crossed on her lap and her eyes fixed on the bracelet this happy alteration enabled me to do something toward completing the outline of her face and figure i might even under fortunate circumstances have vanquished the preliminary difficulties of my task at one effort but the fates were against me that day while i was still working rapidly and to my satisfaction a servant knocked at the door to announce luncheon and mademoiselle lightly roused herself from her serious reflection and her quiet position in a moment  ah me she said turning the miniature round on her wrist till it was out of sight what animals we are after all the spiritual part of us is at the mercy of the stomach my heart is absorbed by tender thoughts yet i am not the less ready for luncheon come my children and fellowmortals allons cultiver notre jardin  with this quotation from candide plaintively delivered the old lady led the way out of the room and was followed by her younger pupils the eldest sister remained behind for a moment and reminded me that the lunch was ready  i am afraid you have found the dear old soul rather an unruly sitter she said noticing the look of dissatisfaction with which i was regarding my drawing but she will improve as you go on she has done better already for the last halfhour has she not  much better i answered my admiration of the miniature on the bracelet seemedi suppose by calling up some old associationsto have a strangely soothing effect on mademoiselle clairfait  ah yes only remind her of the original of that portrait and you change her directly whatever she may have been saying or doing the moment before sometimes she talks of sister rose and of all that she went through in the time of the french revolution by the hour together it is wonderfully interestingat least we all think so  i presume that the lady described as sister rose was a relation of mademoiselle clairfaits  no only a very dear friend mademoiselle clairfait is the daughter of a silkmercer once established at chalonssurmarne her father happened to give an asylum in his office to a lonely old man to whom sister rose and her brother had been greatly indebted in the revolutionary time and out of a train of circumstances connected with that the first acquaintance between mademoiselle and the friend whose portrait she wears arose after the time of her fathers bankruptcy and for many years before we were placed under her charge our good old governess lived entirely with sister rose and her brother she must then have heard all the interesting things that she has since often repeated to my sisters and myself  might i suggest said i after an instants consideration that the best way to give me a fair chance of studying mademoiselle clairfaits face at the next sitting would be to lead her thoughts again to that quieting subject of the miniature and to the events which the portrait recalls it is really the only plan after what i have observed this morning that i can think of for enabling me to do myself and my sitter justice  i am delighted to hear you say so replied the lady for the execution of your plan by me or by my sisters will be the easiest thing in the world a word from us at any time will set mademoiselle thinking and talking too of the friend of her youthful days depend on our assistance so far and now let me show you the way to the luncheontable    two good results followed the ready rendering of the help i had asked from my hosts daughters i succeeded with my portrait of mademoiselle clairfait and i heard the story which occupies the following pages  in the case of the preceding narratives i have repeated what was related to me as nearly as possible in the very words of my sitters in the case of this third story it is impossible for me to proceed upon the same plan the circumstances of sister roses eventful history were narrated to me at different times and in the most fragmentary and discursive manner mademoiselle clairfait characteristically mixed up with the direct interest of her story not only references to places and people which had no recognizable connection with it but outbursts of passionate political declamation on the extreme liberal sideto say nothing of little tender apostrophes to her beloved friend which sounded very prettily as she spoke them but which would lose their effect altogether by being transferred to paper under these circumstances i have thought it best to tell the story in my own wayrigidly adhering to the events of it exactly as they were related and never interfering on my own responsibility except to keep order in the march of the incidents and to present them to the best of my ability variously as well as interestingly to the reader     the french governesss story of sister rose     part first    chapter i  well monsieur guillaume what is the news this evening  none that i know of monsieur justin except that mademoiselle rose is to be married tomorrow  much obliged my respectable old friend for so interesting and unexpected a reply to my question considering that i am the valet of monsieur danville who plays the distinguished part of bridegroom in the little wedding comedy to which you refer i think i may assure you without offense that your news is so far as i am concerned of the stalest possible kind take a pinch of snuff monsieur guillaume and excuse me if i inform you that my question referred to public news and not to the private affairs of the two families whose household interests we have the pleasure of promoting  i dont understand what you mean by such a phrase as promoting household interests monsieur justin i am the servant of monsieur louis trudaine who lives here with his sister mademoiselle rose you are the servant of monsieur danville whose excellent mother has made up the match for him with my young lady as servants both of us the pleasantest news we can have any concern with is news that is connected with the happiness of our masters i have nothing to do with public affairs and being one of the old school i make it my main object in life to mind my own business if our homely domestic politics have no interests for you allow me to express my regret and to wish you a very goodevening  pardon me my dear sir i have not the slightest respect for the old school or the least sympathy with people who only mind their own business however i accept your expressions of regret i reciprocate your goodevening and i trust to find you improved in temper dress manners and appearance the next time i have the honor of meeting you adieu monsieur guillaume and vive la bagatelle  these scraps of dialogue were interchanged on a lovely summer evening in the year seventeen hundred and eightynine before the back door of a small house which stood on the banks of the seine about three miles westward of the city of rouen the one speaker was lean old crabbed and slovenly the other was plump young oilymannered and dressed in the most gorgeous livery costume of the period the last days of genuine dandyism were then rapidly approaching all over the civilized world and monsieur justin was in his own way dressed to perfection as a living illustration of the expiring glories of his epoch  after the old servant had left him he occupied himself for a few minutes in contemplating superciliously enough the back view of the little house before which he stood judging by the windows it did not contain more than six or eight rooms in all instead of stables and outhouses there was a conservatory attached to the building on one side and a low long room built of wood gayly painted on the other one of the windows of this room was left uncurtained and through it could be seen on a sort of dresser inside bottles filled with strangelycolored liquids oddlyshaped utensils of brass and copper one end of a large furnace and other objects which plainly proclaimed that the apartment was used as a chemical laboratory  think of our brides brother amusing himself in such a place as that with cooking drugs in saucepans muttered monsieur justin peeping into the room i am the least particular man in the universe but i must say i wish we were not going to be connected by marriage with an amateur apothecary pah i can smell the place through the window  with these words monsieur justin turned his back on the laboratory in disgust and sauntered toward the cliffs overhanging the river  leaving the garden attached to the house he ascended some gently rising ground by a winding path arrived at the summit the whole view of the seine with its lovely green islands its banks fringed with trees its gliding boats and little scattered waterside cottages opened before him westward where the level country appeared beyond the further bank of the river the landscape was all aglow with the crimson of the setting sun eastward the long shadows and mellow intervening lights the red glory that quivered on the rippling water the steady ruby fire glowing on cottage windows that reflected the level sunlight led the eye onward and onward along the windings of the seine until it rested upon the spires towers and broadlymassed houses of rouen with the wooded hills rising beyond them for background lovely to look on at any time the view was almost supernaturally beautiful now under the gorgeous evening light that glowed up in it all its attractions however were lost on the valet he stood yawning with his hands in his pockets looking neither to the right nor to the left but staring straight before him at a little hollow beyond which the ground sloped away smoothly to the brink of the cliff a bench was placed here and three personsan old lady a gentleman and a young girlwere seated on it watching the sunset and by consequence turning their backs on monsieur justin near them stood two gentlemen also looking toward the river and the distant view these five figures attracted the valets attention to the exclusion of every other object around him  there they are still he said to himself discontentedly madame danville in the same place on the seat my master the bridegroom dutifully next to her mademoiselle rose the bride bashfully next to him monsieur trudaine the amateur apothecary brother affectionately next to her and monsieur lomaque our queer landsteward officially in waiting on the whole party there they all are indeed incomprehensibly wasting their time still in looking at nothing yes continued monsieur justin lifting his eyes wearily and staring hard first up the river at rouen then down the river at the setting sun yes plague take them looking at nothing absolutely and positively at nothing all this while  here monsieur justin yawned again and returning to the garden sat himself down in an arbor and resignedly went to sleep  if the valet had ventured near the five persons whom he had been apostrophizing from a distance and if he had been possessed of some little refinement of observation he could hardly have failed to remark that the bride and bridegroom of the morrow and their companions on either side were all in a greater or less degree under the influence of some secret restraint which affected their conversation their gestures and even the expression of their faces madame danvillea handsome richlydressed old lady with very bright eyes and a quick suspicious mannerlooked composedly and happily enough as long as her attention was fixed on her son but when she turned from him toward the bride a hardly perceptible uneasiness passed over her facean uneasiness which only deepened to positive distrust and dissatisfaction whenever she looked toward mademoiselle trudaines brother in the same way her son who was all smiles and happiness while he was speaking with his future wife altered visibly in manner and look exactly as his mother altered whenever the presence of monsieur trudaine specially impressed itself on his attention then again lomaque the landstewardquiet sharp skinny lomaque with the submissive manner and the redrimmed eyesnever looked up at his masters future brotherinlaw without looking away again rather uneasily and thoughtfully drilling holes in the grass with his long sharppointed cane even the bride herselfthe pretty innocent girl with her childish shyness of mannerseemed to be affected like the others doubt if not distress overshadowed her face from time to time and the hand which her lover held trembled a little and grew restless when she accidentally caught her brothers eye  strangely enough there was nothing to repel but on the contrary everything to attract in the look and manner of the person whose mere presence seemed to exercise such a curiously constraining influence over the weddingparty louis trudaine was a remarkably handsome man his expression was singularly kind and gentle his manner irresistibly winning in its frank manly firmness and composure his words when he occasionally spoke seemed as unlikely to give offense as his looks for he only opened his lips in courteous reply to questions directly addressed to him judging by a latent mournfulness in the tones of his voice and by the sorrowful tenderness which clouded his kind earnest eyes whenever they rested on his sister his thoughts were certainly not of the happy or the hopeful kind but he gave them no direct expression he intruded his secret sadness whatever it might be on no one of his companions nevertheless modest and selfrestrained as he was there was evidently some reproving or saddening influence in his presence which affected the spirits of every one near him and darkened the eve of the wedding to bride and bridegroom alike  as the sun slowly sank in the heavens the conversation flagged more and more after a long silence the bridegroom was the first to start a new subject  rose love he said that magnificent sunset is a good omen for our marriage it promises another lovely day tomorrow  the bride laughed and blushed  do you really believe in omens charles she said  my dear interposed the old lady before her son could answer if charles does believe in omens it is nothing to laugh at you will soon know better when you are his wife than to confound him even in the slightest things with the common herd of people all his convictions are well foundedso well that if i thought he really did believe in omens i should most assuredly make up my mind to believe in them too  i beg your pardon madame rose began tremulously i only meant  my dear child have you so little knowledge of the world as to suppose that i could be offended  let rose speak said the young man  he turned round petulantly almost with the air of a spoiled child to his mother as he said those words she had been looking fondly and proudly on him the moment before now her eyes wandered disconcertedly from his face she hesitated an instant with a sudden confusion which seemed quite foreign to her character then whispered in his ear  am i to blame charles for trying to make her worthy of you  her son took no notice of the question he only reiterated sharply let rose speak  i really had nothing to say faltered the young girl growing more and more confused  oh but you had  there was such an ungracious sharpness in his voice such an outburst of petulance in his manner as he spoke that his mother gave him a warning touch on the arm and whispered hush  monsieur lomaque the landsteward and monsieur trudaine the brother both glanced searchingly at the bride as the words passed the bridegrooms lips she seemed to be frightened and astonished rather than irritated or hurt a curious smile puckered up lomaques lean face as he looked demurely down on the ground and began drilling a fresh hole in the turf with the sharp point of his cane trudaine turned aside quickly and sighing walked away a few paces then came back and seemed about to speak but danville interrupted him  pardon me rose he said i am so jealous of even the appearance of any want of attention toward you that i was nearly allowing myself to be irritated about nothing  he kissed her hand very gracefully and tenderly as he made his excuse but there was a latent expression in his eye which was at variance with the apparent spirit of his action it was noticed by nobody but observant and submissive monsieur lomaque who smiled to himself again and drilled harder than ever at his hole in the grass  i think monsieur trudaine was about to speak said madame danville perhaps he will have no objection to let us hear what he was going to say  none madame replied trudaine politely i was about to take upon myself the blame of roses want of respect for believers in omens by confessing that i have always encouraged her to laugh at superstitions of every kind  you a ridiculer of superstitions said danville turning quickly on him you who have built a laboratory you who are an amateur professor of the occult arts of chemistrya seeker after the elixir of life on my word of honor you astonish me  there was an ironical politeness in his voice look and manner as he said this which his mother and his landsteward monsieur lomaque evidently knew how to interpret the first touched his arm again and whispered be careful the second suddenly grew serious and left off drilling his hole in the grass rose neither heard the warning of madame danville nor noticed the alteration in lomaque she was looking round at her brother and was waiting with a bright affectionate smile to hear his answer he nodded as if to reassure her before he spoke again to danville  you have rather romantic ideas about experiments in chemistry he said quietly mine have so little connection with what you call the occult arts that all the world might see them if all the world thought it worth while the only elixirs of life that i know of are a quiet heart and a contented mind both those i found years and years ago when rose and i first came to live together in the house yonder  he spoke with a quiet sadness in his voice which meant far more to his sister than the simple words he uttered her eyes filled with tears she turned for a moment from her lover and took her brothers hand dont talk louis as if you thought you were going to lose your sister because her lips began to tremble and she stopped suddenly  more jealous than ever of your taking her away from him whispered madame danville in her sons ear hush dont for gods sake take any notice of it she added hurriedly as he rose from the seat and faced trudaine with undisguised irritation and impatience in his manner before he could speak the old servant guillaume made his appearance and announced that coffee was ready madame danville again said hush and quickly took one of his arms while he offered the other to rose charles said the young girl amazedly how flushed your face is and how your arm trembles  he controlled himself in a moment smiled and said to her cant you guess why rose i am thinking of tomorrow while he was speaking he passed close by the landsteward on his way back to the house with the ladies the smile returned to monsieur lomaques lean face and a curious light twinkled in his redrimmed eyes as he began a fresh hole in the grass  wont you go indoors and take some coffee asked trudaine touching the landsteward on the arm  monsieur lomaque started a little and left his cane sticking in the ground a thousand thanks monsieur he said may i be allowed to follow you  i confess the beauty of the evening makes me a little unwilling to leave this place just yet  ah the beauties of naturei feel them with you monsieur trudaine i feel them here saying this lomaque laid one hand on his heart and with the other pulled his stick out of the grass he had looked as little at the landscape or the setting sun as monsieur justin himself  they sat down side by side on the empty bench and then there followed an awkward pause submissive lomaque was too discreet to forget his place and venture on starting a new topic trudaine was preoccupied and disinclined to talk it was necessary however in common politeness to say something hardly attending himself to his own words he began with a commonplace phrase i regret monsieur lomaque that we have not had more opportunities of bettering our acquaintance  i feel deeply indebted rejoined the landsteward to the admirable madame danville for having chosen me as her escort hither from her sons estate near lyons and having thereby procured for me the honor of this introduction both monsieur lomaques redrimmed eyes were seized with a sudden fit of winking as he made this polite speech his enemies were accustomed to say that whenever he was particularly insincere or particularly deceitful he always took refuge in the weakness of his eyes and so evaded the trying ordeal of being obliged to look steadily at the person whom he was speaking with  i was pleased to hear you mention my late fathers name at dinner in terms of high respect continued trudaine resolutely keeping up the conversation did you know him  i am indirectly indebted to your excellent father answered the landsteward for the very situation which i now hold at a time when the good word of a man of substance and reputation was needed to save me from poverty and ruin your father spoke that word since then i have in my own very small way succeeded in life until i have risen to the honor of superintending the estate of monsieur danville  excuse me but your way of speaking of your present situation rather surprises me your father i believe was a merchant just as danvilles father was a merchant the only difference between them was that one failed and the other realized a large fortune why should you speak of yourself as honored by holding your present place  have you never heard exclaimed lomaque with an appearance of great astonishment or can you have heard and forgotten that madame danville is descended from one of the noble houses of france has she never told you as she has often told me that she condescended when she married her late husband and that her great object in life is to get the title of her family years since extinct in the male line settled on her son  yes replied trudaine i remember to have heard something of this and to have paid no great attention to it at the time having little sympathy with such aspirations as you describe you have lived many years in danvilles service monsieur lomaque have youhe hesitated for a moment then continued looking the landsteward full in the facehave you found him a good and kind master  lomaques thin lips seemed to close instinctively at the question as if he were never going to speak again he bowedtrudaine waitedhe only bowed again trudaine waited a third time lomaque looked at his host with perfect steadiness for an instant then his eyes began to get weak again you seem to have some special interest he quietly remarked if i may say so without offense in asking me that question  i deal frankly at all hazards with every one returned trudaine and stranger as you are i will deal frankly with you i acknowledge that i have an interest in asking that questionthe dearest the tenderest of all interests at those last words his voice trembled for a moment but he went on firmly from the beginning of my sisters engagement with danville i made it my duty not to conceal my own feelings my conscience and my affection for rose counseled me to be candid to the last even though my candor should distress or offend others when we first made the acquaintance of madame danville and when i first discovered that her sons attentions to rose were not unfavorably received i felt astonished and though it cost me a hard effort i did not conceal that astonishment from my sister  lomaque who had hitherto been all attention started here and threw up his hands in amazement astonished did i hear you say astonished monsieur trudaine that the attentions of a young gentleman possessed of all the graces and accomplishments of a highlybred frenchman should be favorably received by a young lady astonished that such a dancer such a singer such a talker such a notoriously fascinating ladies man as monsieur danville should by dint of respectful assiduity succeed in making some impression on the heart of mademoiselle rose oh monsieur trudaine venerated monsieur trudaine this is almost too much to credit  lomaques eyes grew weaker than ever and winked incessantly as he uttered this apostrophe at the end he threw up his hands again and blinked inquiringly all round him in mute appeal to universal nature  when in the course of time matters were further advanced continued trudaine without paying any attention to the interruption when the offer of marriage was made and when i knew that rose had in her own heart accepted it i objected and i did not conceal my objections  heavens interposed lomaque again clasping his hands this time with a look of bewilderment what objections what possible objections to a man young and wellbred with an immense fortune and an uncompromised character i have heard of these objections i know they have made bad blood and i ask myself again and again what can they be  god knows i have often tried to dismiss them from my mind as fanciful and absurd said trudaine and i have always failed it is impossible in your presence that i can describe in detail what my own impressions have been from the first of the master whom you serve let it be enough if i confide to you that i cannot even now persuade myself of the sincerity of his attachment to my sister and that i feelin spite of myself in spite of my earnest desire to put the most implicit confidence in roses choicea distrust of his character and temper which now on the eve of the marriage amounts to positive terror long secret suffering doubt and suspense wring this confession from me monsieur lomaque almost unawares in defiance of caution in defiance of all the conventionalities of society you have lived for years under the same roof with this man you have seen him in his most unguarded and private moments i tempt you to betray no confidencei only ask you if you can make me happy by telling me that i have been doing your master grievous injustice by my opinion of him i ask you to take my hand and tell me if you can in all honor that my sister is not risking the happiness of her whole life by giving herself in marriage to danville tomorrow  he held out his hand while he spoke by some strange chance lomaque happened just at that moment to be looking away toward those beauties of nature which he admired so greatly really monsieur trudaine really such an appeal from you at such a time amazes me having got so far he stopped and said no more  when we first sat down together here i had no thought of making this appeal no idea of talking to you as i have talked pursued the other my words have escaped me as i told you almost unawares you must make allowances for them and for me i cannot expect others monsieur lomaque to appreciate and understand my feelings for rose we two have lived alone in the world together father mother kindred they all died years since and left us i am so much older than my sister that i have learned to feel toward her more as a father than as a brother all my life all my dearest hopes all my highest expectations have centered in her i was past the period of my boyhood when my mother put my little child sisters hand in mine and said to me on her deathbed louis be all to her that i have been for she has no one left to look to but you since then the loves and ambitions of other men have not been my loves or my ambitions sister roseas we all used to call her in those past days as i love to call her stillsister rose has been the one aim the one happiness the one precious trust the one treasured reward of all my life i have lived in this poor house in this dull retirement as in a paradise because sister rosemy innocent happy brightfaced evehas lived here with me even if the husband of her choice had been the husband of mine the necessity of parting with her would have been the hardest the bitterest of trials as it is thinking what i think dreading what i dread judge what my feelings must be on the eve of her marriage and know why and with what object i made the appeal which surprised you a moment since but which cannot surprise you now speak if you willi can say no more he sighed bitterly his head dropped on his breast and the hand which he had extended to lomaque trembled as he withdrew it and let it fall at his side  the landsteward was not a man accustomed to hesitate but he hesitated now he was not usually at a loss for phrases in which to express himself but he stammered at the very outset of his reply suppose i answered he began slowly suppose i told you that you wronged him would my testimony really be strong enough to shake opinions or rather presumptions which have been taking firmer and firmer hold of you for months and months past suppose on the other hand that my master had his little lomaque hesitated before he pronounced the next wordhis littleinfirmities let me say but only hypothetically mind thatinfirmities and suppose i had observed them and was willing to confide them to you what purpose would such a confidence answer now at the eleventh hour with mademoiselle roses heart engaged with the marriage fixed for tomorrow no no trust me  trudaine looked up suddenly i thank you for reminding me monsieur lomaque that it is too late now to make inquiries and by consequence too late also to trust in others my sister has chosen and on the subject of that choice my lips shall be henceforth sealed the events of the future are with god whatever they may be i hope i am strong enough to bear my part in them with the patience and the courage of a man i apologize monsieur lomaque for having thoughtlessly embarrassed you by questions which i had no right to ask let us return to the housei will show you the way  lomaques lips opened then closed again he bowed uneasily and his sallow complexion whitened for a moment  trudaine led the way in silence back to the house the landsteward following slowly at a distance of several paces and talking in whispers to himself his father was the saving of me muttered lomaque that is truth and there is no getting over it his father was the saving of me and yet here am ino its too latetoo late to speaktoo late to acttoo late to do anything  close to the house they were met by the old servant  my young lady has just sent me to call you in to coffee monsieur said guillaume she has kept a cup hot for you and another cup for monsieur lomaque  the landsteward startedthis time with genuine astonishment for me he exclaimed mademoiselle rose has troubled herself to keep a cup of coffee hot for me the old servant stared trudaine stopped and looked back  what is there so very surprising he asked in such an ordinary act of politeness on my sisters part  excuse me monsieur trudaine answered lomaque you have not passed such an existence as mineyou are not a friendless old manyou have a settled position in the world and are used to be treated with consideration i am not this is the first occasion in my life on which i find myself an object for the attention of a young lady and it takes me by surprise i repeat my excuses pray let us go in  trudaine made no reply to this curious explanation he wondered at it a little however and he wondered still more when on entering the drawingroom he saw lomaque walk straight up to his sister andapparently not noticing that danville was sitting at the harpsichord and singing at the timeaddress her confusedly and earnestly with a set speech of thanks for his hot cup of coffee rose looked perplexed and half inclined to laugh as she listened to him madame danville who sat by her side frowned and tapped the landsteward contemptuously on the arm with her fan  be so good as to keep silent until my son has done singing she said lomaque made a low bow and retiring to a table in a corner took up a newspaper lying on it if madame danville had seen the expression that came over his face when he turned away from her proud as she was her aristocratic composure might possibly have been a little ruffled  danville had finished his song had quitted the harpsichord and was talking in whispers to his bride madame danville was adding a word to the conversation every now and then trudaine was seated apart at the far end of the room thoughtfully reading a letter which he had taken from his pocket when an exclamation from lomaque who was still engaged with the newspaper caused all the other occupants of the apartment to suspend their employments and look up  what is it asked danville impatiently  shall i be interrupting if i explain inquired lomaque getting very weak in the eyes again as he deferentially addressed himself to madame danville  you have already interrupted us said the old lady sharply so you may now just as well explain  it is a passage from the scientific intelligence which has given me great delight and which will be joyful news for every one here saying this lomaque looked significantly at trudaine and then read from the newspaper these lines    academy of sciences paristhe vacant subprofessorship of chemistry has been offered we are rejoiced to hear to a gentleman whose modesty has hitherto prevented his scientific merits from becoming sufficiently prominent in the world to the members of the academy he has been long since known as the originator of some of the most remarkable improvements in chemistry which have been made of late yearsimprovements the credit of which he has with rare and we were almost about to add culpable moderation allowed others to profit by with impunity no man in any profession is more thoroughly entitled to have a position of trust and distinction conferred on him by the state than the gentleman to whom we referm louis trudaine    before lomaque could look up from the paper to observe the impression which his news produced rose had gained her brothers side and was kissing him in a flutter of delight  dear louis she cried clapping her hands let me be the first to congratulate you how proud and glad i am you accept the professorship of course  trudaine who had hastily and confusedly put his letter back in his pocket the moment lomaque began to read seemed at a loss for an answer he patted his sisters hand rather absently and said  i have not made up my mind dont ask me why roseat least not now not just now an expression of perplexity and distress came over his face as he gently motioned her to resume her chair  pray is a subprofessor of chemistry supposed to hold the rank of a gentleman asked madame danville without the slightest appearance of any special interest in lomaques news  of course not replied her son with a sarcastic laugh he is expected to work and make himself useful what gentleman does that  charles exclaimed the old lady reddening with anger  bah cried danville turning his back on her enough of chemistry lomaque now you have begun reading the newspaper try if you cant find something interesting to read about what are the last accounts from paris any more symptoms of a general revolt  lomaque turned to another part of the paper bad very bad prospects for the restoration of tranquillity he said necker the peoples minister is dismissed placards against popular gatherings are posted all over paris the swiss guards have been ordered to the champs elysees with four pieces of artillery no more is yet known but the worst is dreaded the breach between the aristocracy and the people is widening fatally almost hour by hour  here he stopped and laid down the newspaper trudaine took it from him and shook his head forebodingly as he looked over the paragraph which had just been read  bah cried madame danville the people indeed let those four pieces of artillery be properly loaded let the swiss guards do their duty and we shall hear no more of the people  i advise you not to be sure of that said her son carelessly there are rather too many people in paris for the swiss guards to shoot conveniently dont hold your head too aristocratically high mother till we are quite certain which way the wind really does blow who knows if i may not have to bow just as low one of these days to king mob as ever you courtesied in your youth to king louis the fifteenth  he laughed complacently as he ended and opened his snuffbox his mother rose from her chair her face crimson with indignation  i wont hear you talk soit shocks it horrifies me she exclaimed with vehement gesticulation no no i decline to hear another word i decline to sit by patiently while my son whom i love jests at the most sacred principles and sneers at the memory of an anointed king this is my reward is it for having yielded and having come here against all the laws of etiquette the night before the marriage i comply no longer i resume my own will and my own way i order you my son to accompany me back to rouen we are the bridegrooms party and we have no business overnight at the house of the bride you meet no more till you meet at the church justin my coach lomaque pick up my hood monsieur trudaine thanks for your hospitality i shall hope to return it with interest the first time you are in our neighborhood mademoiselle put on your best looks tomorrow along with your wedding finery remember that my sons bride must do honor to my sons taste justin my coachdrone vagabond idiot where is my coach  my mother looks handsome when she is in a passion does she not rose said danville quietly putting up his snuffbox as the old lady sailed out of the room why you seem quite frightened love he added taking her hand with his easy graceful air frightened let me assure you without the least cause my mother has but that one prejudice and that one weak point rose you will find her a very dove for gentleness as long as you do not wound her pride of caste come come on this night of all others you must not send me away with such a face as that  he bent down and whispered to her a bridegrooms compliment which brought the blood back to her cheek in an instant  ah how she loves himhow dearly she loves him thought her brother watching her from his solitary corner of the room and seeing the smile that brightened her blushing face when danville kissed her hand at parting  lomaque who had remained imperturbably cool during the outbreak of the old ladys angerlomaque whose observant eyes had watched sarcastically the effect of the scene between mother and son on trudaine and his sister was the last to take leave after he had bowed to rose with a certain gentleness in his manner which contrasted strangely with his wrinkled haggard face he held out his hand to her brother i did not take your hand when we sat together on the bench he said may i take it now  trudaine met his advance courteously but in silence you may alter your opinion of me one of these days adding those words in a whisper monsieur lomaque bowed once more to the bride and went out  for a few minutes after the door had closed the brother and sister kept silence our last night together at home that was the thought which now filled the heart of each rose was the first to speak hesitating a little as she approached her brother she said to him anxiously  i am sorry for what happened with madame danville louis does it make you think the worse of charles  i can make allowance for madame danvilles anger returned trudaine evasively because she spoke from honest conviction  honest echoed rose sadly honestah louis i know you are thinking disparagingly of charless convictions when you speak so of his mothers  trudaine smiled and shook his head but she took no notice of the gesture of denialonly stood looking earnestly and wistfully into his face her eyes began to fill she suddenly threw her arms round his neck and whispered to him oh louis louis how i wish i could teach you to see charles with my eyes  he felt her tears on his cheek as she spoke and tried to reassure her  you shall teach me roseyou shall indeed come come we must keep up our spirits or how are you to look your best tomorrow  he unclasped her arms and led her gently to a chair at the same moment there was a knock at the door and roses maid appeared anxious to consult her mistress on some of the preparations for the wedding ceremony no interruption could have been more welcome just at that time it obliged rose to think of present trifles and it gave her brother an excuse for retiring to his study  he sat down by his desk doubting and heavyhearted and placed the letter from the academy of sciences open before him  passing over all the complimentary expressions which it contained his eye rested only on these lines at the end during the first three years of your professorship you will be required to reside in or near paris nine months out of the year for the purpose of delivering lectures and superintending experiments from time to time in the laboratories the letter in which these lines occurred offered him such a position as in his modest selfdistrust he had never dreamed of before the lines themselves contained the promise of such vast facilities for carrying on his favorite experiments as he could never hope to command in his own little study with his own limited means and yet there he now sat doubting whether he should accept or reject the tempting honors and advantages that were offered to himdoubting for his sisters sake  nine months of the year in paris he said to himself sadly and rose is to pass her married life at lyons oh if i could clear my heart of its dread on her accountif i could free my mind of its forebodings for her futurehow gladly i would answer this letter by accepting the trust it offers me  he paused for a few minutes and reflected the thoughts that were in him marked their ominous course in the growing paleness of his cheek in the dimness that stole over his eyes if this cleaving distrust from which i cannot free myself should be in very truth the mute prophecy of evil to cometo come i know not whenif it be so which god forbid how soon she may want a friend a protector near at hand a ready refuge in the time of her trouble where shall she then find protection or refuge with that passionate woman with her husbands kindred and friends  he shuddered as the thought crossed his mind and opening a blank sheet of paper dipped his pen in the ink be all to her louis that i have been he murmured to himself repeating his mothers last words and beginning the letter while he uttered them it was soon completed it expressed in the most respectful terms his gratitude for the offer made to him and his inability to accept it in consequence of domestic circumstances which it was needless to explain the letter was directed sealed it only remained for him to place it in the postbag lying near at hand at this last decisive act he hesitated he had told lomaque and he had firmly believed himself that he had conquered all ambitions for his sisters sake he knew now for the first time that he had only lulled them to resthe knew that the letter from paris had aroused them his answer was written his hand was on the postbag and at that moment the whole struggle had to be risked over againrisked when he was most unfit for it he was not a man under any ordinary circumstances to procrastinate but he procrastinated now  night brings counsel i will wait till tomorrow he said to himself and put the letter of refusal in his pocket and hastily quitted the laboratory    chapter ii  inexorably the important morrow came irretrievably for good or for evil the momentous marriagevow was pronounced charles danville and rose trudaine were now man and wife the prophecy of the magnificent sunset overnight had not proved false it was a cloudless day on the marriage morning the nuptial ceremonies had proceeded smoothly throughout and had even satisfied madame danville she returned with the weddingparty to trudaines house all smiles and serenity to the bride she was graciousness itself good girl said the old lady following rose into a corner and patting her approvingly on the cheek with her fan good girl you have looked well this morningyou have done credit to my sons taste indeed you have pleased me child now go upstairs and get on your travelingdress and count on my maternal affection as long as you make charles happy  it had been arranged that the bride and bridegroom should pass their honeymoon in brittany and then return to danvilles estate near lyons the parting was hurried over as all such partings should be the carriage had driven off trudaine after lingering long to look after it had returned hastily to the house the very dust of the whirling wheels had all dispersed there was absolutely nothing to see and yet there stood monsieur lomaque at the outer gate idly as if he was an independent mancalmly as if no such responsibilities as the calling of madame danvilles coach and the escorting of madame danville back to lyons could possibly rest on his shoulders  idly and calmly slowly rubbing his hands one over the other slowly nodding his head in the direction by which the bride and bridegroom had departed stood the eccentric landsteward at the outer gate on a sudden the sound of footsteps approaching from the house seemed to arouse him once more he looked out into the road as if he expected still to see the carriage of the newlymarried couple poor girl ah poor girl said monsieur lomaque softly to himself turning round to ascertain who was coming from the house  it was only the postman with a letter in his hand and the postbag crumpled up under his arm  any fresh news from paris friend asked lomaque  very bad monsieur answered the postman camille desmoulins has appealed to the people in the palais royal there are fears of a riot  only a riot repeated lomaque sarcastically oh what a brave government not to be afraid of anything worse any letters he added hastily dropping the subject  none to the house said the postman only one from it given me by monsieur trudaine hardly worth while he added twirling the letter in his hand to put it into the bag is it  lomaque looked over his shoulder as he spoke and saw that the letter was directed to the president of the academy of sciences paris  i wonder whether he accepts the place or refuses it thought the landsteward nodding to the postman and continuing on his way back to the house  at the door he met trudaine who said to him rather hastily you are going back to lyons with madame danville i suppose  this very day answered lomaque  if you should hear of a convenient bachelor lodging at lyons or near it continued the other dropping his voice and speaking more rapidly than before you would be doing me a favor if you would let me know about it  lomaque assented but before he could add a question which was on the tip of his tongue trudaine had vanished in the interior of the house  a bachelor lodging repeated the landsteward standing alone on the doorstep at or near lyons aha monsieur trudaine i put your bachelor lodging and your talk to me last night together and i make out a sum total which is i think pretty near the mark you have refused that paris appointment my friend and i fancy i can guess why  he paused thoughtfully and shook his head with ominous frowns and bitings of his lips  all clear enough in that sky he continued after a while looking up at the lustrous midday heaven all clear enough there but i think i see a little cloud rising in a certain household firmament alreadya little cloud which hides much and which i for one shall watch carefully     part second    chapter i  five years have elapsed since monsieur lomaque stood thoughtfully at the gate of trudaines house looking after the carriage of the bride and bridegroom and seriously reflecting on the events of the future great changes have passed over that domestic firmament in which he prophetically discerned the little warning cloud greater changes have passed over the firmament of france  what was revolt five years ago is revolution nowrevolution which has ingulfed thrones and principalities and powers which has set up crownless inhereditary kings and counselors of its own and has bloodily torn them down again by dozens which has raged and raged on unrestrainedly in fierce earnest until but one king can still govern and control it for a little while that king is named terror and seventeen hundred and ninetyfour is the year of his reign  monsieur lomaque landsteward no longer sits alone in an officiallooking room in one of the official buildings of paris it is another july evening as fine as that evening when he and trudaine sat talking together on the bench overlooking the seine the window of the room is wide open and a faint pleasant breeze is beginning to flow through it but lomaque breathes uneasily as if still oppressed by the sultry midday heat and there are signs of perplexity and trouble in his face as he looks down absently now and then into the street  the times he lives in are enough of themselves to sadden any mans face in the reign of terror no living being in all the city of paris can rise in the morning and be certain of escaping the spy the denunciation the arrest or the guillotine before night such times are trying enough to oppress any mans spirits but lomaque is not thinking of them or caring for them now out of a mass of papers which lie before him on his old writingtable he has just taken up and read one which has carried his thoughts back to the past and to the changes which have taken place since he stood alone on the doorstep of trudaines house pondering on what might happen  more rapidly even than he had foreboded those changes had occurred in less time even than he had anticipated the sad emergency for which roses brother had prepared as for a barely possible calamity overtook trudaine and called for all the patience the courage the selfsacrifice which he had to give for his sisters sake by slow gradations downward from bad to worse her husbands character manifested itself less and less disguisedly almost day by day occasional slights ending in habitual neglect careless estrangement turning to cool enmity small insults which ripened evilly to great injuriesthese were the pitiless signs which showed her that she had risked all and lost all while still a young womanthese were the unmerited afflictions which found her helpless and would have left her helpless but for the everpresent comfort and support of her brothers selfdenying love from the first trudaine had devoted himself to meet such trials as now assailed him and like a man he met them in defiance alike of persecution from the mother and of insult from the son  the hard task was only lightened when as time advanced public trouble began to mingle itself with private grief then absorbing political necessities came as a relief to domestic misery then it grew to be the one purpose and pursuit of danvilles life cunningly to shape his course so that he might move safely onward with the advancing revolutionary tidehe cared not whither as long as he kept his possessions safe and his life out of danger his mother inflexibly true to her oldworld convictions through all peril might entreat and upbraid might talk of honor and courage and sincerityhe heeded her not or heeded only to laugh as he had taken the false way with his wife so he was now bent on taking it with the world  the years passed on destroying changes swept hurricanelike over the old governing system of france and still danville shifted successfully with the shifting times the first days of the terror approached in public and in privatein high places and in loweach man now suspected his brother crafty as danville was even he fell under suspicion at last at headquarters in paris principally on his mothers account this was his first political failure and in a moment of thoughtless rage and disappointment he wreaked the irritation caused by it on lomaque suspected himself he in turn suspected the landsteward his mother fomented the suspicionlomaque was dismissed  in the old times the victim would have been ruined in the new times he was simply rendered eligible for a political vocation in life lomaque was poor quickwitted secret not scrupulous he was a good patriot he had good patriot friends plenty of ambition a subtle catlike courage nothing to dreadand he went to paris there were plenty of small chances there for men of his caliber he waited for one of them it came he made the most of it attracted favorably the notice of the terrible fouquiertinville and won his way to a place in the office of the secret police  meanwhile danvilles anger cooled down he recovered the use of that cunning sense which had hitherto served him well and sent to recall the discarded servant it was too late lomaque was already in a position to set him at defiancenay to put his neck perhaps under the blade of the guillotine worse than this anonymous letters reached him warning him to lose no time in proving his patriotism by some indisputable sacrifice and in silencing his mother whose imprudent sincerity was likely ere long to cost her her life danville knew her well enough to know that there was but one way of saving her and thereby saving himself she had always refused to emigrate but he now insisted that she should seize the first opportunity he could procure for her of quitting france until calmer times arrived  probably she would have risked her own life ten times over rather than have obeyed him but she had not the courage to risk her sons too and she yielded for his sake partly by secret influence partly by unblushing fraud danville procured for her such papers and permits as would enable her to leave france by way of marseilles even then she refused to depart until she knew what her sons plans were for the future he showed her a letter which he was about to dispatch to robespierre himself vindicating his suspected patriotism and indignantly demanding to be allowed to prove it by filling some office no matter how small under the redoubtable triumvirate which then governed or more properly terrified france the sight of this document reassured madame danville she bade her son farewell and departed at last with one trusty servant for marseilles  danvilles intention in sending his letter to paris had been simply to save himself by patriotic bluster he was thunderstruck at receiving a reply taking him at his word and summoning him to the capital to accept employment there under the then existing government there was no choice but to obey so to paris he journeyed taking his wife with him into the very jaws of danger he was then at open enmity with trudaine and the more anxious and alarmed he could make the brother feel on the sisters account the better he was pleased true to his trust and his love through all dangers as through all persecutions trudaine followed them and the street of their sojourn at paris in the perilous days of the terror was the street of his sojourn too  danville had been astonished at the acceptance of his proffered services he was still more amazed when he found that the post selected for him was one of the superintendents places in that very office of secret police in which lomaque was employed as agent robespierre and his colleagues had taken the measure of their manhe had money enough and local importance enough to be worth studying they knew where he was to be distrusted and how he might be made useful the affairs of the secret police were the sort of affairs which an unscrupulously cunning man was fitted to help on and the faithful exercise of that cunning in the service of the state was insured by the presence of lomaque in the office the discarded servant was just the right sort of spy to watch the suspected master thus it happened that in the office of the secret police at paris and under the reign of terror lomaques old master was nominally his master stillthe superintendent to whom he was ceremonially accountable in publicthe suspected man whose slightest words and deeds he was officially set to watch in private  ever sadder and darker grew the face of lomaque as he now pondered alone over the changes and misfortunes of the past five years a neighboring churchclock striking the hour of seven aroused him from his meditations he arranged the confused mass of papers before himlooked toward the door as if expecting some one to enterthen finding himself still alone recurred to the one special paper which had first suggested his long train of gloomy thoughts the few lines it contained were signed in cipher and ran thus    you are aware that your superintendent danville obtained leave of absence last week to attend to some affairs of his at lyons and that he is not expected back just yet for a day or two while he is away push on the affair of trudaine collect all the evidence and hold yourself in readiness to act on it at a moments notice dont leave the office till you have heard from me again if you have a copy of the private instructions respecting danville which you wrote for me send it to my house i wish to refresh my memory your original letter is burned    here the note abruptly terminated as he folded it up and put it in his pocket lomaque sighed this was a very rare expression of feeling with him he leaned back in his chair and beat his nails impatiently on the table suddenly there was a faint little tap at the room door and eight or ten menevidently familiars of the new french inquisitionquietly entered and ranged themselves against the wall  lomaque nodded to two of them picard and magloire go and sit down at that desk i shall want you after the rest are gone saying this lomaque handed certain sealed and docketed papers to the other men waiting in the room who received them in silence bowed and went out innocent spectators might have thought them clerks taking bills of lading from a merchant who could have imagined that the giving and receiving of denunciations arrestorders and deathwarrantsthe providing of its doomed human meal for the alldevouring guillotinecould have been managed so coolly and quietly with such unruffled calmness of official routine  now said lomaque turning to the two men at the desk as the door closed have you got those notes about you they answered in the affirmative picard you have the first particulars of this affair of trudaine so you must begin reading i have sent in the reports but we may as well go over the evidence again from the commencement to make sure that nothing has been left out if any corrections are to be made now is the time to make them read picard and lose as little time as you possibly can  thus admonished picard drew some long slips of paper from his pocket and began reading from them as follows    minutes of evidence collected concerning louis trudaine suspected on the denunciation of citizen superintendent danville of hostility to the sacred cause of liberty and of disaffection to the sovereignty of the people 1 the suspected person is placed under secret observation and these facts are elicited he is twice seen passing at night from his own house to a house in the rue de clery on the first night he carries with him moneyon the second papers he returns without either these particulars have been obtained through a citizen engaged to help trudaine in housekeeping one of the sort called servants in the days of the tyrants this man is a good patriot who can be trusted to watch trudaines actions 2 the inmates of the house in the rue de clery are numerous and in some cases not so well known to the government as could be wished it is found difficult to gain certain information about the person or persons visited by trudaine without having recourse to an arrest 3 an arrest is thought premature at this preliminary stage of the proceedings being likely to stop the development of conspiracy and give warning to the guilty to fly order thereupon given to watch and wait for the present 4 citizen superintendent danville quits paris for a short time the office of watching trudaine is then taken out of the hands of the undersigned and is confided to his comrade magloiresigned picard countersigned lomaque    having read so far the police agent placed his papers on the writingtable waited a moment for orders and receiving none went out no change came over the sadness and perplexity of lomaques face he still beat his nails anxiously on the writingtable and did not even look at the second agent as he ordered the man to read his report magloire produced some slips of paper precisely similar to picards and read from them in the same rapid businesslike unmodulated tones    affair of trudaine minutes continued citizen agent magloire having been appointed to continue the surveillance of trudaine reports the discovery of additional facts of importance 1 appearances make it probable that trudaine meditates a third secret visit to the house in the rue de clery the proper measures are taken for observing him closely and the result is the implication of another person discovered to be connected with the supposed conspiracy this person is the sister of trudaine and the wife of citizen superintendent danville   poor lost creature ah poor lost creature muttered lomaque to himself sighing again and shifting uneasily from side to side in his mangy old leathern armchair apparently magloire was not accustomed to sighs interruptions and expressions of regret from the usually imperturbable chief agent he looked up from his papers with a stare of wonder go on magloire cried lomaque with a sudden outburst of irritability why the devil dont you go onall ready citizen returned magloire submissively and proceeded   2 it is at trudaines house that the woman danvilles connection with her brothers secret designs is ascertained through the vigilance of the beforementioned patriot citizen the interview of the two suspected persons is private their conversation is carried on in whispers little can be overheard but that little suffices to prove that trudaines sister is perfectly aware of his intention to proceed for the third time to the house in the rue de clery it is further discovered that she awaits his return and that she then goes back privately to her own house 3 meanwhile the strictest measures are taken for watching the house in the rue de clery it is discovered that trudaines visits are paid to a man and woman known to the landlord and lodgers by the name of dubois they live on the fourth floor it is impossible at the time of the discovery to enter this room or to see the citizen and citoyenne dubois without producing an undesirable disturbance in the house and neighborhood a police agent is left to watch the place while search and arrest orders are applied for the granting of these is accidentally delayed when they are ultimately obtained it is discovered that the man and the woman are both missing they have not hitherto been traced 4 the landlord of the house is immediately arrested as well as the police agent appointed to watch the premises the landlord protests that he knows nothing of his tenants it is suspected however that he has been tampered with as also that trudaines papers delivered to the citizen and citoyenne dubois are forged passports with these and with money it may not be impossible that they have already succeeded in escaping from france the proper measures have been taken for stopping them if they have not yet passed the frontiers no further report in relation to them has yet been received 5 trudaine and his sister are under perpetual surveillance and the undersigned holds himself ready for further orderssigned magloire countersigned lomaque   having finished reading his notes magloire placed them on the writingtable he was evidently a favored man in the office and he presumed upon his position for he ventured to make a remark instead of leaving the room in silence like his predecessor picard  when citizen danville returns to paris he began he will be rather astonished to find that in denouncing his wifes brother he had also unconsciously denounced his wife  lomaque looked up quickly with that old weakness in his eyes which affected them in such a strangely irregular manner on certain occasions magloire knew what this symptom meant and would have become confused if he had not been a police agent as it was he quietly backed a step or two from the table and held his tongue  friend magloire said lomaque winking mildly your last remark looks to me like a question in disguise i put questions constantly to others i never answer questions myself you want to know citizen what our superintendents secret motive is for denouncing his wifes brother suppose you try and find that out for yourself it will be famous practice for you friend magloirefamous practice after office hours  any further orders inquired magloire sulkily  none in relation to the reports returned lomaque i find nothing to alter or add on a revised hearing but i shall have a little note ready for you immediately sit down at the other desk friend magloire i am very fond of you when you are not inquisitive pray sit down  while addressing this polite invitation to the agent in his softest voice lomaque produced his pocketbook and drew from it a little note which he opened and read through attentively it was headed private instructions relative to superintendent danville and proceeded thus  the undersigned can confidently assert from long domestic experience in danvilles household that his motive for denouncing his wifes brother is purely a personal one and is not in the most remote degree connected with politics briefly the facts are these louis trudaine from the first opposed his sisters marriage with danville distrusting the latters temper and disposition the marriage however took place and the brother resigned himself to await resultstaking the precaution of living in the same neighborhood as his sister to interpose if need be between the crimes which the husband might commit and the sufferings which the wife might endure the results soon exceeded his worst anticipations and called for the interposition for which he had prepared himself he is a man of inflexible firmness patience and integrity and he makes the protection and consolation of his sister the business of his life he gives his brotherinlaw no pretext for openly quarreling with him he is neither to be deceived irritated nor tired out and he is danvilles superior every wayin conduct temper and capacity under these circumstances it is unnecessary to say that his brotherinlaws enmity toward him is of the most implacable kind and equally unnecessary to hint at the perfectly plain motive of the denunciation  as to the suspicious circumstances affecting not trudaine only but his sister as well the undersigned regrets his inability thus far to offer either explanation or suggestion at this preliminary stage the affair seems involved in impenetrable mystery  lomaque read these lines through down to his own signature at the end they were the duplicate secret instructions demanded from him in the paper which he had been looking over before the entrance of the two police agents slowly and as it seemed unwillingly he folded the note up in a fresh sheet of paper and was preparing to seal it when a tap at the door stopped him come in he cried irritably and a man in traveling costume covered with dust entered quietly whispered a word or two in his ear and then went out lomaque started at the whisper and opening his note again hastily wrote under his signature i have just heard that danville has hastened his return to paris and may be expected back tonight having traced these lines he closed sealed and directed the letter and gave it to magloire the police agent looked at the address as he left the room it was to citizen robespierre rue sainthonore  left alone again lomaque rose and walked restlessly backward and forward biting his nails  danville comes back tonight he said to himself and the crisis comes with him trudaine a conspirator bah conspiracy can hardly be the answer to the riddle this time what is  he took a turn or two in silencethen stopped at the open window looking out on what little glimpse the street afforded him of the sunset sky this time five years he said trudaine was talking to me on that bench overlooking the river and sister rose was keeping poor hatchetfaced old lomaques cup of coffee hot for him now i am officially bound to suspect them both perhaps to arrest them perhapsi wish this job had fallen into other hands i dont want iti dont want it at any price  he returned to the writingtable and sat down to his papers with the dogged air of a man determined to drive away vexing thoughts by dint of sheer hard work for more than an hour he labored on resolutely munching a bit of dry bread from time to time then he paused a little and began to think again gradually the summer twilight faded and the room grew dark  perhaps we shall tide over tonight after allwho knows said lomaque ringing his handbell for lights they were brought in and with them ominously returned the police agent magloire with a small sealed packet it contained an arrestorder and a tiny threecornered note looking more like a loveletter or a ladys invitation to a party than anything else lomaque opened the note eagerly and read these lines neatly written and signed with robespierres initialsm rformed elegantly in cipher  arrest trudaine and his sister tonight on second thoughts i am not sure if danville comes back in time to be present that it may not be all the better he is unprepared for his wifes arrest watch him closely when it takes place and report privately to me i am afraid he is a vicious man and of all things i abhor vice  any more work for me tonight asked magloire with a yawn  only an arrest replied lomaque collect our men and when youre ready get a coach at the door  we were just going to supper grumbled magloire to himself as he went out the devil seize the aristocrats theyre all in such a hurry to get to the guillotine that they wont even give a man time to eat his victuals in peace  theres no choice now muttered lomaque angrily thrusting the arrestorder and the threecornered note into his pocket his father was the saving of me he himself welcomed me like an equal his sister treated me like a gentleman as the phrase went in those days and now  he stopped and wiped his foreheadthen unlocked his desk produced a bottle of brandy and poured himself out a glass of the liquor which he drank by sips slowly  i wonder whether other men get softerhearted as they grow older he said i seem to do so at any rate courage courage what must be must if i risked my head to do it i couldnt stop this arrest not a man in the office but would be ready to execute it if i wasnt  here the rumble of carriagewheels sounded outside  theres the coach exclaimed lomaque locking up the brandybottle and taking his hat after all as this arrest is to be made its as well for them that i should make it  consoling himself as he best could with this reflection chief police agent lomaque blew out the candles and quitted the room     chapter ii  ignorant of the change in her husbands plans which was to bring him back to paris a day before the time that had been fixed for his return sister rose had left her solitary home to spend the evening with her brother they had sat talking together long after sunset and had let the darkness steal on them insensibly as people will who are only occupied with quiet familiar conversation thus it happened by a curious coincidence that just as lomaque was blowing out his candles at the office rose was lighting the readinglamp at her brothers lodgings  five years of disappointment and sorrow had sadly changed her to outward view her face looked thinner and longer the once delicate red and white of her complexion was gone her figure had wasted under the influence of some weakness which had already made her stoop a little when she walked her manner had lost its maiden shyness only to become unnaturally quiet and subdued of all the charms which had so fatally yet so innocently allured her heartless husband but one remainedthe winning gentleness of her voice it might be touched now and then with a note of sadness but the soft attraction of its even natural tone still remained in the marring of all other harmonies this one harmony had been preserved unchanged her brother though his face was careworn and his manner sadder than of old looked less altered from his former self it is the most fragile material which soonest shows the flaw the worlds idol beauty holds its frailest tenure of existence in the one temple where we most love to worship it  and so you think louis that our perilous undertaking has really ended well by this time said rose anxiously as she lighted the lamp and placed the glass shade over it what a relief it is only to hear you say you think we have succeeded at last  i said i hope rose replied her brother  well even hoped is a great word from you louisa great word from any one in this fearful city and in these days of terror  she stopped suddenly seeing her brother raise his hand in warning they looked at each other in silence and listened the sound of footsteps going slowly past the houseceasing for a moment just beyond itthen going on againcame through the open window there was nothing else outofdoors or in to disturb the silence of the nightthe deadly silence of terror which for months past had hung over paris it was a significant sign of the times that even a passing footstep sounding a little strangely at night was subject for suspicion both to brother and sisterso common a subject that they suspended their conversation as a matter of course without exchanging a word of explanation until the tramp of the strange footsteps had died away  louis continued rose dropping her voice to a whisper after nothing more was audible when may i trust our secret to my husband  not yet rejoined trudaine earnestly not a word not a hint of it till i give you leave remember rose you promised silence from the first everything depends on your holding that promise sacred till i release you from it  i will hold it sacred i will indeed at all hazards under all provocations she answered  that is quite enough to reassure meand now love let us change the subject even these walls may have ears and the closed door yonder may be no protection he looked toward it uneasily while he spoke bytheby i have come round to your way of thinking rose about that new servant of minethere is something false in his face i wish i had been as quick to detect it as you were  rose glanced at him affrightedly has he done anything suspicious have you caught him watching you tell me the worst louis  hush hush my dear not so loud dont alarm yourself he has done nothing suspicious  turn him offpray pray turn him off before it is too late  and be denounced by him in revenge the first night he goes to his section you forget that servants and masters are equal now i am not supposed to keep a servant at all i have a citizen living with me who lays me under domestic obligations for which i make a pecuniary acknowledgment no no if i do anything i must try if i cant entrap him into giving me warning but we have got to another unpleasant subject alreadysuppose i change the topic again you will find a little book on that table there in the cornertell me what you think of it  the book was a copy of corneilles cid prettily bound in blue morocco rose was enthusiastic in her praises i found it in a booksellers shop yesterday said her brother and bought it as a present for you corneille is not an author to compromise any one even in these times dont you remember saying the other day that you felt ashamed of knowing but little of our greatest dramatist rose remembered well and smiled almost as happily as in the old times over her present there are some good engravings at the beginning of each act continued trudaine directing her attention rather earnestly to the illustrations and then suddenly leaving her side when he saw that she became interested in looking at them  he went to the windowlistenedthen drew aside the curtain and looked up and down the street no living soul was in sight i must have been mistaken he thought returning hastily to his sister but i certainly fancied i was followed in my walk today by a spy  i wonder asked rose still busy over her book i wonder louis whether my husband would let me go with you to see le cid the next time it is acted  no cried a voice at the door not if you went on your knees to ask him  rose turned round with a scream there stood her husband on the threshold scowling at her with his hat on and his hands thrust doggedly into his pockets trudaines servant announced him with an insolent smile during the pause that followed the discovery citizen superintendent danville to visit the citoyenne his wife said the fellow making a mock bow to his master  rose looked at her brother then advanced a few paces toward the door this is a surprise she said faintly has anything happened wewe didnt expect you her voice failed her as she saw her husband advancing pale to his very lips with suppressed anger  how dare you come here after what i told you he asked in quick low tones  she shrank at his voice almost as if he had struck her the blood flew into her brothers face as he noticed the action but he controlled himself and taking her hand led her in silence to a chair  i forbid you to sit down in his house said danville advancing still i order you to come back with me do you hear i order you  he was approaching nearer to her when he caught trudaines eye fixed on him and stopped rose started up and placed herself between them  oh charles charles she said to her husband be friends with louis tonight and be kind again to me i have a claim to ask that much of you though you may not think it  he turned away from her and laughed contemptuously she tried to speak again but trudaine touched her on the arm and gave her a warning look  signals exclaimed danville secret signals between you  his eye as he glanced suspiciously at his wife fell on trudaines giftbook which she still held unconsciously  what book is that he asked  only a play of corneilles answered rose louis has just made me a present of it  at this avowal danvilles suppressed anger burst beyond all control  give it him back he cried in a voice of fury you shall take no presents from him the venom of the household spy soils everything he touches give it him back she hesitated you wont he tore the book from her with an oath threw it on the floor and set his foot on it  oh louis louis for gods sake remember  trudaine was stepping forward as the book fell to the floor at the same moment his sister threw her arms round him he stopped turning from fiery red to ghastly pale  no no louis she said clasping him closer not after five years patience nono  he gently detached her arms  you are right love dont be afraid it is all over now  saying that he put her from him and in silence took up the book from the floor  wont that offend you even said danville with an insolent smile you have a wonderful temperany other man would have called me out  trudaine looked back at him steadily and taking out his handkerchief passed it over the soiled cover of the book  if i could wipe the stain of your blood off my conscience as easily as i can wipe the stain of your boot off this book he said quietly you should not live another hour dont cry rose he continued turning again to his sister i will take care of your book for you until you can keep it yourself  you will do this you will do that cried danville growing more and more exasperated and letting his anger got the better even of his cunning now talk less confidently of the futureyou dont know what it has in store for you govern your tongue when you are in my presence a day may come when you will want my helpmy help do you hear that  trudaine turned his face from his sister as if he feared to let her see it when those words were spoken  the man who followed me today was a spydanvilles spy that thought flashed across his mind but he gave it no utterance there was an instants pause of silence and through it there came heavily on the still night air the rumbling of distant wheels the sound advanced nearer and neareradvanced and ceased under the window  danville hurried to it and looked out eagerly i have not hastened my return without reason i wouldnt have missed this arrest for anything thought he peering into the night  the stars were out but there was no moon he could not recognize either the coach or the persons who got out of it and he turned again into the interior of the room his wife had sunk into a chair her brother was locking up in a cabinet the book which he had promised to take care of for her the dead silence made the noise of slowly ascending footsteps on the stairs painfully audible at last the door opened softly  citizen danville health and fraternity said lomaque appearing in the doorway followed by his agents citizen louis trudaine he continued beginning with the usual form  rose started out of her chair but her brothers hand was on her lips before she could speak  my name is louis trudaine he answered  charles cried his sister breaking from him and appealing to her husband who are these men what are they here for  he gave her no answer  louis trudaine said lomaque slowly drawing the order from his pocket in the name of the republic i arrest you  rose come back cried trudaine  it was too late she had broken from him and in the recklessness of terror had seized her husband by the arm  save him she cried save him by all you hold dearest in the world you are that mans superior charlesorder him from the room  danville roughly shook her hand off his arm  lomaque is doing his duty yes he added with a glance of malicious triumph at trudaine yes doing his duty look at me as you pleaseyour looks wont move me i denounced you i admit iti glory in it i have rid myself of an enemy and the state of a bad citizen remember your secret visits to the house in the rue de clery  his wife uttered a cry of horror she seized his arm again with both handsfrail trembling handsthat seemed suddenly nerved with all the strength of a mans  come herecome here i must and will speak to you  she dragged him by main force a few paces back toward an unoccupied corner of the room with deathly cheeks and wild eyes she raised herself on tiptoe and put her lips to her husbands ear at that instant trudaine called to her  rose if you speak i am lost  she stopped at the sound of his voice dropped her hold on her husbands arm and faced her brother shuddering  rose he continued you have promised and your promise is sacred if you prize your honor if you love me come herecome here and be silent  he held out his hand she ran to him and laying her head on his bosom burst into a passion of tears  danville turned uneasily toward the police agents remove your prisoner he said you have done your duty here  only half of it retorted lomaque eying him attentively rose danville  my wife exclaimed the other what about my wife  rose danville continued lomaque impassibly you are included in the arrest of louis trudaine  rose raised her head quickly from her brothers breast his firmness had deserted himhe was trembling she heard him whispering to himself rose too oh my god i was not prepared for that she heard these words and dashed the tears from her eyes and kissed him saying  i am glad of it louis we risked all togetherwe shall now suffer together i am glad of it  danville looked incredulously at lomaque after the first shock of astonishment was over  impossible he exclaimed i never denounced my wife there is some mistake you have exceeded your orders  silence retorted lomaque imperiously silence citizen and respect to a decree of the republic  you blackguard show me the arrestorder said danville who has dared to denounce my wife  you have said lomaque turning on him with a grin of contempt youand blackguard back in your teeth you in denouncing her brother aha we work hard in our office we dont waste time in calling nameswe make discoveries if trudaine is guilty your wife is implicated in his guilt we know it and we arrest her  i resist the arrest cried danville i am the authority here who opposes me  the impassible chief agent made no answer some new noise in the street struck his quick ear he ran to the window and looked out eagerly  who opposes me reiterated danville  hark exclaimed lomaque raising his hand silence and listen  the heavy dull tramp of men marching together became audible as he spoke voices humming low and in unison the marseillaise hymn joined solemnly with the heavy regular footfalls soon the flare of torchlight began to glimmer redder and redder under the dim starlight sky  do you hear that do you see the advancing torchlight cried lomaque pointing exultingly into the street respect to the national hymn and to the man who holds in the hollow of his hand the destinies of all france hat off citizen danville robespierre is in the street his bodyguard the hardhitters are lighting him on his way to the jacobin club who shall oppose you did you say your master and mine the man whose signature is at the bottom of this orderthe man who with a scratch of his pen can send both our heads rolling together into the sack of the guillotine shall i call to him as he passes the house shall i tell him that superintendent danville resists me in making an arrest shall i shall i and in the immensity of his contempt lomaque seemed absolutely to rise in stature as he thrust the arrest order under danvilles eyes and pointed to the signature with the head of his stick  rose looked round in terror as lomaque spoke his last wordslooked round and saw her husband recoil before the signature on the arrest order as if the guillotine itself had suddenly arisen before him her brother felt her shrinking back in his arms and trembled for the preservation of her selfcontrol if the terror and suspense of the arrest lasted any longer  courage rose courage he said you have behaved nobly you must not fail now no no not a word more not a word till i am able to think clearly again and to decide what is best courage love our lives depend on it citizen he continued addressing himself to lomaque proceed with your dutywe are ready  the heavy marching footsteps outside were striking louder and louder on the ground the chanting voices were every moment swelling in volume the dark street was flaming again with the brightening torchlight as lomaque under pretext of giving trudaine his hat came close to him and turning his back toward danville whispered i have not forgotten the eve of the wedding and the bench on the river bank  before trudaine could answer he had taken roses cloak and hood from one of his assistants and was helping her on with it danville still pale and trembling advanced a step when he saw these preparations for departure and addressed a word or two to his wife but he spoke in low tones and the fastadvancing march of feet and sullen low roar of singing outside drowned his voice an oath burst from his lips and he struck his fist in impotent fury on a table near him  the seals are set on everything in this room and in the bedroom said magloire approaching lomaque who nodded and signed to him to bring up the other police agents at the door  ready cried magloire coming forward immediately with his men and raising his voice to make himself heard where to  robespierre and his hardhitters were passing the house the smoke of the torchlight was rolling in at the window the tramping footsteps struck heavier and heavier on the ground the low sullen roar of the marseillaise was swelling to its loudest as lomaque referred for a moment to his arrestorder and then answered  to the prison of st lazare    chapter iii  the head jailer of st lazare stood in the outer hall of the prison two days after the arrest at trudaines lodgings smoking his morning pipe looking toward the courtyard gate he saw the wicket opened and a privileged man let in whom he soon recognized as the chief agent of the second section of secret police why friend lomaque cried the jailer advancing toward the courtyard what brings you here this morning business or pleasure  pleasure this time citizen i have an idle hour or two to spare for a walk i find myself passing the prison and i cant resist calling in to see how my friend the head jailer is getting on lomaque spoke in a surprisingly brisk and airy manner his eyes were suffering under a violent fit of weakness and winking but he smiled notwithstanding with an air of the most inveterate cheerfulness those old enemies of his who always distrusted him most when his eyes were most affected would have certainly disbelieved every word of the friendly speech he had just made and would have assumed it as a matter of fact that his visit to the head jailer had some specially underhand business at the bottom of it  how am i getting on said the jailer shaking his head overworked friendoverworked no idle hours in our department even the guillotine is getting too slow for us  sent off your batch of prisoners for trial this morning asked lomaque with an appearance of perfect unconcern  no theyre just going answered the other come and have a look at them he spoke as if the prisoners were a collection of pictures on view or a set of dresses just made up lomaque nodded his head still with his air of happy holiday carelessness the jailer led the way to an inner hall and pointing lazily with his pipestem said our morning batch citizen just ready for the baking  in one corner of the hall were huddled together more than thirty men and women of all ranks and ages some staring round them with looks of blank despair some laughing and gossiping recklessly near them lounged a guard of patriots smoking spitting and swearing between the patriots and the prisoners sat on a rickety stool the second jailera humpbacked man with an immense red mustachefinishing his breakfast of broad beans which he scooped out of a basin with his knife and washed down with copious draughts of wine from a bottle carelessly as lomaque looked at the shocking scene before him his quick eyes contrived to take note of every prisoners face and to descry in a few minutes trudaine and his sister standing together at the back of the group  now then apollo cried the head jailer addressing his subordinate by a facetious prison nickname dont be all day starting that trumpery batch of yours and harkye friend i have leave of absence on business at my section this afternoon so it will be your duty to read the list for the guillotine and chalk the prisoners doors before the cart comes tomorrow morning ware the bottle apollo today ware the bottle for fear of accidents with the deathlist tomorrow  thirsty july weather thiseh citizen said lomaque leaving the head jailer and patting the hunchback in the friendliest manner on the shoulder why how you have got your batch huddled up together this morning shall i help you to shove them into marching order my time is quite at your disposal this is a holiday morning with me  ha ha ha what a jolly dog he is on his holiday morning exclaimed the head jailer as lomaqueapparently taking leave of his natural character altogether in the exhilaration of an hours unexpected leisurebegan pushing and pulling the prisoners into rank with humorous mock apologies at which not the officials only but many of the victims themselvesreckless victims of a reckless tyrannylaughed heartily persevering to the last in his practical jest lomaque contrived to get close to trudaine for a minute and to give him one significant look before he seized him by the shoulders like the rest now then rearguard cried lomaque pushing trudaine on close the line of march and mind you keep step with your young woman there pluck up your spirits citoyenne one gets used to everything in this world even to the guillotine  while he was speaking and pushing at the same time trudaine felt a piece of paper slip quickly between his neck and his cravat courage he whispered pressing his sisters hand as he saw her shuddering under the assumed brutality of lomaques joke  surrounded by the guard of patriots the procession of prisoners moved slowly into the outer courtyard on its way to the revolutionary tribunal the humpbacked jailer bringing up the rear lomaque was about to follow at some little distance but the head jailer hospitably expostulated what a hurry youre in said he now that incorrigible drinker my second in command has gone off with his batch i dont mind asking you to step in and have a drop of wine  thank you answered lomaque but i have rather a fancy for hearing the trial this morning suppose i come back afterward what time do you go to your section at two oclock eh good i shall try if i cant get here soon after one with these words he nodded and went out the brilliant sunlight in the courtyard made him wink faster than ever had any of his old enemies been with him they would have whispered within themselves if you mean to come back at all citizen lomaque it will not be soon after one  on his way through the streets the chief agent met one or two police office friends who delayed his progress so that when he arrived at the revolutionary tribunal the trials of the day were just about to begin  the principal article of furniture in the hall of justice was a long clumsy deal table covered with green baize at the head of this table sat the president and his court with their hats on backed by a heterogeneous collection of patriots officially connected in various ways with the proceedings that were to take place below the front of the table a railedoff space with a gallery beyond was appropriated to the general publicmostly represented as to the gallery on this occasion by women all sitting together on forms knitting shirtmending and babylinenmaking as coolly as if they were at home parallel with the side of the table furthest from the great door of entrance was a low platform railed off on which the prisoners surrounded by their guard were now assembled to await their trial the sun shone in brightly from a high window and a hum of ceaseless talking pervaded the hall cheerfully as lomaque entered it he was a privileged man here as at the prison and he made his way in by a private door so as to pass to the prisoners platform and to walk round it before he got to a place behind the presidents chair trudaine standing with his sister on the outermost limits of the group nodded significantly as lomaque looked up at him for an instant he had contrived on his way to the tribunal to get an opportunity of reading the paper which the chief agent had slipped into his cravat it contained these lines  i have just discovered who the citizen and citoyenne dubois are there is no chance for you but to confess everything by that means you may inculpate a certain citizen holding authority and may make it his interest if he loves his own life to save yours and your sisters  arrived at the back of the presidents chair lomaque recognized his two trusty subordinates magloire and picard waiting among the assembled patriot officials to give their evidence beyond them leaning against the wall addressed by no one and speaking to no one stood the superintendent danville doubt and suspense were written in every line of his face the fretfulness of an uneasy mind expressed itself in his slightest gestureeven in his manner of passing a handkerchief from time to time over his face on which the perspiration was gathering thick and fast already  silence cried the usher of the court for the time beinga hoarsevoiced man in topboots with a huge saber buckled to his side and a bludgeon in his hand silence for the citizen president he reiterated striking his bludgeon on the table  the president rose and proclaimed that the sitting for the day had begun then sat down again  the momentary silence which followed was interrupted by a sudden confusion among the prisoners on the platform two of the guards sprang in among them there was the thump of a heavy falla scream of terror from some of the female prisonersthen another dead silence broken by one of the guards who walked across the hall with a bloody knife in his hand and laid it on the table citizen president he said i have to report that one of the prisoners has just stabbed himself there was a murmuring exclamation is that all among the women spectators as they resumed their work suicide at the bar of justice was no uncommon occurrence under the reign of terror  name asked the president quietly taking up his pen and opening a book  martigne answered the humpbacked jailer coming forward to the table  description  exroyalist coachmaker to the tyrant capet  accusation  conspiracy in prison  the president nodded and entered in the book martigne coachmaker accused of conspiring in prison anticipated course of law by suicide action accepted as sufficient confession of guilt goods confiscated 1st thermidor year two of the republic  silence cried the man with the bludgeon as the president dropped a little sand on the entry and signing to the jailer that he might remove the dead body closed the book  any special cases this morning resumed the president looking round at the group behind him  there is one said lomaque making his way to the back of the official chair will it be convenient to you citizen to take the case of louis trudaine and rose danville first two of my men are detained here as witnesses and their time is valuable to the republic  the president marked a list of names before him and handed it to the crier or usher placing the figures one and two against louis trudaine and rose danville  while lomaque was backing again to his former place behind the chair danville approached and whispered to him there is a rumor that secret information has reached you about the citizen and citoyenne dubois is it true do you know who they are  yes answered lomaque but i have superior orders to keep the information to myself just at present  the eagerness with which danville put his question and the disappointment he showed on getting no satisfactory answer to it were of a nature to satisfy the observant chief agent that his superintendent was really as ignorant as he appeared to be on the subject of the man and woman dubois that one mystery at any rate was still for danville a mystery unrevealed  louis trudaine rose danville shouted the crier with another rap of his bludgeon  the two came forward at the appeal to the front railing of the platform the first sight of her judges the first shock on confronting the pitiless curiosity of the audience seemed to overwhelm rose she turned from deadly pale to crimson then to pale again and hid her face on her brothers shoulder how fast she heard his heart throbbing how the tears filled her eyes as she felt that his fear was all for her  now said the president writing down their names denounced by whom  magloire and picard stepped forward to the table the first answeredby citizen superintendent danville  the reply made a great stir and sensation among both prisoners and audience  accused of what pursued the president  the male prisoner of conspiracy against the republic the female prisoner of criminal knowledge of the same  produce your proofs in answer to this order  picard and magloire opened their minutes of evidence and read to the president the same particulars which they had formerly read to lomaque in the secret police office  good said the president when they had done we need trouble ourselves with nothing more than the identifying of the citizen and citoyenne dubois which of course you are prepared for have you heard the evidence he continued turning to the prisoners while picard and magloire consulted together in whispers looking perplexedly toward the chief agent who stood silent behind them have you heard the evidence prisoners do you wish to say anything if you do remember that the time of this tribunal is precious and that you will not be suffered to waste it  i demand permission to speak for myself and for my sister answered trudaine my object is to save the time of the tribunal by making a confession  the faint whispering audible among the women spectators a moment before ceased instantaneously as he pronounced the word confession in the breathless silence his low quiet tones penetrated to the remotest corners of the hall while suppressing externally all evidences of the deathagony of hope within him he continued his address in these words  i confess my secret visits to the house in the rue de clery i confess that the persons whom i went to see are the persons pointed at in the evidence and lastly i confess that my object in communicating with them as i did was to supply them with the means of leaving france if i had acted from political motives to the political prejudice of the existing government i admit that i should be guilty of that conspiracy against the republic with which i am charged but no political purpose animated no political necessity urged me in performing the action which has brought me to the bar of this tribunal the persons whom i aided in leaving france were without political influence or political connections i acted solely from private motives of humanity toward them and toward othersmotives which a good republican may feel and yet not turn traitor to the welfare of his country  are you ready to inform the court next who the man and woman dubois really are inquired the president impatiently  i am ready answered trudaine but first i desire to say one word in reference to my sister charged here at the bar with me his voice grew less steady and for the first time his color began to change as rose lifted her face from his shoulder and looked up at him eagerly i implore the tribunal to consider my sister as innocent of all active participation in what is charged against me as a crime he went on having spoken with candor about myself i have some claim to be believed when i speak of her when i assert that she neither did help me nor could help me if there be blame it is mine only if punishment it is i alone who should suffer  he stopped suddenly and grew confused it was easy to guard himself from the peril of looking at rose but he could not escape the hard trial to his selfpossession of hearing her if she spoke just as he pronounced the last sentence she raised her face again from his shoulder and eagerly whispered to him  no no louis not that sacrifice after all the othersnot that though you should force me into speaking to them myself  she abruptly quitted her hold of him and fronted the whole court in an instant the railing in front of her shook with the quivering of her arms and hands as she held by it to support herself her hair lay tangled on her shoulders her face had assumed a strange fixedness her gentle blue eyes so soft and tender at all other times were lit up wildly a low hum of murmured curiosity and admiration broke from the women of the audience some rose eagerly from the benches others cried  listen listen she is going to speak  she did speak silvery and pure the sweet voice sweeter than ever in sadness stole its way through the gross soundsthrough the coarse humming and the hissing whispers  my lord the president began the poor girl firmly her next words were drowned in a volley of hisses from the women  ah aristocrat aristocrat none of your accursed titles here was their shrill cry at her she fronted that cry she fronted the fierce gestures which accompanied it with the steady light still in her eyes with the strange rigidity still fastened on her face she would have spoken again through the uproar and execration but her brothers voice overpowered her  citizen president he cried i have not concluded i demand leave to complete my confession i implore the tribunal to attach no importance to what my sister says the trouble and terror of this day have shaken her intellects she is not responsible for her wordsi assert it solemnly in the face of the whole court  the blood flew up into his white face as he made the asseveration even at that supreme moment the great heart of the man reproached him for yielding himself to a deception though the motive of it was to save his sisters life  let her speak let her speak exclaimed the women as rose without moving without looking at her brother without seeming even to have heard what he said made a second attempt to address her judges in spite of trudaines interposition  silence shouted the man with the bludgeon silence you women the citizen president is going to speak  the prisoner trudaine has the ear of the court said the president and may continue his confession if the female prisoner wishes to speak she may be heard afterward i enjoin both the accused persons to make short work of it with their addresses to me or they will make their case worse instead of better i command silence among the audience and if i am not obeyed i will clear the hall now prisoner trudaine i invite you to proceed no more about your sister let her speak for herself your business and ours is with the man and woman dubois are you or are you not ready to tell the court who they are  i repeat that i am ready answered trudaine the citizen dubois is a servant the woman dubois is the mother of the man who denounces mesuperintendent danville  a low murmuring rushing sound of hundreds of exclaiming voices all speaking halfsuppressedly at the same moment followed the delivery of the answer no officer of the court attempted to control the outburst of astonishment the infection of it spread to the persons on the platform to the crier himself to the judges of the tribunal lounging but the moment before so carelessly silent in their chairs when the noise was at length quelled it was subdued in the most instantaneous manner by one man who shouted from the throng behind the presidents chair  clear the way there superintendent danville is taken ill  a vehement whispering and contending of many voices interrupting each other followed then a swaying among the assembly of official people then a great stillness then the sudden appearance of danville alone at the table  the look of him as he turned his ghastly face toward the audience silenced and steadied them in an instant just as they were on the point of falling into fresh confusion every one stretched forward eagerly to hear what he would say his lips moved but the few words that fell from them were inaudible except to the persons who happened to be close by him having spoken he left the table supported by a police agent who was seen to lead him toward the private door of the court and consequently also toward the prisoners platform he stopped however halfway quickly turned his face from the prisoners and pointing toward the public door at the opposite side of the hall caused himself to be led out into the air by that direction when he had gone the president addressing himself partly to trudaine and partly to the audience said  the citizen superintendent danville has been overcome by the heat in the court he has retired by my desire under the care of a police agent to recover in the open air pledging himself to me to come back and throw a new light on the extraordinary and suspicious statement which the prisoner has just made until the return of citizen danville i order the accused trudaine to suspend any further acknowledgment of complicity which he may have to address to me this matter must be cleared up before other matters are entered on meanwhile in order that the time of the tribunal may not be wasted i authorize the female prisoner to take this opportunity of making any statement concerning herself which she may wish to address to the judges  silence him remove him out of court gag him guillotine him these cries rose from the audience the moment the president had done speaking they were all directed at trudaine who had made a last desperate effort to persuade his sister to keep silence and had been detected in the attempt by the spectators  if the prisoner speaks another word to his sister remove him said the president addressing the guard round the platform  good we shall hear her at last silence silence exclaimed the women settling themselves comfortably on their benches and preparing to resume their work  rose danville the court is waiting to hear you said the president crossing his legs and leaning back luxuriously in his large armchair  amid all the noise and confusion of the last few minutes rose had stood ever in the same attitude with that strangely fixed expression never altering on her face but once when her husband made his way to the side of the table and stood there prominently alone her lips trembled a little and a faint shade of color passed swiftly over her cheeks even that slight change had vanished nowshe was paler stiller more widely altered from her former self than ever as she faced the president and said these words  i wish to follow my brothers example and make my confession as he has made his i would rather he had spoken for me but he is too generous to say any words except such as he thinks may save me from sharing his punishment i refuse to be saved unless he is saved with me where he goes when he leaves this place i will go what he suffers i will suffer if he is to die i believe god will grant me the strength to die resignedly with him  she paused for a moment and half turned toward trudainethen checked herself instantly and went on this is what i now wish to say as to my share in the offense charged against my brother some time ago he told me one day that he had seen my husbands mother in paris disguised as a poor woman that he had spoken to her and forced her to acknowledge herself up to this time we had all felt certain that she had left france because she held oldfashioned opinions which it is dangerous for people to hold nowhad left france before we came to paris she told my brother that she had indeed gone with an old tried servant of the family to help and protect her as far as marseilles and that finding unforeseen difficulty there in getting further she had taken it as a warning from providence not to desert her son of whom she was very passionately fond and from whom she had been most unwilling to depart instead of waiting in exile for quieter times she determined to go and hide herself in paris knowing her son was going there too she assumed the name of her old and faithful servant who declined to the last to leave her unprotected and she proposed to live in the strictest secrecy and retirement watching unknown the career of her son and ready at a moments notice to disclose herself to him when the settlement of public affairs might reunite her safely to her beloved child my brother thought this plan full of danger both for herself for her son and for the honest old man who was risking his head for his mistresss sake i thought so too and in an evil hour i said to louis will you try in secret to get my husbands mother away and see that her faithful servant makes her really leave france this time i wrongly asked my brother to do this for a selfish reason of my owna reason connected with my married life which has not been a happy one i had not succeeded in gaining my husbands affection and was not treated kindly by him my brotherwho has always loved me far more dearly i am afraid than i have ever deservedmy brother increased his kindness to me seeing me treated unkindly by my husband this made illblood between them my thought when i asked my brother to do for me what i have said was that if we two in secret saved my husbands mother without danger to him from imperiling herself and her son we should when the time came for speaking of what we had done appear to my husband in a new and better light i should have shown how well i deserved his love and louis would have shown how well he deserved his brotherinlaws gratitude and so we should have made home happy at last and all three have lived together affectionately this was my thought and when i told it to my brother and asked him if there would be much risk out of his kindness and indulgence toward me he said no he had so used me to accept sacrifices for my happiness that i let him endanger himself to help me in my little household plan i repent this bitterly now i ask his pardon with my whole heart if he is acquitted i will try to show myself worthier of his love if he is found guilty i too will go to the scaffold and die with my brother who risked his life for my sake  she ceased as quietly as she had begun and turned once more to her brother  as she looked away from the court and looked at him a few tears came into her eyes and something of the old softness of form and gentleness of expression seemed to return to her face he let her take his hand but he seemed purposely to avoid meeting the anxious gaze she fixed on him his head sunk on his breast he drew his breath heavily his countenance darkened and grew distorted as if he were suffering some sharp pang of physical pain he bent down a little and leaning his elbow on the rail before him covered his face with his hand and so quelled the rising agony so forced back the scalding tears to his heart the audience had heard rose in silence and they preserved the same tranquillity when she had done this was a rare tribute to a prisoner from the people of the reign of terror  the president looked round at his colleagues and shook his head suspiciously  this statement of the female prisoners complicates the matter very seriously said he is there anybody in court he added looking at the persons behind his chair who knows where the mother of superintendent danville and the servant are now  lomaque came forward at the appeal and placed himself by the table  why citizen agent continued the president looking hard at him are you overcome by the heat too  the fit seemed to take him citizen president when the female prisoner had made an end of her statement exclaimed magloire pressing forward officiously  lomaque gave his subordinate a look which sent the man back directly to the shelter of the official group then said in lower tones than were customary with him  i have received information relative to the mother of superintendent danville and the servant and am ready to answer any questions that may be put to me  where are they now asked the president  she and the servant are known to have crossed the frontier and are supposed to be on their way to cologne but since they have entered germany their whereabouts is necessarily a matter of uncertainty to the republican authorities  have you any information relative to the conduct of the old servant while he was in paris  i have information enough to prove that he was not an object for political suspicion he seems to have been simply animated by servile zeal for the womans interests to have performed for her all the menial offices of a servant in private and to have misled the neighbors by affected equality with her in public  have you any reason to believe that superintendent danville was privy to his mothers first attempt at escaping from france  i infer it from what the female prisoner has said and for other reasons which it would be irregular to detail before the tribunal the proofs can no doubt be obtained if i am allowed time to communicate with the authorities at lyons and marseilles  at this moment danville reentered the court and advancing to the table placed himself close by the chief agents side they looked each other steadily in the face for an instant  he has recovered from the shock of trudaines answer thought lomaque retiring his hand trembles his face is pale but i can see regained selfpossession in his eye and i dread the consequences already  citizen president began danville i demand to know if anything has transpired affecting my honor and patriotism in my absence  he spoke apparently with the most perfect calmness but he looked nobody in the face his eyes were fixed steadily on the green baize of the table beneath him  the female prisoner has made a statement referring principally to herself and her brother answered the president but incidentally mentioning a previous attempt on your mothers part to break existing laws by emigrating from france this portion of the confession contains in it some elements of suspicion which seriously affect you  they shall be suspicions no longerat my own peril i will change them to certainties exclaimed danville extending his arm theatrically and looking up for the first time citizen president i avow it with the fearless frankness of a good patriot i was privy to my mothers first attempt at escaping from france  hisses and cries of execration followed this confession he winced under them at first but recovered his selfpossession before silence was restored  citizens you have heard the confession of my fault he resumed turning with desperate assurance toward the audience now hear the atonement i have made for it at the altar of my country  he waited at the end of that sentence until the secretary to the tribunal had done writing it down in the report book of the court  transcribe faithfully to the letter cried danville pointing solemnly to the open page of the volume life and death hang on my words  the secretary took a fresh dip of ink and nodded to show that he was ready danville went on  in these times of glory and trial for france he proceeded pitching his voice to a tone of deep emotion what are all good citizens most sacredly bound to do to immolate their dearest private affections and interests before their public duties on the first attempt of my mother to violate the laws against emigration by escaping from france i failed in making the heroic sacrifice which inexorable patriotism demanded of me my situation was more terrible than the situation of brutus sitting in judgment on his own sons i had not the roman fortitude to rise equal to it i erred citizenserred as coriolanus did when his august mother pleaded with him for the safety of rome for that error i deserved to be purged out of the republican community but i escaped my merited punishmentnay i even rose to the honor of holding an office under the government time passed and again my mother attempted an escape from france again inevitable fate brought my civic virtue to the test how did i meet this second supremest trial by an atonement for past weakness terrible as the trial itself citizens you will shudder but you will applaud while you tremble citizens look and while you look remember well the evidence given at the opening of this case yonder stands the enemy of his country who intrigued to help my mother to escape here stands the patriot son whose voice was the first the only voice to denounce him for the crime as he spoke he pointed to trudaine then struck himself on the breast then folded his arms and looked sternly at the benches occupied by the spectators  do you assert exclaimed the president that at the time when you denounced trudaine you knew him to be intriguing to aid your mothers escape  i assert it answered danville  the pen which the president held dropped from his hand at that reply his colleagues started and looked at each other in blank silence  a murmur of monster monster began with the prisoners on the platform and spread instantly to the audience who echoed and echoed it again the fiercest womanrepublican on the benches joined cause at last with the haughtiest womanaristocrat on the platform even in that sphere of direst discords in that age of sharpest enmities the one touch of nature preserved its old eternal virtue and roused the motherinstinct which makes the whole world kin  of the few persons in the court who at once foresaw the effect of danvilles answer on the proceedings of the tribunal lomaque was one his sallow face whitened as he looked toward the prisoners platform  they are lost he murmured to himself moving out of the group in which he had hitherto stood lost the lie which has saved that villains head leaves them without the shadow of a hope no need to stop for the sentencedanvilles infamous presence of mind has given them up to the guillotine pronouncing these words he went out hurriedly by a door near the platform which led to the prisoners waitingroom  roses head sank again on her brothers shoulder she shuddered and leaned back faintly on the arm which he extended to support her one of the female prisoners tried to help trudaine in speaking consolingly to her but the consummation of her husbands perfidy seemed to have paralyzed her at heart she murmured once in her brothers ear louis i am resigned to dienothing but death is left for me after the degradation of having loved that man she said those words and closed her eyes wearily and spoke no more  one other question and you may retire resumed the president addressing danville were you cognizant of your wifes connection with her brothers conspiracy  danville reflected for a moment remembered that there were witnesses in court who could speak to his language and behavior on the evening of his wifes arrest and resolved this time to tell the truth  i was not aware of it he answered testimony in my favor can be called which will prove that when my wifes complicity was discovered i was absent from paris  heartlessly selfpossessed as he was the public reception of his last reply had shaken his nerve he now spoke in low tones turning his back on the spectators and fixing his eyes again on the green baize of the table at which he stood  prisoners have you any objection to make any evidence to call invalidating the statement by which citizen danville has cleared himself of suspicion inquired the president  he has cleared himself by the most execrable of all falsehoods answered trudaine if his mother could be traced and brought here her testimony would prove it  can you produce any other evidence in support of your allegation asked the president  i cannot  citizen superintendent danville you are at liberty to retire your statement will be laid before the authority to whom you are officially responsible either you merit a civic crown for more than roman virtue or having got thus far the president stopped abruptly as if unwilling to commit himself too soon to an opinion and merely repeated you may retire  danville left the court immediately going out again by the public door he was followed by murmurs from the womens benches which soon ceased however when the president was observed to close his notebook and turn round toward his colleagues the sentence was the general whisper now hush hushthe sentence  after a consultation of a few minutes with the persons behind him the president rose and spoke the momentous words  louis trudaine and rose danville the revolutionary tribunal having heard the charge against you and having weighed the value of what you have said in answer to it decides that you are both guilty and condemns you to the penalty of death  having delivered the sentence in those terms he sat down again and placed a mark against the two first condemned names on the list of prisoners immediately afterward the next case was called on and the curiosity of the audience was stimulated by a new trial    chapter iv  the waitingroom of the revolutionary tribunal was a grim bare place with a dirty stone floor and benches running round the walls the windows were high and barred and at the outer door leading into the street two sentinels kept watch on entering this comfortless retreat from the court lomaque found it perfectly empty solitude was just then welcome to him he remained in the waitingroom walking slowly from end to end over the filthy pavement talking eagerly and incessantly to himself  after a while the door communicating with the tribunal opened and the humpbacked jailer made his appearance leading in trudaine and rose  you will have to wait here said the little man till the rest of them have been tried and sentenced and then you will all go back to prison in a lump ha citizen he continued observing lomaque at the other end of the hall and bustling up to him here still eh if you were going to stop much longer i should ask a favor of you  i am in no hurry said lomaque with a glance at the two prisoners  good cried the humpback drawing his hand across his mouth i am parched with thirst and dying to moisten my throat at the wineshop over the way just mind that man and woman while im gone will you its the merest formtheres a guard outside the windows are barred the tribunal is within hail do you mind obliging me  on the contrary i am glad of the opportunity  thats a good fellowand remember if i am asked for you must say i was obliged to quit the court for a few minutes and left you in charge  with these words the humpbacked jailer ran off to the wineshop  he had scarcely disappeared before trudaine crossed the room and caught lomaque by the arm  save her he whispered there is an opportunitysave her his face was flushedhis eyes wanderedhis breath on the chief agents cheek while he spoke felt scorching hot save her he repeated shaking lomaque by the arm and dragging him toward the door remember all you owe to my fatherremember our talk on that bench by the riverremember what you said to me yourself on the night of the arrestdont wait to thinksave her and leave me without a word if i die alone i can die as a man should if she goes to the scaffold by my side my heart will fail mei shall die the death of a coward i have lived for her lifelet me die for it and i die happy  he tried to say more but the violence of his agitation forbade it he could only shake the arm he held again and again and point to the bench on which rose sather head sunk on her bosom her hands crossed listlessly on her lap  there are two armed sentinels outsidethe windows are barredyou are without weaponsand even if you had them there is a guardhouse within hail on one side of you and the tribunal on the other escape from this room is impossible answered lomaque  impossible repeated the other furiously you traitor you coward can you look at her sitting there helpless her very life ebbing away already with every minute that passes and tell me coolly that escape is impossible  in the frenzy of his grief and despair he lifted his disengaged hand threateningly while he spoke lomaque caught him by the wrist and drew him toward a window open at the top  you are not in your right senses said the chief agent firmly anxiety and apprehension on your sisters account have shaken your mind try to compose yourself and listen to me i have something important to say trudaine looked at him incredulously important continued lomaque as affecting your sisters interests at this terrible crisis  that last appeal had an instantaneous effect trudaines outstretched hand dropped to his side and a sudden change passed over his expression  give me a moment he said faintly and turning away leaned against the wall and pressed his burning forehead on the chill damp stone he did not raise his head again till he had mastered himself and could say quietly speak i am fit to hear you and sufficiently in my senses to ask your forgiveness for what i said just now  when i left the tribunal and entered this room lomaque began in a whisper there was no thought in my mind that could be turned to good account either for your sister or for you i was fit for nothing but to deplore the failure of the confession which i came to st lazare to suggest to you as your best plan of defense since then an idea has struck me which may be usefulan idea so desperate so uncertaininvolving a proposal so absolutely dependent as to its successful execution on the merest chance that i refuse to confide it to you except on one condition  mention the condition i submit to it before hand  give me your word of honor that you will not mention what i am about to say to your sister until i grant you permission to speak promise me that when you see her shrinking before the terrors of death tonight you will have selfrestraint enough to abstain from breathing a word of hope to her i ask this because there are tentwentyfifty chances to one that there is no hope  i have no choice but to promise answered trudaine  lomaque produced his pocketbook and pencil before he spoke again  i will enter into particulars as soon as i have asked a strange question of you he said you have been a great experimenter in chemistry in your timeis your mind calm enough at such a trying moment as this to answer a question which is connected with chemistry in a very humble way you seem astonished let me put the question at once is there any liquid or powder or combination of more than one ingredient known which will remove writing from paper and leave no stain behind  certainly but is that all the question is there no greater difficulty  none write the prescription whatever it may be on that leaf said the other giving him the pocketbook write it down with plain directions for use trudaine obeyed this is the first step continued lomaque putting the book in his pocket toward the accomplishment of my purposemy uncertain purpose remember now listen i am going to put my own head in danger for the chance of saving yours and your sisters by tampering with the deathlist dont interrupt me if i can save one i can save the other not a word about gratitude wait till you know the extent of your obligation i tell you plainly at the outset there is a motive of despair as well as a motive of pity at the bottom of the action in which i am now about to engage silence i insist on it our time is short it is for me to speak and for you to listen the president of the tribunal has put the deathmark against your names on the prison list of today that list when the trials are over and it is marked to the end will be called in this room before you are taken to st lazare it will then be sent to robespierre who will keep it having a copy made of it the moment it is delivered for circulation among his colleaguesst just and the rest it is my business to make a duplicate of this copy in the first instance the duplicate will be compared with the original and possibly with the copy too either by robespierre himself or by some one in whom he can place implicit trust and will then be sent to st lazare without passing through my hands again it will be read in public the moment it is received at the grating of the prison and will afterward be kept by the jailer who will refer to it as he goes round in the evening with a piece of chalk to mark the cell doors of the prisoners destined for the guillotine tomorrow that duty happens today to fall to the hunchback whom you saw speaking to me he is a confirmed drinker and i mean to tempt him with such wine as he rarely tastes ifafter the reading of the list in public and before the marking of the cell doorsi can get him to sit down to the bottle i will answer for making him drunk for getting the list out of his pocket and for wiping your names out of it with the prescription you have just written for me i shall write all the names one under another just irregularly enough in my duplicate to prevent the interval left by the erasure from being easily observed if i succeed in this your door will not be marked and your names will not be called tomorrow morning when the tumbrils come for the guillotine in the present confusion of prisoners pouring in every day for trial and prisoners pouring out every day for execution you will have the best possible chance of security against awkward inquiries if you play your cards properly for a good fortnight or ten days at least in that time  well well cried trudaine eagerly  lomaque looked toward the tribunal door and lowered his voice to a fainter whisper before he continued in that time robespierres own head may fall into the sack france is beginning to sicken under the reign of terror frenchmen of the moderate faction who have lain hidden for months in cellars and lofts are beginning to steal out and deliberate by twos and threes together under cover of the night robespierre has not ventured for weeks past to face the convention committee he only speaks among his own friends at the jacobins there are rumors of a terrible discovery made by carnot of a desperate resolution taken by tallien men watching behind the scenes see that the last days of the terror are at hand if robespierre is beaten in the approaching struggle you are savedfor the new reign must be a reign of mercy if he conquers i have only put off the date of your death and your sisters and have laid my own neck under the axe those are your chancesthis is all i can do  he paused and trudaine again endeavored to speak such words as might show that he was not unworthy of the deadly risk which lomaque was prepared to encounter but once more the chief agent peremptorily and irritably interposed  i tell you for the third time he said i will listen to no expressions of gratitude from you till i know when i deserve them it is true that i recollect your fathers timely kindness to metrue that i have not forgotten what passed five years since at your house by the riverside i remember everything down to what you would consider the veriest triflethat cup of coffee for instance which your sister kept hot for me i told you then that you would think better of me some day i know that you do now but this is not all you want to glorify me to my face for risking my life for you i wont hear you because my risk is of the paltriest kind i am weary of my life i cant look back to it with pleasure i am too old to look forward to what is left of it with hope there was something in that night at your house before the weddingsomething in what you said in what your sister didwhich altered me i have had my days of gloom and selfreproach from time to time since then i have sickened at my slavery and subjection and duplicity and cringing first under one master then under another i have longed to look back at my life and comfort myself with the sight of some good action just as a frugal man comforts himself with the sight of his little savings laid by in an old drawer i cant do this and i want to do it the want takes me like a fit at uncertain intervalssuddenly under the most incomprehensible influences a glance up at the blue skystarlight over the houses of this great city when i look out at the night from my garret windowa childs voice coming suddenly i dont know where fromthe piping of my neighbors linnet in his little cagenow one trifling thing now anotherwakes up that want in me in a moment rascal as i am those few simple words your sister spoke to the judge went through and through me like a knife strange in a man like me isnt it i am amazed at it myself my life bah ive let it out for hire to be kicked about by rascals from one dirty place to another like a football its my whim to give it a last kick myself and throw it away decently before it lodges on the dunghill forever your sister kept a good cup of coffee hot for me and i give her a bad life in return for the compliment you want to thank me for it what folly thank me when i have done something useful dont thank me for that  he snapped his fingers contemptuously as he spoke and walked away to the outer door to receive the jailer who returned at that moment  well inquired the hunchback has anybody asked for me  no answered lomaque not a soul has entered the room what sort of wine did you get  soso good at a pinch friendgood at a pinch  ah you should go to my shop and try a certain cask filled with a particular vintage  what shop which vintage  i cant stop to tell you now but we shall most likely meet again today i expect to be at the prison this afternoon shall i ask for you good i wont forget with those farewell words he went out and never so much as looked back at the prisoners before he closed the door  trudaine returned to his sister fearful lest his face should betray what had passed during the extraordinary interview between lomaque and himself but whatever change there might be in his expression rose did not seem to notice it she was still strangely inattentive to all outward things that spirit of resignation which is the courage of women in all great emergencies seemed now to be the one animating spirit that fed the flame of life within her  when her brother sat down by her she only took his hand gently and said let us stop together like this louis till the time comes i am not afraid of it for i have nothing but you to make me love life and you too are going to die do you remember the time when i used to grieve that i had never had a child to be some comfort to me i was thinking a moment ago how terrible it would have been now if my wish had been granted it is a blessing for me in this great misery that i am childless let us talk of old days louis as long as we cannot of my husband or my marriageonly of the old times before i was a burden and a trouble to you    chapter v  the day wore on by ones and twos and threes at a time the condemned prisoners came from the tribunal and collected in the waitingroom at two oclock all was ready for the calling over of the deathlist it was read and verified by an officer of the court and then the jailer took his prisoners back to st lazare  evening came the prisoners meal had been served the duplicate of the deathlist had been read in public at the grate the cell doors were all locked from the day of their arrest rose and her brother partly through the influence of a bribe partly through lomaques intercession had been confined together in one cell and together they now awaited the dread event of the morrow  to rose that event was deathdeath to the thought of which at least she was now resigned to trudaine the fastnearing future was darkening hour by hour with the uncertainty which is worse than death with the faint fearful unpartaken suspense which keeps the mind ever on the rack and wears away the heart slowly through the long unsolaced agony of that dreadful night but one relief came to him the tension of every nerve the crushing weight of the one fatal oppression that clung to every thought relaxed a little when roses bodily powers began to sink under her mental exhaustionwhen her sad dying talk of the happy times that were passed ceased softly and she laid her head on his shoulder and let the angel of slumber take her yet for a little while even though she lay already under the shadow of the angel of death  the morning came and the hot summer sunrise what life was left in the terrorstruck city awoke for the day faintly and still the suspense of the long night remained unlightened it was drawing near the hour when the tumbrils were to come for the victims doomed on the day before trudaines ear could detect even the faintest sound in the echoing prison region outside his cell soon listening near the door he heard voices disputing on the other side of it suddenly the bolts were drawn back the key turned in the lock and he found himself standing face to face with the hunchback and one of the subordinate attendants on the prisoners  look muttered this last man sulkily there they are safe in their cell just as i said but i tell you again they are not down in the list what do you mean by bullying me about not chalking their door last night along with the rest catch me doing your work for you again when youre too drunk to do it yourself  hold your tongue and let me have another look at the list returned the hunchback turning away from the cell door and snatching a slip of paper from the others hand the devil take me if i can make head or tail of it he exclaimed scratching his head after a careful examination of the list i could swear that i read over their names at the grate yesterday afternoon with my own lips and yet look as long as i may i certainly cant find them written down here give us a pinch friend am i awake or dreaming drunk or sober this morning  sober i hope said a quiet voice at his elbow i have just looked in to see how you are after yesterday  how i am citizen lomaque petrified with astonishment you yourself took charge of that man and woman for me in the waitingroom yesterday morning and as for myself i could swear to having read their names at the grate yesterday afternoon yet this morning here are no such things as these said names to be found in the list what do you think of that  and what do you think interrupted the aggrieved subordinate of his having the impudence to bully me for being careless in chalking the doors when he was too drunk to do it himself too drunk to know his right hand from his left if i wasnt the bestnatured man in the world i should report him to the head jailer  quite right of you to excuse him and quite wrong of him to bully you said lomaque persuasively take my advice he continued confidentially to the hunchback and dont trust too implicitly to that slippery memory of yours after our little drinking bout yesterday you could not really have read their names at the grate you know or of course they would be down on the list as for the waitingroom at the tribunal a word in your ear chief agents of police know strange secrets the president of the court condemns and pardons in public but there is somebody else with the power of ten thousand presidents who now and then condemns and pardons in private you can guess who i say no more except that i recommend you to keep your head on your shoulders by troubling it about nothing but the list there in your hand stick to that literally and nobody can blame you make a fuss about mysteries that dont concern you and  lomaque stopped and holding his hand edgewise let it drop significantly over the hunchbacks head that action and the hints which preceded it seemed to bewilder the little man more than ever he stared perplexedly at lomaque uttered a word or two of rough apology to his subordinate and rolling his misshapen head portentously walked away with the deathlist crumpled up nervously in his hand  i should like to have a sight of them and see if they really are the same man and woman whom i looked after yesterday morning in the waitingroom said lomaque putting his hand on the cell door just as the deputyjailer was about to close it again  look in by all means said the man no doubt you will find that drunken booby as wrong in what he told you about them as he is about everything else  lomaque made use of the privilege granted to him immediately he saw trudaine sitting with his sister in the corner of the cell furthest from the door evidently for the purpose of preventing her from overhearing the conversation outside there was an unsettled look however in her eyes a slowlyheightening color in her cheeks which showed her to be at least vaguely aware that something unusual had been taking place in the corridor  lomaque beckoned to trudaine to leave her and whispered to him the prescription has worked well you are safe for today break the news to your sister as gently as you can danville he stopped and listened till he satisfied himself by the sound of the deputyjailers footsteps that the man was lounging toward the further end of the corridor danville he resumed after having mixed with the people outside the grate yesterday and having heard your names read was arrested in the evening by secret order from robespierre and sent to the temple what charge will be laid to him or when he will be brought to trial it is impossible to say i only know that he is arrested hush dont talk now my friend outside is coming back keep quiethope everything from the chances and changes of public affairs and comfort yourself with the thought that you are both safe for today  and tomorrow whispered trudaine  dont think of tomorrow returned lomaque turning away hurriedly to the door let tomorrow take care of itself     part third    chapter 1  on a spring morning in the year seventeen hundred and ninetyeight the public conveyance then running between chalonssurmarne and paris sat down one of its outside passengers at the first poststation beyond meaux the traveler an old man after looking about him hesitatingly for a moment or two betook himself to a little inn opposite the posthouse known by the sign of the piebald horse and kept by the widow duvala woman who enjoyed and deserved the reputation of being the fastest talker and the best maker of gibelotte in the whole locality  although the traveler was carelessly noticed by the village idlers and received without ceremony by the widow duval he was by no means so ordinary and uninteresting a stranger as the rustics of the place were pleased to consider him the time had been when this quiet elderly unobtrusive applicant for refreshment at the piebald house was trusted with the darkest secrets of the reign of terror and was admitted at all times and seasons to speak face to face with maximilian robespierre himself the widow duval and the hangerson in front of the posthouse would have been all astonished indeed if any wellinformed personage from the metropolis had been present to tell them that the modest old traveler with the shabby little carpetbag was an exchief agent of the secret police of paris  between three and four years had elapsed since lomaque had exercised for the last time his official functions under the reign of terror his shoulders had contracted an extra stoop and his hair had all fallen off except at the sides and back of his head in some other respects however advancing age seemed to have improved rather than deteriorated him in personal appearance his complexion looked healthier his expression cheerfuller his eyes brighter than they had ever been of late years he walked too with a brisker step than the step of old times in the police office and his dress although it certainly did not look like the costume of a man in affluent circumstances was cleaner and far more nearly worn than ever it had been in the past days of his political employment at paris  he sat down alone in the inn parlor and occupied the time while his hostess had gone to fetch the halfbottle of wine that he ordered in examining a dirty old card which he extricated from a mass of papers in his pocketbook and which bore written on it these lines  when the troubles are over do not forget those who remember you with eternal gratitude stop at the first poststation beyond meaux on the highroad to paris and ask at the inn for citizen maurice whenever you wish to see us or to hear of us again  pray inquired lomaque putting the card in his pocket when the widow duval brought in the wine can you inform me whether a person named maurice lives anywhere in this neighborhood  can i inform you repeated the voluble widow of course i can citizen maurice and the citoyenne his amiable sisterwho is not to be passed over because you dont mention her my honest manlives within ten minutes walk of my house a charming cottage in a charming situation inhabited by two charming peopleso quiet so retiring such excellent pay i supply them with everythingfowls eggs bread butter vegetables not that they eat much of anything wine which they dont drink half enough of to do them good in short i victual the dear little hermitage and love the two amiable recluses with all my heart ah they have had their troubles poor people the sister especially though they never talk about them when they first came to live in our neighborhood  i beg pardon citoyenne but if you would only be so kind as to direct me  which is threeno fourno three years and a half agoin short just after the time when that satan of a man robespierre had his head cut off and serve him right i said to my husband who was on his last legs then poor man shell diemeaning the lady she didnt though my fowls eggs bread butter vegetables and wine carried her throughalways in combination with the anxious care of citizen maurice yes yes let us be tenderly conscientious in giving credit where credit is due let us never forget that the citizen maurice contributed something to the cure of the interesting invalid as well as the victuals and drink from the piebald horse there she is now the prettiest little woman in the prettiest little cottage  where will you be so obliging as to tell me where  and in excellent health except that she is subject now and then to nervous attacks having evidently as i believe been struck with some dreadful frightmost likely during that accursed time of the terror for they came from parisyou dont drink honest man why dont you drink very very pretty in a pale way figure perhaps too thinlet me pour it out for youbut an angel of gentleness and attached in such a touching way to the citizen maurice  citizen hostess will you or will you not tell me where they live  you droll little man why did you not ask me that before if you wanted to know finish your wine and come to the door theres your change and thank you for your custom though it isnt much come to the door i say and dont interrupt me youre an old mancan you see forty yards before you yes you can dont be peevishthat never did anybody any good yet now look back along the road where i am pointing you see a large heap of stones good on the other side of the heap of stones there is a little path you cant see that but you can remember what i tell you good you go down the path till you get to a stream down the stream till you get to a bridge down the other bank of the stream after crossing the bridge till you get to an old watermilla jewel of a watermill famous for miles round artists from the four quarters of the globe are always coming to sketch it ah what you are getting peevish again you wont wait impatient old man what a life your wife must lead if you have got one remember the bridge ah your poor wife and children i pity them your daughters especially pst pst remember the bridgepeevish old man remember the bridge  walking as fast as he could out of hearing of the widow duvals tongue lomaque took the path by the heap of stones which led out of the highroad crossed the stream and arrived at the old watermill close by it stood a cottagea rough simple building with a strip of garden in front lomaques observant eyes marked the graceful arrangement of the flowerbeds and the delicate whiteness of the curtains that hung behind the badlyglazed narrow windows this must be the place he said to himself as he knocked at the door with his stick i can see the traces of her hand before i cross the threshold  the door was opened pray does the citizen maurice lomaque began not seeing clearly for the first moment in the dark little passage  before he could say any more his hand was grasped his carpetbag was taken from him and a wellknown voice cried welcome a thousand thousand times welcome at last citizen maurice is not at home but louis trudaine takes his place and is overjoyed to see once more the best and dearest of his friends  i hardly know you again how you are altered for the better exclaimed lomaque as they entered the parlor of the cottage  remember that you see me after a long freedom from anxiety since i have lived here i have gone to rest at night and have not been afraid of the morning replied trudaine he went out into the passage while he spoke and called at the foot of the one flight of stairs which the cottage possessed rose rose come down the friend whom you most wished to see has arrived at last  she answered the summons immediately the frank friendly warmth of her greeting her resolute determination after the first inquiries were over to help the guest to take off his upper coat with her own hands so confused and delighted lomaque that he hardly knew which way to turn or what to say  this is even more trying in a pleasant way to a lonely old fellow like me he was about to add than the unexpected civility of the hot cup of coffee years ago but remembering what recollections even that trifling circumstance might recall he checked himself  more trying than what asked rose leading him to a chair  ah i forget i am in my dotage already he answered confusedly i have not got used just yet to the pleasure of seeing your kind face again it was indeed a pleasure to look at that face now after lomaques last experience of it three years of repose though they had not restored to rose those youthful attractions which she had lost forever in the days of the terror had not passed without leaving kindly outward traces of their healing progress though the girlish roundness had not returned to her cheeks or the girlish delicacy of color to her complexion her eyes had recovered much of their old softness and her expression all of its old winning charm what was left of latent sadness in her face and of significant quietness in her manner remained gently and harmlesslyremained rather to show what had been once than what was now  when they were all seated there was however something like a momentary return to the suspense and anxiety of past days in their faces as trudaine looking earnestly at lomaque asked do you bring any news from paris  none he replied but excellent news instead from rouen i have heard accidentally through the employer whom i have been serving since we parted that your old house by the riverside is to let again  rose started from her chair oh louis if we could only live there once more my flowergarden she continued to lomaque  cultivated throughout he answered by the late proprietor  and the laboratory added her brother  left standing said lomaque here is a letter with all the particulars you may depend upon them for the writer is the person charged with the letting of the house  trudaine looked over the letter eagerly  the price is not beyond our means he said after our three years economy here we can afford to give something for a great pleasure  oh what a day of happiness it will be when we go home again cried rose pray write to your friend at once she added addressing lomaque and say we take the house before any one else is beforehand with us  he nodded and folding up the letter mechanically in the old official form made a note on it in the old official manner trudaine observed the action and felt its association with past times of trouble and terror his face grew grave again as he said to lomaque and is this good news really all the news of importance you have to tell us  lomaque hesitated and fidgeted in his chair what other news i have will bear keeping he replied there are many questions i should like to ask first about your sister and yourself do you mind allowing me to refer for a moment to the time when we last met  he addressed this inquiry to rose who answered in the negative but her voice seemed to falter even in saying the one word no she turned her head away when she spoke and lomaque noticed that her hands trembled as she took up some work lying on a table near and hurriedly occupied herself with it  we speak as little about that time as possible said trudaine looking significantly toward his sister but we have some questions to ask you in our turn so the allusion for this once is inevitable your sudden disappearance at the very crisis of that time of danger has not yet been fully explained to us the one short note which you left behind you helped us to guess at what had happened rather than to understand it  i can easily explain it now answered lomaque the sudden overthrow of the reign of terror which was salvation to you was destruction to me the new republican reign was a reign of mercy except for the tail of robespierre as the phrase ran then every man who had been so wicked or so unfortunate as to be involved even in the meanest capacity with the machinery of the government of terror was threatened and justly with the fate of robespierre i among others fell under this menace of death i deserved to die and should have resigned myself to the guillotine but for you from the course taken by public events i knew you would be saved and although your safety was the work of circumstances still i had a hand in rendering it possible at the outset and a yearning came over me to behold you both free again with my own eyesa selfish yearning to see in you a living breathing real result of the one good impulse of my heart which i could look back on with satisfaction this desire gave me a new interest in life i resolved to escape death if it were possible for ten days i lay hidden in paris after thatthanks to certain scraps of useful knowledge which my experience in the office of secret police had given mei succeeded in getting clear of paris and in making my way safely to switzerland the rest of my story is so short and so soon told that i may as well get it over at once the only relation i knew of in the world to apply to was a cousin of mine whom i had never seen before established as a silkmercer at berne i threw myself on this mans mercy he discovered that i was likely with my business habits to be of some use to him and he took me into his house i worked for what he pleased to give me traveled about for him in switzerland deserved his confidence and won it till within the last few months i remained with him and only left my employment to enter by my masters own desire the house of his brother established also as a silkmercer at chalonssurmarne in the countinghouse of this merchant i am corresponding clerk and am only able to come and see you now by offering to undertake a special business mission for my employer at paris it is drudgery at my time of life after all i have gone throughbut my hard work is innocent work i am not obliged to cringe for every crownpiece i put in my pocketnot bound to denounce deceive and dog to death other men before i can earn my bread and scrape together money enough to bury me i am ending a bad base life harmlessly at last it is a poor thing to do but it is something doneand even that contents a man at my age in short i am happier than i used to be or at least less ashamed when i look people like you in the face  hush hush interrupted rose laying her hand on his arm i cannot allow you to talk of yourself in that way even in jest  i was speaking in earnest answered lomaque quietly but i wont weary you with any more words about myself my story is told  all asked trudaine he looked searchingly almost suspiciously at lomaque as he put the question all he repeated yours is a short story indeed my good friend perhaps you have forgotten some of it  again lomaque fidgeted and hesitated  is it not a little hard on an old man to be always asking questions of him and never answering one of his inquiries in return he said to rose very gayly as to manner but rather uneasily as to look  he will not speak out till we two are alone thought trudaine it is best to risk nothing and to humor him  come come he said aloud no grumbling i admit that it is your turn to hear our story now and i will do my best to gratify you but before i begin he added turning to his sister let me suggest rose that if you have any household matters to settle upstairs  i know what you mean she interrupted hurriedly taking up the work which during the last few minutes she had allowed to drop into her lap but i am stronger than you think i can face the worst of our recollections composedly go on louis pray go oni am quite fit to stop and hear you  you know what we suffered in the first days of our suspense after the success of your stratagem said trudaine turning to lomaque i think it was on the evening after we had seen you for the last time at st lazare that strange confused rumors of an impending convulsion in paris first penetrated within our prison walls during the next few days the faces of our jailers were enough to show us that those rumors were true and that the reign of terror was actually threatened with overthrow at the hands of the moderate party we had hardly time to hope everything from this blessed change before the tremendous news of robespierres attempted suicide then of his condemnation and execution reached us the confusion produced in the prison was beyond all description the accused who had been tried and the accused who had not been tried got mingled together from the day of robespierres arrest no orders came to the authorities no deathlists reached the prison the jailers terrified by rumors that the lowest accomplices of the tyrant would be held responsible and be condemned with him made no attempt to maintain order some of themthat hunchback man among the restdeserted their duties altogether the disorganization was so complete that when the commissioners from the new government came to st lazare some of us were actually half starving from want of the bare necessities of life to inquire separately into our cases was found to be impossible sometimes the necessary papers were lost sometimes what documents remained were incomprehensible to the new commissioners they were obliged at last to make short work of it by calling us up before them in dozens tried or not tried we had all been arrested by the tyrant had all been accused of conspiracy against him and were all ready to hail the new government as the salvation of france in nine cases out of ten our best claim to be discharged was derived from these circumstances we were trusted by tallien and the men of the ninth thermidor because we had been suspected by robespierre couthon and st just arrested informally we were now liberated informally when it came to my sisters turn and mine we were not under examination five minutes no such thing as a searching question was asked of us i believe we might even have given our own names with perfect impunity but i had previously instructed rose that we were to assume our mothers maiden namemaurice as the citizen and citoyenne maurice accordingly we passed out of prisonunder the same name we have lived ever since in hiding here our past repose has depended our future happiness will depend on our escape from death being kept the profoundest secret among us three for one all sufficient reason which you can easily guess at the brother and sister maurice must still know nothing of louis trudaine and rose danville except that they were two among the hundreds of victims guillotined during the reign of terror  he spoke the last sentence with a faint smile and with the air of a man trying in spite of himself to treat a grave subject lightly his face clouded again however in a moment when he looked toward his sister as he ceased her work had once more dropped on her lap her face was turned away so that he could not see it but he knew by the trembling of her clasped hands as they rested on her knee and by the slight swelling of the veins on her neck which she could not hide from him that her boasted strength of nerve had deserted her three years of repose had not yet enabled her to hear her marriage name uttered or to be present when past times of deathly suffering and terror were referred to without betraying the shock in her face and manner trudaine looked saddened but in no way surprised by what he saw making a sign to lomaque to say nothing he rose and took up his sisters hood which lay on a windowseat near him  come rose he said the sun is shining the sweet spring air is inviting us out let us have a quiet stroll along the banks of the stream why should we keep our good friend here cooped up in this narrow little room when we have miles and miles of beautiful landscape to show him on the other side of the threshold come it is high treason to queen nature to remain indoors on such a morning as this  without waiting for her to reply he put on her hood drew her arm through his and led the way out lomaques face grew grave as he followed them  i am glad i only showed the bright side of my budget of news in her presence thought he she is not well at heart yet i might have hurt her poor thing i might have hurt her again sadly if i had not held my tongue  they walked for a little while down the banks of the stream talking of indifferent matters then returned to the cottage by that time rose had recovered her spirits and could listen with interest and amusement to lomaques drylyhumorous description of his life as a clerk at chalonssurmarne they parted for a little while at the cottage door rose retired to the upstairs room from which she had been summoned by her brother trudaine and lomaque returned to wander again along the banks of the stream  with one accord and without a word passing between them they left the neighborhood of the cottage hurriedly then stopped on a sudden and attentively looked each other in the facelooked in silence for an instant trudaine spoke first  i thank you for having spared her he began abruptly she is not strong enough yet to bear hearing of a new misfortune unless i break the tidings to her first  you suspect me then of bringing bad news said lomaque  i know you do when i saw your first look at her after we were all seated in the cottage parlor i knew it speak without fear without caution without one useless word of preface after three years of repose if it pleases god to afflict us again i can bear the trial calmly and if need be can strengthen her to bear it calmly too i say again lomaque speak at once and speak out i know your news is bad for i know beforehand that it is news of danville  you are right my bad news is news of him  he has discovered the secret of our escape from the guillotine  nohe has not a suspicion of it he believesas his mother as every one doesthat you were both executed the day after the revolutionary tribunal sentenced you to death  lomaque you speak positively of that belief of hisbut you cannot be certain of it  i can on the most indisputable the most startling evidenceon the authority of danvilles own act you have asked me to speak out  i ask you againi insist on it your news lomaqueyour news without another word of preface  you shall have it without another word of preface danville is on the point of being married  as the answer was given they both stopped by the bank of the stream and again looked each other in the face there was a minute of dead silence between them during that minute the water bubbling by happily over its bed of pebbles seemed strangely loud the singing of birds in a little wood by the streamside strangely near and shrill in both their ears the light breeze for all its midday warmth touched their cheeks coldly and the spring sunlight pouring on their faces felt as if it were glimmering on them through winter clouds  let us walk on said trudaine in a low voice i was prepared for bad news yet not for that are you certain of what you have just told me  as certain as that the stream here is flowing by our side hear how i made the discovery and you will doubt no longer before last week i knew nothing of danville except that his arrest on suspicion by robespierres order was as events turned out the saving of his life he was imprisoned as i told you on the evening after he had heard your names read from the deathlist at the prison grate he remained in confinement at the temple unnoticed in the political confusion outofdoors just as you remained unnoticed at st lazare and he profited precisely in the same manner that you profited by the timely insurrection which overthrew the reign of terror i knew this and i knew that he walked out of prison in the character of a persecuted victim of robespierresand for better than three years past i knew no more now listen last week i happened to be waiting in the shop of my employer citizen clairfait for some papers to take into the countinghouse when an old man enters with a sealed parcel which he hands to one of the shopmen saying  give that to citizen clairfait  any name says the shopman  the name is of no consequence answers the old man but if you please you can give mine say the parcel came from citizen dubois and then he goes out his name in connection with his elderly look strikes me directly  does that old fellow live at chalons i ask  no says the shopman he is here in attendance on a customer of oursan old exaristocrat named danville she is on a visit in our town  i leave you to imagine how that reply startles and amazes me the shopman can answer none of the other questions i put to him but the next day i am asked to dinner by my employer who for his brothers sake shows me the utmost civility on entering the room i find his daughter just putting away a lavendercolored silk scarf on which she has been embroidering in silver what looks to me very like a crest and coatofarms  i dont mind your seeing what i am about citizen lomaque says she for i know my father can trust you that scarf is sent back to us by the purchaser an exemigrant lady of the old aristocratic school to have her family coatofarms embroidered on it  rather a dangerous commission even in these mercifully democratic times is it not says i  the old lady you must know says she is as proud as lucifer and having got back safely to france in these days of moderate republicanism thinks she may now indulge with impunity in all her oldfashioned notions she has been an excellent customer of ours so my father thought it best to humor her without however trusting her commission to any of the workroom women to execute we are not living under the reign of terror now certainly still there is nothing like being on the safe side  nothing i answer pray what is this exemigrants name  danville replies the citoyenne clairfait she is going to appear in that fine scarf at her sons marriage  marriage i exclaim perfectly thunderstruck  yes says she what is there so amazing in that by all accounts the son poor man deserves to make a lucky marriage this time his first wife was taken away from him in the reign of terror by the guillotine  who is he going to marry i inquire still breathless  the daughter of general berthelinan exaristocrat by family like the old lady but by principle as good a republican as ever liveda harddrinking loudswearing bigwhiskered old soldier who snaps his fingers at his ancestors and says we are all descended from adam the first genuine sansculotte in the world  in this way the citoyenne clairfait gossips on all dinnertime but says nothing more of any importance i with my old policeoffice habits set to the next day and try to make some discoveries for myself the sum of what i find out is this danvilles mother is staying with general berthelins sister and daughter at chalons and danville himself is expected to arrive every day to escort them all three to paris where the marriagecontract is to be signed at the generals house discovering this and seeing that prompt action is now of the most vital importance i undertake as i told you my employers commission for paris depart with all speed and stop here on my way wait i have not done yet all the haste i can make is not haste enough to give me a good start of the wedding party on my road here the diligence by which i travel is passed by a carriage posting along at full speed i cannot see inside that carriage but i look at the boxseat and recognize on it the old man dubois he whirls by in a cloud of dust but i am certain of him and i say to myself what i now say again to you no time is to be lost  no time shall be lost answers trudaine firmly three years have passed he continued in a lower voice speaking to himself rather than to lomaque three years since the day when i led my sister out of the gates of the prisonthree years since i said in my heart i will be patient and will not seek to avenge myself our wrongs cry from earth to heaven from man who inflicts to god who redresses when the day of reckoning comes let it be the day of his vengeance not of mine in my heart i said those wordsi have been true to themi have waited the day has come and the duty it demands of me shall be fulfilled  there was a moments silence before lomaque spoke again your sister he began hesitatingly  it is there only that my purpose falters said the other earnestly if it were but possible to spare her all knowledge of this last trial and to leave the accomplishment of the terrible task to me alone  i think it is possible interposed lomaque listen to what i advise we must depart for paris by the diligence tomorrow morning and we must take your sister with ustomorrow will be time enough people dont sign marriagecontracts on the evening after a long days journey we must go then and we must take your sister leave the care of her in paris and the responsibility of keeping her in ignorance of what you are doing to me go to this general berthelins house at a time when you know danville is there we can get that knowledge through the servants confront him without a moments previous warning confront him as a man risen from the dead confront him before every soul in the room though the room should be full of peopleand leave the rest to the selfbetrayal of a panicstricken man say but three words and your duty will be done you may return to your sister and may depart with her in safety to your old retreat at rouen or where else you please on the very day when you have put it out of her infamous husbands power to add another to the list of his crimes  you forget the suddenness of the journey to paris said trudaine how are we to account for it without the risk of awakening my sisters suspicions  trust that to me answered lomaque let us return to the cottage at once no not you he added suddenly as they turned to retrace their steps there is that in your face which would betray us leave me to go back alonei will say that you have gone to give some orders at the inn let us separate immediately you will recover your selfpossessionyou will get to look yourself again soonerif you are left alone i know enough of you to know that we will not waste another minute in explanations even minutes are precious to us on such a day as this by the time you are fit to meet your sister again i shall have had time to say all i wish to her and shall be waiting at the cottage to tell you the result  he looked at trudaine and his eyes seemed to brighten again with something of the old energy and sudden decision of the days when he was a man in office under the reign of terror leave it to me he said and waving his hand turned away quickly in the direction of the cottage  nearly an hour passed before trudaine ventured to follow him when he at length entered the path which led to the garden gate he saw his sister waiting at the cottage door her face looked unusually animated and she ran forward a step or two to meet him  oh louis she said i have a confession to make and i must beg you to hear it patiently to the end you must know that our good lomaque though he came in tired from his walk occupied himself the first thing at my request in writing the letter which is to secure to us our dear old home by the banks of the seine when he had done he looked at me and said i should like to be present at your happy return to the house where i first saw you oh come come with us i said directly i am not an independent man he answered i have a margin of time allowed me at paris certainly but it is not longif i were only my own master and then he stopped louis i remembered all we owed to him i remembered that there was no sacrifice we ought not to be too glad to make for his sake i felt the kindness of the wish he had expressed and perhaps i was a little influenced by my own impatience to see once more my flowergarden and the rooms where we used to be so happy so i said to him i am sure louis will agree with me that our time is yours and that we shall be only too glad to advance our departure so as to make traveling leisure enough for you to come with us to rouen we should be worse than ungrateful he stopped me you have always been good to me he said i must not impose on your kindness now no no you have formalities to settle before you can leave this place not one i saidfor we have not as you know louis why here is your furniture to begin with he said a few chairs and tables hired from the inn i answered we have only to give the landlady our key to leave a letter for the owner of the cottage and then he laughed why to hear you talk one would think you were as ready to travel as i am so we are i said quite as ready living in the way we do here he shook his head but you will not shake yours louis i am sure now you have heard all my long story you cant blame me can you  before trudaine could answer lomaque looked out of the cottage window  i have just been telling my brother every thing said rose turning round toward him  and what does he say asked lomaque  he says what i say replied rose answering for her brother that our time is your timethe time of our best and dearest friend  shall it be done then asked lomaque with a meaning look at trudaine  rose glanced anxiously at her brother his face was much graver than she had expected to see it but his answer relieved her from all suspense  you are quite right love to speak as you did he said gently then turning to lomaque he added in a firmer voice it shall be done    chapter ii  two days after the travelingcarriage described by lomaque had passed the diligence on the road to paris madame danville sat in the drawingroom of an apartment in the rue de grenelle handsomely dressed for driving out after consulting a large gold watch that hung at her side and finding that it wanted a quarter of an hour only to two oclock she rang her handbell and said to the maidservant who answered the summons i have five minutes to spare send dubois here with my chocolate  the old man made his appearance with great alacrity after handing the cup of chocolate to his mistress he ventured to use the privilege of talking to which his long and faithful services entitled him and paid the old lady a compliment i am rejoiced to see madame looking so young and in such good spirits this morning he said with a low bow and a mild deferential smile  i think i have some reason for being in good spirits on the day when my sons marriagecontract is to be signed said madame danville with a gracious nod of the head ha dubois i shall live yet to see him with a patent of nobility in his hand the mob has done its worst the end of this infamous revolution is not far off our order will have its turn again soon and then who will have such a chance at court as my son he is noble already through his mother he will then be noble also through his wife yes yes let that coarsemannered passionate old soldierfather of hers be as unnaturally republican as he pleases he has inherited a name which will help my son to a peerage the vicomte danville d with an apostrophe dubois you understand the vicomte danvillehow prettily it sounds  charmingly madamecharmingly ah this second marriage of my young masters begins under much better auspices than the first  the remark was an unfortunate one madame danville frowned portentously and rose in a great hurry from her chair  are your wits failing you you old fool she exclaimed indignantly what do you mean by referring to such a subject as that on this day of all others you are always harping on those two wretched people who were guillotined as if you thought i could have saved their lives were you not present when my son and i met after the time of the terror did you not hear my first words to him when he told me of the catastrophe were they not charles i love you but if i thought you had let those two unfortunates who risked themselves to save me die without risking your life in return to save them i would break my heart rather than ever look at you or speak to you again did i not say that and did he not answer mother my life was risked for them i proved my devotion by exposing myself to arresti was imprisoned for my exertionsand then i could do no more did you not stand by and hear him give that answer overwhelmed while he spoke by generous emotion do you not know that he really was imprisoned in the temple do you dare to think that we are to blame after that i owe you much dubois but if you are to take liberties with me  oh madame i beg pardon a thousand times i was thoughtlessonly thoughtless  silence is my coach at the door very well get ready to accompany me your master will not have time to return here he will meet me for the signing of the contract at general berthelins house at two precisely stop are there many people in the street i cant be stared at by the mob as i go to my carriage  dubois hobbled penitently to the window and looked out while his mistress walked to the door  the street is almost empty madame he said only a man with a woman on his arm stopping and admiring your carriage they seem like decent people as well as i can tell without my spectacles not mob i should say madame certainly not mob  very well attend me downstairs and bring some loose silver with you in case those two decent people should be fit objects for charity no orders for the coachman except that he is to go straight to the generals house  the party assembled at general berthelins to witness the signature of the marriagecontract comprised besides the persons immediately interested in the ceremony of the day some young ladies friends of the bride and a few officers who had been comrades of her fathers in past years the guests were distributed rather unequally in two handsome apartments opening into each otherone called in the house the drawingroom and the other the library in the drawingroom were assembled the notary with the contract ready the bride the young ladies and the majority of general berthelins friends in the library the remainder of the military guests were amusing themselves at a billiardtable until the signing of the contract should take place while danville and his future fatherinlaw walked up and down the room together the first listening absently the last talking with all his accustomed energy and with more than his accustomed allowance of barrackroom expletives the general had taken it into his head to explain some of the clauses in the marriagecontract to the bridegroom who though far better acquainted with their full scope and meaning than his fatherinlaw was obliged to listen for civilitys sake while the old soldier was still in the midst of his long and confused harangue a clock struck on the library mantelpiece  two oclock exclaimed danville glad of any pretext for interrupting the talk about the contract two oclock and my mother not here yet what can be delaying her  nothing cried the general when did you ever know a woman punctual my lad if we wait for your motherand shes such a rabid aristocrat that she would never forgive us for not waitingwe shant sign the contract yet this halfhour never mind lets go on with what we were talking about where the devil was i when that cursed clock struck and interrupted us now then black eyes whats the matter  this last question was addressed to mademoiselle berthelin who at that moment hastily entered the library from the drawingroom she was a tall and rather masculinelooking girl with superb black eyes dark hair growing low on her forehead and something of her fathers decision and bluntness in her manner of speaking  a stranger in the other room papa who wants to see you i suppose the servants showed him upstairs thinking he was one of the guests ought i to have had him shown down again  a nice question how should i know wait till i have seen him miss and then ill tell you with these words the general turned on his heel and went into the drawingroom  his daughter would have followed him but danville caught her by the hand  can you be hardhearted enough to leave me here alone he asked  what is to become of all my bosom friends in the next room you selfish man if i stop here with you retorted mademoiselle struggling to free herself  call them in here said danville gayly making himself master of her other hand  she laughed and drew him away toward the drawingroom  come she cried and let all the ladies see what a tyrant i am going to marry come and show them what an obstinate unreasonable wearisome  her voice suddenly failed her she shuddered and turned faint danvilles hand had in one instant grown cold as death in hers the momentary touch of his fingers as she felt their grasp loosen struck some mysterious chill through her from head to foot she glanced round at him affrightedly and saw his eyes looking straight into the drawingroom they were fixed in a strange unwavering awful stare while from the rest of his face all expression all character all recognizable play and movement of feature had utterly gone it was a breathless lifeless maska white blank with a cry of terror she looked where he seemed to be looking and could see nothing but the stranger standing in the middle of the drawingroom before she could ask a questionbefore she could speak even a single wordher father came to her caught danville by the arm and pushed her roughly back into the library  go there and take the women with you he said in a quick fierce whisper into the library he continued turning to the ladies and raising his voice into the library all of you along with my daughter  the women terrified by his manner obeyed him in the greatest confusion as they hurried past him into the library he signed to the notary to follow and then closed the door of communication between the two rooms  stop where you are he cried addressing the old officers who had risen from their chairs stay i insist on it whatever happens jacques berthelin has done nothing to be ashamed of in the presence of his old friends and companions you have seen the beginning now stay and see the end  while he spoke he walked into the middle of the room he had never quitted his hold of danvilles arm step by step they advanced together to the place where trudaine was standing  you have come into my house and asked me for my daughter in marriageand i have given her to you said the general addressing danville quietly you told me that your first wife and her brother were guillotined three years ago in the time of the terrorand i believed you now look at that manlook him straight in the face he has announced himself to me as the brother of your wife and he asserts that his sister is alive at this moment one of you two has deceived me which is it  danville tried to speak but no sound passed his lips tried to wrench his arm from the grasp that was on it but could not stir the old soldiers steady hand  are you afraid are you a coward cant you look him in the face asked the general tightening his hold sternly  stop stop interposed one of the old officers coming forward give him time this may be a case of strange accidental resemblance which would be enough under the circumstances to discompose any man you will excuse me citizen he continued turning to trudaine but you are a stranger you have given us no proof of your identity  there is the proof said trudaine pointing to danvilles face  yes yes pursued the other he looks pale and startled enough certainly but i say again let us not be too hasty there are strange cases on record of accidental resemblances and this may be one of them  as he repeated those words danville looked at him with a faint cringing gratitude stealing slowly over the blank terror of his face he bowed his head murmured something and gesticulated confusedly with the hand that he was free to use  look cried the old officer look berthelin he denies the mans identity  do you hear that said the general appealing to trudaine have you proofs to confute him if you have produce them instantly  before the answer could be given the door leading into the drawingroom from the staircase was violently flung open and madame danvilleher hair in disorder her face in its colorless terror looking like the very counterpart of her sonsappeared on the threshold with the old man dubois and a group of amazed and startled servants behind her  for gods sake dont sign for gods sake come away she cried i have seen your wifein the spirit or in the flesh i know not whichbut i have seen her charles charles as true as heaven is above us i have seen your wife  you have seen her in the flesh living and breathing as you see her brother yonder said a firm quiet voice from among the servants on the landing outside  let that man enter whoever he is cried the general  lomaque passed madame danville on the threshold she trembled as he brushed by her then supporting herself by the wall followed him a few paces into the room she looked first at her sonafter that at trudaineafter that back again at her son something in her presence silenced every one there fell a sudden stillness over all the assemblya stillness so deep that the eager frightened whispering and sharp rustling of dresses among the women in the library became audible from the other side of the closed door  charles she said slowly advancing why do you look she stopped and fixed her eyes again on her son more earnestly than before then turned them suddenly on trudaine you are looking at my son sir she said and i see contempt in your face by what right do you insult a man whose grateful sense of his mothers obligations to you made him risk his life for the saving of yours and your sisters by what right have you kept the escape of my sons wife from death by the guillotinean escape which for all i know to the contrary his generous exertions were instrumental in effectinga secret from my son by what right i demand to know has your treacherous secrecy placed us in such a position as we now stand in before the master of this house  an expression of sorrow and pity passed over trudaines face while she spoke he retired a few steps and gave her no answer the general looked at him with eager curiosity and dropping his hold of danvilles arm seemed about to speak but lomaque stepped forward at the same time and held up his hand to claim attention  i think i shall express the wishes of citizen trudaine he said addressing madame danville if i recommend this lady not to press for too public an answer to her questions  pray who are you sir who take it on yourself to advise me she retorted haughtily i have nothing to say to you except that i repeat those questions and that i insist on their being answered  who is this man asked the general addressing trudaine and pointing to lomaque  a man unworthy of credit cried danville speaking audibly for the first time and darting a look of deadly hatred at lomaque an agent of police under robespierre  and in that capacity capable of answering questions which refer to the transactions of robespierres tribunals remarked the exchief agent with his old official selfpossession  true exclaimed the general the man is rightlet him be heard  there is no help for it said lomaque looking at trudaine leave it to meit is fittest that i should speak i was present he continued in a louder voice at the trial of citizen trudaine and his sister they were brought to the bar through the denunciation of citizen danville till the confession of the male prisoner exposed the fact i can answer for danvilles not being aware of the real nature of the offenses charged against trudaine and his sister when it became known that they had been secretly helping this lady to escape from france and when danvilles own head was consequently in danger i myself heard him save it by a false assertion that he had been aware of trudaines conspiracy from the first  do you mean to say interrupted the general that he proclaimed himself in open court as having knowingly denounced the man who was on trial for saving his mother  i do answered lomaque a murmur of horror and indignation rose from all the strangers present at that reply the reports of the tribunal are existing to prove the truth of what i say he went on as to the escape of citizen trudaine and the wife of danville from the guillotine it was the work of political circumstances which there are persons living to speak to if necessary and of a little stratagem of mine which need not be referred to now and last with reference to the concealment which followed the escape i beg to inform you that it was abandoned the moment we knew of what was going on here and that it was only persevered in up to this time as a natural measure of precaution on the part of citizen trudaine from a similar motive we now abstain from exposing his sister to the shock and the peril of being present here what man with an atom of feeling would risk letting her even look again on such a husband as that  he glanced round him and pointed to danville as he put the question before a word could be spoken by any one else in the room a low wailing cry of my mistress my dear dear mistress directed all eyes first on the old man dubois then on madame danville  she had been leaning against the wall before lomaque began to speak but she stood perfectly upright now she neither spoke nor moved not one of the light gaudy ribbons flaunting on her disordered headdress so much as trembled the old servant dubois was crouched on his knees at her side kissing her cold right hand chafing it in his reiterating his faint mournful cry oh my mistress my dear dear mistress but she did not appear to know that he was near her it was only when her son advanced a step or two toward her that she seemed to awaken suddenly from that deathtrance of mental pain then she slowly raised the hand that was free and waved him back from her he stopped in obedience to the gesture and endeavored to speak she waved her hand again and the deathly stillness of her face began to grow troubled her lips moved a littleshe spoke  oblige me sir for the last time by keeping silence you and i have henceforth nothing to say to each other i am the daughter of a race of nobles and the widow of a man of honor you are a traitor and a false witnessa thing from which all true men and true women turn with contempt i renounce you publicly in the presence of these gentlemen i say iti have no son  she turned her back on him and bowing to the other persons in the room with the old formal courtesy of bygone times walked slowly and steadily to the door stopping there she looked back and then the artificial courage of the moment failed her with a faint suppressed cry she clutched at the hand of the old servant who still kept faithfully at her side he caught her in his arms and her head sank on his shoulder  help him cried the general to the servants near the door help him to take her into the next room  the old man looked up suspiciously from his mistress to the persons who were assisting him to support her with a strange sudden jealousy he shook his hand at them home he cried she shall go home and i will take care of her away you therenobody holds her head but dubois downstairs downstairs to her carriage she has nobody but me now and i say that she shall be taken home  as the door closed general berthelin approached trudaine who had stood silent and apart from the time when lomaque first appeared in the drawingroom  i wish to ask your pardon said the old soldier because i have wronged you by a moment of unjust suspicion for my daughters sake i bitterly regret that we did not see each other long ago but i thank you nevertheless for coming here even at the eleventh hour  while he was speaking one of his friends came up and touching him on the shoulder said berthelin is that scoundrel to be allowed to go  the general turned on his heel directly and beckoned contemptuously to danville to follow him to the door when they were well out of earshot he spoke these words  you have been exposed as a villain by your brotherinlaw and renounced as a liar by your mother they have done their duty by you and now it only remains for me to do mine when a man enters the house of another under false pretenses and compromises the reputation of his daughter we old army men have a very expeditious way of making him answer for it it is just three oclock now at five you will find me and one of my friends  he stopped and looked round cautiouslythen whispered the rest in danvilles earthrew open the door and pointed downstairs  our work here is done said lomaque laying his hand on trudaines arm let us give danville time to get clear of the house and then leave it too  my sister where is she asked trudaine eagerly  make your mind easy about her i will tell you more when we get out  you will excuse me i know said general berthelin speaking to all the persons present with his hand on the library door if i leave you i have bad news to break to my daughter and private business after that to settle with a friend  he saluted the company with his usual bluff nod of the head and entered the library a few minutes afterward trudaine and lomaque left the house  you will find your sister waiting for you in our apartment at the hotel said the latter she knows nothing absolutely nothing of what has passed  but the recognition asked trudaine amazedly his mother saw her surely she  i managed it so that she should be seen and should not see our former experience of danville suggested to me the propriety of making the experiment and my old policeoffice practice came in useful in carrying it out i saw the carriage standing at the door and waited till the old lady came down i walked your sister away as she got in and walked her back again past the window as the carriage drove off a moment did it and it turned out as useful as i thought it would enough of that go back now to your sister keep indoors till the night mail starts for rouen i have had two places taken for you on speculation go resume possession of your house and leave me here to transact the business which my employer has intrusted to me and to see how matters end with danville and his mother i will make time somehow to come and bid you goodby at rouen though it should be only for a single day bah no thanks give us your hand i was ashamed to take it eight years agoi can give it a hearty shake now there is your way here is mine leave me to my business in silks and satins and go you back to your sister and help her to pack up for the night mail    chapter iii  three more days have passed it is evening rose trudaine and lomaque are seated together on the bench that overlooks the windings of the seine the old familiar scene spreads before them beautiful as everunchanged as if it was but yesterday since they had all looked on it for the last time  they talk together seriously and in low voices the same recollections fill their heartsrecollections which they refrain from acknowledging but the influence of which each knows by instinct that the other partakes sometimes one leads the conversation sometimes another but whoever speaks the topic chosen is always as if by common consent a topic connected with the future  the evening darkens in and rose is the first to rise from the bench a secret look of intelligence passes between her and her brother and then she speaks to lomaque  will you follow me into the house she asks with as little delay as possible i have something that i very much wish to show you  her brother waits till she is out of hearing then inquires anxiously what has happened at paris since the night when he and rose left it  your sister is free lomaque answers  the duel took place then  the same day they were both to fire together the second of his adversary asserts that he was paralyzed with terror his own second declares that he was resolved however he might have lived to confront death courageously by offering his life at the first fire to the man whom he had injured which account is true i know not it is only certain that he did not discharge his pistol that he fell by his antagonists first bullet and that he never spoke afterward  and his mother  it is hard to gain information her doors are closed the old servant guards her with jealous care a medical man is in constant attendance and there are reports in the house that the illness from which she is suffering affects her mind more than her body i could ascertain no more  after that answer they both remain silent for a little while then rise from the bench and walk toward the house  have you thought yet about preparing your sister to hear of all that has happened lomaque asks as he sees the lamplight glimmering in the parlor window  i shall wait to prepare her till we are settled again heretill the first holiday pleasure of our return has worn off and the quiet realities of our everyday life of old have resumed their way answers trudaine  they enter the house rose beckons to lomaque to sit down near her and places pen and ink and an open letter before him  i have a last favor to ask of you she says smiling  i hope it will not take long to grant he rejoins for i have only tonight to be with you tomorrow morning before you are up i must be on my way back to chalons  will you sign that letter she continues still smiling and then give it to me to send to the post it was dictated by louis and written by me and it will be quite complete if you will put your name at the end of it  i suppose i may read it  she nods and lomaque reads these lines   citizeni beg respectfully to apprise you that the commission you intrusted to me at paris has been performed  i have also to beg that you will accept my resignation of the place i hold in your countinghouse the kindness shown me by you and your brother before you emboldens me to hope that you will learn with pleasure the motive of my withdrawal two friends of mine who consider that they are under some obligations to me are anxious that i should pass the rest of my days in the quiet and protection of their home troubles of former years have knit us together as closely as if we were all three members of one family i need the repose of a happy fireside as much as any man after the life i have led and my friends assure me so earnestly that their whole hearts are set on establishing the old mans easychair by their hearth that i cannot summon resolution enough to turn my back on them and their offer  accept then i beg of you the resignation which this letter contains and with it the assurance of my sincere gratitude and respect  to citizen clairfait silkmercer  chalonssurmarne   after reading these lines lomaque turned round to trudaine and attempted to speak but the words would not come at command he looked up at rose and tried to smile but his lip only trembled she dipped the pen in the ink and placed it in his hand he bent his head down quickly over the paper so that she could not see his face but still he did not write his name she put her hand caressingly on his shoulder and whispered to him  come come humor sister rose she must have her own way now she is back again at home  he did not answerhis head sank lowerhe hesitated for an instantthen signed his name in faint trembling characters at the end of the letter  she drew it away from him gently a few teardrops lay on the paper as she dried them with her handkerchief she looked at her brother  they are the last he shall ever shed louis you and i will take care of that     epilogue to the third story  i have now related all that is eventful in the history of sister rose to the last the three friends dwelt together happily in the cottage on the river bank mademoiselle clairfait was fortunate enough to know them before death entered the little household and took away in the fullness of time the eldest of its members she describes lomaque in her quaint foreign english as a brave big heart generous affectionate and admirably free from the small obstinacies and prejudices of old age except on one point he could never be induced to take his coffee of an evening from any other hand than the hand of sister rose  i linger over these final particulars with a strange unwillingness to separate myself from them and give my mind to other thoughts perhaps the persons and events that have occupied my attention for so many nights past have some peculiar interest for me that i cannot analyze perhaps the labor and time which this story has cost me have especially endeared it to my sympathies now that i have succeeded in completing it however that may be i have need of some resolution to part at last with sister rose and return in the interests of my next and fourth story to english ground  i have experienced so much difficulty let me add in deciding on the choice of a new narrative out of my collection that my wife has lost all patience and has undertaken on her own responsibility to relieve me of my unreasonable perplexities by her advicegiven as usual without a moments hesitationi cannot do better than tell the story of  the lady of glenwith grange     prologue to the fourth story  my practice in the art of portraitpainting if it has done nothing else has at least fitted me to turn my talents such as they are to a great variety of uses i have not only taken the likenesses of men women and children but have also extended the range of my brush under stress of circumstances to horses dogs houses and in one case even to a bullthe terror and glory of his parish and the most truculent sitter i ever had the beast was appropriately named thunder and lightning and was the property of a gentlemanfarmer named garthwaite a distant connection of my wifes family  how it was that i escaped being gored to death before i had finished my picture is more than i can explain to this day thunder and lightning resented the very sight of me and my colorbox as if he viewed the taking of his likeness in the light of a personal insult it required two men to coax him while a third held him by a ring in his nostrils before i could venture on beginning to work even then he always lashed his tail and jerked his huge head and rolled his fiery eyes with a devouring anxiety to have me on his horns for daring to sit down quietly and look at him never i can honestly say did i feel more heartily grateful for the blessings of soundness of limb and wholeness of skin than when i had completed the picture of the bull  one morning when i had but little more than half done my unwelcome task my friend and i were met on our way to the bulls stable by the farm bailiff who informed us gravely that thunder and lightning was just then in such an especially surly state of temper as to render it quite unsafe for me to think of painting him i looked inquiringly at mr garthwaite who smiled with an air of comic resignation and said very well then we have nothing for it but to wait till tomorrow what do you say to a mornings fishing mr kerby now that my bulls bad temper has given us a holiday  i replied with perfect truth that i knew nothing about fishing but mr garthwaite who was as ardent an angler in his way as izaak walton himself was not to be appeased even by the best of excuses it is never too late to learn cried he i will make a fisherman of you in no time if you will only attend to my directions it was impossible for me to make any more apologies without the risk of appealing discourteous so i thanked my host for his friendly intentions and with some secret misgivings accepted the first fishingrod that he put into my hands  we shall soon get there said mr garthwaite i am taking you to the best millstream in the neighborhood it was all one to me whether we got there soon or late and whether the stream was good or bad however i did my best to conceal my unsportsmanlike apathy and tried to look quite happy and very impatient to begin as we drew near to the mill and heard louder and louder the gushing of many waters all round it  leading the way immediately to a place beneath the falling stream where there was a deep eddying pool mr garthwaite baited and threw in his line before i had fixed the joints of my fishingrod this first difficulty overcome i involuntarily plunged into some excellent but rather embarrassing sport with my line and hook i caught every one of my garments from head to foot i angled for my own clothes with the dexterity and success of izaak walton himself i caught my hat my jacket my waistcoat my trousers my fingers and my thumbssome devil possessed my hook some more than eellike vitality twirled and twisted in every inch of my line by the time my host arrived to assist me i had attached myself to my fishingrod apparently for life all difficulties yielded however to his patience and skill my hook was baited for me and thrown in my rod was put into my hand my friend went back to his place and we began at last to angle in earnest  we certainly caught a few fish in my case i mean of course that the fish caught themselves but they were scanty in number and light in weight whether it was the presence of the millers foremana gloomy personage who stood staring disastrously upon us from a little flowergarden on the opposite bankthat cast adverse influence over our sport or whether my want of faith and earnestness as an angler acted retributively on my companion as well as myself i know not but it is certain that he got almost as little reward for his skill as i got for my patience after nearly two hours of intense expectation on my part and intense angling on his mr garthwaite jerked his line out of the water in a rage and bade me follow him to another place declaring that the stream must have been netted by poachers in the night who had taken all the large fish away with them and had thrown in the small ones to grow until their next visit we moved away further down the bank leaving the imperturbable foreman still in the flowergarden staring at us speechlessly on our departure exactly as he had already stared at us on our approach  stop a minute said mr garthwaite suddenly after we had walked some distance in silence by the side of the stream i have an idea now we are out for a days angling we wont be balked instead of trying the water here again we will go where i know by experience that the fishing is excellent and what is more you shall be introduced to a lady whose appearance is sure to interest you and whose history i can tell you beforehand is a very remarkable one  indeed i said may i ask in what way  she is connected answered mr garthwaite with an extraordinary story which relates to a family once settled in an old house in this neighborhood her name is miss welwyn but she is less formally known an among the poor people about here who love her dearly and honor her almost superstitiously as the lady of glenwith grange wait till you have seen her before you ask me to say anything more she lives in the strictest retirement i am almost the only visitor who is admitted dont say you had rather not go in any friend of mine will be welcome at the grange the scene of the story remember for my sakethe more especially because i have never abused my privilege of introduction the place is not above two miles from here and the stream which we call in our county dialect glenwith beck runs through the ground  as we walked on mr garthwaites manner altered he became unusually silent and thoughtful the mention of miss welwyns name had evidently called up some recollections which were not in harmony with his everyday mood feeling that to talk to him on any indifferent subject would be only to interrupt his thoughts to no purpose i walked by his side in perfect silence looking out already with some curiosity and impatience for a first view of glenwith grange we stopped at last close by an old church standing on the outskirts of a pretty village the low wall of the churchyard was bounded on one side by a plantation and was joined by a park paling in which i noticed a small wicketgate mr garthwaite opened it and led me along a shrubbery path which conducted us circuitously to the dwellinghouse  we had evidently entered by a private way for we approached the building by the back i looked up at it curiously and saw standing at one of the windows on the lower floor a little girl watching us as we advanced she seemed to be about nine or ten years old i could not help stopping a moment to look up at her her clear complexion and her long dark hair were so beautiful and yet there was something in her expressiona dimness and vacancy in her large eyesa changeless unmeaning smile on her parted lipswhich seemed to jar with all that was naturally attractive in her face which perplexed disappointed and even shocked me though i hardy knew why mr garthwaite who had been walking along thoughtfully with his eyes on the ground turned back when he found me lingering behind him looked up where i was looking started a little i thought then took my arm whispered rather impatiently dont say anything about having seen that poor child when you are introduced to miss welwyn ill tell you why afterward and led me round hastily to the front of the building  it was a very dreary old house with a lawn in front thickly sprinkled with flowerbeds and creepers of all sorts climbing in profusion about the heavy stone porch and the mullions of the lower windows in spite of these prettiest of all ornaments clustering brightly round the buildingin spite of the perfect repair in which it was kept from top to bottomthere was something repellent to me in the aspect of the whole place a deathly stillness hung over it which fell oppressively on my spirits when my companion rang the loud deeptoned bell the sound startled me as if we had been committing a crime in disturbing the silence and when the door was opened by an old female servant while the hollow echo of the bell was still vibrating in the air i could hardly imagine it possible that we should be let in we were admitted however without the slightest demur i remarked that there was the same atmosphere of dreary repose inside the house which i had already observed or rather felt outside it no dogs barked at our approachno doors banged in the servants officesno heads peeped over the banistersnot one of the ordinary domestic consequences of an unexpected visit in the country met either eye or ear the large shadowy apartment half library half breakfastroom into which we were ushered was as solitary as the hall of entrance unless i except such drowsy evidences of life as were here presented to us in the shape of an angola cat and a gray parrotthe first lying asleep in a chair the second sitting ancient solemn and voiceless in a large cage  mr garthwaite walked to the window when we entered without saying a word determining to let his taciturn humor have its way i asked him no questions but looked around the room to see what information it would give me and rooms often do give such information about the character and habits of the owner of the house  two tables covered with books were the first objects that attracted me on approaching them i was surprised to find that the allinfluencing periodical literature of the present daywhose sphere is already almost without limit whose readers even in our time may be numbered by millionswas entirely unrepresented on miss welwyns table nothing modern nothing contemporary in the world of books presented itself of all the volumes beneath my hand not one bore the badge of the circulating library or wore the flaring modern livery of gilt cloth every work that i took up had been written at least fifteen or twenty years since the prints hanging round the walls toward which i next looked were all engraved from devotional subjects by the old masters the musicstand contained no music of later date than the compositions of haydn and mozart whatever i examined besides told me with the same consistency the same strange tale the owner of these possessions lived in the bygone time lived among old recollections and old associationsa voluntary recluse from all that was connected with the passing day in miss welwyns house the stir the tumult the idle business of the world evidently appealed in vain to sympathies which grew no longer with the growing hour  as these thoughts were passing through my mind the door opened and the lady herself appeared  she looked certainly past the prime of life longer past it as i afterward discovered than she really was but i never remember in any other face to have seen so much of the better part of the beauty of early womanhood still remaining as i saw in hers sorrow had evidently passed over the fair calm countenance before me but had left resignation there as its only trace her expression was still youthfulyouthful in its kindness and its candor especially it was only when i looked at her hair that was now growing grayat her wan thin handsat the faint lines marked round her mouthat the sad serenity of her eyes that i fairly detected the mark of age and more than that the token of some great grief which had been conquered but not banished even from her voice alonefrom the peculiar uncertainty of its low calm tones when she spokeit was easy to conjecture that she must have passed through sufferings at some time of her life which had tried to the quick the noble nature that they could not subdue  mr garthwaite and she met each other almost like brother and sister it was plain that the friendly intimacy between them had been of very long duration our visit was a short one the conversation never advanced beyond the commonplace topics suited to the occasion it was therefore from what i saw and not from what i heard that i was enabled to form my judgment of miss welwyn deeply as she had interested mefar more deeply than i at all know how to explain in fitting wordsi cannot say that i was unwilling to depart when we rose to take leave though nothing could be more courteous and more kind than her manner toward me during the whole interview i could still perceive that it cost her some effort to repress in my presence the shades of sadness and reserve which seemed often ready to steal over her and i must confess that when i once or twice heard the halfsigh stifled and saw the momentary relapse into thoughtfulness suddenly restrained i felt an indefinable awkwardness in my position which made me ill at ease which set me doubting whether as a perfect stranger i had done right in suffering myself to be introduced where no new faces could awaken either interest or curiosity where no new sympathies could ever be felt no new friendships ever be formed  as soon as we had taken leave of miss welwyn and were on our way to the stream in her grounds i more than satisfied mr garthwaite that the impression the lady had produced on me was of no transitory kind by overwhelming him with questions about hernot omitting one or two incidental inquiries on the subject of the little girl whom i had seen at the back window he only rejoined that his story would answer all my questions and that he would begin to tell it as soon as we had arrived at glenwith beck and were comfortably settled to fishing  five minutes more of walking brought us to the bank of the stream and showed us the water running smoothly and slowly tinged with the softest green luster from the reflections of trees which almost entirely arched it over leaving me to admire the view at my ease mr garthwaite occupied himself with the necessary preparations for angling baiting my hook as well as his own then desiring me to sit near him on the bank he at last satisfied my curiosity by beginning his story i shall relate it in his own manner and as nearly as possible in his own words     the anglers story of the lady of glenwith grange  i have known miss welwyn long enough to be able to bear personal testimony to the truth of many of the particulars which i am now about to relate i knew her father and her younger sister rosamond and i was acquainted with the frenchman who became rosamonds husband these are the persons of whom it will be principally necessary for me to speak they are the only prominent characters in my story  miss welwyns father died some years since i remember him very wellthough he never excited in me or in any one else that i ever heard of the slightest feeling of interest when i have said that he inherited a very large fortune amassed during his fathers time by speculations of a very daring very fortunate but not always very honorable kind and that he bought this old house with the notion of raising his social position by making himself a member of our landed aristocracy in these parts i have told you as much about him i suspect as you would care to hear he was a thoroughly commonplace man with no great virtues and no great vices in him he had a little heart a feeble mind an amiable temper a tall figure and a handsome face more than this need not and cannot be said on the subject of mr welwyns character  i must have seen the late mrs welwyn very often as a child but i cannot say that i remember anything more of her than that she was tall and handsome and very generous and sweettempered toward me when i was in her company she was her husbands superior in birth as in everything else was a great reader of books in all languages and possessed such admirable talents as a musician that her wonderful playing on the organ is remembered and talked of to this day among the old people in our country houses about here all her friends as i have heard were disappointed when she married mr welwyn rich as he was and were afterward astonished to find her preserving the appearance at least of being perfectly happy with a husband who neither in mind nor heart was worthy of her  it was generally supposed and i have no doubt correctly that she found her great happiness and her great consolation in her little girl idanow the lady from whom we have just parted the child took after her mother from the firstinheriting her mothers fondness for books her mothers love of music her mothers quick sensibilities and more than all her mothers quiet firmness patience and loving kindness of disposition from idas earliest years mrs welwyn undertook the whole superintendence of her education the two were hardly ever apart within doors or without neighbors and friends said that the little girl was being brought up too fancifully and was not enough among other children was sadly neglected as to all reasonable and practical teaching and was perilously encouraged in those dreamy and imaginative tendencies of which she had naturally more than her due share there was perhaps some truth in this and there might have been still more if ida had possessed an ordinary character or had been reserved for an ordinary destiny but she was a strange child from the first and a strange future was in store for her  little ida reached her eleventh year without either brother or sister to be her playfellow and companion at home immediately after that period however her sister rosamond was born though mr welwyns own desire was to have had a son there were nevertheless great rejoicings yonder in the old house on the birth of this second daughter but they were all turned only a few months afterward to the bitterest grief and despair the grange lost its mistress while rosamond was still an infant in arms her mother died  mrs welwyn had been afflicted with some disorder after the birth of her second child the name of which i am not learned enough in medical science to be able to remember i only know that she recovered from it to all appearance in an unexpectedly short time that she suffered a fatal relapse and that she died a lingering and a painful death mr welwyn who in after years had a habit of vaingloriously describing his marriage as a lovematch on both sides was really fond of his wife in his own frivolous feeble way and suffered as acutely as such a man could suffer during the latter days of her illness and at the terrible time when the doctors one and all confessed that her life was a thing to be despaired of he burst into irrepressible passions of tears and was always obliged to leave the sickroom whenever mrs welwyn spoke of her approaching end the last solemn words of the dying woman the tenderest messages that she could give the dearest parting wishes that she could express the most earnest commands that she could leave behind her the gentlest reasons for consolation that she could suggest to the survivors among those who loved her were not poured into her husbands ear but into her childs from the first period of her illness ida had persisted in remaining in the sickroom rarely speaking never showing outwardly any signs of terror or grief except when she was removed from it and then bursting into hysterical passions of weeping which no expostulations no arguments no commandsnothing in short but bringing her back to the bedsideever availed to calm her mother had been her playfellow her companion her dearest and most familiar friend and there seemed something in the remembrance of this which instead of overwhelming the child with despair strengthened her to watch faithfully and bravely by her dying parent to the very last  when the parting moment was over and when mr welwyn unable to bear the shock of being present in the house of death at the time of his wifes funeral left home and went to stay with one of his relations in a distant part of england ida whom it had been his wish to take away with him petitioned earnestly to be left behind i promised mamma before she died that i would be as good to my little sister rosamond as she had been to me said the child simply and she told me in return that i might wait here and see her laid in her grave there happened to be an aunt of mrs welwyn and an old servant of the family in the house at this time who understood ida much better than her father did and they persuaded him not to take her away i have heard my mother say that the effect of the childs appearance at the funeral on her and on all who went to see it was something that she could never think of without the tears coming into her eyes and could never forget to the last day of her life  it must have been very shortly after this period that i saw ida for the first time  i remember accompanying my mother on a visit to the old house we have just left in the summer when i was at home for the holidays it was a lovely sunshiny morning there was nobody indoors and we walked out into the garden as we approached that lawn yonder on the other side of the shrubbery i saw first a young woman in mourning apparently a servant sitting reading then a little girl dressed all in black moving toward us slowly over the bright turf and holding up before her a baby whom she was trying to teach to walk she looked to my ideas so very young to be engaged in such an occupation as this and her gloomy black frock appeared to be such an unnaturally grave garment for a mere child of her age and looked so doubly dismal by contrast with the brilliant sunny lawn on which she stood that i quite started when i first saw her and eagerly asked my mother who she was the answer informed me of the sad family story which i have been just relating to you mrs welwyn had then been buried about three months and ida in her childish way was trying as she had promised to supply her mothers place to her infant sister rosamond  i only mention this simple incident because it is necessary before i proceed to the eventful part of my narrative that you should know exactly in what relation the sisters stood toward one another from the first of all the last parting words that mrs welwyn had spoken to her child none had been oftener repeated none more solemnly urged than those which had commended the little rosamond to idas love and care to other persons the full the alltrusting dependence which the dying mother was known to have placed in a child hardly eleven years old seemed merely a proof of that helpless desire to cling even to the feeblest consolations which the approach of death so often brings with it but the event showed that the trust so strangely placed had not been ventured vainly when it was committed to young and tender hands the whole future existence of the child was one noble proof that she had been worthy of her mothers dying confidence when it was first reposed in her in that simple incident which i have just mentioned the new life of the two motherless sisters was all foreshadowed  time passed i left schoolwent to collegetraveled in germany and stayed there some time to learn the language at every interval when i came home and asked about the welwyns the answer was in substance almost always the same mr welwyn was giving his regular dinners performing his regular duties as a county magistrate enjoying his regular recreations as an a amateur farmer and an eager sportsman his two daughters were never separate ida was the same strange quiet retiring girl that she had always been and was still as the phrase went spoiling rosamond in every way in which it was possible for an elder sister to spoil a younger by too much kindness  i myself went to the grange occasionally when i was in this neighborhood in holiday and vacation time and was able to test the correctness of the picture of life there which had been drawn for me i remember the two sisters when rosamond was four or five years old and when ida seemed to me even then to be more like the childs mother than her sister she bore with her little caprices as sisters do not bear with one another she was so patient at lessontime so anxious to conceal any weariness that might overcome her in play hours so proud when rosamonds beauty was noticed so grateful for rosamonds kisses when the child thought of bestowing them so quick to notice all that rosamond did and to attend to all that rosamond said even when visitors were in the room that she seemed to my boyish observation altogether different from other elder sisters in other family circles into which i was then received  i remember then again when rosamond was just growing to womanhood and was in high spirits at the prospect of spending a season in london and being presented at court she was very beautiful at that timemuch handsomer than ida her accomplishments were talked of far and near in our country circles few if any of the people however who applauded her playing and singing who admired her watercolor drawings who were delighted at her fluency when she spoke french and amazed at her ready comprehension when she read german knew how little of all this elegant mental cultivation and nimble manual dexterity she owed to her governess and masters and how much to her elder sister it was ida who really found out the means of stimulating her when she was idle ida who helped her through all her worst difficulties ida who gently conquered her defects of memory over her books her inaccuracies of ear at the piano her errors of taste when she took the brush and pencil in hand it was ida alone who worked these marvels and whose allsufficient reward for her hardest exertions was a chance word of kindness from her sisters lips rosamond was not unaffectionate and not ungrateful but she inherited much of her fathers commonness and frivolity of character she became so accustomed to owe everything to her sisterto resign all her most trifling difficulties to idas everready careto have all her tastes consulted by idas everwatchful kindnessthat she never appreciated as it deserved the deep devoted love of which she was the object when ida refused two good offers of marriage rosamond was as much astonished as the veriest strangers who wondered why the elder miss welwyn seemed bent on remaining single all her life  when the journey to london to which i have already alluded took place ida accompanied her father and sister if she had consulted her own tastes she would have remained in the country but rosamond declared that she should feel quite lost and helpless twenty times a day in town without her sister it was in the nature of ida to sacrifice herself to any one whom she loved on the smallest occasions as well as the greatest her affection was as intuitively ready to sanctify rosamonds slightest caprices as to excuse rosamonds most thoughtless faults so she went to london cheerfully to witness with pride all the little triumphs won by her sisters beauty to hear and never tire of hearing all that admiring friends could say in her sisters praise  at the end of the season mr welwyn and his daughters returned for a short time to the country then left home again to spend the latter part of the autumn and the beginning of the winter in paris  they took with them excellent letters of introduction and saw a great deal of the best society in paris foreign as well as english at one of the first of the evening parties which they attended the general topic of conversation was the conduct of a certain french nobleman the baron franval who had returned to his native country after a long absence and who was spoken of in terms of high eulogy by the majority of the guests present the history of who franval was and of what he had done was readily communicated to mr welwyn and his daughters and was briefly this  the baron inherited little from his ancestors besides his high rank and his ancient pedigree on the death of his parents he and his two unmarried sisters their only surviving children found the small territorial property of the franvals in normandy barely productive enough to afford a comfortable subsistence for the three the baron then a young man of threeandtwenty endeavored to obtain such military or civil employment as might become his rank but although the bourbons were at that time restored to the throne of france his efforts were ineffectual either his interest at court was bad or secret enemies were at work to oppose his advancement he failed to obtain even the slightest favor and irritated by undeserved neglect resolved to leave france and seek occupation for his energies in foreign countries where his rank would be no bar to his bettering his fortunes if he pleased by engaging in commercial pursuits  an opportunity of the kind that he wanted unexpectedly offered itself he left his sisters in care of an old male relative of the family at the chateau in normandy and sailed in the first instance to the west indies afterward extending his wanderings to the continent of south america and there engaging in mining transactions on a very large scale after fifteen years of absence during the latter part of which time false reports of his death had reached normandy he had just returned to france having realized a handsome independence with which he proposed to widen the limits of his ancestral property and to give his sisters who were still like himself unmarried all the luxuries and advantages that affluence could bestow the barons independent spirit and generous devotion to the honor of his family and the happiness of his surviving relatives were themes of general admiration in most of the social circles of paris he was expected to arrive in the capital every day and it was naturally enough predicted that his reception in society there could not fail to be of the most flattering and most brilliant kind  the welwyns listened to this story with some little interest rosamond who was very romantic being especially attracted by it and openly avowing to her father and sister when they got back to their hotel that she felt as ardent a curiosity as anybody to see the adventurous and generous baron the desire was soon gratified franval came to paris as had been anticipatedwas introduced to the welwynsmet them constantly in societymade no favorable impression on ida but won the good opinion of rosamond from the first and was regarded with such high approval by their father that when he mentioned his intentions of visiting england in the spring of the new year he was cordially invited to spend the hunting season at glenwith grange  i came back from germany about the same time that the welwyns returned from paris and at once set myself to improve my neighborly intimacy with the family i was very fond of ida more fond perhaps than my vanity will now allow me to but that is of no consequence it is much more to the purpose to tell you that i heard the whole of the barons story enthusiastically related by mr welwyn and rosamond that he came to the grange at the appointed time that i was introduced to him and that he produced as unfavorable an impression upon me as he had already produced upon ida  it was whimsical enough but i really could not tell why i disliked him though i could account very easily according to my own notions for his winning the favor and approval of rosamond and her father he was certainly a handsome man as far as features went he had a winning gentleness and graceful respect in his manner when he spoke to women and he sang remarkably well with one of the sweetest tenor voices i ever heard these qualities alone were quite sufficient to attract any girl of rosamonds disposition and i certainly never wondered why he was a favorite of hers  then as to her father the baron was not only fitted to win his sympathy and regard in the field by proving himself an ardent sportsman and an excellent rider but was also in virtue of some of his minor personal peculiarities just the man to gain the friendship of his host mr welwyn was as ridiculously prejudiced as most weakheaded englishmen are on the subject of foreigners in general in spite of his visit to paris the vulgar notion of a frenchman continued to be his notion both while he was in france and when he returned from it now the baron was as unlike the traditional mounseer of english songs plays and satires as a man could well be and it was on account of this very dissimilarity that mr welwyn first took a violent fancy to him and then invited him to his house franval spoke english remarkably well wore neither beard mustache nor whiskers kept his hair cut almost unbecomingly short dressed in the extreme of plainness and modest good taste talked little in general society uttered his words when he did speak with singular calmness and deliberation and to crown all had the greater part of his acquired property invested in english securities in mr welwyns estimation such a man as this was a perfect miracle of a frenchman and he admired and encouraged him accordingly  i have said that i disliked him yet could not assign a reason for my dislike and i can only repeat it now he was remarkably polite to me we often rode together in hunting and sat near each other at the grange table but i could never become familiar with him he always gave me the idea of a man who had some mental reservation in saying the most trifling thing there was a constant restraint hardly perceptible to most people but plainly visible nevertheless to me which seemed to accompany his lightest words and to hang about his most familiar manner this however was no just reason for my secretly disliking and distrusting him as i did ida said as much to me i remember when i confessed to her what my feelings toward him were and tried but vainly to induce her to be equally candid with me in return she seemed to shrink from the tacit condemnation of rosamonds opinion which such a confidence on her part would have implied and yet she watched the growth of that opinionor in other words the growth of her sisters liking for the baronwith an apprehension and sorrow which she tried fruitlessly to conceal even her father began to notice that her spirits were not so good as usual and to suspect the cause of her melancholy i remember he jested with all the dense insensibility of a stupid man about ida having invariably been jealous from a child if rosamond looked kindly upon anybody except her elder sister  the spring began to get far advanced toward summer franval paid a visit to london came back in the middle of the season to glenwith grange wrote to put off his departure for france and at last not at all to the surprise of anybody who was intimate with the welwyns proposed to rosamond and was accepted he was candor and generosity itself when the preliminaries of the marriagesettlement were under discussion he quite overpowered mr welwyn and the lawyers with references papers and statements of the distribution and extent of his property which were found to be perfectly correct his sisters were written to and returned the most cordial answers saying that the state of their health would not allow them to come to england for the marriage but adding a warm invitation to normandy for the bride and her family nothing in short could be more straightforward and satisfactory than the barons behavior and the testimonies to his worth and integrity which the news of the approaching marriage produced from his relatives and his friends  the only joyless face at the grange now was idas at any time it would have been a hard trial to her to resign that first and foremost place which she had held since childhood in her sisters heart as she knew she must resign it when rosamond married but secretly disliking and distrusting franval as she did the thought that he was soon to become the husband of her beloved sister filled her with a vague sense of terror which she could not explain to herself which it was imperatively necessary that she should conceal and which on those very accounts became a daily and hourly torment to her that was almost more than she could bear  one consolation alone supported her rosamond and she were not to be separated she knew that the baron secretly disliked her as much as she disliked him she knew that she must bid farewell to the brighter and happier part of her life on the day when she went to live under the same roof with her sisters husband but true to the promise made years and years ago by her dying mothers bedtrue to the affection which was the ruling and beautiful feeling of her whole existenceshe never hesitated about indulging rosamonds wish when the girl in her bright lighthearted way said that she could never get on comfortably in the marriage state unless she had ida to live with her and help her just the same as ever the baron was too polite a man even to look dissatisfied when he heard of the proposed arrangement and it was therefore settled from the beginning that ida was always to live with her sister  the marriage took place in the summer and the bride and bridegroom went to spend their honeymoon in cumberland on their return to glenwith grange a visit to the barons sisters in normandy was talked of but the execution of this project was suddenly and disastrously suspended by the death of mr welwyn from an attack of pleurisy  in consequence of this calamity the projected journey was of course deferred and when autumn and the shooting season came the baron was unwilling to leave the wellstocked preserves of the grange he seemed indeed to grow less and less inclined as time advanced for the trip to normandy and wrote excuse after excuse to his sisters when letters arrived from them urging him to pay the promised visit in the wintertime he said he would not allow his wife to risk a long journey in the spring his health was pronounced to be delicate in the genial summertime the accomplishment of the proposed visit would be impossible for at that period the baroness expected to become a mother such were the apologies which franval seemed almost glad to be able to send to his sisters in france  the marriage was in the strictest sense of the term a happy one the baron though he never altogether lost the strange restraint and reserve of his manner was in his quiet peculiar way the fondest and kindest of husbands he went to town occasionally on business but always seemed glad to return to the baroness he never varied in the politeness of his bearing toward his wifes sister he behaved with the most courteous hospitality toward all the friends of the welwyns in short he thoroughly justified the good opinion which rosamond and her father had formed of him when they first met at paris and yet no experience of his character thoroughly reassured ida months passed on quietly and pleasantly and still that secret sadness that indefinable unreasonable apprehension on rosamonds account hung heavily on her sisters heart  at the beginning of the first summer months a little domestic inconvenience happened which showed the baroness for the first time that her husbands temper could be seriously ruffledand that by the veriest trifle he was in the habit of taking in two french provincial newspapersone published at bordeaux and the other at havre he always opened these journals the moment they came looked at one particular column of each with the deepest attention for a few minutes then carelessly threw them aside into his wastepaper basket his wife and her sister were at first rather surprised at the manner in which he read his two papers but they thought no more of it when he explained that he only took them in to consult them about french commercial intelligence which might be occasionally of importance to him  these papers were published weekly on the occasion to which i have just referred the bordeaux paper came on the proper day as usual but the havre paper never made its appearance this trifling circumstance seemed to make the baron seriously uneasy he wrote off directly to the country postoffice and to the newspaper agent in london his wife astonished to see his tranquillity so completely overthrown by so slight a cause tried to restore his good humor by jesting with him about the missing newspaper he replied by the first angry and unfeeling words that she had heard issue from his lips she was then within about six weeks of her confinement and very unfit to bear harsh answers from anybodyleast of all from her husband  on the second day no answer came on the afternoon of the third the baron rode off to the post town to make inquiries about an hour after he had gone a strange gentleman came to the grange and asked to see the baroness on being informed that she was not well enough to receive visitors he sent up a message that his business was of great importance and that he would wait downstairs for a second answer  on receiving this message rosamond turned as usual to her elder sister for advice ida went downstairs immediately to see the stranger what i am now about to tell you of the extraordinary interview which took place between them and of the shocking events that followed it i have heard from miss welwyns own lips  she felt unaccountably nervous when she entered the room the stranger bowed very politely and asked in a foreign accent if she were the baroness franval she set him right on this point and told him she attended to all matters of business for the baroness adding that if his errand at all concerned her sisters husband the baron was not then at home  the stranger answered that he was aware of it when he called and that the unpleasant business on which he came could not be confided to the baronat least in the first instance  she asked why he said he was there to explain and expressed himself as feeling greatly relieved at having to open his business to her because she would doubtless be best able to prepare her sister for the bad news that he was unfortunately obliged to bring the sudden faintness which overcame her as he spoke those words prevented her from addressing him in return he poured out some water for her from a bottle which happened to be standing on the table and asked if he might depend on her fortitude she tried to say yes but the violent throbbing of her heart seemed to choke her he took a foreign newspaper from his pocket saying that he was a secret agent of the french policethat the paper was the havre journal for the past week and that it had been expressly kept from reaching the baron as usual through his the agents interference he then opened the newspaper and begged that she would nerve herself sufficiently for her sisters sake to read certain lines which would give her some hint of the business that brought him there he pointed to the passage as he spoke it was among the shipping entries and was thus expressed  arrived the berenice from san francisco with a valuable cargo of hides she brings one passenger the baron franval of chateau franval in normandy  as miss welwyn read the entry her heart which had been throbbing violently but the moment before seemed suddenly to cease from all action and she began to shiver though it was a warm june evening the agent held the tumbler to her lips and made her drink a little of the water entreating her very earnestly to take courage and listen to him he then sat down and referred again to the entry every word he uttered seeming to burn itself in forever as she expressed it on her memory and her heart  he said it has been ascertained beyond the possibility of doubt that there is no mistake about the name in the lines you have just read and it is as certain as that we are here that there is only one baron franval now alive the question therefore is whether the passenger by the berenice is the true baron ori beg you most earnestly to bear with me and to compose yourselfor the husband of your sister the person who arrived last week at havre was scouted as an impostor by the ladies at the chateau the moment he presented himself there as the brother returning to them after sixteen years of absence the authorities were communicated with and i and my assistants were instantly sent for from paris  we wasted no time in questioning the supposed impostor he either was or affected to be in a perfect frenzy of grief and indignation we just ascertained from competent witnesses that he bore an extraordinary resemblance to the real baron and that he was perfectly familiar with places and persons in and about the chateau we just ascertained that and then proceeded to confer with the local authorities and to examine their private entries of suspected persons in their jurisdiction ranging back over a past period of twenty years or more one of the entries thus consulted contained these particulars hector auguste monbrun son of a respectable proprietor in normandy well educated gentlemanlike manners on bad terms with his family character bold cunning unscrupulous selfpossessed is a clever mimic may be easily recognized by his striking likeness to the baron franval imprisoned at twenty for theft and assault  miss welwyn saw the agent look up at her after he had read this extract from the policebook to ascertain if she was still able to listen to him he asked with some appearance of alarm as their eyes met if she would like some more water she was just able to make a sign in the negative he took a second extract from his pocketbook and went on  he said the next entry under the same name was dated four years later and ran thus h a monbrun condemned to the galleys for life for assassination and other crimes not officially necessary to be here specified escaped from custody at toulon is known since the expiration of his first term of imprisonment to have allowed his beard to grow and to have worn his hair long with the intention of rendering it impossible for those acquainted with him in his native province to recognize him as heretofore by his likeness to the baron franval there were more particulars added not important enough for extract we immediately examined the supposed impostor for if he was monbrun we knew that we should find on his shoulder the two letters of the convict brand t f standing for travaux forces after the minutest examination with the mechanical and chemical tests used on such occasions not the slightest trace of the brand was to be found the moment this astounding discovery was made i started to lay an embargo on the forthcoming numbers of the havre journal for that week which were about to be sent to the english agent in london i arrived at havre on saturday the morning of publication in time to execute my design i waited there long enough to communicate by telegraph with my superiors in paris then hastened to this place what my errand here is you may  he might have gone on speaking for some moments longer but miss welwyn heard no more  her first sensation of returning consciousness was the feeling that water was being sprinkled on her face then she saw that all the windows in the room had been set wide open to give her air and that she and the agent were still alone at first she felt bewildered and hardly knew who he was but he soon recalled to her mind the horrible realities that had brought him there by apologizing for not having summoned assistance when she fainted he said it was of the last importance in franvals absence that no one in the house should imagine that anything unusual was taking place in it then after giving her an interval of a minute or two to collect what little strength she had left he added that he would not increase her sufferings by saying anything more just then on the shocking subject of the investigation which it was his duty to makethat he would leave her to recover herself and to consider what was the best course to be taken with the baroness in the present terrible emergencyand that he would privately return to the house between eight and nine oclock that evening ready to act as miss welwyn wished and to afford her and her sister any aid and protection of which they might stand in need with these words he bowed and noiselessly quitted the room  for the first few awful minutes after she was left alone miss welwyn sat helpless and speechless utterly numbed in heart and mind and bodythen a sort of instinct she was incapable of thinking seemed to urge her to conceal the fearful news from her sister as long as possible she ran upstairs to rosamonds sittingroom and called through the door for she dared not trust herself in her sisters presence that the visitor had come on some troublesome business from their late fathers lawyers and that she was going to shut herself up and write some long letters in connection with that business after she had got into her own room she was never sensible of how time was passingnever conscious of any feeling within her except a baseless helpless hope that the french police might yet be proved to have made some terrible mistakeuntil she heard a violent shower of rain come on a little after sunset the noise of the rain and the freshness it brought with it in the air seemed to awaken her as if from a painful and a fearful sleep the power of reflection returned to her her heart heaved and bounded with an overwhelming terror as the thought of rosamond came back vividly to it her memory recurred despairingly to the longpast day of her mothers death and to the farewell promise she had made by her mothers bedside she burst into an hysterical passion of weeping that seemed to be tearing her to pieces in the midst of it she heard the clatter of a horses hoofs in the courtyard and knew that rosamonds husband had come back  dipping her handkerchief in cold water and passing it over her eyes as she left the room she instantly hastened to her sister  fortunately the daylight was fading in the oldfashioned chamber that rosamond occupied before they could say two words to each other franval was in the room he seemed violently irritated said that he had waited for the arrival of the mailthat the missing newspaper had not come by itthat he had got wet throughthat he felt a shivering fit coming onand that he believed he had caught a violent cold his wife anxiously suggested some simple remedies he roughly interrupted her saying there was but one remedy the remedy of going to bed and so left them without another word she just put her handkerchief to her eyes and said softly to her sister how he is changed then spoke no more they sat silent for half an hour or longer after that rosamond went affectionately and forgivingly to see how her husband was she returned saying that he was in bed and in a deep heavy sleep and predicting hopefully that he would wake up quite well the next morning in a few minutes more the clock stuck nine and ida heard the servants step ascending the stairs she suspected what his errand was and went out to meet him her presentiment had not deceived her the police agent had arrived and was waiting for her downstairs  he asked her if she had said anything to her sister or had thought of any plan of action the moment she entered the room and on receiving a reply in the negative inquired further if the baron had come home yet she answered that he had that he was ill and tired and vexed and that he had gone to bed the agent asked in an eager whisper if she knew that he was asleep and alone in bed and when he received her reply said that he must go up into the bedroom directly  she began to feel the faintness coming over her again and with it sensations of loathing and terror that she could neither express to others nor define to herself he said that if she hesitated to let him avail himself of this unexpected opportunity her scruples might lead to fatal results he reminded her that if the baron were really the convict monbrun the claims of society and of justice demanded that he should be discovered by the first available means and that if he were notif some inconceivable mistake had really been committedthen such a plan for getting immediately at the truth as was now proposed would insure the delivery of an innocent man from suspicion and at the same time spare him the knowledge that he had ever been suspected this last argument had its effect on miss welwyn the baseless helpless hope that the french authorities might yet be proved to be in error which she had already felt in her own room returned to her now she suffered the agent to lead her upstairs  he took the candle from her hand when she pointed to the door opened it softly and leaving it ajar went into the room  she looked through the gap with a feverish horrorstruck curiosity franval was lying on his side in a profound sleep with his back turned toward the door the agent softly placed the candle upon a small readingtable between the door and the bedside softly drew down the bedclothes a little away from the sleepers back then took a pair of scissors from the toilettable and very gently and slowly began to cut away first the loose folds then the intervening strips of linen from the part of franvals nightgown that was over his shoulders when the upper part of his back had been bared in this way the agent took the candle and held it near the flesh miss welwyn heard him ejaculate some word under his breath then saw him looking round to where she was standing and beckoning to her to come in  mechanically she obeyed mechanically she looked down where his finger was pointing it was the convict monbrunthere just visible under the bright light of the candle were the fatal letters t f branded on the villains shoulder  though she could neither move nor speak the horror of this discovery did not deprive her of her consciousness she saw the agent softly draw up the bedclothes again into their proper position replace the scissors on the toilettable and take from it a bottle of smellingsalts she felt him removing her from the bedroom and helping her quickly downstairs giving her the salts to smell to by the way when they were alone again he said with the first appearance of agitation that he had yet exhibited now madam for gods sake collect all your courage and be guided by me you and your sister had better leave the house immediately have you any relatives in the neighborhood with whom you could take refuge they had none what is the name of the nearest town where you could get good accommodation for the night harleybrook he wrote the name down on his tablets how far off is it twelve miles you had better have the carriage out at once to go there with as little delay as possible leaving me to pass the night here i will communicate with you tomorrow at the principal hotel can you compose yourself sufficiently to be able to tell the head servant if i ring for him that he is to obey my orders till further notice the servant was summoned and received his instructions the agent going out with him to see that the carriage was got ready quietly and quickly miss welwyn went upstairs to her sister  how the fearful news was first broken to rosamond i cannot relate to you miss welwyn has never confided to me has never confided to anybody what happened at the interview between her sister and herself that night i can tell you nothing of the shock they both suffered except that the younger and the weaker died under it that the elder and the stronger has never recovered from it and never will  they went away the same night with one attendant to harleybrook as the agent had advised before daybreak rosamond was seized with the pains of premature labor she died three days after unconscious of the horror of her situation wandering in her mind about past times and singing old tunes that ida had taught her as she lay in her sisters arms  the child was born alive and lives still you saw her at the window as we came in at the back way to the grange i surprised you i dare say by asking you not to speak of her to miss welwyn perhaps you noticed something vacant in the little girls expression i am sorry to say that her mind is more vacant still if idiot did not sound like a mocking word however tenderly and pityingly one may wish to utter it i should tell you that the poor thing had been an idiot from her birth  you will doubtless want to hear now what happened at glenwith grange after miss welwyn and her sister had left it i have seen the letter which the police agent sent the next morning to harleybrook and speaking from my recollection of that i shall be able to relate all you can desire to know  first as to the past history of the scoundrel monbrun i need only tell you that he was identical with an escaped convict who for a long term of years had successfully eluded the vigilance of the authorities all over europe and in america as well in conjunction with two accomplices he had succeeded in possessing himself of large sums of money by the most criminal means he also acted secretly as the banker of his convict brethren whose dishonest gains were all confided to his hands for safekeeping he would have been certainly captured on venturing back to france along with his two associates but for the daring imposture in which he took refuge and which if the true baron franval had really died abroad as was reported would in all probability never have been found out  besides his extraordinary likeness to the baron he had every other requisite for carrying on his deception successfully though his parents were not wealthy he had received a good education he was so notorious for his gentlemanlike manners among the villainous associates of his crimes and excesses that they nicknamed him the prince all his early life had been passed in the neighborhood of the chateau franval he knew what were the circumstances which had induced the baron to leave it he had been in the country to which the baron had emigrated he was able to refer familiarly to persons and localities at home and abroad with which the baron was sure to be acquainted and lastly he had an expatriation of fifteen years to plead for him as his allsufficient excuse if he made any slight mistakes before the barons sisters in his assumed character of their longabsent brother it will be of course hardly necessary for me to tell you in relation to this part of the subject that the true franval was immediately and honorably reinstated in the family rights of which the impostor had succeeded for a time in depriving him  according to monbruns own account he had married poor rosamond purely for love and the probabilities certainly are that the pretty innocent english girl had really struck the villains fancy for the time and that the easy quiet life he was leading at the grange pleased him by contrast with his perilous and vagabond existence of former days what might have happened if he had had time enough to grow wearied of his illfated wife and his english home it is now useless to inquire what really did happen on the morning when he awoke after the flight of ida and her sister can be briefly told  as soon as his eyes opened they rested on the police agent sitting quietly by the bedside with a loaded pistol in his hand monbrun knew immediately that he was discovered but he never for an instant lost the selfpossession for which he was famous he said he wished to have five minutes allowed him to deliberate quietly in bed whether he should resist the french authorities on english ground and so gain time by obliging the one government to apply specially to have him delivered up by the otheror whether he should accept the terms officially offered to him by the agent if he quietly allowed himself to be captured he chose the latter courseit was suspected because he wished to communicate personally with some of his convict associates in france whose fraudulent gains were in his keeping and because he felt boastfully confident of being able to escape again whenever he pleased be his secret motives however what they might he allowed the agent to conduct him peaceably from the grange first writing a farewell letter to poor rosamond full of heartless french sentiment and glib sophistries about fate and society his own fate was not long in overtaking him he attempted to escape again as it had been expected he would and was shot by the sentinel on duty at the time i remember hearing that the bullet entered his head and killed him on the spot  my story is done it is ten years now since rosamond was buried in the churchyard yonder and it is ten years also since miss welwyn returned to be the lonely inhabitant of glenwith grange she now lives but in the remembrances that it calls up before her of her happier existence of former days there is hardly an object in the old house which does not tenderly and solemnly remind her of the mother whose last wishes she lived to obey of the sister whose happiness was once her dearest earthly care those prints that you noticed on the library walls rosamond used to copy in the past time when her pencil was often guided by idas hand those musicbooks that you were looking over she and her mother have played from together through many a long and quiet summers evening she has no ties now to bind her to the present but the poor child whose affliction it is her constant effort to lighten and the little peasant population around her whose humble cares and wants and sorrows she is always ready to relieve far and near her modest charities have penetrated among us and far and near she is heartily beloved and blessed in many a laborers household there is no poor mans hearth not in this village only but for miles away from it as well at which you would not be received with the welcome given to an old friend if you only told the cottagers that you knew the lady of glenwith grange  prologue to the fifth story  the next piece of work which occupied my attention after taking leave of mr garthwaite offered the strongest possible contrast to the task which had last engaged me fresh from painting a bull at a farmhouse i set forth to copy a holy family by correggio at a convent of nuns people who go to the royal academy exhibition and see pictures by famous artists painted year after year in the same marked style which first made them celebrated would be amazed indeed if they knew what a jackofalltrades a poor painter must become before he can gain his daily bread  the picture by correggio which i was now commissioned to copy had been lent to the nuns by a catholic gentleman of fortune who prized it as the gem of his collection and who had never before trusted it out of his own hands my copy when completed was to be placed over the high altar of the convent chapel and my work throughout its progress was to be pursued entirely in the parlor of the nunnery and always in the watchful presence of one or other of the inmates of the house it was only on such conditions that the owner of the correggio was willing to trust his treasure out of his own hands and to suffer it to be copied by a stranger the restrictions he imposed which i thought sufficiently absurd and perhaps offensively suspicious as well were communicated to me politely enough before i was allowed to undertake the commission unless i was inclined to submit to precautionary regulations which would affect any other artist exactly as they affected me i was told not to think of offering to make the copy and the nuns would then address themselves to some other person in my profession after a days consideration i submitted to the restrictions by my wifes advice and saved the nuns the trouble of making application for a copier of correggio in any other quarter  i found the convent was charmingly situated in a quiet little valley in the west of england the parlor in which i was to paint was a large welllighted apartment and the village inn about half a mile off afforded me cheap and excellent quarters for the night thus far therefore there was nothing to complain of as for the picture which was the next object of interest to me i was surprised to find that the copying of it would be by no means so difficult a task as i had anticipated i am rather of a revolutionary spirit in matters of art and am bold enough to think that the old masters have their faults as well as their beauties i can give my opinion therefore on the correggio at the convent independently at least looked at technically the picture was a fine specimen of coloring and execution but looked at for the higher merits of delicacy elevation and feeling for the subject it deserved copying as little as the most commonplace work that any unlucky modern artist ever produced the faces of the holy family not only failed to display the right purity and tenderness of expression but absolutely failed to present any expression at all it is flat heresy to say so but the valuable correggio was nevertheless emphatically and in so many words a very uninteresting picture  so much for the convent and the work that i was to do in it my next anxiety was to see how the restrictions imposed on me were to be carried out the first day the mother superior herself mounted guard in the parlora stern silent fanaticallooking woman who seemed determined to awe me and make me uncomfortable and who succeeded thoroughly in the execution of her purpose the second day she was relieved by the officiating priest of the conventa mild melancholy gentlemanlike man with whom i got on tolerably well the third day i had for overlooker the portress of the housea dirty dismal deaf old woman who did nothing but knit stockings and chew orrisroot the fourth day a middleaged nun whom i heard addressed as mother martha occupied the post of guardian to the precious correggio and with her the number of my overlookers terminated she and the portress and the priest and the mother superior relieved each other with military regularity until i had put the last touch to my copy i found them ready for me every morning on entering the parlor and i left them in the chair of observation every evening on quitting it as for any young and beautiful nuns who might have been in the building i never so much as set eyes on the ends of their veils from the door to the parlor and from the parlor to the door comprised the whole of my experience of the inside of the convent  the only one of my superintending companions with whom i established anything like a familiar acquaintance was mother martha she had no outward attractions to recommend her but she was simple goodhumored ready to gossip and inquisitive to a perfectly incredible degree her whole life had been passed in the nunnery she was thoroughly accustomed to her seclusion thoroughly content with the monotonous round of her occupations not at all anxious to see the world for herself but on the other hand insatiably curious to know all about it from others there was no question connected with myself my wife my children my friends my profession my income my travels my favorite amusements and even my favorite sins which a woman could ask a man that mother martha did not in the smallest and softest of voices ask of me though an intelligent wellinformed person in all that related to her own special vocation she was a perfect child in everything else i constantly caught myself talking to her just as i should have talked at home to one of my own little girls  i hope no one will think that in expressing myself thus i am writing disparagingly of the poor nun on two accounts i shall always feel compassionately and gratefully toward mother martha she was the only person in the convent who seemed sincerely anxious to make her presence in the parlor as agreeable to me as possible and she goodhumoredly told me the story which it is my object in these pages to introduce to the reader in both ways i am deeply indebted to her and i hope always to remember the obligation  the circumstances under which the story came to be related to me may be told in very few words  the interior of a convent parlor being a complete novelty to me i looked around with some interest on first entering my paintingroom at the nunnery there was but little in it to excite the curiosity of any one the floor was covered with common matting and the ceiling with plain whitewash the furniture was of the simplest kind a low chair with a prayingdesk fixed to the back and a finely carved oak bookcase studded all over with brass crosses being the only useful objects that i could discern which had any conventional character about them as for the ornaments of the room they were entirely beyond my appreciation i could feel no interest in the colored prints of saints with gold platters at the backs of their heads that hung on the wall and i could see nothing particularly impressive in the two plain little alabaster pots for holy water fastened one near the door the other over the chimneypiece the only object indeed in the whole room which in the slightest degree attracted my curiosity was an old wormeaten wooden cross made in the rudest manner hanging by itself on a slip of wall between two windows it was so strangely rough and misshapen a thing to exhibit prominently in a neat room that i suspected some history must be attached to it and resolved to speak to my friend the nun about it at the earliest opportunity  mother martha said i taking advantage of the first pause in the succession of quaintly innocent questions which she was as usual addressing to me i have been looking at that rough old cross hanging between the windows and fancying that it must surely be some curiosity  hush hush exclaimed the nun you must not speak of that as a curiosity the mother superior calls it a relic  i beg your pardon said i i ought to have chosen my expressions more carefully  not interposed mother martha nodding to show me that my apology need not be finishednot that it is exactly a relic in the strict catholic sense of the word but there were circumstances in the life of the person who made it here she stopped and looked at me doubtfully  circumstances perhaps which it is not considered advisable to communicate to strangers i suggested  oh no answered the nun i never heard that they were to be kept a secret they were not told as a secret to me  then you know all about them i asked  certainly i could tell you the whole history of the wooden cross but it is all about catholics and you are a protestant  that mother martha does not make it at all less interesting to me  does it not indeed exclaimed the nun innocently what a strange man you are and what a remarkable religion yours must be what do your priests say about ours are they learned men your priests  i felt that my chance of hearing mother marthas story would be a poor one indeed if i allowed her to begin a fresh string of questions accordingly i dismissed the inquiries about the clergy of the established church with the most irreverent briefness and recalled her attention forthwith to the subject of the wooden cross  yes yes said the goodnatured nun surely you shall hear all i can tell you about it but she hesitated timidly but i must ask the mother superiors leave first  saying these words she summoned the portress to my great amusement to keep guard over the inestimable correggio in her absence and left the room in less than five minutes she came back looking quite happy and important in her innocent way  the mother superior she said has given me leave to tell all i know about the wooden cross she says it may do you good and improve your protestant opinion of us catholics  i expressed myself as being both willing and anxious to profit by what i heard and the nun began her narrative immediately  she related it in her own simple earnest minute way dwelling as long on small particulars as on important incidents and making moral reflections for my benefit at every place where it was possible to introduce them in spite however of these drawbacks in the telling of it the story interested and impressed me in no ordinary degree and i now purpose putting the events of it together as skillfully and strikingly as i can in the hope that this written version of the narrative may appeal as strongly to the readers sympathies as the spoken version did to mine     the nuns story of gabriels marriage    chapter i  one night during the period of the first french revolution the family of francois sarzeau a fisherman of brittany were all waking and watching at a late hour in their cottage on the peninsula of quiberon francois had gone out in his boat that evening as usual to fish shortly after his departure the wind had risen the clouds had gathered and the storm which had been threatening at intervals throughout the whole day burst forth furiously about nine oclock it was now eleven and the raging of the wind over the barren heathy peninsula still seemed to increase with each fresh blast that tore its way out upon the open sea the crashing of the waves on the beach was awful to hear the dreary blackness of the sky terrible to behold the longer they listened to the storm the oftener they looked out at it the fainter grew the hopes which the fishermans family still strove to cherish for the safety of francois sarzeau and of his younger son who had gone with him in the boat  there was something impressive in the simplicity of the scene that was now passing within the cottage  on one side of the great rugged black fireplace crouched two little girls the younger half asleep with her head in her sisters lap these were the daughters of the fisherman and opposite to them sat their eldest brother gabriel his right arm had been badly wounded in a recent encounter at the national game of the soule a sport resembling our english football but played on both sides in such savage earnest by the people of brittany as to end always in bloodshed often in mutilation sometimes even in loss of life on the same bench with gabriel sat his betrothed wifea girl of eighteenclothed in the plain almost monastic blackandwhite costume of her native district she was the daughter of a small farmer living at some little distance from the coast between the groups formed on either side of the fireplace the vacant space was occupied by the foot of a trucklebed in this bed lay a very old man the father of francois sarzeau his haggard face was covered with deep wrinkles his long white hair flowed over the coarse lump of sacking which served him for a pillow and his light gray eyes wandered incessantly with a strange expression of terror and suspicion from person to person and from object to object in all parts of the room whenever the wind and sea whistled and roared at their loudest he muttered to himself and tossed his hands fretfully on his wretched coverlet on these occasions his eyes always fixed themselves intently on a little delf image of the virgin placed in a niche over the fireplace every time they saw him look in this direction gabriel and the young girls shuddered and crossed themselves and even the child who still kept awake imitated their example there was one bond of feeling at least between the old man and his grandchildren which connected his age and their youth unnaturally and closely together this feeling was reverence for the superstitions which had been handed down to them by their ancestors from centuries and centuries back as far even as the age of the druids the spirit warnings of disaster and death which the old man heard in the wailing of the wind in the crashing of the waves in the dreary monotonous rattling of the casement the young man and his affianced wife and the little child who cowered by the fireside heard too all differences in sex in temperament in years superstition was strong enough to strike down to its own dread level in the fishermans cottage on that stormy night  besides the benches by the fireside and the bed the only piece of furniture in the room was a coarse wooden table with a loaf of black bread a knife and a pitcher of cider placed on it old nets coils of rope tattered sails hung about the walls and over the wooden partition which separated the room into two compartments wisps of straw and ears of barley drooped down through the rotten rafters and gaping boards that made the floor of the granary above  these different objects and the persons in the cottage who composed the only surviving members of the fishermans family were strangely and wildly lit up by the blaze of the fire and by the still brighter glare of a resin torch stuck into a block of wood in the chimneycorner the red and yellow light played full on the weird face of the old man as he lay opposite to it and glanced fitfully on the figures of the young girl gabriel and the two children the great gloomy shadows rose and fell and grew and lessened in bulk about the walls like visions of darkness animated by a supernatural specterlife while the dense obscurity outside spreading before the curtainless window seemed as a wall of solid darkness that had closed in forever around the fishermans house the night scene within the cottage was almost as wild and as dreary to look upon as the night scene without  for a long time the different persons in the room sat together without speaking even without looking at each other at last the girl turned and whispered something into gabriels ear  perrine what were you saying to gabriel asked the child opposite seizing the first opportunity of breaking the desolate silencedoubly desolate at her agewhich was preserved by all around her  i was telling him answered perrine simply that it was time to change the bandages on his arm and i also said to him what i have often said before that he must never play at that terrible game of the soule again  the old man had been looking intently at perrine and his grandchild as they spoke his harsh hollow voice mingled with the last soft tones of the young girl repeating over and over again the same terrible words drowned drowned son and grandson both drowned both drowned  hush grandfather said gabriel we must not lose all hope for them yet god and the blessed virgin protect them he looked at the little delf image and crossed himself the others imitated him except the old man he still tossed his hands over the coverlet and still repeated drowned drowned  oh that accursed soule groaned the young man but for this wound i should have been with my father the poor boys life might at least have been saved for we should then have left him here  silence exclaimed the harsh voice from the bed the wail of dying men rises louder than the loud sea the devils psalmsinging roars higher than the roaring wind be silent and listen francois drowned pierre drowned hark hark  a terrific blast of wind burst over the house as he spoke shaking it to its center overpowering all other sounds even to the deafening crash of the waves the slumbering child awoke and uttered a scream of fear perrine who had been kneeling before her lover binding the fresh bandages on his wounded arm paused in her occupation trembling from head to foot gabriel looked toward the window his experience told him what must be the hurricane fury of that blast of wind out at sea and he sighed bitterly as he murmured to himself god help them bothmans help will be as nothing to them now  gabriel cried the voice from the bed in altered tonesvery faint and trembling  he did not hear or did not attend to the old man he was trying to soothe and encourage the young girl at his feet  dont be frightened love he said kissing her very gently and tenderly on the forehead you are as safe here as anywhere was i not right in saying that it would be madness to attempt taking you back to the farmhouse this evening you can sleep in that room perrine when you are tiredyou can sleep with the two girls  gabriel brother gabriel cried one of the children oh look at grandfather  gabriel ran to the bedside the old man had raised himself into a sitting position his eyes were dilated his whole face was rigid with terror his hands were stretched out convulsively toward his grandson the white women he screamed the white women the gravediggers of the drowned are out on the sea  the children with cries of terror flung themselves into perrines arms even gabriel uttered an exclamation of horror and started back from the bedside  still the old man reiterated the white women the white women open the door gabriel lookout westward where the ebbtide has left the sand dry youll see them bright as lightning in the darkness mighty as the angels in stature sweeping like the wind over the sea in their long white garments with their white hair trailing far behind them open the door gabriel youll see them stop and hover over the place where your father and your brother have been drowned youll see them come on till they reach the sand youll see them dig in it with their naked feet and beckon awfully to the raging sea to give up its dead open the door gabrielor though it should be the death of me i will get up and open it myself  gabriels face whitened even to his lips but he made a sign that he would obey it required the exertion of his whole strength to keep the door open against the wind while he looked out  do you see them grandson gabriel speak the truth and tell me if you see them cried the old man  i see nothing but darknesspitch darkness answered gabriel letting the door close again  ah woe woe groaned his grandfather sinking back exhausted on the pillow darkness to you but bright as lightning to the eyes that are allowed to see them drowned drowned pray for their souls gabrieli see the white women even where i lie and dare not pray for them son and grandson drowned both drowned  the young man went back to perrine and the children  grandfather is very ill tonight he whispered you had better all go into the bedroom and leave me alone to watch by him  they rose as he spoke crossed themselves before the image of the virgin kissed him one by one and without uttering a word softly entered the little room on the other side of the partition gabriel looked at his grandfather and saw that he lay quiet now with his eyes closed as if he were already dropping asleep the young man then heaped some fresh logs on the fire and sat down by it to watch till morning  very dreary was the moaning of the night storm but it was not more dreary than the thoughts which now occupied him in his solitudethoughts darkened and distorted by the terrible superstitions of his country and his race ever since the period of his mothers death he had been oppressed by the conviction that some curse hung over the family at first they had been prosperous they had got money a little legacy had been left them but this good fortune had availed only for a time disaster on disaster strangely and suddenly succeeded losses misfortunes poverty want itself had overwhelmed them his fathers temper had become so soured that the oldest friends of francois sarzeau declared he was changed beyond recognition and now all this past misfortunethe steady withering household blight of many yearshad ended in the last worst misery of allin death the fate of his father and his brother admitted no longer of a doubt he knew it as he listened to the storm as he reflected on his grandfathers words as he called to mind his own experience of the perils of the sea and this double bereavement had fallen on him just as the time was approaching for his marriage with perrine just when misfortune was most ominous of evil just when it was hardest to bear forebodings which he dared not realize began now to mingle with the bitterness of his grief whenever his thoughts wandered from the present to the future and as he sat by the lonely fireside murmuring from time to time the church prayer for the repose of the dead he almost involuntarily mingled with it another prayer expressed only in his own simple words for the safety of the livingfor the young girl whose love was his sole earthly treasure for the motherless children who must now look for protection to him alone  he had sat by the hearth a long long time absorbed in his thoughts not once looking round toward the bed when he was startled by hearing the sound of his grandfathers voice once more  gabriel whispered the old man trembling and shrinking as he spoke gabriel do you hear a dripping of waternow slow now quick againon the floor at the foot of my bed  i hear nothing grandfather but the crackling of the fire and the roaring of the storm outside  drip drip drip faster and faster plainer and plainer take the torch gabriel look down on the floorlook with all your eyes is the place wet there is it the rain from heaven that is dropping through the roof  gabriel took the torch with trembling fingers and knelt down on the floor to examine it closely he started back from the place as he saw that it was quite drythe torch dropped upon the hearthhe fell on his knees before the statue of the virgin and hid his face  is the floor wet answer me i command youis the floor wet asked the old man quickly and breathlessly  gabriel rose went back to the bedside and whispered to him that no drop of rain had fallen inside the cottage as he spoke the words he saw a change pass over his grandfathers facethe sharp features seemed to wither up on a sudden the eager expression to grow vacant and deathlike in an instant the voice too altered it was harsh and querulous no more its tones became strangely soft slow and solemn when the old man spoke again  i hear it still he said drip drip faster and plainer than ever that ghostly dropping of water is the last and the surest of the fatal signs which have told of your fathers and your brothers deaths tonight and i know from the place where i hear itthe foot of the bed i lie onthat it is a warning to me of my own approaching end i am called where my son and my grandson have gone before me my weary time in this world is over at last dont let perrine and the children come in here if they should awakethey are too young to look at death  gabriels blood curdled when he heard these wordswhen he touched his grandfathers hand and felt the chill that it struck to his ownwhen he listened to the raging wind and knew that all help was miles and miles away from the cottage still in spite of the storm the darkness and the distance he thought not for a moment of neglecting the duty that had been taught him from his childhoodthe duty of summoning the priest to the bedside of the dying i must call perrine he said to watch by you while i am away  stop cried the old man stop gabriel i implore i command you not to leave me  the priest grandfatheryour confession  it must be made to you in this darkness and this hurricane no man can keep the path across the heath gabriel i am dyingi should be dead before you got back gabriel for the love of the blessed virgin stop here with me till i diemy time is shorti have a terrible secret that i must tell to somebody before i draw my last breath your ear to my mouthquick quick  as he spoke the last words a slight noise was audible on the other side of the partition the door half opened and perrine appeared at it looking affrightedly into the room the vigilant eyes of the old mansuspicious even in deathcaught sight of her directly  go back he exclaimed faintly before she could utter a word go backpush her back gabriel and nail down the latch in the door if she wont shut it of herself  dear perrine go in again implored gabriel go in and keep the children from disturbing us you will only make him worseyou can be of no use here  she obeyed without speaking and shut the door again  while the old man clutched him by the arm and repeated quick quick your ear close to my mouth gabriel heard her say to the children who were both awake let us pray for grandfather and as he knelt down by the bedside there stole on his ear the sweet childish tones of his little sisters and the soft subdued voice of the young girl who was teaching them the prayer mingling divinely with the solemn wailing of wind and sea rising in a still and awful purity over the hoarse gasping whispers of the dying man  i took an oath not to tell it gabriellean down closer im weak and they mustnt hear a word in that roomi took an oath not to tell it but death is a warrant to all men for breaking such an oath as that listen dont lose a word im saying dont look away into the room the stain of bloodguilt has defiled it forever hush hush hush let me speak now your fathers dead i cant carry the horrid secret with me into the grave just remember gabrieltry if you cant remember the time before i was bedridden ten years ago and moreit was about six weeks you know before your mothers death you can remember it by that you and all the children were in that room with your mother you were asleep i think it was night not very lateonly nine oclock your father and i were standing at the door looking out at the heath in the moonlight he was so poor at that time he had been obliged to sell his own boat and none of the neighbors would take him out fishing with themyour father wasnt liked by any of the neighbors well we saw a stranger coming toward us a very young man with a knapsack on his back he looked like a gentleman though he was but poorly dressed he came up and told us he was dead tired and didnt think he could reach the town that night and asked if we would give him shelter till morning and your father said yes if he would make no noise because the wife was ill and the children were asleep so he said all he wanted was to go to sleep himself before the fire we had nothing to give him but black bread he had better food with him than that and undid his knapsack to get at it andandgabriel im sinkingdrink something to drinkim parched with thirst  silent and deadly pale gabriel poured some of the cider from the pitcher on the table into a drinkingcup and gave it to the old man slight as the stimulant was its effect on him was almost instantaneous his dull eyes brightened a little and he went on in the same whispering tones as before  he pulled the food out of his knapsack rather in a hurry so that some of the other small things in it fell on the floor among these was a pocketbook which your father picked up and gave him back and he put it in his coatpocketthere was a tear in one of the sides of the book and through the hole some banknotes bulged out i saw them and so did your father dont move away gabriel keep close theres nothing in me to shrink from well he shared his food like an honest fellow with us and then put his hand in his pocket and gave me four or five livres and then lay down before the fire to go to sleep as he shut his eyes your father looked at me in a way i didnt like hed been behaving very bitterly and desperately toward us for some time past being soured about poverty and your mothers illness and the constant crying out of you children for more to eat so when he told me to go and buy some wood some bread and some wine with money i had got i didnt like somehow to leave him alone with the stranger and so made excuses saying which was true that it was too late to buy things in the village that night but he told me in a rage to go and do as he bid me and knock the people up if the shop was shut so i went out being dreadfully afraid of your fatheras indeed we all were at that timebut i couldnt make up my mind to go far from the house i was afraid of something happening though i didnt dare to think what i dont know how it was but i stole back in about ten minutes on tiptoe to the cottage i looked in at the window and sawo god forgive him o god forgive mei sawimore to drink gabriel i cant speak againmore to drink  the voices in the next room had ceased but in the minute of silence which now ensued gabriel heard his sisters kissing perrine and wishing her goodnight they were all three trying to go asleep again  gabriel pray yourself and teach your children after you to pray that your father may find forgiveness where he is now gone i saw him as plainly as i now see you kneeling with his knife in one hand over the sleeping man he was taking the little book with the notes in it out of the strangers pocket he got the book into his possession and held it quite still in his hand for an instant thinking i believeoh no no im surehe was repenting im sure he was going to put the book back but just at that moment the stranger moved and raised one of his arms as if he was waking up then the temptation of the devil grew too strong for your fatheri saw him lift the hand with the knife in itbut saw nothing more i couldnt look in at the windowi couldnt move awayi couldnt cry out i stood with my back turned toward the house shivering all over though it was a warm summertime and hearing no cries no noises at all from the room behind me i was too frightened to know how long it was before the opening of the cottage door made me turn round but when i did i saw your father standing before me in the yellow moonlight carrying in his arms the bleeding body of the poor lad who had shared his food with us and slept on our hearth hush hush dont groan and sob in that way stifle it with the bedclothes hush youll wake them in the next room  gabrielgabriel exclaimed a voice from behind the partition what has happened gabriel let me come out and be with you  no no cried the old man collecting the last remains of his strength in the attempt to speak above the wind which was just then howling at the loudest stay where you aredont speak dont come outi command you gabriel his voice dropped to a faint whisper raise me up in bedyou must hear the whole of it now raise me im choking so that i can hardly speak keep close and listeni cant say much more where was iah your father he threatened to kill me if i didnt swear to keep it secret and in terror of my life i swore he made me help him to carry the bodywe took it all across the heathoh horrible horrible under the bright moonlift me higher gabriel you know the great stones yonder set up by the heathens you know the hollow place under the stones they call the merchants table we had plenty of room to lay him in that and hide him so and then we ran back to the cottage i never dared to go near the place afterward no nor your father either higher gabriel im choking again we burned the pocketbook and the knapsacknever knew his namewe kept the money to spend youre not lifting me youre not listening close enough your father said it was a legacy when you and your mother asked about the money you hurt me you shake me to pieces gabriel when you sob like that it brought a curse on us the money the curse has drowned your father and your brother the curse is killing me but ive confessedtell the priest i confessed before i died stop her stop perrine i hear her getting up take his bones away from the merchants table and bury them for the love of god and tell the priest lift me higher lift me till i am on my kneesif your father was alive hed murder me but tell the priestbecause of my guilty soulto pray andremember the merchants tableto bury and to prayto pray always for  as long as perrine heard faintly the whispering of the old man though no word that he said reached her ear she shrank from opening the door in the partition but when the whispering sounds which terrified her she knew not how or why first faltered then ceased altogether when she heard the sobs that followed them and when her heart told her who was weeping in the next roomthen she began to be influenced by a new feeling which was stronger than the strongest fear and she opened the door without hesitation almost without trembling  the coverlet was drawn up over the old man gabriel was kneeling by the bedside with his face hidden when she spoke to him he neither answered nor looked at her after a while the sobs that shook him ceased but still he never moved except once when she touched him and then he shudderedshuddered under her hand she called in his little sisters and they spoke to him and still he uttered no word in reply they wept one by one often and often they entreated him with loving words but the stupor of grief which held him speechless and motionless was beyond the power of human tears stronger even than the strength of human love  it was near daybreak and the storm was lulling but still no change occurred at the bedside once or twice as perrine knelt near gabriel still vainly endeavoring to arouse him to a sense of her presence she thought she heard the old man breathing feebly and stretched out her hand toward the coverlet but she could not summon courage to touch him or to look at him this was the first time she had ever been present at a deathbed the stillness in the room the stupor of despair that had seized on gabriel so horrified her that she was almost as helpless as the two children by her side it was not till the dawn looked in at the cottage windowso coldly so drearily and yet so reassuringlythat she began to recover her selfpossession at all then she knew that her best resource would be to summon assistance immediately from the nearest house while she was trying to persuade the two children to remain alone in the cottage with gabriel during her temporary absence she was startled by the sound of footsteps outside the door it opened and a man appeared on the threshold standing still there for a moment in the dim uncertain light  she looked closerlooked intently at him it was francois sarzeau himself    chapter ii  the fisherman was dripping with wet but his face always pale and inflexible seemed to be but little altered in expression by the perils through which he must have passed during the night young pierre lay almost insensible in his arms in the astonishment and fright of the first moment perrine screamed as she recognized him  there there there he said peevishly advancing straight to the hearth with his burden dont make a noise you never expected to see us alive again i dare say we gave ourselves up as lost and only escaped after all by a miracle  he laid the boy down where he could get the full warmth of the fire and then turning round took a wickercovered bottle from his pocket and said if it hadnt been for the brandy he stopped suddenlystartedput down the bottle on the bench near himand advanced quickly to the bedside  perrine looked after him as he went and saw gabriel who had risen when the door was opened moving back from the bed as francois approached the young mans face seemed to have been suddenly struck to stoneits blank ghastly whiteness was awful to look at he moved slowly backward and backward till he came to the cottage wallthen stood quite still staring on his father with wild vacant eyes moving his hands to and fro before him muttering but never pronouncing one audible word  francois did not appear to notice his son he had the coverlet of the bed in his hand  anything the matter here he asked as he drew it down  still gabriel could not speak perrine saw it and answered for him  gabriel is afraid that his poor grandfather is dead she whispered nervously  dead there was no sorrow in the tone as he echoed the word was he very bad in the night before his death happened did he wander in his mind he has been rather lightheaded lately  he was very restless and spoke of the ghostly warnings that we all know of he said he saw and heard many things which told him from the other world that you and pierregabriel she screamed suddenly interrupting herself look at him look at his face your grandfather is not dead  at this moment francois was raising his fathers head to look closely at him a faint spasm had indeed passed over the deathly face the lips quivered the jaw dropped francois shuddered as he looked and moved away hastily from the bed at the same instant gabriel started from the wall his expression altered his pale cheeks flushed suddenly as he snatched up the wickercased bottle and poured all the little brandy that was left in it down his grandfathers throat  the effect was nearly instantaneous the sinking vital forces rallied desperately the old mans eyes opened again wandered round the room then fixed themselves intently on francois as he stood near the fire trying and terrible as his position was at that moment gabriel still retained selfpossession enough to whisper a few words in perrines ear go back again into the bedroom and take the children with you he said we may have something to speak about which you had better not hear  son gabriel your grandfather is trembling all over said francois if he is dying at all he is dying of cold help me to lift him bed and all to the hearth  no no dont let him touch me gasped the old man dont let him look at me in that way dont let him come near me gabriel is it his ghost or is it himself  as gabriel answered he heard a knocking at the door his father opened it and disclosed to view some people from the neighboring fishing village who had comemore out of curiosity than sympathyto inquire whether francois and the boy pierre had survived the night without asking any one to enter the fisherman surlily and shortly answered the various questions addressed to him standing in his own doorway while he was thus engaged gabriel heard his grandfather muttering vacantly to himself last nighthow about last night grandson what was i talking about last night did i say your father was drowned very foolish to say he was drowned and then see him come back alive again but it wasnt thatim so weak in my head i cant remember what was it gabriel something too horrible to speak of is that what youre whispering and trembling about i said nothing horrible a crime bloodshed i know nothing of any crime or bloodshed herei must have been frightened out of my wits to talk in that way the merchants table only a big heap of old stones what with the storm and thinking i was going to die and being afraid about your father i must have been lightheaded dont give another thought to that nonsense gabriel im better now we shall all live to laugh at poor grandfather for talking nonsense about crime and bloodshed in his sleep ah poor old manlast nightlightheadedfancies and nonsense of an old manwhy dont you laugh at it im laughingso lightheaded so light  he stopped suddenly a low cry partly of terror and partly of pain escaped him the look of pining anxiety and imbecile cunning which had distorted his face while he had been speaking faded from it forever he shivered a little breathed heavily once or twice then became quite still  had he died with a falsehood on his lips  gabriel looked round and saw that the cottage door was closed and that his father was standing against it how long he had occupied that position how many of the old mans last words he had heard it was impossible to conjecture but there was a lowering suspicion in his harsh face as he now looked away from the corpse to his son which made gabriel shudder and the first question that he asked on once more approaching the bedside was expressed in tones which quiet as they were had a fearful meaning in them  what did your grandfather talk about last night he asked  gabriel did not answer all that he had heard all that he had seen all the misery and horror that might yet be to come had stunned his mind the unspeakable dangers of his present position were too tremendous to be realized he could only feel them vaguely in the weary torpor that oppressed his heart while in every other direction the use of his faculties physical and mental seemed to have suddenly and totally abandoned him  is your tongue wounded son gabriel as well as your arm his father went on with a bitter laugh i come back to you saved by a miracle and you never speak to me would you rather i had died than the old man there he cant hear you nowwhy shouldnt you tell me what nonsense he was talking last night you wont i say you shall he crossed the room and put his back to the door before either of us leave this place you shall confess it you know that my duty to the church bids me to go at once and tell the priest of your grandfathers death if i leave that duty unfulfilled remember it is through your fault you keep me herefor here i stop till im obeyed do you hear that idiot speak speak instantly or you shall repeat it to the day of your death i ask againwhat did your grandfather say to you when he was wandering in his mind last night  he spoke of a crime committed by another and guiltily kept secret by him answered gabriel slowly and sternly and this morning he denied his own words with his last living breath but last night if he spoke the truth  the truth echoed francois what truth  he stopped his eyes fell then turned toward the corpse for a few minutes he stood steadily contemplating it breathing quickly and drawing his hand several times across his forehead then he faced his son once more in that short interval he had become in outward appearance a changed man expression voice and manner all were altered  heaven forgive me he went on but i could almost laugh at myself at this solemn moment for having spoken and acted just now so much like a fool denied his words did he poor old man they say sense often comes back to lightheaded people just before death and he is a proof of it the fact is gabriel my own wits must have been a little shakenand no wonderby what i went through last night and what i have come home to this morning as if you or anybody could ever really give serious credit to the wandering speeches of a dying old man where is perrine why did you send her away i dont wonder at your still looking a little startled and feeling low in your mind and all thatfor youve had a trying night of it trying in every way he must have been a good deal shaken in his wits last night between fears about himself and fears about me to think of my being angry with you gabriel for being a little alarmedvery naturallyby an old mans queer fancies come out perrinecome out of the bedroom whenever you are tired of it you must learn sooner or later to look at death calmly shake hands gabriel and let us make it up and say no more about what has passed you wont still angry with me for what i said to you just now ah youll think better about it by the time i return come out perrine weve no secrets here  where are you going to asked gabriel as he saw his father hastily open the door  to tell the priest that one of his congregation is dead and to have the death registered answered francois these are my duties and must be performed before i take any rest  he went out hurriedly as he said these words gabriel almost trembled at himself when he found that he breathed more freely that he felt less horribly oppressed both in mind and body the moment his fathers back was turned fearful as thought was now it was still a change for the better to be capable of thinking at all was the behavior of his father compatible with innocence could the old mans confused denial of his own words in the morning and in the presence of his son be set for one instant against the circumstantial confession that he had made during the night alone with his grandson these were the terrible questions which gabriel now asked himself and which he shrank involuntarily from answering and yet that doubt the solution of which would one way or the other irrevocably affect the whole future of his life must sooner or later be solved at any hazard  was there any way of setting it at rest yes one wayto go instantly while his father was absent and examine the hollow place under the merchants table if his grandfathers confession had really been made while he was in possession of his senses this place which gabriel knew to be covered in from wind and weather had never been visited since the commission of the crime by the perpetrator or by his unwilling accomplice though time had destroyed all besides the hair and the bones of the victim would still be left to bear witness to the truthif truth had indeed been spoken as this conviction grew on him the young mans cheek paled and he stopped irresolute halfway between the hearth and the door then he looked down doubtfully at the corpse on the bed and then there came upon him suddenly a revulsion of feeling a wild feverish impatience to know the worst without another instant of delay possessed him only telling perrine that he should be back soon and that she must watch by the dead in his absence he left the cottage at once without waiting to hear her reply even without looking back as he closed the door behind him  there were two tracks to the merchants table one the longer of the two by the coast cliffs the other across the heath but this latter path was also for some little distance the path which led to the village and the church he was afraid of attracting his fathers attention here so he took the direction of the coast at one spot the track trended inland winding round some of the many druid monuments scattered over the country this place was on high ground and commanded a view at no great distance of the path leading to the village just where it branched off from the heathy ridge which ran in the direction of the merchants table here gabriel descried the figure of a man standing with his back toward the coast  this figure was too far off to be identified with absolute certainty but it looked like and might well be francois sarzeau whoever he was the man was evidently uncertain which way he should proceed when he moved forward it was first to advance several paces toward the merchants table then he went back again toward the distant cottages and the church twice he hesitated thus the second time pausing long before he appeared finally to take the way that led to the village  leaving the post of observation among the stones at which he had instinctively halted for some minutes past gabriel now proceeded on his own path could this man really be his father and if it were so why did francois sarzeau only determine to go to the village where his business lay after having twice vainly attempted to persevere in taking the exactly opposite direction of the merchants table did he really desire to go there had he heard the name mentioned when the old man referred to it in his dying words and had he failed to summon courage enough to make all safe by removingthis last question was too horrible to be pursued gabriel stifled it affrightedly in his own heart as he went on  he reached the great druid monument without meeting a living soul on his way the sun was rising and the mighty stormclouds of the night were parting asunder wildly over the whole eastward horizon the waves still leaped and foamed gloriously but the gale had sunk to a keen fresh breeze as gabriel looked up and saw how brightly the promise of a lovely day was written in the heavens he trembled as he thought of the search which he was now about to make the sight of the fair fresh sunrise jarred horribly with the suspicions of committed murder that were rankling foully in his heart but he knew that his errand must be performed and he nerved himself to go through with it for he dared not return to the cottage until the mystery had been cleared up at once and forever  the merchants table was formed by two huge stones resting horizontally on three others in the troubled times of more than half a century ago regular tourists were unknown among the druid monuments of brittany and the entrance to the hollow place under the stonessince often visited by strangerswas at this time nearly choked up by brambles and weeds gabriels first look at this tangled nook of briers convinced him that the place had not been entered perhaps for years by any living being without allowing himself to hesitate for he felt that the slightest delay might be fatal to his resolution he passed as gently as possible through the brambles and knelt down at the low dusky irregular entrance of the hollow place under the stones  his heart throbbed violently his breath almost failed him but he forced himself to crawl a few feet into the cavity and then groped with his hand on the ground about him  he touched something something which it made his flesh creep to handle something which he would fain have dropped but which he grasped tight in spite of himself he drew back into the outer air and sunshine was it a human bone no he had been the dupe of his own morbid terrorhe had only taken up a fragment of dried wood  feeling shame at such selfdeception as this he was about to throw the wood from him before he reentered the place when another idea occurred to him  though it was dimly lighted through one or two chinks in the stones the far part of the interior of the cavity was still too dusky to admit of perfect examination by the eye even on a bright sunshiny morning observing this he took out the tinderbox and matches which like the other inhabitants of the district he always carried about with him for the purpose of lighting his pipe determining to use the piece of wood as a torch which might illuminate the darkest corner of the place when he next entered it fortunately the wood had remained so long and had been preserved so dry in its sheltered position that it caught fire almost as easily as a piece of paper the moment it was fairly aflame gabriel went into the cavity penetrating at oncethis timeto its furthest extremity  he remained among the stones long enough for the wood to burn down nearly to his hand when he came out and flung the burning fragment from him his face was flushed deeply his eyes sparkled he leaped carelessly on to the heath over the bushes through which he had threaded his way so warily but a few minutes before exclaiming i may marry perrine with a clear conscience now i am the son of as honest a man as there is in brittany  he had closely examined the cavity in every corner and not the slightest sign that any dead body had ever been laid there was visible in the hollow place under the merchants table    chapter iii  i may marry perrine with a clear conscience now  there are some parts of the world where it would be drawing no natural picture of human nature to represent a son as believing conscientiously that an offense against life and the laws of hospitality secretly committed by his father rendered him though innocent of all participation in it unworthy to fulfill his engagement with his affianced wife among the simple inhabitants of gabriels province however such acuteness of conscientious sensibility as this was no extraordinary exception to all general rules ignorant and superstitious as they might be the people of brittany practiced the duties of hospitality as devoutly as they practiced the duties of the national religion the presence of the strangerguest rich or poor was a sacred presence at their hearths his safety was their especial charge his property their especial responsibility they might be half starved but they were ready to share the last crust with him nevertheless as they would share it with their own children  any outrage on the virtue of hospitality thus born and bred in the people was viewed by them with universal disgust and punished with universal execration this ignominy was uppermost in gabriels thoughts by the side of his grandfathers bed the dread of this worst dishonor which there was no wiping out held him speechless before perrine shamed and horrified him so that he felt unworthy to look her in the face and when the result of his search at the merchants table proved the absence there of all evidence of the crime spoken of by the old man the blessed relief the absorbing triumph of that discovery was expressed entirely in the one thought which had prompted his first joyful words he could marry perrine with a clear conscience for he was the son of an honest man  when he returned to the cottage francois had not come back perrine was astonished at the change in gabriels manner even pierre and the children remarked it rest and warmth had by this time so far recovered the younger brother that he was able to give some account of the perilous adventures of the night at sea they were still listening to the boys narrative when francois at last returned it was now gabriel who held out his hand and made the first advances toward reconciliation  to his utter amazement his father recoiled from him the variable temper of francois had evidently changed completely during his absence at the village a settled scowl of distrust darkened his face as he looked at his son  i never shake hands with people who have once doubted me he exclaimed loudly and irritably for i always doubt them forever after you are a bad son you have suspected your father of some infamy that you dare not openly charge him with on no other testimony than the rambling nonsense of a halfwitted dying old man dont speak to me i wont hear you an innocent man and a spy are bad company go and denounce me you judas in disguise i dont care for your secret or for you whats that girl perrine doing here still why hasnt she gone home long ago the priests coming we dont want strangers in the house of death take her back to the farmhouse and stop there with her if you like nobody wants you here  there was something in the manner and look of the speaker as he uttered these words so strange so sinister so indescribably suggestive of his meaning much more than he said that gabriel felt his heart sink within him instantly and almost at the same moment this fearful question forced itself irresistibly on his mind might not his father have followed him to the merchants table  even if he had been desired to speak he could not have spoken now while that question and the suspicion that it brought with it were utterly destroying all the reassuring hopes and convictions of the morning the mental suffering produced by the sudden change from pleasure to pain in all his thoughts reacted on him physically he felt as if he were stifling in the air of the cottage in the presence of his father and when perrine hurried on her walking attire and with a face which alternately flushed and turned pale with every moment approached the door he went out with her as hastily as if he had been flying from his home never had the fresh air and the free daylight felt like heavenly and guardian influences to him until now  he could comfort perrine under his fathers harshness he could assure her of his own affection which no earthly influence could change while they walked together toward the farmhouse but he could do no more he durst not confide to her the subject that was uppermost in his mind of all human beings she was the last to whom he could reveal the terrible secret that was festering at his heart as soon as they got within sight of the farmhouse gabriel stopped and promising to see her again soon took leave of perrine with assumed ease in his manner and with real despair in his heart whatever the poor girl might think of it he felt at that moment that he had not courage to face her father and hear him talk happily and pleasantly as his custom was of perrines approaching marriage  left to himself gabriel wandered hither and thither over the open heath neither knowing nor caring in what direction he turned his steps the doubts about his fathers innocence which had been dissipated by his visit to the merchants table that fathers own language and manner had now revivedhad even confirmed though he dared not yet acknowledge so much to himself it was terrible enough to be obliged to admit that the result of his mornings search was after all not conclusivethat the mystery was in very truth not yet cleared up the violence of his fathers last words of distrust the extraordinary and indescribable changes in his fathers manner while uttering themwhat did these things mean guilt or innocence again was it any longer reasonable to doubt the deathbed confession made by his grandfather was it not on the contrary far more probable that the old mans denial in the morning of his own words at night had been made under the influence of a panic terror when his moral consciousness was bewildered and his intellectual faculties were sinking the longer gabriel thought of these questions the less competentpossibly also the less willinghe felt to answer them should he seek advice from others wiser than he no not while the thousandth part of a chance remained that his father was innocent  this thought was still in his mind when he found himself once more in sight of his home he was still hesitating near the door when he saw it opened cautiously his brother pierre looked out and then came running toward him come in gabriel oh do come in said the boy earnestly we are afraid to be alone with father hes been beating us for talking of you  gabriel went in his father looked up from the hearth where he was sitting muttered the word spy and made a gesture of contempt but did not address a word directly to his son the hours passed on in silence afternoon waned into evening and evening into night and still he never spoke to any of his children soon after it was dark he went out and took his net with him saying that it was better to be alone on the sea than in the house with a spy  when he returned the next morning there was no change in him days passedweeks months even elapsed and still though his manner insensibly became what it used to be toward his other children it never altered toward his eldest son at the rare periods when they now met except when absolutely obliged to speak he preserved total silence in his intercourse with gabriel he would never take gabriel out with him in the boat he would never sit alone with gabriel in the house he would never eat a meal with gabriel he would never let the other children talk to him about gabriel and he would never hear a word in expostulation a word in reference to anything his dead father had said or done on the night of the storm from gabriel himself  the young man pined and changed so that even perrine hardly knew him again under this cruel system of domestic excommunication under the wearing influence of the one unchanging doubt which never left him and more than all under the incessant reproaches of his own conscience aroused by the sense that he was evading a responsibility which it was his solemn his immediate duty to undertake but no sting of conscience no ill treatment at home and no selfreproaches for failing in his duty of confession as a good catholic were powerful enough in their influence over gabriel to make him disclose the secret under the oppression of which his very life was wasting away he knew that if he once revealed it whether his father was ultimately proved to be guilty or innocent there would remain a slur and a suspicion on the family and on perrine besides from her approaching connection with it which in their time and in their generation could never be removed the reproach of the world is terrible even in the crowded city where many of the dwellers in our abidingplace are strangers to usbut it is far more terrible in the country where none near us are strangers where all talk of us and know of us where nothing intervenes between us and the tyranny of the evil tongue gabriel had not courage to face this and dare the fearful chance of lifelong ignominyno not even to serve the sacred interests of justice of atonement and of truth    chapter iv  while gabriel still remained prostrated under the affliction that was wasting his energies of body and mind brittany was visited by a great public calamity in which all private misfortunes were overwhelmed for a while  it was now the time when the evergathering storm of the french revolution had risen to its hurricane climax those chiefs of the new republic were in power whose last worst madness it was to decree the extinction of religion and the overthrow of everything that outwardly symbolized it throughout the whole of the country that they governed already this decree had been executed to the letter in and around paris and now the soldiers of the republic were on their way to brittany headed by commanders whose commission was to root out the christian religion in the last and the surest of the strongholds still left to it in france  these men began their work in a spirit worthy of the worst of their superiors who had sent them to do it they gutted churches they demolished chapels they overthrew roadside crosses wherever they found them the terrible guillotine devoured human lives in the villages of brittany as it had devoured them in the streets of paris the musket and the sword in highway and byway wreaked havoc on the peopleeven on women and children kneeling in the act of prayer the priests were tracked night and day from one hidingplace where they still offered up worship to another and were killed as soon as overtakenevery atrocity was committed in every district but the christian religion still spread wider than the widest bloodshed still sprang up with everrenewed vitality from under the very feet of the men whose vain fury was powerless to trample it down everywhere the people remained true to their faith everywhere the priests stood firm by them in their sorest need the executioners of the republic had been sent to make brittany a country of apostates they did their worst and left it a country of martyrs  one evening while this frightful persecution was still raging gabriel happened to be detained unusually late at the cottage of perrines father he had lately spent much of his time at the farm house it was his only refuge now from that place of suffering of silence and of secret shame which he had once called home just as he had taken leave of perrine for the night and was about to open the farmhouse door her father stopped him and pointed to a chair in the chimneycorner  leave us alone my dear said the old man to his daughter i want to speak to gabriel you can go to your mother in the next room  the words which pere bonanas he was called by the neighborshad now to say in private were destined to lead to very unexpected events after referring to the alteration which had appeared of late in gabriels manner the old man began by asking him sorrowfully but not suspiciously whether he still preserved his old affection for perrine on receiving an eager answer in the affirmative pere bonan then referred to the persecution still raging through the country and to the consequent possibility that he like others of his countrymen might yet be called to suffer and perhaps to die for the cause of his religion if this last act of selfsacrifice were required of him perrine would be left unprotected unless her affianced husband performed his promise to her and assumed without delay the position of her lawful guardian let me know that you will do this concluded the old man i shall be resigned to all that may be required of me if i can only know that i shall not die leaving perrine unprotected gabriel gave the promisegave it with his whole heart as he took leave of pere bonan the old man said to him  come here tomorrow i shall know more then than i know nowi shall be able to fix with certainty the day for the fulfillment of your engagement with perrine  why did gabriel hesitate at the farmhouse door looking back on pere bonan as though he would fain say something and yet not speaking a word why after he had gone out and had walked onward several paces did he suddenly stop return quickly to the farmhouse stand irresolute before the gate and then retrace his steps sighing heavily as he went but never pausing again on his homeward way because the torment of his horrible secret had grown harder to bear than ever since he had given the promise that had been required of him because while a strong impulse moved him frankly to lay bare his hidden dread and doubt to the father whose beloved daughter was soon to be his wife there was a yet stronger passive influence which paralyzed on his lips the terrible confession that he knew not whether he was the son of an honest man or the son of an assassin and a robber made desperate by his situation he determined while he hastened homeward to risk the worst and ask that fatal question of his father in plain words but this supreme trial for parent and child was not to be when he entered the cottage francois was absent he had told the younger children that he should not be home again before noon on the next day  early in the morning gabriel repaired to the farmhouse as he had been bidden influenced by his love for perrine blindly confiding in the faint hope which in despite of heart and conscience he still forced himself to cherish that his father might be innocent he now preserved the appearance at least of perfect calmness if i tell my secret to perrines father i risk disturbing in him that confidence in the future safety of his child for which i am his present and only warrant something like this thought was in gabriels mind as he took the hand of pere bonan and waited anxiously to hear what was required of him on that day  we have a short respite from danger gabriel said the old man news has come to me that the spoilers of our churches and the murderers of our congregations have been stopped on their way hitherward by tidings which have reached them from another district this interval of peace and safety will be a short onewe must take advantage of it while it is yet ours my name is among the names on the list of the denounced if the soldiers of the republic find me herebut we will say nothing more of this it is of perrine and of you that i must now speak on this very evening your marriage may be solemnized with all the wonted rites of our holy religion and the blessing may be pronounced over you by the lips of a priest this evening therefore gabriel you must become the husband and the protector of perrine listen to me attentively and i will tell you how  this was the substance of what gabriel now heard from pere bonan  not very long before the persecutions broke out in brittany a priest known generally by the name of father paul was appointed to a curacy in one of the northern districts of the province he fulfilled all the duties of his station in such a manner as to win the confidence and affection of every member of his congregation and was often spoken of with respect even in parts of the country distant from the scene of his labors it was not however until the troubles broke out and the destruction and bloodshed began that he became renowned far and wide from one end of brittany to another from the date of the very first persecutions the name of father paul was a rallyingcry of the hunted peasantry he was their great encouragement under oppression their example in danger their last and only consoler in the hour of death wherever havoc and ruin raged most fiercely wherever the pursuit was hottest and the slaughter most cruel there the intrepid priest was sure to be seen pursuing his sacred duties in defiance of every peril his hairbreadth escapes from death his extraordinary reappearances in parts of the country where no one ever expected to see him again were regarded by the poorer classes with superstitious awe wherever father paul appeared with his black dress his calm face and the ivory crucifix which he always carried in his hand the people reverenced him as more than mortal and grew at last to believe that singlehanded he would successfully defend his religion against the armies of the republic but their simple confidence in his powers of resistance was soon destined to be shaken fresh reenforcements arrived in brittany and overran the whole province from one end to the other one morning after celebrating service in a dismantled church and after narrowly escaping with his life from those who pursued him the priest disappeared secret inquiries were made after him in all directions but he was heard of no more  many weary days had passed and the dispirited peasantry had already mourned him as dead when some fishermen on the northern coast observed a ship of light burden in the offing making signals to the shore they put off to her in their boats and on reaching the deck saw standing before them the wellremembered figure of father paul  the priest had returned to his congregations and had founded the new altar that they were to worship at on the deck of the ship razed from the face of the earth their church had not been destroyedfor father paul and the priests who acted with him had given that church a refuge on the sea henceforth their children could still be baptized their sons and daughters could still be married the burial of their dead could still be solemnized under the sanction of the old religion for which not vainly they had suffered so patiently and so long  throughout the remaining time of trouble the services were uninterrupted on board the ship a code of signals was established by which those on shore were always enabled to direct their brethren at sea toward such parts of the coast as happened to be uninfested by the enemies of their worship on the morning of gabriels visit to the farmhouse these signals had shaped the course of the ship toward the extremity of the peninsula of quiberon the people of the district were all prepared to expect the appearance of the vessel some time in the evening and had their boats ready at a moments notice to put off and attend the service at the conclusion of this service pere bonan had arranged that the marriage of his daughter and gabriel was to take place  they waited for evening at the farmhouse a little before sunset the ship was signaled as in sight and then pere bonan and his wife followed by gabriel and perrine set forth over the heath to the beach with the solitary exception of francois sarzeau the whole population of the neighborhood was already assembled there gabriels brother and sisters being among the number  it was the calmest evening that had been known for months there was not a cloud in the lustrous skynot a ripple on the still surface of the sea the smallest children were suffered by their mothers to stray down on the beach as they pleased for the waves of the great ocean slept as tenderly and noiselessly on their sandy bed as if they had been changed into the waters of an inland lake slow almost imperceptible was the approach of the shipthere was hardly a breath of wind to carry her onshe was just drifting gently with the landward set of the tide at that hour while her sails hung idly against the masts long after the sun had gone down the congregation still waited and watched on the beach the moon and stars were arrayed in their glory of the night before the ship dropped anchor then the muffled tolling of a bell came solemnly across the quiet waters and then from every creek along the shore as far as the eye could reach the black forms of the fishermens boats shot out swift and stealthy into the shining sea  by the time the boats had arrived alongside of the ship the lamp had been kindled before the altar and its flame was gleaming red and dull in the radiant moonlight two of the priests on board were clothed in their robes of office and were waiting in their appointed places to begin the service but there was a third dressed only in the ordinary attire of his calling who mingled with the congregation and spoke a few words to each of the persons composing it as one by one they mounted the sides of the ship those who had never seen him before knew by the famous ivory crucifix in his hand that the priest who received them was father paul gabriel looked at this man whom he now beheld for the first time with a mixture of astonishment and awe for he saw that the renowned chief of the christians of brittany was to all appearance but little older than himself  the expression on the pale calm face of the priest was so gentle and kind that children just able to walk tottered up to him and held familiarly by the skirts of his black gown whenever his clear blue eyes rested on theirs while he beckoned them to his side no one would ever have guessed from the countenance of father paul what deadly perils he had confronted but for the scar of a saberwound as yet hardly healed which ran across his forehead that wound had been dealt while he was kneeling before the altar in the last church in brittany which had escaped spoliation he would have died where he knelt but for the peasants who were praying with him and who unarmed as they were threw themselves like tigers on the soldiery and at awful sacrifice of their own lives saved the life of their priest there was not a man now on board the ship who would have hesitated had the occasion called for it again to have rescued him in the same way  the service began since the days when the primitive christians worshiped amid the caverns of the earth can any service be imagined nobler in itself or sublimer in the circumstances surrounding it than that which was now offered up here was no artificial pomp no gaudy profusion of ornament no attendant grandeur of mans creation all around this church spread the hushed and awful majesty of the tranquil sea the roof of this cathedral was the immeasurable heaven the pure moon its one great light the countless glories of the stars its only adornment here were no hired singers or rich priestprinces no curious sightseers or careless lovers of sweet sounds this congregation and they who had gathered it together were all poor alike all persecuted alike all worshiping alike to the overthrow of their worldly interests and at the imminent peril of their lives how brightly and tenderly the moonlight shone upon the altar and the people before it how solemnly and divinely the deep harmonies as they chanted the penitential psalms mingled with the hoarse singing of the freshening night breeze in the rigging of the ship how sweetly the still rushing murmur of many voices as they uttered the responses together now died away and now rose again softly into the mysterious night  of all the members of the congregationyoung or oldthere was but one over whom that impressive service exercised no influence of consolation or of peace that one was gabriel often throughout the day his reproaching conscience had spoken within him again and again often when he joined the little assembly on the beach he turned away his face in secret shame and apprehension from perrine and her father vainly after gaining the deck of the ship did he try to meet the eye of father paul as frankly as readily and as affectionately as others met it the burden of concealment seemed too heavy to be borne in the presence of the priestand yet torment as it was he still bore it but when he knelt with the rest of the congregation and saw perrine kneeling by his sidewhen he felt the calmness of the solemn night and the still sea filling his heartwhen the sounds of the first prayers spoke with a dread spiritual language of their own to his soulthen the remembrance of the confession which he had neglected and the terror of receiving unprepared the sacrament which he knew would be offered to himgrew too vivid to be endured the sense that he merited no longer though once worthy of it the confidence in his perfect truth and candor placed in him by the woman with whom he was soon to stand before the altar overwhelmed him with shame the mere act of kneeling among that congregation the passive accomplice by his silence and secrecy for aught he knew to the contrary of a crime which it was his bounden duty to denounce appalled him as if he had already committed sacrilege that could never be forgiven tears flowed down his cheeks though he strove to repress them sobs burst from him though he tried to stifle them he knew that others besides perrine were looking at him in astonishment and alarm but he could neither control himself nor move to leave his place nor raise his eyes evenuntil suddenly he felt a hand laid on his shoulder that touch slight as it was ran through him instantly he looked up and saw father paul standing by his side  beckoning him to follow and signing to the congregation not to suspend their devotions he led gabriel out of the assemblythen paused for a moment reflectingthen beckoning him again took him into the cabin of the ship and closed the door carefully  you have something on your mind he said simply and quietly taking the young man by the hand i may be able to relieve you if you tell me what it is  as gabriel heard these gentle words and saw by the light of a lamp which burned before a cross fixed against the wall the sad kindness of expression with which the priest was regarding him the oppression that had lain so long on his heart seemed to leave it in an instant the haunting fear of ever divulging his fatal suspicions and his fatal secret had vanished as it were at the touch of father pauls hand for the first time he now repeated to another earthe sounds of prayer and praise rising grandly the while from the congregation abovehis grandfathers deathbed confession word for word almost as he had heard it in the cottage on the night of the storm  once and once only did father paul interrupt the narrative which in whispers was addressed to him gabriel had hardly repeated the first two or three sentences of his grandfathers confession when the priest in quick altered tones abruptly asked him his name and place of abode  as the question was answered father pauls calm face became suddenly agitated but the next moment resolutely resuming his selfpossession he bowed his head as a sign that gabriel was to continue clasped his trembling hands and raising them as if in silent prayer fixed his eyes intently on the cross he never looked away from it while the terrible narrative proceeded but when gabriel described his search at the merchants table and referring to his fathers behavior since that time appealed to the priest to know whether he might even yet in defiance of appearances be still filially justified in doubting whether the crime had been really perpetratedthen father paul moved near to him once more and spoke again  compose yourself and look at me he said with his former sad kindness of voice and manner i can end your doubts forever gabriel your father was guilty in intention and in act but the victim of his crime still lives i can prove it  gabriels heart beat wildly a deadly coldness crept over him as he saw father paul loosen the fastening of his cassock round the throat  at that instant the chanting of the congregation above ceased and then the sudden and awful stillness was deepened rather than interrupted by the faint sound of one voice praying slowly and with trembling fingers the priest removed the band round his neckpaused a littlesighed heavilyand pointed to a scar which was now plainly visible on one side of his throat he said something at the same time but the bell above tolled while he spoke it was the signal of the elevation of the host gabriel felt an arm passed round him guiding him to his knees and sustaining him from sinking to the floor for one moment longer he was conscious that the bell had stopped that there was dead silence that father paul was kneeling by him beneath the cross with bowed headthen all objects around vanished and he saw and knew nothing more  when he recovered his senses he was still in the cabin the man whose life his father had attempted was bending over him and sprinkling water on his face and the clear voices of the women and children of the congregation were joining the voices of the men in singing the agnus dei  look up at me without fear gabriel said the priest i desire not to avenge injuries i visit not the sins of the father on the child look up and listen i have strange things to speak of and i have a sacred mission to fulfill before the morning in which you must be my guide  gabriel attempted to kneel and kiss his hand but father paul stopped him and said pointing to the cross kneel to thatnot to me not to your fellowmortal and your friendfor i will be your friend gabriel believing that gods mercy has ordered it so and now listen to me he proceeded with a brotherly tenderness in his manner which went to gabriels heart the service is nearly ended what i have to tell you must be told at once the errand on which you will guide me must be performed before tomorrow dawns sit here near me and attend to what i now say  gabriel obeyed father paul then proceeded thus  i believe the confession made to you by your grandfather to have been true in every particular on the evening to which he referred you i approached your cottage as he said for the purpose of asking shelter for the night at that period i had been studying hard to qualify myself for the holy calling which i now pursue and on the completion of my studies had indulged in the recreation of a tour on foot through brittany by way of innocently and agreeably occupying the leisure time then at my disposal before i entered the priesthood when i accosted your father i had lost my way had been walking for many hours and was glad of any rest that i could get for the night it is unnecessary to pain you now by reference to the events which followed my entrance under your fathers roof i remember nothing that happened from the time when i lay down to sleep before the fire until the time when i recovered my senses at the place which you call the merchants table my first sensation was that of being moved into the cold air when i opened my eyes i saw the great druid stones rising close above me and two men on either side of me rifling my pockets they found nothing valuable there and were about to leave me where i lay when i gathered strength enough to appeal to their mercy through their cupidity money was not scarce with me then and i was able to offer them a rich reward which they ultimately received as i had promised if they would take me to any place where i could get shelter and medical help i supposed they inferred by my language and accentperhaps also by the linen i wore which they examined closelythat i belonged to the higher ranks of the community in spite of the plainness of my outer garments and might therefore be in a position to make good my promise to them i heard one say to the other let us risk it and then they took me in their arms carried me down to a boat on the beach and rowed to a vessel in the offing the next day they disembarked me at paimboeuf where i got the assistance which i so much needed i learned through the confidence they were obliged to place in me in order to give me the means of sending them their promised reward that these men were smugglers and that they were in the habit of using the cavity in which i had been laid as a place of concealment for goods and for letters of advice to their accomplices this accounted for their finding me as to my wound i was informed by the surgeon who attended me that it had missed being inflicted in a mortal part by less than a quarter of an inch and that as it was nothing but the action of the night air in coagulating the blood over the place had in the first instance saved my life to be brief i recovered after a long illness returned to paris and was called to the priesthood the will of my superiors obliged me to perform the first duties of my vocation in the great city but my own wish was to be appointed to a cure of souls in your province gabriel can you imagine why  the answer to this question was in gabriels heart but he was still too deeply awed and affected by what he had heard to give it utterance  i must tell you then what my motive was said father paul you must know first that i uniformly abstained from disclosing to any one where and by whom my life had been attempted i kept this a secret from the men who rescued mefrom the surgeonfrom my own friends even my reason for such a proceeding was i would fain believe a christian reason i hope i had always felt a sincere and humble desire to prove myself by the help of god worthy of the sacred vocation to which i was destined but my miraculous escape from death made an impression on my mind which gave me another and an infinitely higher view of this vocationthe view which i have since striven and shall always strive for the future to maintain as i lay during the first days of my recovery examining my own heart and considering in what manner it would be my duty to act toward your father when i was restored to health a thought came into my mind which calmed comforted and resolved all my doubts i said within myself in a few months more i shall be called to be one of the chosen ministers of god if i am worthy of my vocation my first desire toward this man who has attempted to take my life should be not to know that human justice has overtaken him but to know that he has truly and religiously repented and made atonement for his guilt to such repentance and atonement let it be my duty to call him if he reject that appeal and be hardened only the more against me because i have forgiven him my injuries then it will be time enough to denounce him for his crimes to his fellowmen surely it must be well for me here and hereafter if i begin my career in the holy priesthood by helping to save from hell the soul of the man who of all others has most cruelly wronged me it was for this reason gabrielit was because i desired to go straightway to your fathers cottage and reclaim him after he had believed me to be deadthat i kept the secret and entreated of my superiors that i might be sent to brittany but this as i have said was not to be at first and when my desire was granted my place was assigned me in a far district the persecution under which we still suffer broke out the designs of my life were changed my own will became no longer mine to guide me but through sorrow and suffering and danger and bloodshed i am now led after many days to the execution of that first purpose which i formed on entering the priesthood gabriel when the service is over and the congregation are dispersed you must guide me to the door of your fathers cottage  he held up his hand in sign of silence as gabriel was about to answer just then the officiating priests above were pronouncing the final benediction when it was over father paul opened the cabin door as he ascended the steps followed by gabriel pere bonan met them the old man looked doubtfully and searchingly on his future soninlaw as he respectfully whispered a few words in the ear of the priest father paul listened attentively answered in a whisper and then turned to gabriel first begging the few people near them to withdraw a little  i have been asked whether there is any impediment to your marriage he said and have answered that there is none what you have said to me has been said in confession and is a secret between us two remember that and forget not at the same time the service which i shall require of you tonight after the marriageceremony is over where is perrine bonan he added aloud looking round him perrine came forward father paul took her hand and placed it in gabriels lead her to the altar steps he said and wait there for me  it was more than an hour later the boats had left the ships side the congregation had dispersed over the face of the countrybut still the vessel remained at anchor those who were left in her watched the land more anxiously than usual for they knew that father paul had risked meeting the soldiers of the republic by trusting himself on shore a boat was awaiting his return on the beach half of the crew armed being posted as scouts in various directions on the high land of the heath they would have followed and guarded the priest to the place of his destination but he forbade it and leaving them abruptly walked swiftly onward with one young man only for his companion  gabriel had committed his brother and his sisters to the charge of perrine they were to go to the farmhouse that night with his newlymarried wife and her father and mother father paul had desired that this might be done when gabriel and he were left alone to follow the path which led to the fishermans cottage the priest never spoke while they walked onnever looked aside either to the right or the leftalways held his ivory crucifix clasped to his breast they arrived at the door  knock whispered father paul to gabriel and then wait here with me  the door was opened on a lovely moonlight night francois sarzeau had stood on that threshold years since with a bleeding body in his arms on a lovely moonlight night he now stood there again confronting the very man whose life he had attempted and knowing him not  father paul advanced a few paces so that the moonlight fell fuller on his features and removed his hat  francois sarzeau looked started moved one step back then stood motionless and perfectly silent while all traces of expression of any kind suddenly vanished from his face then the calm clear tones of the priest stole gently on the dead silence i bring a message of peace and forgiveness from a guest of former years he said and pointed as he spoke to the place where he had been wounded in the neck  for one moment gabriel saw his father trembling violently from head to footthen his limbs steadied againstiffened suddenly as if struck by catalepsy his lips parted but without quivering his eyes glared but without moving in the orbits the lovely moonlight itself looked ghastly and horrible shining on the supernatural panic deformity of that face gabriel turned away his head in terror he heard the voice of father paul saying to him wait here till i come back  then there was an instant of silence againthen a low groaning sound that seemed to articulate the name of god a sound unlike his fathers voice unlike any human voice he had ever heardand then the noise of a closing door he looked up and saw that he was standing alone before the cottage  once after an interval he approached the window  he just saw through it the hand of the priest holding on high the ivory crucifix but stopped not to see more for he heard such words such sounds as drove him back to his former place there he stayed until the noise of something falling heavily within the cottage struck on his ear again he advanced toward the door heard father paul praying listened for several minutes then heard a moaning voice now joining itself to the voice of the priest now choked in sobs and bitter wailing once more he went back out of hearing and stirred not again from his place he waited a long and a weary time thereso long that one of the scouts on the lookout came toward him evidently suspicious of the delay in the priests return he waved the man back and then looked again toward the door at last he saw it opensaw father paul approach him leading francois sarzeau by the hand  the fisherman never raised his downcast eyes to his sons face tears trickled silently over his cheeks he followed the hand that led him as a little child might have followed it listened anxiously and humbly at the priests side to every word that he spoke  gabriel said father paul in a voice which trembled a little for the first time that nightgabriel it has pleased god to grant the perfect fulfillment of the purpose which brought me to this place i tell you this as all that you needas all i believe that you would wishto know of what has passed while you have been left waiting for me here such words as i have now to speak to you are spoken by your fathers earnest desire it is his own wish that i should communicate to you his confession of having secretly followed you to the merchants table and of having discovered as you discovered that no evidence of his guilt remained there this admission he thinks will be enough to account for his conduct toward yourself from that time to this i have next to tell you also at your fathers desire that he has promised in my presence and now promises again in yours sincerity of repentance in this manner when the persecution of our religion has ceasedas cease it will and that speedily be assured of ithe solemnly pledges himself henceforth to devote his life his strength and what worldly possessions he may have or may acquire to the task of reerecting and restoring the roadside crosses which have been sacrilegiously overthrown and destroyed in his native province and to doing good go where he may i have now said all that is required of me and may bid you farewellbearing with me the happy remembrance that i have left a father and son reconciled and restored to each other may god bless and prosper you and those dear to you gabriel may god accept your fathers repentance and bless him also throughout his future life  he took their hands pressed them long and warmly then turned and walked quickly down the path which led to the beach gabriel dared not trust himself yet to speak but he raised his arm and put it gently round his fathers neck the two stood together so looking out dimly through the tears that filled their eyes to the sea they saw the boat put off in the bright track of the moonlight and reach the vessels side they watched the spreading of the sails and followed the slow course of the ship till she disappeared past a distant headland from sight  after that they went into the cottage together they knew it not then but they had seen the last in this world of father paul    chapter v  the events foretold by the good priest happened sooner even than he had anticipated a new government ruled the destinies of france and the persecution ceased in brittany  among other propositions which were then submitted to the parliament was one advocating the restoration of the roadside crosses throughout the province it was found however on inquiry that these crosses were to be counted by thousands and that the mere cost of wood required to reerect them necessitated an expenditure of money which the bankrupt nation could ill afford to spare while this project was under discussion and before it was finally rejected one man had undertaken the task which the government shrank from attempting when gabriel left the cottage taking his brother and sisters to live with his wife and himself at the farmhouse francois sarzeau left it also to perform in highway and byway his promise to father paul for months and months he labored without intermission at his task still always doing good and rendering help and kindness and true charity to any whom he could serve he walked many a weary mile toiled through many a hard days work humbled himself even to beg of others to get wood enough to restore a single cross no one ever heard him complain ever saw him impatient ever detected him in faltering at his task the shelter in an outhouse the crust of bread and drink of water which he could always get from the peasantry seemed to suffice him among the people who watched his perseverance a belief began to gain ground that his life would be miraculously prolonged until he had completed his undertaking from one end of brittany to the other but this was not to be  he was seen one cold autumn evening silently and steadily at work as usual setting up a new cross on the site of one which had been shattered to splinters in the troubled times in the morning he was found lying dead beneath the sacred symbol which his own hands had completed and erected in its place during the night they buried him where he lay and the priest who consecrated the ground allowed gabriel to engrave his fathers epitaph in the wood of the cross it was simply the initial letters of the dead mans name followed by this inscription pray for the repose of his soul he died penitent and the doer of good works  once and once only did gabriel hear anything of father paul the good priest showed by writing to the farmhouse that he had not forgotten the family so largely indebted to him for their happiness the letter was dated rome father paul said that such services as he had been permitted to render to the church in brittany had obtained for him a new and a far more glorious trust than any he had yet held he had been recalled from his curacy and appointed to be at the head of a mission which was shortly to be dispatched to convert the inhabitants of a savage and far distant land to the christian faith he now wrote as his brethren with him were writing to take leave of all friends forever in this world before setting outfor it was well known to the chosen persons intrusted with the new mission that they could only hope to advance its object by cheerfully risking their own lives for the sake of their religion he gave his blessing to francois sarzeau to gabriel and to his family and bade them affectionately farewell for the last time  there was a postscript to the letter which was addressed to perrine and which she often read afterward with tearful eyes the writer begged that if she should have any children she would show her friendly and christian remembrance of him by teaching them to pray as he hoped she herself would pray that a blessing might attend father pauls labors in the distant land  the priests loving petition was never forgotten when perrine taught its first prayer to her first child the little creature was instructed to end the few simple words pronounced at its mothers knees with god bless father paul   in those words the nun concluded her narrative after it was ended she pointed to the old wooden cross and said to me  that was one of the many that he made it was found a few years since to have suffered so much from exposure to the weather that it was unfit to remain any longer in its old place a priest in brittany gave it to one of the nuns in this convent do you wonder now that the mother superior always calls it a relic  no i answered and i should have small respect indeed for the religious convictions of any one who could hear the story of that wooden cross and not feel that the mother superiors name for it is the very best that could have been chosen  prologue to the sixth story  on the last occasion when i made a lengthened stay in london my wife and i were surprised and amused one morning by the receipt of the following note addressed to me in a small crabbed foreignlooking handwriting   professor tizzi presents amiable compliments to mr kerby the artist and is desirous of having his portrait done to be engraved from and placed at the beginning of the voluminous work on the vital principle or invisible essence of life which the professor is now preparing for the pressand posterity  the professor will give five pounds and will look upon his face with satisfaction as an object perpetuated for public contemplation at a reasonable rate if mr kerby will accept the sum just mentioned  in regard to the professors ability to pay five pounds as well as to offer them if mr kerby should from ignorance entertain injurious doubts he is requested to apply to the professors honorable friend mr lanfray of rockleigh place  but for the reference at the end of this strange note i should certainly have considered it as a mere trap set to make a fool of me by some mischievous friend as it was i rather doubted the propriety of taking any serious notice of professor tizzis offer and i might probably have ended by putting the letter in the fire without further thought about it but for the arrival by the next post of a note from mr lanfray which solved all my doubts and sent me away at once to make the acquaintance of the learned discoverer of the essence of life  do not be surprised mr lanfray wrote if you get a strange note from a very eccentric italian one professor tizzi formerly of the university of padua i have known him for some years scientific inquiry is his monomania and vanity his ruling passion he has written a book on the principle of life which nobody but himself will ever read but which he is determined to publish with his own portrait for frontispiece if it is worth your while to accept the little he can offer you take it by all means for he is a character worth knowing he was exiled i should tell you years ago for some absurd political reason and has lived in england ever since all the money he inherits from his father who was a mail contractor in the north of italy goes in books and experiments but i think i can answer for his solvency at any rate for the large sum of five pounds if you are not very much occupied just now go and see him he is sure to amuse you  professor tizzi lived in the northern suburb of london on approaching his house i found it so far as outward appearance went excessively dirty and neglected but in no other respect different from the villas in its neighborhood the front garden door after i had rang twice was opened by a yellowfaced suspicious old foreigner dressed in wornout clothes and completely and consistently dirty all over from top to toe on mentioning my name and business this old man led me across a weedy neglected garden and admitted me into the house at the first step into the passage i was surrounded by books closely packed in plain wooden shelves they ran all along the wall on either side to the back of the house and when i looked up at the carpetless staircase i saw nothing but books again running all the way up the wall as far as my eye could reach here is the artist painter cried the old servant throwing open one of the parlor doors before i had half done looking at the books and signing impatiently to me to walk into the room  books again all round the walls and all over the flooramong them a plain deal table with leaves of manuscript piled high on every part of itamong the leaves a head of long elfish white hair covered with a black skullcap and bent down over a bookabove the head a sallow withered hand shaking itself at me as a sign that i must not venture to speak just at that momenton the tops of the bookcases glass vases full of spirits of some kind with horrible objects floating in the liquiddirt on the window panes cobwebs hanging from the ceiling dust springing up in clouds under my intruding feet these were the things i observed on first entering the study of professor tizzi  after i had waited for a minute or so the shaking hand stopped descended with a smack on the nearest pile of manuscript seized the book that the head had been bending over and flung it contemptuously to the other end of the room ive refuted you at any rate said professor tizzi looking with extreme complacency at the cloud of dust raised by the fall of the rejected volume  he turned next to me what a grand face it was what a broad white foreheadwhat fiercely brilliant black eyeswhat perfect regularity and refinement in the other features with the long venerable hair framing them in as it were on either side poor as i was i felt that i could have painted his portrait for nothing titian vandyke valasquezany of the three would have paid him to sit to them  accept my humblest excuses sir said the old man speaking english with a singularly pure accent for a foreigner that absurd book plunged me so deep down in the quagmires of sophistry and error mr kerby that i really could not get to the surface at once when you came into the room so you are willing to draw my likeness for such a small sum as five pounds he continued rising and showing me that he wore a long black velvet gown instead of the paltry and senseless costume of modern times  i informed him that five pounds was as much as i generally got for a drawing  it seems little said the professor but if you want fame i can make it up to you in that way there is my great work he pointed to the piles of manuscript the portrait of my mind and the mirror of my learning put a likeness of my face on the first page and posterity will then be thoroughly acquainted with me outside and in your portrait will be engraved mr kerby and your name shall be inscribed under the print you shall be associated sir in that way with a work which will form an epoch in the history of human science the vital principleor in other words the essence of that mysterious something which we call life and which extends down from man to the feeblest insect and the smallest planthas been an unguessed riddle from the beginning of the world to the present time i alone have found the answer and here it is he fixed his dazzling eyes on me in triumph and smacked the piles of manuscript fiercely with both his sallow hands  i saw that he was waiting for me to say something so i asked if his great work had not cost a vast expenditure of time and pains  i am seventy sir said the professor and i began preparing myself for that book at twenty after mature consideration i have written it in english having three other foreign languages at my fingers ends as a substantial proof of my gratitude to the nation that has given me an asylum perhaps you think the work looks rather long in its manuscript state it will occupy twelve volumes sir and it is not half long enough even then for the subject i take two volumes and no man could do it in less to examine the theories of all the philosophers in the world ancient and modern on the vital principle i take two more and little enough to scatter every one of the theories seriatim to the winds i take two more at the risk for brevitys sake of doing things by halves to explain the exact stuff or vital compound of which the first man and woman in the world were madecalling them adam and eve out of deference to popular prejudices i take two morebut you are standing all this time mr kerby and i am talking instead of sitting for my portrait pray take any books you want anywhere off the floor and make a seat of any height you please furniture would only be in my way here so i dont trouble myself with anything of the kind  i obediently followed the professors directions and had just heaped up a pile of grimy quartos when the old servant entered the room with a shabby little tray in his hand in the middle of the tray i saw a crust of bread and a bit of garlic encircled by a glass of water a knife salt pepper a bottle of vinegar and a flask of oil  with your permission i am going to breakfast said professor tizzi as the tray was set down before him on the part of his great work relating to the vital compound of adam and eve as he spoke he took up the piece of bread and rubbed the crusty part of it with the bit of garlic till it looked as polished as a new diningtable that done he turned the bread crumb uppermost and saturated it with oil added a few drops of vinegar sprinkled with pepper and salt and with a gleam of something very like greediness in his bright eyes took up the knife to cut himself a first mouthful of the horrible mess that he had just concocted the best of breakfasts said the professor seeing me look amazed not a cannibal meal of chickenlife in embryo vulgarly called an egg not a dogs gorge of a dead animals flesh blood and bones warmed with fire popularly known as a chop not a breakfast sir that lions tigers caribbees and costermongers could all partake of alike but an innocent nutritive simple vegetable meal a philosophers refection a breakfast that a prizefighter would turn from in disgust and that a plato would share with relish  i have no doubt that he was right and that i was prejudiced but as i saw the first oily vinegary garlicky morsel slide noiselessly into his mouth i began to feel rather sick my hands were dirty with moving the books and i asked if i could wash them before beginning to work at the likeness as a good excuse for getting out of the room while professor tizzi was unctuously disposing of his simple vegetable meal  the philosopher looked a little astonished at my request as if the washing of hands at irregular times and seasons offered a comparatively new subject of contemplation to him but he rang a handbell on his table immediately and told the old servant to take me up into his bedroom  the interior of the parlor had astonished me but a sight of the bedroom was a new sensationnot of the most agreeable kind the couch on which the philosopher sought repose after his labors was a trucklebed that would not have fetched half a crown at a sale on one side of it dangled from the ceiling a complete male skeleton looking like all that was left of a man who might have hung himself about a century ago and who had never been disturbed since the moment of his suicide on the other side of the bed stood a long press in which i observed hideous colored preparations of the muscular system and bottles with curious twining threadlike substances inside them which might have been remarkable worms or dissections of nerves scattered amicably side by side with the professors hairbrush three parts worn out with remnants of his beard on bits of shavingpaper with a broken shoehorn and with a traveling lookingglass of the sort usually sold at sixpence apiece repetitions of the litter of books in the parlor lay all about over the floor colored anatomical prints were nailed anyhow against the walls rolledup towels were scattered here there and everywhere in the wildest confusion as if the room had been bombarded with them and last but by no means least remarkable among the other extraordinary objects in the bedchamber the stuffed figure of a large unshaven poodledog stood on an old cardtable keeping perpetual watch over a pair of the philosophers black breeches twisted round his forepaws  i had started on entering the room at the skeleton and i started once more at the dog the old servant noticed me each time with a sardonic grin dont be afraid he said one is as dead as the other with these words he left me to wash my hands  finding little more than a pint of water at my disposal and failing altogether to discover where the soap was kept i was not long in performing my ablutions before leaving the room i looked again at the stuffed poodle on the board to which he was fixed i saw painted in faded letters the word scarammuccia evidently the comic italian name to which he had answered in his lifetime there was no other inscription but i made up my mind that the dog must have been the professors pet and that he kept the animal stuffed in his bedroom as a remembrance of past times who would have suspected so great a philosopher of having so much heart thought i leaving the bedroom to go downstairs again  the professor had done his breakfast and was anxious to begin the sitting so i took out my chalks and paper and set to work at oncei seated on one pile of books and he on another  fine anatomical preparations in my room are there not mr kerby said the old gentleman did you notice a very interesting and perfect arrangement of the intestinal ganglia they form the subject of an important chapter in my great work  i am afraid you will think me very ignorant i replied but i really do not know the intestinal ganglia when i see them the object i noticed with most curiosity in your room was something more on a level with my own small capacity  and what was that asked the professor  the figure of the stuffed poodle i suppose he was a favorite of yours  of mine no no a young womans favorite sir before i was born and a very remarkable dog too the vital principle in that poodle mr kerby must have been singularly intensified he lived to a fabulous old age and he was clever enough to play an important part of his own in what you english call a romance of real life if i could only have dissected that poodle i would have put him into my book he should have headed my chapter on the vital principle of beasts  here is a story in prospect thought i if i can only keep his attention up to the subject  he should have figured in my great work sir the professor went on scarammuccia should have taken his place among the examples that prove my new theory but unfortunately he died before i was born his mistress gave him stuffed as you see upstairs to my father to take care of for her and he has descended as an heirloom to me talking of dogs mr kerby i have ascertained beyond the possibility of doubt that the brachial plexus in people who die of hydrophobiabut stop i had better show you how it isthe preparation is upstairs under my washhand stand  he left his seat as he spoke in another minute he would have sent the servant to fetch the preparation and i should have lost the story at the risk of his taking offense i begged him not to move just then unless he wished me to spoil his likeness this alarmed but fortunately did not irritate him he returned to his seat and i resumed the subject of the stuffed poodle asking him boldly to tell me the story with which the dog was connected the demand seemed to impress him with no very favorable opinion of my intellectual tastes but he complied with it and related not without many a wearisome digression to the subject of his great work the narrative which i propose calling by the name of the yellow mask after the slight specimens that i have given of his character and style of conversation it will be almost unnecessary for me to premise that i tell this story as i have told the last and sister rose in my own language and according to my own plan in the disposition of the incidentsadding nothing of course to the facts but keeping them within the limits which my disposable space prescribes to me  i may perhaps be allowed to add in this place that i have not yet seen or heard of my portrait in an engraved state professor tizzi is still alive but i look in vain through the publishers lists for an announcement of his learned work on the vital principle possibly he may be adding a volume or two to the twelve already completed by way of increasing the debt which a deeply obliged posterity is sooner or later sure of owing to him     the professors story of the yellow mask     part first    chapter i  about a century ago there lived in the ancient city of pisa a famous italian milliner who by way of vindicating to all customers her familiarity with paris fashions adopted a french title and called herself the demoiselle grifoni she was a wizen little woman with a mischievous face a quick tongue a nimble foot a talent for business and an uncertain disposition rumor hinted that she was immensely rich and scandal suggested that she would do anything for money  the one undeniable good quality which raised demoiselle grifoni above all her rivals in the trade was her inexhaustible fortitude she was never known to yield an inch under any pressure of adverse circumstances thus the memorable occasion of her life on which she was threatened with ruin was also the occasion on which she most triumphantly asserted the energy and decision of her character at the height of the demoiselles prosperity her skilled forewoman and cutterout basely married and started in business as her rival such a calamity as this would have ruined an ordinary milliner but the invincible grifoni rose superior to it almost without an effort and proved incontestably that it was impossible for hostile fortune to catch her at the end of her resources while the minor milliners were prophesying that she would shut up shop she was quietly carrying on a private correspondence with an agent in paris nobody knew what these letters were about until a few weeks had elapsed and then circulars were received by all the ladies in pisa announcing that the best french forewoman who could be got for money was engaged to superintend the great grifoni establishment this masterstroke decided the victory all the demoiselles customers declined giving orders elsewhere until the forewoman from paris had exhibited to the natives of pisa the latest fashions from the metropolis of the world of dress  the frenchwoman arrived punctual to the appointed dayglib and curt smiling and flippant tight of face and supple of figure her name was mademoiselle virginie and her family had inhumanly deserted her she was set to work the moment she was inside the doors of the grifoni establishment a room was devoted to her own private use magnificent materials in velvet silk and satin with due accompaniment of muslins laces and ribbons were placed at her disposal she was told to spare no expense and to produce in the shortest possible time the finest and nearest specimen dresses for exhibition in the showroom mademoiselle virginie undertook to do everything required of her produced her portfolios of patterns and her book of colored designs and asked for one assistant who could speak french enough to interpret her orders to the italian girls in the workroom  i have the very person you want cried demoiselle grifoni a workwoman we call brigida herethe idlest slut in pisa but as sharp as a needlehas been in france and speaks the language like a native ill send her to you directly  mademoiselle virginie was not left long alone with her patterns and silks a tall woman with bold black eyes a reckless manner and a step as firm as a mans stalked into the room with the gait of a tragedyqueen crossing the stage the instant her eyes fell on the french forewoman she stopped threw up her hands in astonishment and exclaimed finette  teresa cried the frenchwoman casting her scissors on the table and advancing a few steps  hush call me brigida  hush call me virginie  these two exclamations were uttered at the same moment and then the two women scrutinized each other in silence the swarthy cheeks of the italian turned to a dull yellow and the voice of the frenchwoman trembled a little when she spoke again  how in the name of heaven have you dropped down in the world as low as this she asked i thought you were provided for when  silence interrupted brigida you see i was not provided for i have had my misfortunes and you are the last woman alive who ought to refer to them  do you think i have not had my misfortunes too since we met brigidas face brightened maliciously at those words you have had your revenge continued mademoiselle virginie coldly turning away to the table and taking up the scissors again  brigida followed her threw one arm roughly round her neck and kissed her on the cheek let us be friends again she said the frenchwoman laughed tell me how i have had my revenge pursued the other tightening her grasp mademoiselle virginie signed to brigida to stoop and whispered rapidly in her ear the italian listened eagerly with fierce suspicious eyes fixed on the door when the whispering ceased she loosened her hold and with a sigh of relief pushed back her heavy black hair from her temples now we are friends she said and sat down indolently in a chair placed by the worktable  friends repeated mademoiselle virginie with another laugh and now for business she continued getting a row of pins ready for use by putting them between her teeth i am here i believe for the purpose of ruining the late forewoman who has set up in opposition to us good i will ruin her spread out the yellow brocaded silk my dear and pin that pattern on at your end while i pin at mine and what are your plans brigida mind you dont forget that finette is dead and that virginie has risen from her ashes you cant possibly intend to stop here all your life leave an inch outside the paper all round you must have projects what are they  look at my figure said brigida placing herself in an attitude in the middle of the room  ah rejoined the other its not what it was theres too much of it you want diet walking and a french staymaker muttered mademoiselle virginie through her chevausdefrise of pins  did the goddess minerva walk and employ a french staymaker i thought she rode upon clouds and lived at a period before waists were invented  what do you mean  thisthat my present project is to try if i cant make my fortune by sitting as a model for minerva in the studio of the best sculptor in pisa  and who is he unwind me a yard or two of that black lace  the mastersculptor luca lomian old family once noble but down in the world now the master is obliged to make statues to get a living for his daughter and himself  more of the lacedouble it over the bosom of the dress and how is sitting to this needy sculptor to make your fortune  wait a minute there are other sculptors besides him in the studio there is first his brother the priestfather rocco who passes all his spare time with the master he is a good sculptor in his wayhas cast statues and made a font for his churcha holy man who devotes all his work in the studio to the cause of piety  ah bah we should think him a droll priest in france more pins you dont expect him to put money in your pocket surely  wait i say again there is a third sculptor in the studioactually a nobleman his name is fabio dascoli he is rich young handsome an only child and little better than a fool fancy his working at sculpture as if he had his bread to get by itand thinking that an amusement imagine a man belonging to one of the best families in pisa mad enough to want to make a reputation as an artist wait wait the best is to come his father and mother are deadhe has no near relations in the world to exercise authority over himhe is a bachelor and his fortune is all at his own disposal going abegging my friend absolutely going abegging for want of a clever woman to hold out her hand and take it from him  yes yesnow i understand the goddess minerva is a clever woman and she will hold out her hand and take his fortune from him with the utmost docility  the first thing is to get him to offer it i must tell you that i am not going to sit to him but to his master luca lomi who is doing the statue of minerva the face is modeled from his daughter and now he wants somebody to sit for the bust and arms maddalena lomi and i are as nearly as possible the same height i hearthe difference between us being that i have a good figure and she has a bad one i have offered to sit through a friend who is employed in the studio if the master accepts i am sure of an introduction to our rich young gentleman and then leave it to my good looks my various accomplishments and my ready tongue to do the rest  stop i wont have the lace doubled on second thoughts ill have it single and running all round the dress in curvesso well and who is this friend of yours employed in the studio a fourth sculptor  no no the strangest simplest little creature  just then a faint tap was audible at the door of the room  brigida laid her finger on her lips and called impatiently to the person outside to come in  the door opened gently and a young girl poorly but very neatly dressed entered the room she was rather thin and under the average height but her head and figure were in perfect proportion her hair was of that gorgeous auburn color her eyes of that deep violetblue which the portraits of giorgione and titian have made famous as the type of venetian beauty her features possessed the definiteness and regularity the good modeling to use an artists term which is the rarest of all womanly charms in italy as elsewhere the one serious defect of her face was its paleness her cheeks wanting nothing in form wanted everything in color that look of health which is the essential crowningpoint of beauty was the one attraction which her face did not possess  she came into the room with a sad and weary expression in her eyes which changed however the moment she observed the magnificentlydressed french forewoman into a look of astonishment and almost of awe her manner became shy and embarrassed and after an instant of hesitation she turned back silently to the door  stop stop nanina said brigida in italian dont be afraid of that lady she is our new forewoman and she has it in her power to do all sorts of kind things for you look up and tell us what you want you were sixteen last birthday nanina and you behave like a baby of two years old  i only came to know if there was any work for me today said the girl in a very sweet voice that trembled a little as she tried to face the fashionable french forewoman again  no work child that is easy enough for you to do said brigida are you going to the studio today  some of the color that naninas cheeks wanted began to steal over them as she answered yes  dont forget my message darling and if master luca lomi asks where i live answer that you are ready to deliver a letter to me but that you are forbidden to enter into any particulars at first about who i am or where i live  why am i forbidden inquired nanina innocently  dont ask questions baby do as you are told bring me back a nice note or message tomorrow from the studio and i will intercede with this lady to get you some work you are a foolish child to want it when you might make more money here and at florence by sitting to painters and sculptors though what they can see to paint or model in you i never could understand  i like working at home better than going abroad to sit said nanina looking very much abashed as she faltered out the answer and escaping from the room with a terrified farewell obeisance which was an eccentric compound of a start a bow and a courtesy  that awkward child would be pretty said mademoiselle virginie making rapid progress with the cuttingout of her dress if she knew how to give herself a complexion and had a presentable gown on her back who is she  the friend who is to get me into master luca lomis studio replied brigida laughing rather a curious ally for me to take up with isnt she  where did you meet with her  here to be sure she hangs about this place for any plain work she can get to do and takes it home to the oddest little room in a street near the campo santo i had the curiosity to follow her one day and knocked at her door soon after she had gone in as if i was a visitor she answered my knock in a great flurry and fright as you may imagine i made myself agreeable affected immense interest in her affairs and so got into her room such a place a mere corner of it curtained off to make a bedroom one chair one stool one saucepan on the fire before the hearth the most grotesquely hideous unshaven poodledog you ever saw and on the stool a fair little girl plaiting dinnermats such was the householdfurniture and all included where is your father i asked he ran away and left us years ago answers my awkward little friend who has just left the room speaking in that simple way of hers with all the composure in the world and your motherdead she went up to the little matplaiting girl as she gave that answer and began playing with her long flaxen hair your sister i suppose said i what is her namethey call me la biondella says the child looking up from her mat la biondella virginie means the fair and why do you let that great shaggy illlooking brute lie before your fireplace i asked oh cried the little matplaiter that is our dear old dog scarammuccia he takes care of the house when nanina is not at home he dances on his hind legs and jumps through a hoop and tumbles down dead when i cry bang scarammuccia followed us home one night years ago and he has lived with us ever since he goes out every day by himself we cant tell where and generally returns licking his chops which makes us afraid that he is a thief but nobody finds him out because he is the cleverest dog that ever lived the child ran on in this way about the great beast by the fireplace till i was obliged to stop her while that simpleton nanina stood by laughing and encouraging her i asked them a few more questions which produced some strange answers they did not seem to know of any relations of theirs in the world the neighbors in the house had helped them after their father ran away until they were old enough to help themselves and they did not seem to think there was anything in the least wretched or pitiable in their way of living the last thing i heard when i left them that day was la biondella crying bangthen a bark a thump on the floor and a scream of laughter if it was not for their dog i should go and see them oftener but the illconditioned beast has taken a dislike to me and growls and shows his teeth whenever i come near him  the girl looked sickly when she came in here is she always like that  no she has altered within the last month i suspect our interesting young nobleman has produced an impression the oftener the girl has sat to him lately the paler and more out of spirits she has become  oh she has sat to him has she  she is sitting to him now he is doing a bust of some pagan nymph or other and prevailed on nanina to let him copy from her head and face according to her own account the little fool was frightened at first and gave him all the trouble in the world before she would consent  and now she has consented dont you think it likely she may turn out rather a dangerous rival men are such fools and take such fancies into their heads  ridiculous a threadpaper of a girl like that who has no manner no talk no intelligence who has nothing to recommend her but an awkward babyish prettiness dangerous to me no no if there is danger at all i have to dread it from the sculptors daughter i dont mind confessing that i am anxious to see maddalena lomi but as for nanina she will simply be of use to me all i know already about the studio and the artists in it i know through her she will deliver my message and procure me my introduction and when we have got so far i shall give her an old gown and a shake of the hand and then goodby to our little innocent  well well for your sake i hope you are the wiser of the two in this matter for my part i always distrust innocence wait one moment and i shall have the body and sleeves of this dress ready for the needlewomen there ring the bell and order them up for i have directions to give and you must interpret for me  while brigida went to the bell the energetic frenchwoman began planning out the skirt of the new dress she laughed as she measured off yard after yard of the silk  what are you laughing about asked brigida opening the door and ringing a handbell in the passage  i cant help fancying dear in spite of her innocent face and her artless ways that your young friend is a hypocrite  and i am quite certain love that she is only a simpleton    chapter ii  the studio of the mastersculptor luca lomi was composed of two large rooms unequally divided by a wooden partition with an arched doorway cut in the middle of it  while the milliners of the grifoni establishment were industriously shaping dresses the sculptors in luca lomis workshop were in their way quite as hard at work shaping marble and clay in the smaller of the two rooms the young nobleman only addressed in the studio by his christian name of fabio was busily engaged on his bust with nanina sitting before him as a model his was not one of those traditional italian faces from which subtlety and suspicion are always supposed to look out darkly on the world at large both countenance and expression proclaimed his character frankly and freely to all who saw him quick intelligence looked brightly from his eyes and easy good humor laughed out pleasantly in the rather quaint curve of his lips for the rest his face expressed the defects as well as the merits of his character showing that he wanted resolution and perseverance just as plainly as it showed also that he possessed amiability and intelligence  at the end of the large room nearest to the street door luca lomi was standing by his lifesize statue of minerva and was issuing directions from time to time to some of his workmen who were roughly chiseling the drapery of another figure at the opposite side of the room nearest to the partition his brother father rocco was taking a cast from a statuette of the madonna while maddalena lomi the sculptors daughter released from sitting for minervas face walked about the two rooms and watched what was going on in them  there was a strong family likeness of a certain kind between father brother and daughter all three were tall handsome darkhaired and darkeyed nevertheless they differed in expression strikingly as they resembled one another in feature maddalena lomis face betrayed strong passions but not an ungenerous nature her father with the same indications of a violent temper had some sinister lines about his mouth and forehead which suggested anything rather than an open disposition father roccos countenance on the other hand looked like the personification of absolute calmness and invincible moderation and his manner which in a very firm way was singularly quiet and deliberate assisted in carrying out the impression produced by his face the daughter seemed as if she could fly into a passion at a moments notice and forgive also at a moments notice the father appearing to be just as irritable had something in his face which said as plainly as if in words anger me and i never pardon the priest looked as if he need never be called on either to ask forgiveness or to grant it for the double reason that he could irritate nobody else and that nobody else could irritate him  rocco said luca looking at the face of his minerva which was now finished this statue of mine will make a sensation  i am glad to hear it rejoined the priest dryly  it is a new thing in art continued luca enthusiastically other sculptors with a classical subject like mine limit themselves to the ideal classical face and never think of aiming at individual character now i do precisely the reverse of that i get my handsome daughter maddalena to sit for minerva and i make an exact likeness of her i may lose in ideal beauty but i gain in individual character people may accuse me of disregarding established rules but my answer is that i make my own rules my daughter looks like a minerva and there she is exactly as she looks  it is certainly a wonderful likeness said father rocco approaching the statue  it the girl herself cried the other exactly her expression and exactly her features measure maddalena and measure minerva and from forehead to chin you wont find a hairbreadth of difference between them  but how about the bust and arms of the figure now the face is done asked the priest returning as he spoke to his own work  i may have the very model i want for them tomorrow little nanina has just given me the strangest message what do you think of a mysterious lady admirer who offers to sit for the bust and arms of my minerva  are you going to accept the offer inquired the priest  i am going to receive her tomorrow and if i really find that she is the same height as maddalena and has a bust and arms worth modeling of course i shall accept her offer for she will be the very sitter i have been looking after for weeks past who can she be thats the mystery i want to find out which do you say roccoan enthusiast or an adventuress  i do not presume to say for i have no means of knowing  ah there you are with your moderation again now i do presume to assert that she must be either one or the otheror she would not have forbidden nanina to say anything about her in answer to all my first natural inquiries where is maddalena i thought she was here a minute ago  she is in fabios room answered father rocco softly shall i call her  no no returned luca he stopped looked round at the workmen who were chipping away mechanically at their bit of drapery then advanced close to the priest with a cunning smile and continued in a whisper if maddalena can only get from fabios room here to fabios palace over the way on the arnocome come rocco dont shake your head if i brought her up to your church door one of these days as fabio dascolis betrothed you would be glad enough to take the rest of the business off my hands and make her fabio dascolis wife you are a very holy man rocco but you know the difference between the clink of the moneybag and the clink of the chisel for all that  i am sorry to find luca returned the priest coldly that you allow yourself to talk of the most delicate subjects in the coarsest way this is one of the minor sins of the tongue which is growing on you when we are alone in the studio i will endeavor to lead you into speaking of the young man in the room there and of your daughter in terms more becoming to you to me and to them until that time allow me to go on with my work  luca shrugged his shoulders and went back to his statue father rocco who had been engaged during the last ten minutes in mixing wet plaster to the right consistency for taking a cast suspended his occupation and crossing the room to a corner next the partition removed from it a chevalglass which stood there he lifted it away gently while his brothers back was turned carried it close to the table at which he had been at work and then resumed his employment of mixing the plaster having at last prepared the composition for use he laid it over the exposed half of the statuette with a neatness and dexterity which showed him to be a practiced hand at casttaking just as he had covered the necessary extent of surface luca turned round from his statue  how are you getting on with the cast he asked do you want any help  none brother i thank you answered the priest pray do not disturb either yourself or your workmen on my account  luca turned again to the statue and at the same moment father rocco softly moved the chevalglass toward the open doorway between the two rooms placing it at such an angle as to make it reflect the figures of the persons in the smaller studio he did this with significant quickness and precision it was evidently not the first time he had used the glass for purposes of secret observation  mechanically stirring the wet plaster round and round for the second casting the priest looked into the glass and saw as in a picture all that was going forward in the inner room maddalena lomi was standing behind the young nobleman watching the progress he made with his bust occasionally she took the modeling tool out of his hand and showed him with her sweetest smile that she too as a sculptors daughter understood something of the sculptors art and now and then in the pauses of the conversation when her interest was especially intense in fabios work she suffered her hand to drop absently on his shoulder or stooped forward so close to him that her hair mingled for a moment with his moving the glass an inch or two so as to bring nanina well under his eye father rocco found that he could trace each repetition of these little acts of familiarity by the immediate effect which they produced on the girls face and manner whenever maddalena so much as touched the young noblemanno matter whether she did so by premeditation or really by accidentnaninas features contracted her pale cheeks grew paler she fidgeted on her chair and her fingers nervously twisted and untwisted the loose ends of the ribbon fastened round her waist  jealous thought father rocco i suspected it weeks ago  he turned away and gave his whole attention for a few minutes to the mixing of the plaster when he looked back again at the glass he was just in time to witness a little accident which suddenly changed the relative positions of the three persons in the inner room  he saw maddalena take up a modeling tool which lay on a table near her and begin to help fabio in altering the arrangement of the hair in his bust the young man watched what she was doing earnestly enough for a few moments then his attention wandered away to nanina she looked at him reproachfully and he answered by a sign which brought a smile to her face directly maddalena surprised her at the instant of the change and following the direction of her eyes easily discovered at whom the smile was directed she darted a glance of contempt at nanina threw down the modeling tool and turned indignantly to the young sculptor who was affecting to be hard at work again  signor fabio she said the next time you forget what is due to your rank and yourself warn me of it if you please beforehand and i will take care to leave the room while speaking the last words she passed through the doorway father rocco bending abstractedly over his plaster mixture heard her continue to herself in a whisper as she went by him if i have any influence at all with my father that impudent beggargirl shall be forbidden the studio  jealousy on the other side thought the priest something must be done at once or this will end badly  he looked again at the glass and saw fabio after an instant of hesitation beckon to nanina to approach him she left her seat advanced halfway to his then stopped he stepped forward to meet her and taking her by the hand whispered earnestly in her ear when he had done before dropping her hand he touched her cheek with his lips and then helped her on with the little white mantilla which covered her head and shoulders outofdoors the girl trembled violently and drew the linen close to her face as fabio walked into the larger studio and addressing father rocco said  i am afraid i am more idle or more stupid than ever today i cant get on with the bust at all to my satisfaction so i have cut short the sitting and given nanina a halfholiday  at the first sound of his voice maddalena who was speaking to her father stopped and with another look of scorn at nanina standing trembling in the doorway left the room luca lomi called fabio to him as she went away and father rocco turning to the statuette looked to see how the plaster was hardening on it seeing them thus engaged nanina attempted to escape from the studio without being noticed but the priest stopped her just as she was hurrying by him  my child said he in his gentle quiet way are you going home  naninas heart beat too fast for her to reply in words she could only answer by bowing her head  take this for your little sister pursued father rocco putting a few silver coins in her hand i have got some customers for those mats she plaits so nicely you need not bring them to my rooms i will come and see you this evening when i am going my rounds among my parishioners and will take the mats away with me you are a good girl naninayou have always been a good girland as long as i am alive my child you shall never want a friend and an adviser  naninas eyes filled with tears she drew the mantilla closer than ever round her face as she tried to thank the priest father rocco nodded to her kindly and laid his hand lightly on her head for a moment then turned round again to his cast  dont forget my message to the lady who is to sit to me tomorrow said luca to nanina as she passed him on her way out of the studio  after she had gone fabio returned to the priest who was still busy over his cast  i hope you will get on better with the bust tomorrow said father rocco politely i am sure you cannot complain of your model  complain of her cried the young man warmly she has the most beautiful head i ever saw if i were twenty times the sculptor that i am i should despair of being able to do her justice  he walked into the inner room to look at his bust againlingered before it for a little whileand then turned to retrace his steps to the larger studio between him and the doorway stood three chairs as he went by them he absently touched the backs of the first two and passed the third but just as he was entering the larger room stopped as if struck by a sudden recollection returned hastily and touched the third chair raising his eyes as he approached the large studio again after doing this he met the eyes of the priest fixed on him in unconcealed astonishment  signor fabio exclaimed father rocco with a sarcastic smile who would ever have imagined that you were superstitious  my nurse was returned the young man reddening and laughing rather uneasily she taught me some bad habits that i have not got over yet with those words he nodded and hastily went out  superstitious said father rocco softly to himself he smiled again reflected for a moment and then going to the window looked into the street the way to the left led to fabios palace and the way to the right to the campo santo in the neighborhood of which nanina lived the priest was just in time to see the young sculptor take the way to the right  after another halfhour had elapsed the two workmen quitted the studio to go to dinner and luca and his brother were left alone  we may return now said father rocco to that conversation which was suspended between us earlier in the day  i have nothing more to say rejoined luca sulkily  then you can listen to me brother with the greater attention pursued the priest i objected to the coarseness of your tone in talking of our young pupil and your daughter i object still more strongly to your insinuation that my desire to see them married provided always that they are sincerely attached to each other springs from a mercenary motive  you are trying to snare me rocco in a mesh of fine phrases but i am not to be caught i know what my own motive is for hoping that maddalena may get an offer of marriage from this wealthy young gentlemanshe will have his money and we shall all profit by it that is coarse and mercenary if you please but it is the true reason why i want to see maddalena married to fabio you want to see it tooand for what reason i should like to know if not for mine  of what use would wealthy relations be to me what are people with moneywhat is money itselfto a man who follows my calling  money is something to everybody  is it when have you found that i have taken any account of it give me money enough to buy my daily bread and to pay for my lodging and my coarse cassock and though i may want much for the poor for myself i want no more then have you found me mercenary do i not help you in this studio for love of you and of the art without exacting so much as journeymans wages have i ever asked you for more than a few crowns to give away on feastdays among my parishioners money money for a man who may be summoned to rome tomorrow who may be told to go at half an hours notice on a foreign mission that may take him to the ends of the earth and who would be ready to go the moment when he was called on money to a man who has no wife no children no interests outside the sacred circle of the church brother do you see the dust and dirt and shapeless marble chips lying around your statue there cover that floor instead with gold and though the litter may have changed in color and form in my eyes it would be litter still  a very noble sentiment i dare say rocco but i cant echo it granting that you care nothing for money will you explain to me why you are so anxious that maddalena should marry fabio she has had offers from poorer menyou knew of thembut you have never taken the least interest in her accepting or rejecting a proposal before  i hinted the reason to you months ago when fabio first entered the studio  it was rather a vague hint brother cant you be plainer today  i think i can in the first place let me begin by assuring you that i have no objection to the young man himself he may be a little capricious and undecided but he has no incorrigible faults that i have discovered  that is rather a cool way of praising him rocco  i should speak of him warmly enough if he were not the representative of an intolerable corruption and a monstrous wrong whenever i think of him i think of an injury which his present existence perpetuates and if i do speak of him coldly it is only for that reason  luca looked away quickly from his brother and began kicking absently at the marble chips which were scattered over the floor around him  i now remember he said what that hint of yours pointed at i know what you mean  then you know answered the priest that while part of the wealth which fabio dascoli possesses is honestly and incontestably his own part also has been inherited by him from the spoilers and robbers of the church  blame his ancestors for that dont blame him  i blame him as long as the spoil is not restored  how do you know that it was spoil after all  i have examined more carefully than most men the records of the civil wars in italy and i know that the ancestors of fabio dascoli wrung from the church in her hour of weakness property which they dared to claim as their right i know of titles to lands signed away in those stormy times under the influence of fear or through false representations of which the law takes no account i call the money thus obtained spoil and i say that it ought to be restored and shall be restored to the church from which it was taken  and what does fabio answer to that brother  i have not spoken to him on the subject  why not  because i have as yet no influence over him when he is married his wife will have influence over him and she shall speak  maddalena i suppose how do you know that she will speak  have i not educated her does she not understand what her duties are toward the church in whose bosom she has been reared  luca hesitated uneasily and walked away a step or two before he spoke again  does this spoil as you call it amount to a large sum of money he asked in an anxious whisper  i may answer that question luca at some future time said the priest for the present let it be enough that you are acquainted with all i undertook to inform you of when we began our conversation you now know that if i am anxious for this marriage to take place it is from motives entirely unconnected with selfinterest if all the property which fabios ancestors wrongfully obtained from the church were restored to the church tomorrow not one paulo of it would go into my pocket i am a poor priest now and to the end of my days shall remain so you soldiers of the world brother fight for your pay i am a soldier of the church and i fight for my cause  saying these words he returned abruptly to the statuette and refused to speak or leave his employment again until he had taken the mold off and had carefully put away the various fragments of which it consisted this done he drew a writingdesk from the drawer of his workingtable and taking out a slip of paper wrote these lines   come down to the studio tomorrow fabio will be with us but nanina will return no more   without signing what he had written he sealed it up and directed it to donna maddalena then took his hat and handed the note to his brother  oblige me by giving that to my niece he said  tell me rocco said luca turning the note round and round perplexedly between his finger and thumb do you think maddalena will be lucky enough to get married to fabio  still coarse in your expressions brother  never mind my expressions is it likely  yes luca i think it is likely  with those words he waved his hand pleasantly to his brother and went out    chapter iii  from the studio father rocco went straight to his own rooms hard by the church to which he was attached opening a cabinet in his study he took from one of its drawers a handful of small silver money consulted for a minute or so a slate on which several names and addresses were written provided himself with a portable inkhorn and some strips of paper and again went out  he directed his steps to the poorest part of the neighborhood and entering some very wretched houses was greeted by the inhabitants with great respect and affection the women especially kissed his hands with more reverence than they would have shown to the highest crowned head in europe in return he talked to them as easily and unconstrainedly as if they were his equals sat down cheerfully on dirty bedsides and rickety benches and distributed his little gifts of money with the air of a man who was paying debts rather than bestowing charity where he encountered cases of illness he pulled out his inkhorn and slips of paper and wrote simple prescriptions to be made up from the medicinechest of a neighboring convent which served the same merciful purpose then that is answered by dispensaries in our days when he had exhausted his money and had got through his visits he was escorted out of the poor quarter by a perfect train of enthusiastic followers the women kissed his hand again and the men uncovered as he turned and with a friendly sign bade them all farewell  as soon as he was alone again he walked toward the campo santo and passing the house in which nanina lived sauntered up and down the street thoughtfully for some minutes when he at length ascended the steep staircase that led to the room occupied by the sisters he found the door ajar pushing it open gently he saw la biondella sitting with her pretty fair profile turned toward him eating her evening meal of bread and grapes at the opposite end of the room scarammuccia was perched up on his hindquarters in a corner with his mouth wide open to catch the morsel of bread which he evidently expected the child to throw to him what the elder sister was doing the priest had not time to see for the dog barked the moment he presented himself and nanina hastened to the door to ascertain who the intruder might be all that he could observe was that she was too confused on catching sight of him to be able to utter a word la biondella was the first to speak  thank you father rocco said the child jumping up with her bread in one hand and her grapes in the otherthank you for giving me so much money for my dinnermats there they are tied up together in one little parcel in the corner nanina said she was ashamed to think of your carrying them and i said i knew where you lived and i should like to ask you to let me take them home  do you think you can carry them all the way my dear asked the priest  look father rocco see if i cant carry them cried la biondella cramming her bread into one of the pockets of her little apron holding her bunch of grapes by the stalk in her mouth and hoisting the packet of dinnermats on her head in a moment see i am strong enough to carry double said the child looking up proudly into the priests face  can you trust her to take them home for me asked father rocco turning to nanina i want to speak to you alone and her absence will give me the opportunity can you trust her out by herself  yes father rocco she often goes out alone nanina gave this answer in low trembling tones and looked down confusedly on the ground  go then my dear said father rocco patting the child on the shoulder and come back here to your sister as soon as you have left the mats  la biondella went out directly in great triumph with scarammuccia walking by her side and keeping his muzzle suspiciously close to the pocket in which she had put her bread father rocco closed the door after them and then taking the one chair which the room possessed motioned to nanina to sit by him on the stool  do you believe that i am your friend my child and that i have always meant well toward you he began  the best and kindest of friends answered nanina  then you will hear what i have to say patiently and you will believe that i am speaking for your good even if my words should distress you nanina turned away her head now tell me should i be wrong to begin with if i said that my brothers pupil the young nobleman whom we call signor fabio had been here to see you today nanina started up affrightedly from her stool sit down again my child i am not going to blame you i am only going to tell you what you must do for the future  he took her hand it was cold and it trembled violently in his  i will not ask what he has been saying to you continued the priest for it might distress you to answer and i have moreover had means of knowing that your youth and beauty have made a strong impression on him i will pass over then all reference to the words he may have been speaking to you and i will come at once to what i have now to say in my turn nanina my child arm yourself with all your courage and promise me before we part tonight that you will see signor fabio no more  nanina turned round suddenly and fixed her eyes on him with an expression of terrified incredulity no more  you are very young and very innocent said father rocco but surely you must have thought before now of the difference between signor fabio and you surely you must have often remembered that you are low down among the ranks of the poor and that he is high up among the rich and the nobly born  naninas hands dropped on the priests knees she bent her head down on them and began to weep bitterly  surely you must have thought of that reiterated father rocco  oh i have often often thought of it murmured the girl i have mourned over it and cried about it in secret for many nights past he said i looked pale and ill and out of spirits today and i told him it was with thinking of that  and what did he say in return  there was no answer father rocco looked down nanina raised her head directly from his knees and tried to turn it away again he took her hand and stopped her  come he said speak frankly to me say what you ought to say to your father and your friend what was his answer my child when you reminded him of the difference between you  he said i was born to be a lady faltered the girl still struggling to turn her face away and that i might make myself one if i would learn and be patient he said that if he had all the noble ladies in pisa to choose from on one side and only little nanina on the other he would hold out his hand to me and tell them this shall be my wife he said love knew no difference of rank and that if he was a nobleman and rich it was all the more reason why he should please himself he was so kind that i thought my heart would burst while he was speaking and my little sister liked him so that she got upon his knee and kissed him even our dog who growls at other strangers stole to his side and licked his hand oh father rocco father rocco the tears burst out afresh and the lovely head dropped once more wearily on the priests knee  father rocco smiled to himself and waited to speak again till she was calmer  supposing he resumed after some minutes of silence supposing signor fabio really meant all he said to you  nanina started up and confronted the priest boldly for the first time since he had entered the room  supposing she exclaimed her cheeks beginning to redden and her dark blue eyes flashing suddenly through her tears supposing father rocco fabio would never deceive me i would die here at your feet rather than doubt the least word he said to me  the priest signed to her quietly to return to the stool i never suspected the child had so much spirit in her he thought to himself  i would die repeated nanina in a voice that began to falter now i would die rather than doubt him  i will not ask you to doubt him said father rocco gently and i will believe in him myself as firmly as you do let us suppose my child that you have learned patiently all the many things of which you are now ignorant and which it is necessary for a lady to know let us suppose that signor fabio has really violated all the laws that govern people in his high station and has taken you to him publicly as his wife you would be happy then nanina but would he he has no father or mother to control him it is true but he has friendsmany friends and intimates in his own rankproud heartless people who know nothing of your worth and goodness who hearing of your low birth would look on you and on your husband too my child with contempt he has not your patience and fortitude think how bitter it would be for him to bear that contemptto see you shunned by proud women and carelessly pitied or patronized by insolent men yet all this and more he would have to endure or else to quit the world he has lived in from his boyhoodthe world he was born to live in you love him i know  naninas tears burst out afresh oh how dearlyhow dearly she murmured  yes you love him dearly continued the priest but would all your love compensate him for everything else that he must lose it might at first but there would come a time when the world would assert its influence over him again when he would feel a want which you could not supplya weariness which you could not solace think of his life then and of yours think of the first day when the first secret doubt whether he had done rightly in marrying you would steal into his mind we are not masters of all our impulses the lightest spirits have their moments of irresistible depression the bravest hearts are not always superior to doubt my child my child the world is strong the pride of rank is rooted deep and the human will is frail at best be warned for your own sake and for fabios be warned in time  nanina stretched out her hands toward the priest in despair  oh father rocco father rocco she cried why did you not tell me this before  because my child i only knew of the necessity for telling you today but it is not too late it is never too late to do a good action you love fabio nanina will you prove that love by making a great sacrifice for his good  i would die for his good  will you nobly cure him of a passion which will be his ruin if not yours by leaving pisa tomorrow  leave pisa exclaimed nanina her face grew deadly pale she rose and moved back a step or two from the priest  listen to me pursued father rocco i have heard you complain that you could not get regular employment at needlework you shall have that employment if you will go with meyou and your little sister too of courseto florence tomorrow  i promised fabio to go to the studio began nanina affrightedly i promised to go at ten oclock how can i  she stopped suddenly as if her breath were failing her  i myself will take you and your sister to florence said father rocco without noticing the interruption i will place you under the care of a lady who will be as kind as a mother to you both i will answer for your getting such work to do as will enable you to keep yourself honestly and independently and i will undertake if you do not like your life at florence to bring you back to pisa after a lapse of three months only three months nanina it is not a long exile  fabio fabio cried the girl sinking again on the seat and hiding her face  it is for his good said father rocco calmly for fabios good remember  what would he think of me if i went away oh if i had but learned to write if i could only write fabio a letter  am i not to be depended on to explain to him all that he ought to know  how can i go away from him oh father rocco how can you ask me to go away from him  i will ask you to do nothing hastily i will leave you till tomorrow morning to decide at nine oclock i shall be in the street and i will not even so much as enter this house unless i know beforehand that you have resolved to follow my advice give me a sign from your window if i see you wave your white mantilla out of it i shall know that you have taken the noble resolution to save fabio and to save yourself i will say no more my child for unless i am grievously mistaken in you i have already said enough  he went out leaving her still weeping bitterly not far from the house he met la biondella and the dog on their way back the little girl stopped to report to him the safe delivery of her dinnermats but he passed on quickly with a nod and a smile his interview with nanina had left some influence behind it which unfitted him just then for the occupation of talking to a child   nearly half an hour before nine oclock on the following morning father rocco set forth for the street in which nanina lived on his way thither he overtook a dog walking lazily a few paces ahead in the roadway and saw at the same time an elegantlydressed lady advancing toward him the dog stopped suspiciously as she approached and growled and showed his teeth when she passed him the lady on her side uttered an exclamation of disgust but did not seem to be either astonished or frightened by the animals threatening attitude father rocco looked after her with some curiosity as she walked by him she was a handsome woman and he admired her courage i know that growling brute well enough he said to himself but who can the lady be  the dog was scarammuccia returning from one of his marauding expeditions the lady was brigida on her way to luca lomis studio  some minutes before nine oclock the priest took his post in the street opposite naninas window it was open but neither she nor her little sister appeared at it he looked up anxiously as the churchclocks struck the hour but there was no sign for a minute or so after they were all silent is she hesitating still said father rocco to himself  just as the words passed his lips the white mantilla was waved out of the window     part second    chapter i  even the masterstroke of replacing the treacherous italian forewoman by a french dressmaker engaged direct from paris did not at first avail to elevate the great grifoni establishment above the reach of minor calamities mademoiselle virginie had not occupied her new situation at pisa quite a week before she fell ill all sorts of reports were circulated as to the cause of this illness and the demoiselle grifoni even went so far as to suggest that the health of the new forewoman had fallen a sacrifice to some nefarious practices of the chemical sort on the part of her rival in the trade but however the misfortune had been produced it was a fact that mademoiselle virginie was certainly very ill and another fact that the doctor insisted on her being sent to the baths of lucca as soon as she could be moved from her bed  fortunately for the demoiselle grifoni the frenchwoman had succeeded in producing three specimens of her art before her health broke down they comprised the eveningdress of yellow brocaded silk to which she had devoted herself on the morning when she first assumed her duties at pisa a black cloak and hood of an entirely new shape and an irresistibly fascinating dressinggown said to have been first brought into fashion by the princesses of the bloodroyal of france these articles of costume on being exhibited in the showroom electrified the ladies of pisa and orders from all sides flowed in immediately on the grifoni establishment they were of course easily executed by the inferior workwomen from the specimen designs of the french dressmaker so that the illness of mademoiselle virginie though it might cause her mistress some temporary inconvenience was after all productive of no absolute loss  two months at the baths of lucca restored the new forewoman to health she returned to pisa and resumed her place in the private workroom once reestablished there she discovered that an important change had taken place during her absence her friend and assistant brigida had resigned her situation all inquiries made of the demoiselle grifoni only elicited one answer the missing workwoman had abruptly left her place at five minutes warning and had departed without confiding to any one what she thought of doing or whither she intended to turn her steps  months elapsed the new year came but no explanatory letter arrived from brigida the spring season passed off with all its accompaniments of dressmaking and dressbuying but still there was no news of her the first anniversary of mademoiselle virginies engagement with the demoiselle grifoni came round and then at last a note arrived stating that brigida had returned to pisa and that if the french forewoman would send an answer mentioning where her private lodgings were she would visit her old friend that evening after business hours the information was gladly enough given and punctually to the appointed time brigida arrived in mademoiselle virginies little sittingroom  advancing with her usual indolent stateliness of gait the italian asked after her friends health as coolly and sat down in the nearest chair as carelessly as if they had not been separated for more than a few days mademoiselle virginie laughed in her liveliest manner and raised her mobile french eyebrows in sprightly astonishment  well brigida she exclaimed they certainly did you no injustice when they nicknamed you carefornothing in old grifonis workroom where have you been why have you never written to me  i had nothing particular to write about and besides i always intended to come back to pisa and see you answered brigida leaning back luxuriously in her chair  but where have you been for nearly a whole year past in italy  no at paris you know i can singnot very well but i have a voice and most frenchwomen excuse the impertinence have none i met with a friend and got introduced to a manager and i have been singing at the theaternot the great parts only the second your amiable countrywomen could not screech me down on the stage but they intrigued against me successfully behind the scenes in short i quarreled with our principal lady quarreled with the manager quarreled with my friend and here i am back at pisa with a little money saved in my pocket and no great notion what i am to do next  back at pisa why did you leave it  brigidas eyes began to lose their indolent expression she sat up suddenly in her chair and set one of her hands heavily on a little table by her side  why she repeated because when i find the game going against me i prefer giving it up at once to waiting to be beaten  ah you refer to that last years project of yours for making your fortune among the sculptors i should like to hear how it was you failed with the wealthy young amateur remember that i fell ill before you had any news to give me your absence when i returned from lucca and almost immediately afterward the marriage of your intended conquest to the sculptors daughter proved to me of course that you must have failed but i never heard how i know nothing at this moment but the bare fact that maddalena lomi won the prize  tell me first do she and her husband live together happily  there are no stories of their disagreeing she has dresses horses carriages a negro page the smallest lapdog in italyin short all the luxuries that a woman can want and a child bytheby into the bargain  a child  yes a child born little more than a week ago  not a boy i hope  no a girl  i am glad of that those rich people always want the firstborn to be an heir they will both be disappointed i am glad of that  mercy on us brigida how fierce you look  do i its likely enough i hate fabio dascoli and maddalena lomisingly as man and woman doubly as man and wife stop ill tell you what you want to know directly only answer me another question or two first have you heard anything about her health  how should i hear dressmakers cant inquire at the doors of the nobility  true now one last question that little simpleton nanina  i have never seen or heard anything of her she cant be at pisa or she would have called at our place for work  ah i need not have asked about her if i had thought a moment beforehand father rocco would be sure to keep her out of fabios sight for his nieces sake  what he really loved that threadpaper of a girl as you called her  better than fifty such wives as he has got now i was in the studio the morning he was told of her departure from pisa a letter was privately given to him telling him that the girl had left the place out of a feeling of honor and had hidden herself beyond the possibility of discovery to prevent him from compromising himself with all his friends by marrying her naturally enough he would not believe that this was her own doing and naturally enough also when father rocco was sent for and was not to be found he suspected the priest of being at the bottom of the business i never saw a man in such a fury of despair and rage before he swore that he would have all italy searched for the girl that he would be the death of the priest and that he would never enter luca lomis studio again  and as to this last particular of course being a man he failed to keep his word  of course at that first visit of mine to the studio i discovered two things the first as i said that fabio was really in love with the girlthe second that maddalena lomi was really in love with him you may suppose i looked at her attentively while the disturbance was going on and while nobodys notice was directed on me all women are vain i know but vanity never blinded my eyes i saw directly that i had but one superiority over hermy figure she was my height but not well made she had hair as dark and as glossy as mine eyes as bright and as black as mine and the rest of her face better than mine my nose is coarse my lips are too thick and my upper lip overhangs my under too far she had none of those personal faults and as for capacity she managed the young fool in his passion as well as i could have managed him in her place  how  she stood silent with downcast eyes and a distressed look all the time he was raving up and down the studio she must have hated the girl and been rejoiced at her disappearance but she never showed it you would be an awkward rival i thought to myself even to a handsomer woman than i am however i determined not to despair too soon and made up my mind to follow my plan just as if the accident of the girls disappearance had never occurred i smoothed down the mastersculptor easily enoughflattering him about his reputation assuring him that the works of luca lomi had been the objects of my adoration since childhood telling him that i had heard of his difficulty in finding a model to complete his minerva from and offering myself if he thought me worthy for the honorlaying great stress on that wordfor the honor of sitting to him i dont know whether he was altogether deceived by what i told him but he was sharp enough to see that i really could be of use and he accepted my offer with a profusion of compliments we parted having arranged that i was to give him a first sitting in a weeks time  why put it off so long  to allow our young gentleman time to cool down and return to the studio to be sure what was the use of my being there while he was away  yes yesi forgot and how long was it before he came back  i had allowed him more time than enough when i had given my first sitting i saw him in the studio and heard it was his second visit there since the day of the girls disappearance those very violent men are always changeable and irresolute  had he made no attempt then to discover nanina  oh yes he had searched for her himself and had set others searching for her but to no purpose four days of perpetual disappointment had been enough to bring him to his senses luca lomi had written him a peacemaking letter asking what harm he or his daughter had done even supposing father rocco was to blame maddalena lomi had met him in the street and had looked resignedly away from him as if she expected him to pass her in short they had awakened his sense of justice and his good nature you see i can impartially give him his due and they had got him back he was silent and sentimental enough at first and shockingly sulky and savage with the priest  i wonder father rocco ventured within his reach  father rocco is not a man to be daunted or defeated by anybody i can tell you the same day on which fabio came back to the studio he returned to it beyond boldly declaring that he thought nanina had done quite right and had acted like a good and virtuous girl he would say nothing about her or her disappearance it was quite useless to ask him questionshe denied that any one had a right to put them threatening entreating flatteringall modes of appeal were thrown away on him ah my dear depend upon it the cleverest and politest man in pisa the most dangerous to an enemy and the most delightful to a friend is father rocco the rest of them when i began to play my cards a little too openly behaved with brutal rudeness to me father rocco from first to last treated me like a lady sincere or not i dont carehe treated me like a lady when the others treated me like  there there dont get hot about it now tell me instead how you made your first approaches to the young gentleman whom you talk of so contemptuously as fabio  as it turned out in the worst possible way first of course i made sure of interesting him in me by telling him that i had known nanina so far it was all well enough my next object was to persuade him that she could never have gone away if she had truly loved him alone and that he must have had some fortunate rival in her own rank of life to whom she had sacrificed him after gratifying her vanity for a time by bringing a young nobleman to her feet i had as you will easily imagine difficulty enough in making him take this view of naninas flight his pride and his love for the girl were both concerned in refusing to admit the truth of my suggestion at last i succeeded i brought him to that state of ruffled vanity and fretful selfassertion in which it is easiest to work on a mans feelingsin which a mans own wounded pride makes the best pitfall to catch him in i brought him i say to that state and then she stepped in and profited by what i had done is it wonderful now that i rejoice in her disappointmentsthat i should be glad to hear any ill thing of her that any one could tell me  but how did she first get the advantage of you  if i had found out she would never have succeeded where i failed all i know is that she had more opportunities of seeing him than i and that she used them cunningly enough even to deceive me while i thought i was gaining ground with fabio i was actually losing it my first suspicions were excited by a change in luca lomis conduct toward me he grew cold neglectfulat last absolutely rude i was resolved not to see this but accident soon obliged me to open my eyes one morning i heard fabio and maddalena talking of me when they imagined i had left the studio i cant repeat their words especially here the blood flies into my head and the cold catches me at the heart when i only think of them it will be enough if i tell you that he laughed at me and that she  hush not so loud there are other people lodging in the house never mind about telling me what you heard it only irritates you to no purpose i can guess that they had discovered  through herremember all through her  yes yes i understand they had discovered a great deal more than you ever intended them to know and all through her  but for the priest virginie i should have been openly insulted and driven from their doors he had insisted on their behaving with decent civility toward me they said that he was afraid of me and laughed at the notion of his trying to make them afraid too that was the last thing i heard the fury i was in and the necessity of keeping it down almost suffocated me i turned round to leave the place forever when who should i see standing close behind me but father rocco he must have discovered in my face that i knew all but he took no notice of it he only asked in his usual quiet polite way if i was looking for anything i had lost and if he could help me i managed to thank him and to get to the door he opened it for me respectfully and bowedhe treated me like a lady to the last it was evening when i left the studio in that way the next morning i threw up my situation and turned my back on pisa now you know everything  did you hear of the marriage or did you only assume from what you knew that it would take place  i heard of it about six months ago a man came to sing in the chorus at our theater who had been employed some time before at the grand concert given on the occasion of the marriage but let us drop the subject now i am in a fever already with talking of it you are in a bad situation here my dear i declare your room is almost stifling  shall i open the other window  no let us go out and get a breath of air by the riverside come take your hood and fanit is getting darknobody will see us and we can come back here if you like in half an hour  mademoiselle virginie acceded to her friends wish rather reluctantly they walked toward the river the sun was down and the sudden night of italy was gathering fast although brigida did not say another word on the subject of fabio or his wife she led the way to the bank of the arno on which the young noblemans palace stood  just as they got near the great door of entrance a sedanchair approaching in the opposite direction was set down before it and a footman after a moments conference with a lady inside the chair advanced to the porters lodge in the courtyard leaving her friend to go on brigida slipped in after the servant by the open wicket and concealed herself in the shadow cast by the great closed gates  the marchesa melani to inquire how the countess dascoli and the infant are this evening said the footman  my mistress has not changed at all for the better since the morning answered the porter the child is doing quite well  the footman went back to the sedanchair then returned to the porters lodge  the marchesa desires me to ask if fresh medical advice has been sent for he said  another doctor has arrived from florence today replied the porter  mademoiselle virginie missing her friend suddenly turned back toward the palace to look after her and was rather surprised to see brigida slip out of the wicketgate there were two oil lamps burning on pillars outside the doorway and their light glancing on the italians face as she passed under them showed that she was smiling    chapter ii  while the marchesa melani was making inquiries at the gate of the palace fabio was sitting alone in the apartment which his wife usually occupied when she was in health it was her favorite room and had been prettily decorated by her own desire with hangings in yellow satin and furniture of the same color fabio was now waiting in it to hear the report of the doctors after their evening visit  although maddalena lomi had not been his first love and although he had married her under circumstances which are generally and rightly considered to afford few chances of lasting happiness in wedded life still they had lived together through the one year of their union tranquilly if not fondly she had molded herself wisely to his peculiar humors had made the most of his easy disposition and when her quick temper had got the better of her had seldom hesitated in her cooler moments to acknowledge that she had been wrong she had been extravagant it is true and had irritated him by fits of unreasonable jealousy but these were faults not to be thought of now he could only remember that she was the mother of his child and that she lay ill but two rooms away from himdangerously ill as the doctors had unwillingly confessed on that very day  the darkness was closing in upon him and he took up the handbell to ring for lights when the servant entered there was genuine sorrow in his face genuine anxiety in his voice as he inquired for news from the sickroom the man only answered that his mistress was still asleep and then withdrew after first leaving a sealed letter on the table by his masters side fabio summoned him back into the room and asked when the letter had arrived he replied that it had been delivered at the palace two days since and that he had observed it lying unopened on a desk in his masters study  left alone again fabio remembered that the letter had arrived at a time when the first dangerous symptoms of his wifes illness had declared themselves and that he had thrown it aside after observing the address to be in a handwriting unknown to him in his present state of suspense any occupation was better than sitting idle so he took up the letter with a sigh broke the seal and turned inquiringly to the name signed at the end  it was nanina  he started and changed color a letter from her he whispered to himself why does it come at such a time as this  his face grew paler and the letter trembled in his fingers those superstitious feelings which he had ascribed to the nursery influences of his childhood when father rocco charged him with them in the studio seemed to be overcoming him now he hesitated and listened anxiously in the direction of his wifes room before reading the letter was its arrival ominous of good or evil that was the thought in his heart as he drew the lamp near to him and looked at the first lines  am i wrong in writing to you the letter began abruptly if i am you have but to throw this little leaf of paper into the fire and to think no more of it after it is burned up and gone i can never reproach you for treating my letter in that way for we are never likely to meet again  why did i go away only to save you from the consequences of marrying a poor girl who was not fit to become your wife it almost broke my heart to leave you for i had nothing to keep up my courage but the remembrance that i was going away for your sake i had to think of that morning and nightto think of it always or i am afraid i should have faltered in my resolution and have gone back to pisa i longed so much at first to see you once more only to tell you that nanina was not heartless and ungrateful and that you might pity her and think kindly of her though you might love her no longer  only to tell you that if i had been a lady i might have told it to you in a letter but i had never learned to write and i could not prevail on myself to get others to take the pen for me all i could do was to learn secretly how to write with my own hand it was long long work but the uppermost thought in my heart was always the thought of justifying myself to you and that made me patient and persevering i learned at last to write so as not to be ashamed of myself or to make you ashamed of me i began a lettermy first letter to youbut i heard of your marriage before it was done and then i had to tear the paper up and put the pen down again  i had no right to come between you and your wife even with so little a thing as a letter i had no right to do anything but hope and pray for your happiness are you happy i am sure you ought to be for how can your wife help loving you  it is very hard for me to explain why i have ventured on writing now and yet i cant think that i am doing wrong i heard a few days ago for i have a friend at pisa who keeps me informed by my own desire of all the pleasant changes in your lifei heard of your child being born and i thought myself after that justified at last in writing to you no letter from me at such a time as this can rob your childs mother of so much as a thought of yours that is due to her thus at least it seems to me i wish so well to your child that i cannot surely be doing wrong in writing these lines  i have said already what i wanted to saywhat i have been longing to say for a whole year past i have told you why i left pisa and have perhaps persuaded you that i have gone through some suffering and borne some heartaches for your sake have i more to write only a word or two to tell you that i am earning my bread as i always wished to earn it quietly at homeat least at what i must call home now i am living with reputable people and i want for nothing la biondella has grown very much she would hardly be obliged to get on your knee to kiss you now and she can plait her dinnermats faster and more neatly than ever our old dog is with us and has learned two new tricks but you cant be expected to remember him although you were the only stranger i ever saw him take kindly to at first  it is time i finished if you have read this letter through to the end i am sure you will excuse me if i have written it badly there is no date to it because i feel that it is safest and best for both of us that you should know nothing of where i am living i bless you and pray for you and bid you affectionately farewell if you can think of me as a sister think of me sometimes still  fabio sighed bitterly while he read the letter why he whispered to himself why does it come at such a time as this when i cannot dare not think of her as he slowly folded the letter up the tears came into his eyes and he half raised the paper to his lips at the same moment some one knocked at the door of the room he started and felt himself changing color guiltily as one of his servants entered  my mistress is awake the man said with a very grave face and a very constrained manner and the gentlemen in attendance desire me to say  he was interrupted before he could give his message by one of the medical men who had followed him into the room  i wish i had better news to communicate began the doctor gently  she is worse then said fabio sinking back into the chair from which he had risen the moment before  she has awakened weaker instead of stronger after her sleep returned the doctor evasively i never like to give up all hope till the very last but  it is cruel not to be candid with him interposed another voicethe voice of the doctor from florence who had just entered the room strengthen yourself to bear the worst he continued addressing himself to fabio she is dying can you compose yourself enough to go to her bedside  pale and speechless fabio rose from his chair and made a sign in the affirmative he trembled so that the doctor who had first spoken was obliged to lead him out of the room  your mistress has some near relations in pisa has she not said the doctor from florence appealing to the servant who waited near him  her father sir signor luca lomi and her uncle father rocco answered the man they were here all through the day until my mistress fell asleep  do you know where to find them now  signor luca told me he should be at his studio and father rocco said i might find him at his lodgings  send for them both directly stay who is your mistresss confessor he ought to be summoned without loss of time  my mistresss confessor is father rocco sir  very wellsend or go yourself at once even minutes may be of importance now saying this the doctor turned away and sat down to wait for any last demands on his services in the chair which fabio had just left    chapter iii  before the servant could get to the priests lodgings a visitor had applied there for admission and had been immediately received by father rocco himself this favored guest was a little man very sprucely and neatly dressed and oppressively polite in his manner he bowed when he first sat down he bowed when he answered the usual inquiries about his health and he bowed for the third time when father rocco asked what had brought him from florence  rather an awkward business replied the little man recovering himself uneasily after his third bow the dressmaker named nanina whom you placed under my wifes protection about a year ago  what of her inquired the priest eagerly  i regret to say she has left us with her childsister and their very disagreeable dog that growls at everybody  when did they go  only yesterday i came here at once to tell you as you were so very particular in recommending us to take care of her it is not our fault that she has gone my wife was kindness itself to her and i always treated her like a duchess i bought dinnermats of her sister i even put up with the thieving and growling of the disagreeable dog  where have they gone to have you found out that  i have found out by application at the passportoffice that they have not left florencebut what particular part of the city they have removed to i have not yet had time to discover  and pray why did they leave you in the first place nanina is not a girl to do anything without a reason she must have had some cause for going away what was it  the little man hesitated and made a fourth bow  you remember your private instructions to my wife and myself when you first brought nanina to our house he said looking away rather uneasily while he spoke  yes you were to watch her but to take care that she did not suspect you it was just possible at that time that she might try to get back to pisa without my knowing it and everything depended on her remaining at florence i think now that i did wrong to distrust her but it was of the last importance to provide against all possibilities and to abstain from putting too much faith in my own good opinion of the girl for these reasons i certainly did instruct you to watch her privately so far you are quite right and i have nothing to complain of go on  you remember resumed the little man that the first consequence of our following your instructions was a discovery which we immediately communicated to you that she was secretly learning to write  yes and i also remember sending you word not to show that you knew what she was doing but to wait and see if she turned her knowledge of writing to account and took or sent any letters to the post you informed me in your regular monthly report that she nearer did anything of the kind  never until three days ago and then she was traced from her room in my house to the postoffice with a letter which she dropped into the box  and the address of which you discovered before she took it from your house  unfortunately i did not answered the little man reddening and looking askance at the priest as if he expected to receive a severe reprimand  but father rocco said nothing he was thinking who could she have written to if to fabio why should she have waited for months and months after she had learned how to use her pen before sending him a letter if not to fabio to what other person could she have written  i regret not discovering the addressregret it most deeply said the little man with a low bow of apology  it is too late for regret said father rocco coldly tell me how she came to leave your house i have not heard that yet be as brief as you can i expect to be called every moment to the bedside of a near and dear relation who is suffering from severe illness you shall have all my attention but you must ask it for as short a time as possible  i will be briefness itself in the first place you must know that i haveor rather hadan idle unscrupulous rascal of an apprentice in my business  the priest pursed up his mouth contemptuously  in the second place this same goodfornothing fellow had the impertinence to fall in love with nanina  father rocco started and listened eagerly  but i must do the girl the justice to say that she never gave him the slightest encouragement and that whenever he ventured to speak to her she always quietly but very decidedly repelled him  a good girl said father rocco i always said she was a good girl it was a mistake on my part ever to have distrusted her  among the other offenses continued the little man of which i now find my scoundrel of an apprentice to have been guilty was the enormity of picking the lock of my desk and prying into my private papers  you ought not to have had any private papers should always be burned papers  they shall be for the future i will take good care of that  were any of my letters to you about nanina among these private papers  unfortunately they were pray pray excuse my want of caution this time it shall never happen again  go on such imprudence as yours can never be excused it can only be provided against for the future i suppose the apprentice showed my letters to the girl  i infer as much though why he should do so  simpleton did you not say that he was in love with her as you term it and that he got no encouragement  yes i said thatand i know it to be true  well was it not his interest being unable to make any impression on the girls fancy to establish some claim to her gratitude and try if he could not win her that way by showing her my letters he would make her indebted to him for knowing that she was watched in your house but this is not the matter in question now you say you infer that she had seen my letters on what grounds  on the strength of this bit of paper answered the little man ruefully producing a note from his pocket she must have had your letters shown to her soon after putting her own letter into the post for on the evening of the same day when i went up into her room i found that she and her sister and the disagreeable dog had all gone and observed this note laid on the table  father rocco took the note and read these lines   i have just discovered that i have been watched and suspected ever since my stay under your roof it is impossible that i can remain another night in the house of a spy i go with my sister we owe you nothing and we are free to live honestly where we please if you see father rocco tell him that i can forgive his distrust of me but that i can never forget it i who had full faith in him had a right to expect that he should have full faith in me it was always an encouragement to me to think of him as a father and a friend i have lost that encouragement foreverand it was the last i had left to me  nanina   the priest rose from his seat as he handed the note back and the visitor immediately followed his example  we must remedy this misfortune as we best may he said with a sigh are you ready to go back to florence tomorrow  the little man bowed again  find out where she is and ascertain if she wants for anything and if she is living in a safe place say nothing about me and make no attempt to induce her to return to your house simply let me know what you discover the poor child has a spirit that no ordinary people would suspect in her she must be soothed and treated tenderly and we shall manage her yet no mistakes mind this time do just what i tell you and do no more have you anything else to say to me  the little man shook his head and shrugged his shoulders  goodnight then said the priest  goodnight said the little man slipping through the door that was held open for him with the politest alacrity  this is vexatious said father rocco taking a turn or two in the study after his visitor had gone it was bad to have done the child an injusticeit is worse to have been found out there is nothing for it now but to wait till i know where she is i like her and i like that note she left behind her it is bravely delicately and honestly writtena good girla very good girl indeed  he walked to the window breathed the fresh air for a few moments and quietly dismissed the subject from his mind when he returned to his table he had no thoughts for any one but his sick niece  it seems strange he said that i have had no message about her yet perhaps luca has heard something it may be well if i go to the studio at once to find out  he took up his hat and went to the door just as he opened it fabios servant confronted him on the thresh old  i am sent to summon you to the palace said the man the doctors have given up all hope  father rocco turned deadly pale and drew back a step have you told my brother of this he asked  i was just on my way to the studio answered the servant  i will go there instead of you and break the bad news to him said the priest  they descended the stairs in silence just as they were about to separate at the street door father rocco stopped the servant  how is the child he asked with such sudden eagerness and impatience that the man looked quite startled as he answered that the child was perfectly well  there is some consolation in that said father rocco walking away and speaking partly to the servant partly to himself my caution has misled me he continued pausing thoughtfully when he was left alone in the roadway i should have risked using the mothers influence sooner to procure the righteous restitution all hope of compassing it now rests on the life of the child infant as she is her fathers illgotten wealth may yet be gathered back to the church by her hands  he proceeded rapidly on his way to the studio until he reached the riverside and drew close to the bridge which it was necessary to cross in order to get to his brothers house here he stopped abruptly as if struck by a sudden idea the moon had just risen and her light streaming across the river fell full upon his face as he stood by the parapet wall that led up to the bridge he was so lost in thought that he did not hear the conversation of two ladies who were advancing along the pathway close behind him as they brushed by him the taller of the two turned round and looked back at his face  father rocco exclaimed the lady stopping  donna brigida cried the priest looking surprised at first but recovering himself directly and bowing with his usual quiet politeness pardon me if i thank you for honoring me by renewing our acquaintance and then pass on to my brothers studio a heavy affliction is likely to befall us and i go to prepare him for it  you refer to the dangerous illness of your niece said brigida i heard of it this evening let us hope that your fears are exaggerated and that we may yet meet under less distressing circumstances i have no present intention of leaving pisa for some time and i shall always be glad to thank father rocco for the politeness and consideration which he showed to me under delicate circumstances a year ago  with these words she courtesied deferentially and moved away to rejoin her friend the priest observed that mademoiselle virginie lingered rather near as if anxious to catch a few words of the conversation between brigida and himself seeing this he in his turn listened as the two women slowly walked away together and heard the italian say to her companion virginie i will lay you the price of a new dress that fabio dascoli marries again  father rocco started when she said those words as if he had trodden on fire  my thought he whispered nervously to himself my thought at the moment when she spoke to me marry again another wife over whom i should have no influence other children whose education would not be confided to me what would become then of the restitution that i have hoped for wrought for prayed for  he stopped and looked fixedly at the sky above him the bridge was deserted his black figure rose up erect motionless and spectral with the white still light falling solemnly all around it standing so for some minutes his first movement was to drop his hand angrily on the parapet of the bridge he then turned round slowly in the direction by which the two women had walked away  donna brigida he said i will lay you the price of fifty new dresses that fabio dascoli never marries again  he set his face once more toward the studio and walked on without stopping until he arrived at the mastersculptors door  marry again he thought to himself as he rang the bell donna brigida was your first failure not enough for you are you going to try a second time  luca lomi himself opened the door he drew father rocco hurriedly into the studio toward a single lamp burning on a stand near the partition between the two rooms  have you heard anything of our poor child he asked tell me the truth tell me the truth at once  hush compose yourself i have heard said father rocco in low mournful tones  luca tightened his hold on the priests arm and looked into his face with breathless speechless eagerness  compose yourself repeated father rocco compose yourself to hear the worst my poor luca the doctors have given up all hope  luca dropped his brothers arm with a groan of despair oh maddalena my childmy only child  reiterating these words again and again he leaned his head against the partition and burst into tears sordid and coarse as his nature was he really loved his daughter all the heart he had was in his statues and in her  after the first burst of his grief was exhausted he was recalled to himself by a sensation as if some change had taken place in the lighting of the studio he looked up directly and dimly discerned the priest standing far down at the end of the room nearest the door with the lamp in his hand eagerly looking at something  rocco he exclaimed rocco why have you taken the lamp away what are you doing there  there was no movement and no answer luca advanced a step or two and called again rocco what are you doing there  the priest heard this time and came suddenly toward his brother with the lamp in his handso suddenly that luca started  what is it he asked in astonishment gracious god rocco how pale you are  still the priest never said a word he put the lamp down on the nearest table luca observed that his hand shook he had never seen his brother violently agitated before when rocco had announced but a few minutes ago that maddalenas life was despaired of it was in a voice which though sorrowful was perfectly calm what was the meaning of this sudden panicthis strange silent terror  the priest observed that his brother was looking at him earnestly come he said in a faint whisper come to her bedside we have no time to lose get your hat and leave it to me to put out the lamp  he hurriedly extinguished the light while he spoke they went down the studio side by side toward the door the moonlight streamed through the window full on the place where the priest had been standing alone with the lamp in his hand as they passed it luca felt his brother tremble and saw him turn away his head                                             two hours later fabio dascoli and his wife were separated in this world forever and the servants of the palace were anticipating in whispers the order of their mistresss funeral procession to the burialground of the campo santo     part third    chapter i  about eight months after the countess dascoli had been laid in her grave in the campo santo two reports were circulated through the gay world of pisa which excited curiosity and awakened expectation everywhere  the first report announced that a grand masked ball was to be given at the melani palace to celebrate the day on which the heir of the house attained his majority all the friends of the family were delighted at the prospect of this festival for the old marquis melani had the reputation of being one of the most hospitable and at the same time one of the most eccentric men in pisa every one expected therefore that he would secure for the entertainment of his guests if he really gave the ball the most whimsical novelties in the way of masks dances and amusements generally that had ever been seen  the second report was that the rich widower fabio dascoli was on the point of returning to pisa after having improved his health and spirits by traveling in foreign countries and that he might be expected to appear again in society for the first time since the death of his wife at the masked ball which was to be given in the melani palace this announcement excited special interest among the young ladies of pisa fabio had only reached his thirtieth year and it was universally agreed that his return to society in his native city could indicate nothing more certainly than his desire to find a second mother for his infant child all the single ladies would now have been ready to bet as confidently as brigida had offered to bet eight months before that fabio dascoli would marry again  for once in a way report turned out to be true in both the cases just mentioned invitations were actually issued from the melani palace and fabio returned from abroad to his home on the arno  in settling all the arrangements connected with his masked ball the marquis melani showed that he was determined not only to deserve but to increase his reputation for oddity he invented the most extravagant disguises to be worn by some of his more intimate friends he arranged grotesque dances to be performed at stated periods of the evening by professional buffoons hired from florence he composed a toy symphony which included solos on every noisy plaything at that time manufactured for childrens use and not content with thus avoiding the beaten track in preparing the entertainments at the ball he determined also to show decided originality even in selecting the attendants who were to wait on the company other people in his rank of life were accustomed to employ their own and hired footmen for this purpose the marquis resolved that his attendants should be composed of young women only that two of his rooms should be fitted up as arcadian bowers and that all the prettiest girls in pisa should be placed in them to preside over the refreshments dressed in accordance with the mock classical taste of the period as shepherdesses of the time of virgil  the only defect of this brilliantly new idea was the difficulty of executing it the marquis had expressly ordered that not fewer than thirty shepherdesses were to be engagedfifteen for each bower it would have been easy to find double this number in pisa if beauty had been the only quality required in the attendant damsels but it was also absolutely necessary for the security of the marquiss gold and silver plate that the shepherdesses should possess besides good looks the very homely recommendation of a fair character this last qualification proved it is sad to say to be the one small merit which the majority of the ladies willing to accept engagements at the palace did not possess day after day passed on and the marquiss steward only found more and more difficulty in obtaining the appointed number of trustworthy beauties at last his resources failed him altogether and he appeared in his masters presence about a week before the night of the ball to make the humiliating acknowledgment that he was entirely at his wits end the total number of fair shepherdesses with fair characters whom he had been able to engage amounted only to twentythree  nonsense cried the marquis irritably as soon as the steward had made his confession i told you to get thirty girls and thirty i mean to have whats the use of shaking your head when all their dresses are ordered thirty tunics thirty wreaths thirty pairs of sandals and silk stockings thirty crooks you scoundreland you have the impudence to offer me only twentythree hands to hold them not a word i wont hear a word get me my thirty girls or lose your place the marquis roared out this last terrible sentence at the top of his voice and pointed peremptorily to the door  the steward knew his master too well to remonstrate he took his hat and cane and went out it was useless to look through the ranks of rejected volunteers again there was not the slightest hope in that quarter the only chance left was to call on all his friends in pisa who had daughters out at service and to try what he could accomplish by bribery and persuasion that way  after a whole day occupied in solicitations promises and patient smoothing down of innumerable difficulties the result of his efforts in the new direction was an accession of six more shepherdesses this brought him on bravely from twentythree to twentynine and left him at last with only one anxietywhere was he now to find shepherdess number thirty  he mentally asked himself that important question as he entered a shady bystreet in the neighborhood of the campo santo on his way back to the melani palace sauntering slowly along in the middle of the road and fanning himself with his handkerchief after the oppressive exertions of the day he passed a young girl who was standing at the street door of one of the houses apparently waiting for somebody to join her before she entered the building  body of bacchus exclaimed the steward using one of those old pagan ejaculations which survive in italy even to the present day there stands the prettiest girl i have seen yet if she would only be shepherdess number thirty i should go home to supper with my mind at ease ill ask her at any rate nothing can be lost by asking and everything may be gained stop my dear he continued seeing the girl turn to go into the house as he approached her dont be afraid of me i am steward to the marquis melani and well known in pisa as an eminently respectable man i have something to say to you which may be greatly for your benefit dont look surprised i am coming to the point at once do you want to earn a little money honestly of course you dont look as if you were very rich child  i am very poor and very much in want of some honest work to do answered the girl sadly  then we shall suit each other to a nicety for i have work of the pleasantest kind to give you and plenty of money to pay for it but before we say anything more about that suppose you tell me first something about yourselfwho you are and so forth you know who i am already  i am only a poor workgirl and my name is nanina i have nothing more sir to say about myself than that  do you belong to pisa  yes sirat least i did but i have been away for some time i was a year at florence employed in needlework  all by yourself  no sir with my little sister i was waiting for her when you came up  have you never done anything else but needlework never been out at service  yes sir for the last eight months i have had a situation to wait on a lady at florence and my sister who is turned eleven sir and can make herself very useful was allowed to help in the nursery  how came you to leave this situation  the lady and her family were going to rome sir they would have taken me with them but they could not take my sister we are alone in the world and we never have been parted from each other and never shall beso i was obliged to leave the situation  and here you are back at pisawith nothing to do i suppose  nothing yet sir we only came back yesterday  only yesterday you are a lucky girl let me tell you to have met with me i suppose you have somebody in the town who can speak to your character  the landlady of this house can sir  and who is she pray  marta angrisani sir  what the wellknown sicknurse you could not possibly have a better recommendation child i remember her being employed at the melani palace at the time of the marquiss last attack of gout but i never knew that she kept a lodginghouse  she and her daughter sir have owned this house longer than i can recollect my sister and i have lived in it since i was quite a little child and i had hoped we might be able to live here again but the top room we used to have is taken and the room to let lower down is far more i am afraid than we can afford  how much is it  nanina mentioned the weekly rent of the room in fear and trembling the steward burst out laughing  suppose i offered you money enough to be able to take that room for a whole year at once he said  nanina looked at him in speechless amazement  suppose i offered you that continued the steward and suppose i only ask you in return to put on a fine dress and serve refreshments in a beautiful room to the company at the marquis melanis grand ball what should you say to that  nanina said nothing she drew back a step or two and looked more bewildered than before  you must have heard of the ball said the steward pompously the poorest people in pisa have heard of it it is the talk of the whole city  still nanina made no answer to have replied truthfully she must have confessed that the talk of the whole city had now no interest for her the last news from pisa that had appealed to her sympathies was the news of the countess dascolis death and of fabios departure to travel in foreign countries since then she had heard nothing more of him she was as ignorant of his return to his native city as of all the reports connected with the marquiss ball something in her own heartsome feeling which she had neither the desire nor the capacity to analyzehad brought her back to pisa and to the old home which now connected itself with her tenderest recollections believing that fabio was still absent she felt that no ill motive could now be attributed to her return and she had not been able to resist the temptation of revisiting the scene that had been associated with the first great happiness as well as with the first great sorrow of her life among all the poor people of pisa she was perhaps the very last whose curiosity could be awakened or whose attention could be attracted by the rumor of gayeties at the melani palace  but she could not confess all this she could only listen with great humility and no small surprise while the steward in compassion for her ignorance and with the hope of tempting her into accepting his offered engagement described the arrangements of the approaching festival and dwelt fondly on the magnificence of the arcadian bowers and the beauty of the shepherdesses tunics as soon as he had done nanina ventured on the confession that she should feel rather nervous in a grand dress that did not belong to her and that she doubted very much her own capability of waiting properly on the great people at the ball the steward however would hear of no objections and called peremptorily for marta angrisani to make the necessary statement as to naninas character while this formality was being complied with to the stewards perfect satisfaction la biondella came in unaccompanied on this occasion by the usual companion of all her walks the learned poodle scarammuccia  this is naninas sister said the goodnatured sicknurse taking the first opportunity of introducing la biondella to the great marquiss great man a very good industrious little girl and very clever at plaiting dinnermats in case his excellency should ever want any what have you done with the dog my dear  i couldnt get him past the pork butchers three streets off replied la biondella he would sit down and look at the sausages i am more than half afraid he means to steal some of them  a very pretty child said the steward patting la biondella on the cheek we ought to have her at the hall if his excellency should want a cupid or a youthful nymph or anything small and light in that way i shall come back and let you know in the meantime nanina consider yourself shepherdess number thirty and come to the housekeepers room at the palace to try on your dress tomorrow nonsense dont talk to me about being afraid and awkward all youre wanted to do is to look pretty and your glass must have told you you could do that long ago remember the rent of the room my dear and dont stand in your light and your sisters does the little girl like sweetmeats of course she does well i promise you a whole box of sugarplums to take home for her if you will come and wait at the ball  oh go to the ball nanina go to the ball cried la biondella clapping her hands  of course she will go to the ball said the nurse she would be mad to throw away such an excellent chance  nanina looked perplexed she hesitated a little then drew marta angrisani away into a corner and whispered this question to her  do you think there will be any priests at the palace where the marquis lives  heavens child what a thing to ask returned the nurse priests at a masked ball you might as well expect to find turks performing high mass in the cathedral but supposing you did meet with priests at the palace what then  nothing said nanina constrainedly she turned pale and walked away as she spoke her great dread in returning to pisa was the dread of meeting with father rocco again she had never forgotten her first discovery at florence of his distrust of her the bare thought of seeing him any more after her faith in him had been shaken forever made her feel faint and sick at heart  tomorrow in the housekeepers room said the steward putting on his hat you will find your new dress all ready for you  nanina courtesied and ventured on no more objections the prospect of securing a home for a whole year to come among people whom she knew reconciled herinfluenced as she was also by marta angrisanis advice and by her sisters anxiety for the promised presentto brave the trial of appearing at the ball  what a comfort to have it all settled at last said the steward as soon as he was out again in the street we shall see what the marquis says now if he doesnt apologize for calling me a scoundrel the moment he sets eyes on number thirty he is the most ungrateful nobleman that ever existed  arriving in front of the palace the steward found workmen engaged in planning the external decorations and illuminations for the night of the ball a little crowd had already assembled to see the ladders raised and the scaffoldings put up he observed among them standing near the outskirts of the throng a lady who attracted his attention he was an ardent admirer of the fair sex by the beauty and symmetry of her figure while he lingered for a moment to look at her a shaggy poodledog licking his chops as if he had just had something to eat trotted by stopped suddenly close to the lady sniffed suspiciously for an instant and then began to growl at her without the slightest apparent provocation the steward advancing politely with his stick to drive the dog away saw the lady start and heard her exclaim to herself amazedly  you here you beast can nanina have come back to pisa  this last exclamation gave the steward as a gallant man an excuse for speaking to the elegant stranger  excuse me madam he said but i heard you mention the name of nanina may i ask whether you mean a pretty little workgirl who lives near the campo santo  the same said the lady looking very much surprised and interested immediately  it may be a gratification to you madam to know that she has just returned to pisa continued the steward politely and moreover that she is in a fair way to rise in the world i have just engaged her to wait at the marquiss grand ball and i need hardly say under those circumstances that if she plays her cards properly her fortune is made  the lady bowed looked at her informant very intently and thoughtfully for a moment then suddenly walked away without uttering a word  a curious woman thought the steward entering the palace i must ask number thirty about her tomorrow    chapter ii  the death of maddalena dascoli produced a complete change in the lives of her father and her uncle after the first shock of the bereavement was over luca lomi declared that it would be impossible for him to work in his studio againfor some time to come at leastafter the death of the beloved daughter with whom every corner of it was now so sadly and closely associated he accordingly accepted an engagement to assist in restoring several newly discovered works of ancient sculpture at naples and set forth for that city leaving the care of his workrooms at pisa entirely to his brother  on the mastersculptors departure father rocco caused the statues and busts to be carefully enveloped in linen cloths locked the studio doors and to the astonishment of all who knew of his former industry and dexterity as a sculptor never approached the place again his clerical duties he performed with the same assiduity as ever but he went out less than had been his custom hitherto to the houses of his friends his most regular visits were to the ascoli palace to inquire at the porters lodge after the health of maddalenas child who was always reported to be thriving admirably under the care of the best nurses that could be found in pisa as for any communications with his polite little friend from florence they had ceased months ago the informationspeedily conveyed to himthat nanina was in the service of one of the most respectable ladies in the city seemed to relieve any anxieties which he might otherwise have felt on her account he made no attempt to justify himself to her and only required that his overcourteous little visitor of former days should let him know whenever the girl might happen to leave her new situation  the admirers of father rocco seeing the alteration in his life and the increased quietness of his manner said that as he was growing older he was getting more and more above the things of this world his enemies for even father rocco had them did not scruple to assert that the change in him was decidedly for the worse and that he belonged to the order of men who are most to be distrusted when they become most subdued the priest himself paid no attention either to his eulogists or his depreciators nothing disturbed the regularity and discipline of his daily habits and vigilant scandal though she sought often to surprise him sought always in vain  such was father roccos life from the period of his nieces death to fabios return to pisa  as a matter of course the priest was one of the first to call at the palace and welcome the young nobleman back what passed between them at this interview never was precisely known but it was surmised readily enough that some misunderstanding had taken place for father rocco did not repeat his visit he made no complaints of fabio but simply stated that he had said something intended for the young mans good which had not been received in a right spirit and that he thought it desirable to avoid the painful chance of any further collision by not presenting himself at the palace again for some little time people were rather amazed at this they would have been still more surprised if the subject of the masked ball had not just then occupied all their attention and prevented their noticing it by another strange event in connection with the priest father rocco some weeks after the cessation of his intercourse with fabio returned one morning to his old way of life as a sculptor and opened the longclosed doors of his brothers studio  luca lomis former workmen discovering this applied to him immediately for employment but were informed that their services would not be needed visitors called at the studio but were always sent away again by the disappointing announcement that there was nothing new to show them so the days passed on until nanina left her situation and returned to pisa this circumstance was duly reported to father rocco by his correspondent at florence but whether he was too much occupied among the statues or whether it was one result of his cautious resolution never to expose himself unnecessarily to so much as the breath of detraction he made no attempt to see nanina or even to justify himself toward her by writing her a letter all his mornings continued to be spent alone in the studio and all his afternoons to be occupied by his clerical duties until the day before the masked ball at the melani palace  early on that day he covered over the statues and locked the doors of the workrooms once more then returned to his own lodgings and did not go out again one or two of his friends who wanted to see him were informed that he was not well enough to be able to receive them if they had penetrated into his little study and had seen him they would have been easily satisfied that this was no mere excuse they would have noticed that his face was startlingly pale and that the ordinary composure of his manner was singularly disturbed  toward evening this restlessness increased and his old housekeeper on pressing him to take some nourishment was astonished to hear him answer her sharply and irritably for the first time since she had been in his service a little later her surprise was increased by his sending her with a note to the ascoli palace and by the quick return of an answer brought ceremoniously by one of fabios servants it is long since he has had any communication with that quarter are they going to be friends again thought the housekeeper as she took the answer upstairs to her master  i feel better tonight he said as he read it well enough indeed to venture out if any one inquires for me tell them that i am gone to the ascoli palace saying this he walked to the door then returned and trying the lock of his cabinet satisfied himself that it was properly secured then went out  he found fabio in one of the large drawingrooms of the palace walking irritably backward and forward with several little notes crumpled together in his hands and a plain black domino dress for the masquerade of the ensuing night spread out on one of the tables  i was just going to write to you said the young man abruptly when i received your letter you offer me a renewal of our friendship and i accept the offer i have no doubt those references of yours when we last met to the subject of second marriages were well meant but they irritated me and speaking under that irritation i said words that i had better not have spoken if i pained you i am sorry for it wait pardon me for one moment i have not quite done yet it seems that you are by no means the only person in pisa to whom the question of my possibly marrying again appears to have presented itself ever since it was known that i intended to renew my intercourse with society at the ball tomorrow night i have been persecuted by anonymous lettersinfamous letters written from some motive which it is impossible for me to understand i want your advice on the best means of discovering the writers and i have also a very important question to ask you but read one of the letters first yourself any one will do as a sample of the rest  fixing his eyes searchingly on the priest he handed him one of the notes still a little paler than usual father rocco sat down by the nearest lamp and shading his eyes read these lines   count fabioit is the common talk of pisa that you are likely as a young man left with a motherless child to marry again your having accepted an invitation to the melani palace gives a color of truth to this report widowers who are true to the departed do not go among all the handsomest single women in a city at a masked ball reconsider your determination and remain at home i know you and i knew your wife and i say to you solemnly avoid temptation for you must never marry again neglect my advice and you will repent it to the end of your life i have reasons for what i sayserious fatal reasons which i cannot divulge if you would let your wife lie easy in her grave if you would avoid a terrible warning go not to the masked ball   i ask you and i ask any man if that is not infamous exclaimed fabio passionately as the priest handed him back the letter an attempt to work on my fears through the memory of my poor dead wife an insolent assumption that i want to marry again when i myself have not even so much as thought of the subject at all what is the secret object of this letter and of the rest here that resemble it whose interest is it to keep me away from the ball what is the meaning of such a phrase as if you would let your wife lie easy in her grave have you no advice to give meno plan to propose for discovering the vile hand that traced these lines speak to me why in heavens name dont you speak  the priest leaned his head on his hand and turning his face from the light as if it dazzled his eyes replied in his lowest and quietest tones  i cannot speak till i have had time to think the mystery of that letter is not to be solved in a moment there are things in it that are enough to perplex and amaze any man  what things  it is impossible for me to go into detailsat least at the present moment  you speak with a strange air of secrecy have you nothing definite to sayno advice to give me  i should advise you not to go to the ball  you would why  if i gave you my reasons i am afraid i should only be irritating you to no purpose  father rocco neither your words nor your manner satisfy me you speak in riddles and you sit there in the dark with your face hidden from me  the priest instantly started up and turned his face to the light  i recommend you to control your temper and to treat me with common courtesy he said in his quietest firmest tones looking at fabio steadily while he spoke  we will not prolong this interview said the young man calming himself by an evident effort i have one question to ask you and then no more to say  the priest bowed his head in token that he was ready to listen he still stood up calm pale and firm in the full light of the lamp  it is just possible continued fabio that these letters may refer to some incautious words which my late wife might have spoken i ask you as her spiritual director and as a near relation who enjoyed her confidence if you ever heard her express a wish in the event of my surviving her that i should abstain from marrying again  did she never express such a wish to you  never but why do you evade my question by asking me another  it is impossible for me to reply to your question  for what reason  because it is impossible for me to give answers which must refer whether they are affirmative or negative to what i have heard in confession  we have spoken enough said fabio turning angrily from the priest i expected you to help me in clearing up these mysteries and you do your best to thicken them what your motives are what your conduct means it is impossible for me to know but i say to you what i would say in far other terms if they were here to the villains who have written these lettersno menaces no mysteries no conspiracies will prevent me from being at the ball tomorrow i can listen to persuasion but i scorn threats there lies my dress for the masquerade no power on earth shall prevent me from wearing it tomorrow night he pointed as he spoke to the black domino and halfmask lying on the table  no power on earth repeated father rocco with a smile and an emphasis on the last word superstitious still count fabio do you suspect the powers of the other world of interfering with mortals at masquerades  fabio started and turning from the table fixed his eyes intently on the priests face  you suggested just now that we had better not prolong this interview said father rocco still smiling i think you were right if we part at once we may still part friends you have had my advice not to go to the ball and you decline following it i have nothing more to say goodnight  before fabio could utter the angry rejoinder that rose to his lips the door of the room had opened and closed again and the priest was gone    chapter iii  the next night at the time of assembling specified in the invitations to the masked ball fabio was still lingering in his palace and still allowing the black domino to lie untouched and unheeded on his dressingtable this delay was not produced by any change in his resolution to go to the melani palace his determination to be present at the ball remained unshaken and yet at the last moment he lingered and lingered on without knowing why some strange influence seemed to be keeping him within the walls of his lonely home it was as if the great empty silent palace had almost recovered on that night the charm which it had lost when its mistress died  he left his own apartment and went to the bedroom where his infant child lay asleep in her little crib he sat watching her and thinking quietly and tenderly of many past events in his life for a long time then returned to his room a sudden sense of loneliness came upon him after his visit to the childs bedside but he did not attempt to raise his spirits even then by going to the ball he descended instead to his study lighted his readinglamp and then opening a bureau took from one of the drawers in it the letter which nanina had written to him this was not the first time that a sudden sense of his solitude had connected itself inexplicably with the remembrance of the workgirls letter  he read it through slowly and when he had done kept it open in his hand i have youth titles wealth he thought to himself sadly everything that is sought after in this world and yet if i try to think of any human being who really and truly loves me i can remember but onethe poor faithful girl who wrote these lines  old recollections of the first day when he met with nanina of the first sitting she had given him in luca lomis studio of the first visit to the neat little room in the bystreet began to rise more and more vividly in his mind entirely absorbed by them he sat absently drawing with pen and ink on some sheets of letterpaper lying under his hand lines and circles and fragments of decorations and vague remembrances of old ideas for statues until the sudden sinking of the flame of his lamp awoke his attention abruptly to present things  he looked at his watch it was close on midnight  this discovery at last aroused him to the necessity of immediate departure in a few minutes he had put on his domino and mask and was on his way to the ball  before he reached the melani palace the first part of the entertainment had come to an end the toy symphony had been played the grotesque dance performed amid universal laughter and now the guests were for the most part fortifying themselves in the arcadian bowers for new dances in which all persons present were expected to take part the marquis melani had with characteristic oddity divided his two classical refreshmentrooms into what he termed the light and heavy departments fruit pastry sweetmeats salads and harmless drinks were included under the first head and all the stimulating liquors and solid eatables under the last the thirty shepherdesses had been according to the marquiss order equally divided at the outset of the evening between the two rooms but as the company began to crowd more and more resolutely in the direction of the heavy department ten of the shepherdesses attached to the light department were told off to assist in attending on the hungry and thirsty majority of guests who were not to be appeased by pastry and lemonade among the five girls who were left behind in the room for the light refreshments was nanina the steward soon discovered that the novelty of her situation made her really nervous and he wisely concluded that if he trusted her where the crowd was greatest and the noise loudest she would not only be utterly useless but also very much in the way of her more confident and experienced companions  when fabio arrived at the palace the jovial uproar in the heavy department was at its height and several gentlemen fired by the classical costumes of the shepherdesses were beginning to speak latin to them with a thick utterance and a valorous contempt for all restrictions of gender number and case as soon as he could escape from the congratulations on his return to his friends which poured on him from all sides fabio withdrew to seek some quieter room the heat noise and confusion had so bewildered him after the tranquil life he had been leading for many months past that it was quite a relief to stroll through the half deserted dancingrooms to the opposite extremity of the great suite of apartments and there to find himself in a second arcadian bower which seemed peaceful enough to deserve its name  a few guests were in this room when he first entered it but the distant sound of some first notes of dance music drew them all away after a careless look at the quaint decorations about him he sat down alone on a divan near the door and beginning already to feel the heat and discomfort of his mask took it off he had not removed it more than a moment before he heard a faint cry in the direction of a long refreshmenttable behind which the five waitinggirls were standing he started up directly and could hardly believe his senses when he found himself standing face to face with nanina  her cheeks had turned perfectly colorless her astonishment at seeing the young nobleman appeared to have some sensation of terror mingled with it the waitingwoman who happened to stand by her side instinctively stretched out an arm to support her observing that she caught at the edge of the table as fabio hurried round to get behind it and speak to her when he drew near her head drooped on her breast and she said faintly i never knew you were at pisa i never thought you would be here oh i am true to what i said in my letter though i seem so false to it  i want to speak to you about the letterto tell you how carefully i have kept it how often i have read it said fabio  she turned away her head and tried hard to repress the tears that would force their way into her eyes we should never have met she said never never have met again  before fabio could reply the waitingwoman by naninas side interposed  for heavens sake dont stop speaking to her here she exclaimed impatiently if the steward or one of the upper servants was to come in you would get her into dreadful trouble wait till tomorrow and find some fitter place than this  fabio felt the justice of the reproof immediately he tore a leaf out of his pocketbook and wrote on it i must tell you how i honor and thank you for that letter tomorrowten oclockthe wicketgate at the back of the ascoli gardens believe in my truth and honor nanina for i believe implicitly in yours having written these lines he took from among his bunch of watchseals a little key wrapped it up in the note and pressed it into her hand in spite of himself his fingers lingered round hers and he was on the point of speaking to her again when he saw the waitingwomans hand which was just raised to motion him away suddenly drop her color changed at the same moment and she looked fixedly across the table  he turned round immediately and saw a masked woman standing alone in the room dressed entirely in yellow from head to foot she had a yellow hood a yellow halfmask with deep fringe hanging down over her mouth and a yellow domino cut at the sleeves and edges into long flameshaped points which waved backward and forward tremulously in the light air wafted through the doorway the womans black eyes seemed to gleam with an evil brightness through the sightholes of the mask and the tawny fringe hanging before her mouth fluttered slowly with every breath she drew without a word or a gesture she stood before the table and her gleaming black eyes fixed steadily on fabio the instant he confronted her a sudden chill struck through him as he observed that the yellow of the strangers domino and mask was of precisely the same shade as the yellow of the hangings and furniture which his wife had chosen after their marriage for the decoration of her favorite sittingroom  the yellow mask whispered the waitinggirls nervously crowding together behind the table the yellow mask again  make her speak  ask her to have something  this gentleman will ask her speak to her sir do speak to her she glides about in that fearful yellow dress like a ghost  fabio looked around mechanically at the girl who was whispering to him he saw at the same time that nanina still kept her head turned away and that she had her handkerchief at her eyes she was evidently struggling yet with the agitation produced by their unexpected meeting and was most probably for that reason the only person in the room not conscious of the presence of the yellow mask  speak to her sir do speak to her whispered two of the waitinggirls together  fabio turned again toward the table the black eyes were still gleaming at him from behind the tawny yellow of the mask he nodded to the girls who had just spoken cast one farewell look at nanina and moved down the room to get round to the side of the table at which the yellow mask was standing step by step as he moved the bright eyes followed him steadily and more steadily their evil light seemed to shine through and through him as he turned the corner of the table and approached the still spectral figure  he came close up to the woman but she never moved her eyes never wavered for an instant he stopped and tried to speak but the chill struck through him again an overpowering dread an unutterable loathing seized on him all sense of outer thingsthe whispering of the waitinggirls behind the table the gentle cadence of the dance music the distant hum of joyous talksuddenly left him he turned away shuddering and quitted the room  following the sound of the music and desiring before all things now to join the crowd wherever it was largest he was stopped in one of the smaller apartments by a gentleman who had just risen from the card table and who held out his hand with the cordiality of an old friend  welcome back to the world count fabio he began gayly then suddenly checked himself why you look pale and your hand feels cold not ill i hope  no no i have been rather startledi cant say whyby a very strangely dressed woman who fairly stared me out of countenance  you dont mean the yellow mask  yes i do have you seen her  everybody has seen her but nobody can make her unmask or get her to speak our host has not the slightest notion who she is and our hostess is horribly frightened at her for my part i think she has given us quite enough of her mystery and her grim dress and if my name instead of being nothing but plain andrea darbino was marquis melani i would say to her madam we are here to laugh and amuse ourselves suppose you open your lips and charm us by appearing in a prettier dress  during this conversation they had sat down together with their backs toward the door by the side of one of the cardtables while darbino was speaking fabio suddenly felt himself shuddering again and became conscious of a sound of low breathing behind him  he turned round instantly and there standing between them and peering down at them was the yellow mask  fabio started up and his friend followed his example again the gleaming black eyes rested steadily on the young noblemans face and again their look chilled him to the heart  yellow lady do you know my friend exclaimed darbino with mock solemnity  there was no answer the fatal eyes never moved from fabios face  yellow lady continued the other listen to the music will you dance with me  the eyes looked away and the figure glided slowly from the room  my dear count said darbino that woman seems to have quite an effect on you i declare she has left you paler than ever come into the supperroom with me and have some wine you really look as if you wanted it  they went at once to the large refreshmentroom nearly all the guests had by this time begun to dance again they had the whole apartment therefore almost entirely to themselves  among the decorations of the room which were not strictly in accordance with genuine arcadian simplicity was a large lookingglass placed over a wellfurnished sideboard darbino led fabio in this direction exchanging greetings as he advanced with a gentleman who stood near the glass looking into it and carelessly fanning himself with his mask  my dear friend cried darbino you are the very man to lead us straight to the best bottle of wine in the palace count fabio let me present to you my intimate and good friend the cavaliere finello with whose family i know you are well acquainted finello the count is a little out of spirits and i have prescribed a good dose of wine i see a whole row of bottles at your side and i leave it to you to apply the remedy glasses there three glasses my lovely shepherdess with the black eyesthe three largest you have got  the glasses were brought the cavaliere finello chose a particular bottle and filled them all three gentlemen turned round to the sideboard to use it as a table and thus necessarily faced the lookingglass  now let us drink the toast of toasts said darbino finello count fabiothe ladies of pisa  fabio raised the wine to his lips and was on the point of drinking it when he saw reflected in the glass the figure of the yellow mask the glittering eyes were again fixed on him and the yellowhooded head bowed slowly as if in acknowledgment of the toast he was about to drink for the third time the strange chill seized him and he set down his glass of wine untasted  what is the matter asked darbino  have you any dislike count to that particular wine inquired the cavaliere  the yellow mask whispered fabio the yellow mask again  they all three turned round directly toward the door but it was too latethe figure had disappeared  does any one know who this yellow mask is asked finello one may guess by the walk that the figure is a womans perhaps it may be the strange color she has chosen for her dress or perhaps her stealthy way of moving from room to room but there is certainly something mysterious and startling about her  startling enough as the count would tell you said darbino the yellow mask has been responsible for his loss of spirits and change of complexion and now she has prevented him even from drinking his wine  i cant account for it said fabio looking round him uneasily but this is the third room into which she has followed methe third time she has seemed to fix her eyes on me alone i suppose my nerves are hardly in a fit state yet for masked balls and adventures the sight of her seems to chill me who can she be  if she followed me a fourth time said finello i should insist on her unmasking  and suppose she refused asked his friend  then i should take her mask off for her  it is impossible to do that with a woman said fabio i prefer trying to lose her in the crowd excuse me gentlemen if i leave you to finish the wine and then to meet me if you like in the great ballroom  he retired as he spoke put on his mask and joined the dancers immediately taking care to keep always in the most crowded corner of the apartment for some time this plan of action proved successful and he saw no more of the mysterious yellow domino ere long however some new dances were arranged in which the great majority of the persons in the ballroom took part the figures resembling the old english country dances in this respect that the ladies and gentlemen were placed in long rows opposite to each other the sets consisted of about twenty couples each placed sometimes across and sometimes along the apartment and the spectators were all required to move away on either side and range themselves close to the walls as fabio among others complied with this necessity he looked down a row of dancers waiting during the performance of the orchestral prelude and there watching him again from the opposite end of the lane formed by the gentlemen on one side and the ladies on the other he saw the yellow mask  he moved abruptly back toward another row of dancers placed at right angles to the first row and there again at the opposite end of the gay lane of brightlydressed figures was the yellow mask he slipped into the middle of the room but it was only to find her occupying his former position near the wall and still in spite of his disguise watching him through row after row of dancers the persecution began to grow intolerable he felt a kind of angry curiosity mingling now with the vague dread that had hitherto oppressed him finellos advice recurred to his memory and he determined to make the woman unmask at all hazards with this intention he returned to the supperroom in which he had left his friends  they were gone probably to the ballroom to look for him plenty of wine was still left on the sideboard and he poured himself out a glass finding that his hand trembled as he did so he drank several more glasses in quick succession to nerve himself for the approaching encounter with the yellow mask while he was drinking he expected every moment to see her in the lookingglass again but she never appearedand yet he felt almost certain that he had detected her gliding out after him when he left the ballroom  he thought it possible that she might be waiting for him in one of the smaller apartments and taking off his mask walked through several of them without meeting her until he came to the door of the refreshmentroom in which nanina and he had recognized each other the waitingwoman behind the table who had first spoken to him caught sight of him now and ran round to the door  dont come in and speak to nanina again she said mistaking the purpose which had brought him to the door what with frightening her first and making her cry afterward you have rendered her quite unfit for her work the steward is in there at this moment very goodnatured but not very sober he says she is pale and redeyed and not fit to be a shepherdess any longer and that as she will not be missed now she may go home if she likes we have got her an old cloak and she is going to try and slip through the rooms unobserved to get downstairs and change her dress dont speak to her pray or you will only make her cry again and what is worse make the steward fancy  she stopped at that last word and pointed suddenly over fabios shoulder  the yellow mask she exclaimed oh sir draw her away into the ballroom and give nanina a chance of getting out  fabio turned directly and approached the mask who as they looked at each other slowly retreated before him the waitingwoman seeing the yellow figure retire hastened back to nanina in the refreshmentroom  slowly the masked woman retreated from one apartment to another till she entered a corridor brilliantly lighted up and beautifully ornamented with flowers on the right hand this corridor led to the ballroom on the left to an antechamber at the head of the palace staircase the yellow mask went on a few paces toward the left then stopped the bright eyes fixed themselves as before on fabios face but only for a moment he heard a light step behind him and then he saw the eyes move following the direction they took he turned round and discovered nanina wrapped up in the old cloak which was to enable her to get downstairs unobserved  oh how can i get out how can i get out cried the girl shrinking back affrightedly as she saw the yellow mask  that way said fabio pointing in the direction of the ballroom nobody will notice you in the cloak it will only be thought some new disguise he took her arm as he spoke to reassure her and continued in a whisper dont forget tomorrow  at the same moment he felt a hand laid on him it was the hand of the masked woman and it put him back from nanina  in spite of himself he trembled at her touch but still retained presence of mind enough to sign to the girl to make her escape with a look of eager inquiry in the direction of the mask and a half suppressed exclamation of terror she obeyed him and hastened away toward the ballroom  we are alone said fabio confronting the gleaming black eyes and reaching out his hand resolutely toward the yellow mask tell me who you are and why you follow me or i will uncover your face and solve the mystery for myself  the woman pushed his hand aside and drew back a few paces but never spoke a word he followed her there was not an instant to be lost for just then the sound of footsteps hastily approaching the corridor became audible  now or never he whispered to himself and snatched at the mask  his arm was again thrust aside but this time the woman raised her disengaged hand at the same moment and removed the yellow mask  the lamps shed their soft light full on her face  it was the face of his dead wife    chapter iv  signor andrea darbino searching vainly through the various rooms in the palace for count fabio dascoli and trying as a last resource the corridor leading to the ballroom and grand staircase discovered his friend lying on the floor in a swoon without any living creature near him determining to avoid alarming the guests if possible darbino first sought help in the antechamber he found there the marquiss valet assisting the cavaliere finello who was just taking his departure to put on his cloak  while finello and his friend carried fabio to an open window in the antechamber the valet procured some iced water this simple remedy and the change of atmosphere proved enough to restore the fainting man to his senses but hardlyas it seemed to his friendsto his former self they noticed a change to blankness and stillness in his face and when he spoke an indescribable alteration in the tone of his voice  i found you in a room in the corridor said darbino what made you faint dont you remember was it the heat  fabio waited for a moment painfully collecting his ideas he looked at the valet and finello signed to the man to withdraw  was it the heat repeated darbino  no answered fabio in strangely hushed steady tones i have seen the face that was behind the yellow mask  well  it was the face of my dead wife  your dead wife  when the mask was removed i saw her face not as i remember it in the pride of her youth and beautynot even as i remember her on her sickbedbut as i remember her in her coffin  count for gods sake rouse yourself collect your thoughtsremember where you areand free your mind of its horrible delusion  spare me all remonstrances i am not fit to bear them my life has only one object nowthe pursuing of this mystery to the end will you help me i am scarcely fit to act for myself  he still spoke in the same unnaturally hushed deliberate tones darbino and finello exchanged glances behind him as he rose from the sofa on which he had hitherto been lying  we will help you in everything said darbino soothingly trust in us to the end what do you wish to do first  the figure must have gone through this room let us descend the staircase and ask the servants if they have seen it pass  both darbino and finello remarked that he did not say her  they inquired down to the very courtyard not one of the servants had seen the yellow mask  the last resource was the porter at the outer gate they applied to him and in answer to their questions he asserted that he had most certainly seen a lady in a yellow domino and mask drive away about half an hour before in a hired coach  should you remember the coachman again asked darbino  perfectly he is an old friend of mine  and you know where he lives  yes as well as i know where i do  any reward you like if you can get somebody to mind your lodge and can take us to that house  in a few minutes they were following the porter through the dark silent streets we had better try the stables first said the man my friend the coachman will hardly have had time to do more than set the lady down we shall most likely catch him just putting up his horses  the porter turned out to be right on entering the stableyard they found that the empty coach had just driven into it  you have been taking home a lady in a yellow domino from the masquerade said darbino putting some money into the coachmans hand  yes sir i was engaged by that lady for the eveningengaged to drive her to the ball as well as to drive her home  where did you take her from  from a very extraordinary placefrom the gate of the campo santo burialground  during this colloquy finello and darbino had been standing with fabio between them each giving him an arm the instant the last answer was given he reeled back with a cry of horror  where have you taken her to now asked darbino he looked about him nervously as he put the question and spoke for the first time in a whisper  to the campo santo again said the coachman  fabio suddenly drew his arms out of the arms of his friends and sank to his knees on the ground hiding his face from some broken ejaculations which escaped him it seemed as if he dreaded that his senses were leaving him and that he was praying to be preserved in his right mind  why is he so violently agitated said finello eagerly to his friend  hush returned the other you heard him say that when he saw the face behind the yellow mask it was the face of his dead wife  yes but what then  his wife was buried in the campo santo    chapter v  of all the persons who had been present in any capacity at the marquis melanis ball the earliest riser on the morning after it was nanina the agitation produced by the strange events in which she had been concerned destroyed the very idea of sleep through the hours of darkness she could not even close her eyes and as soon as the new day broke she rose to breathe the early morning air at her window and to think in perfect tranquillity over all that had passed since she entered the melani palace to wait on the guests at the masquerade  on reaching home the previous night all her other sensations had been absorbed in a vague feeling of mingled dread and curiosity produced by the sight of the weird figure in the yellow mask which she had left standing alone with fabio in the palace corridor the morning light however suggested new thoughts she now opened the note which the young nobleman had pressed into her hand and read over and over again the hurried pencil lines scrawled on the paper could there be any harm any forgetfulness of her own duty in using the key inclosed in the note and keeping her appointment in the ascoli gardens at ten oclock surely notsurely the last sentence he had written believe in my truth and honor nanina for i believe implicitly in yours was enough to satisfy her this time that she could not be doing wrong in listening for once to the pleading of her own heart and besides there in her lap lay the key of the wicketgate it was absolutely necessary to use that if only for the purpose of giving it back safely into the hand of its owner  as this last thought was passing through her mind and plausibly overcoming any faint doubts and difficulties which she might still have left she was startled by a sudden knocking at the street door and looking out of the window immediately saw a man in livery standing in the street anxiously peering up at the house to see if his knocking had aroused anybody  does marta angrisani the sicknurse live here inquired the man as soon as nanina showed herself at the window  yes she answered must i call her up is there some person ill  call her up directly said the servant she is wanted at the ascoli palace my master count fabio  nanina waited to hear no more she flew to the room in which the sicknurse slept and awoke her almost roughly in an instant  he is ill she cried breathlessly oh make haste make haste he is ill and he has sent for you  marta inquired who had sent for her and on being informed promised to lose no time nanina ran downstairs to tell the servant that the sicknurse was getting on her clothes the mans serious expression when she came close to him terrified her all her usual selfdistrust vanished and she entreated him without attempting to conceal her anxiety to tell her particularly what his masters illness was and how it had affected him so suddenly after the ball  i know nothing about it answered the man noticing naninas manner as she put her question with some surprise except that my master was brought home by two gentlemen friends of his about a couple of hours ago in a very sad state half out of his mind as it seemed to me i gathered from what was said that he had got a dreadful shock from seeing some woman take off her mask and show her face to him at the ball how that could be i dont in the least understand but i know that when the doctor was sent for he looked very serious and talked about fearing brainfever  here the servant stopped for to his astonishment he saw nanina suddenly turn away from him and then heard her crying bitterly as she went back into the house  marta angrisani had huddled on her clothes and was looking at herself in the glass to see that she was sufficiently presentable to appear at the palace when she felt two arms flung round her neck and before she could say a word found nanina sobbing on her bosom  he is illhe is in danger cried the girl i must go with you to help him you have always been kind to me martabe kinder than ever now take me with youtake me with you to the palace  you child exclaimed the nurse gently unclasping her arms  yesyes if it is only for an hour pleaded nanina if it is only for one little hour every day you have only to say that i am your helper and they would let me in marta i shall break my heart if i cant see him and help him to get well again  the nurse still hesitated nanina clasped her round the neck once more and laid her cheekburning hot now though the tears had been streaming down it but an instant beforeclose to the good womans face  i love him marta great as he is i love him with all my heart and soul and strength she went on in quick eager whispering tones and he loves me he would have married me if i had not gone away to save him from it i could keep my love for him a secret while he was well i could stifle it and crush it down and wither it up by absence but now he is ill it gets beyond me i cant master it oh marta dont break my heart by denying me i have suffered so much for his sake that i have earned the right to nurse him  marta was not proof against this last appeal she had one great and rare merit for a middleaged womanshe had not forgotten her own youth  come child said she soothingly i wont attempt to deny you dry your eyes put on your mantilla and when we get face to face with the doctor try to look as old and ugly as you can if you want to be let into the sickroom along with me  the ordeal of medical scrutiny was passed more easily than marta angrisani had anticipated it was of great importance in the doctors opinion that the sick man should see familiar faces at his bedside nanina had only therefore to state that he knew her well and that she had sat to him as a model in the days when he was learning the art of sculpture to be immediately accepted as martas privileged assistant in the sickroom  the worst apprehensions felt by the doctor for the patient were soon realized the fever flew to his brain for nearly six weeks he lay prostrate at the mercy of death now raging with the wild strength of delirium and now sunk in the speechless motionless sleepless exhaustion which was his only repose at last the blessed day came when he enjoyed his first sleep and when the doctor began for the first time to talk of the future with hope even then however the same terrible peculiarity marked his light dreams which had previously shown itself in his fierce delirium from the faintly uttered broken phrases which dropped from him when he slept as from the wild words which burst from him when his senses were deranged the one sad discovery inevitably resultedthat his mind was still haunted day and night hour after hour by the figure in the yellow mask  as his bodily health improved the doctor in attendance on him grew more and more anxious as to the state of his mind there was no appearance of any positive derangement of intellect but there was a mental depressionan unaltering invincible prostration produced by his absolute belief in the reality of the dreadful vision that he had seen at the masked ballwhich suggested to the physician the gravest doubts about the case he saw with dismay that the patient showed no anxiety as he got stronger except on one subject he was eagerly desirous of seeing nanina every day by his bedside but as soon as he was assured that his wish should be faithfully complied with he seemed to care for nothing more even when they proposed in the hope of rousing him to an exhibition of something like pleasure that the girl should read to him for an hour every day out of one of his favorite books he only showed a languid satisfaction weeks passed away and still do what they would they could not make him so much as smile  one day nanina had begun to read to him as usual but had not proceeded far before marta angrisani informed her that he had fallen into a doze she ceased with a sigh and sat looking at him sadly as he lay near her faint and pale and mournful in his sleepmiserably altered from what he was when she first knew him it had been a hard trial to watch by his bedside in the terrible time of his delirium but it was a harder trial still to look at him now and to feel less and less hopeful with each succeeding day  while her eyes and thoughts were still compassionately fixed on him the door of the bedroom opened and the doctor came in followed by andrea darbino whose share in the strange adventure with the yellow mask caused him to feel a special interest in fabios progress toward recovery  asleep i see and sighing in his sleep said the doctor going to the bedside the grand difficulty with him he continued turning to darbino remains precisely what it was i have hardly left a single means untried of rousing him from that fatal depression yet for the last fortnight he has not advanced a single step it is impossible to shake his conviction of the reality of that face which he saw or rather which he thinks he saw when the yellow mask was removed and as long as he persists in his own shocking view of the case so long he will lie there getting better no doubt as to his body but worse as to his mind  i suppose poor fellow he is not in a fit state to be reasoned with  on the contrary like all men with a fixed delusion he has plenty of intelligence to appeal to on every point except the one point on which he is wrong i have argued with him vainly by the hour together he possesses unfortunately an acute nervous sensibility and a vivid imagination and besides he has as i suspect been superstitiously brought up as a child it would be probably useless to argue rationally with him on certain spiritual subjects even if his mind was in perfect health he has a good deal of the mystic and the dreamer in his composition and science and logic are but broken reeds to depend upon with men of that kind  does he merely listen to you when you reason with him or does he attempt to answer  he has only one form of answer and that is unfortunately the most difficult of all to dispose of whenever i try to convince him of his delusion he invariably retorts by asking me for a rational explanation of what happened to him at the masked ball now neither you nor i though we believe firmly that he has been the dupe of some infamous conspiracy have been able as yet to penetrate thoroughly into this mystery of the yellow mask our common sense tells us that he must be wrong in taking his view of it and that we must be right in taking ours but if we cannot give him actual tangible proof of thatif we can only theorize when he asks us for an explanationit is but too plain in his present condition that every time we remonstrate with him on the subject we only fix him in his delusion more and more firmly  it is not for want of perseverance on my part said darbino after a moment of silence that we are still left in the dark ever since the extraordinary statement of the coachman who drove the woman home i have been inquiring and investigating i have offered the reward of two hundred scudi for the discovery of her i have myself examined the servants at the palace the nightwatchman at the campo santo the policebooks the lists of keepers of hotels and lodginghouses to hit on some trace of this woman and i have failed in all directions if my poor friends perfect recovery does indeed depend on his delusion being combated by actual proof i fear we have but little chance of restoring him so far as i am concerned i confess myself at the end of my resources  i hope we are not quite conquered yet returned the doctor the proofs we want may turn up when we least expect them it is certainly a miserable case he continued mechanically laying his fingers on the sleeping mans pulse there he lies wanting nothing now but to recover the natural elasticity of his mind and here we stand at his bedside unable to relieve him of the weight that is pressing his faculties down i repeat it signor andrea nothing will rouse him from his delusion that he is the victim of a supernatural interposition but the production of some startling practical proof of his error at present he is in the position of a man who has been imprisoned from his birth in a dark room and who denies the existence of daylight if we cannot open the shutters and show him the sky outside we shall never convert him to a knowledge of the truth  saying these words the doctor turned to lead the way out of the room and observed nanina who had moved from the bedside on his entrance standing near the door he stopped to look at her shook his head goodhumoredly and called to marta who happened to be occupied in an adjoining room  signora marta said the doctor i think you told me some time ago that your pretty and careful little assistant lives in your house pray does she take much walking exercise  very little signor dottore she goes home to her sister when she leaves the palace very little walking exercise indeed  i thought so her pale cheeks and heavy eyes told me as much now my dear said the doctor addressing nanina you are a very good girl and i am sure you will attend to what i tell you go out every morning before you come here and take a walk in the fresh air you are too young not to suffer by being shut up in close rooms every day unless you get some regular exercise take a good long walk in the morning or you will fall into my hands as a patient and be quite unfit to continue your attendance here now signor andrea i am ready for you mind my child a walk every day in the open air outside the town or you will fall ill take my word for it  nanina promised compliance but she spoke rather absently and seemed scarcely conscious of the kind familiarity which marked the doctors manner the truth was that all her thoughts were occupied with what he had been saying by fabios bedside she had not lost one word of the conversation while the doctor was talking of his patient and of the conditions on which his recovery depended oh if that proof which would cure him could only be found she thought to herself as she stole back anxiously to the bedside when the room was empty  on getting home that day she found a letter waiting for her and was greatly surprised to see that it was written by no less a person than the mastersculptor luca lomi it was very short simply informing her that he had just returned to pisa and that he was anxious to know when she could sit to him for a new busta commission from a rich foreigner at naples  nanina debated with herself for a moment whether she should answer the letter in the hardest way to her by writing or in the easiest way in person and decided on going to the studio and telling the mastersculptor that it would be impossible for her to serve him as a model at least for some time to come it would have taken her a long hour to say this with due propriety on paper it would only take her a few minutes to say it with her own lips so she put on her mantilla again and departed for the studio  on arriving at the gate and ringing the bell a thought suddenly occurred to her which she wondered had not struck her before was it not possible that she might meet father rocco in his brothers workroom it was too late to retreat now but not too late to ask before she entered if the priest was in the studio accordingly when one of the workmen opened the door to her she inquired first very confusedly and anxiously for father rocco hearing that he was not with his brother then she went tranquilly enough to make her apologies to the mastersculptor  she did not think it necessary to tell him more than that she was now occupied every day by nursing duties in a sickroom and that it was consequently out of her power to attend at the studio luca lomi expressed and evidently felt great disappointment at her failing him as a model and tried hard to persuade her that she might find time enough if she chose to sit to him as well as to nurse the sick person the more she resisted his arguments and entreaties the more obstinately he reiterated them he was dusting his favorite busts and statues after his long absence with a featherbrush when she came in and he continued this occupation all the while he was talkingurging a fresh plea to induce nanina to reconsider her refusal to sit at every fresh piece of sculpture he came to and always receiving the same resolute apology from her as she slowly followed him down the studio toward the door  arriving thus at the lower end of the room luca stopped with a fresh argument on his lips before his statue of minerva he had dusted it already but he lovingly returned to dust it again it was his favorite workthe only good likeness although it did assume to represent a classical subject of his dead daughter that he possessed he had refused to part with it for maddalenas sake and as he now approached it with his brush for the second time he absently ceased speaking and mounted on a stool to look at the face near and blow some specks of dust off the forehead nanina thought this a good opportunity of escaping from further importunities she was on the point of slipping away to the door with a word of farewell when a sudden exclamation from luca lomi arrested her  plaster cried the mastersculptor looking intently at that part of the hair of the statue which lay lowest on the forehead plaster here he took out his penknife as he spoke and removed a tiny morsel of some white substance from an interstice between two folds of the hair where it touched the face it is plaster he exclaimed excitedly somebody has been taking a cast from the face of my statue  he jumped off the stool and looked all round the studio with an expression of suspicious inquiry i must have this cleared up he said my statues were left under roccos care and he is answerable if there has been any stealing of casts from any one of them i must question him directly  nanina seeing that he took no notice of her felt that she might now easily effect her retreat she opened the studio door and repeated for the twentieth time at least that she was sorry she could not sit to him  i am sorry too child he said irritably looking about for his hat he found it apparently just as nanina was going out for she heard him call to one of the workmen in the inner studio and order the man to say if anybody wanted him that he had gone to father roccos lodgings    chapter vi  the next morning when nanina rose a bad attack of headache and a sense of languor and depression reminded her of the necessity of following the doctors advice and preserving her health by getting a little fresh air and exercise she had more than two hours to spare before the usual time when her daily attendance began at the ascoli palace and she determined to employ the interval of leisure in taking a morning walk outside the town la biondella would have been glad enough to go too but she had a large order for dinnermats on hand and was obliged for that day to stop in the house and work thus it happened that when nanina set forth from home the learned poodle scarammuccia was her only companion  she took the nearest way out of the town the dog trotting along in his usual steady observant way close at her side pushing his great rough muzzle from time to time affectionately into her hand and trying hard to attract her attention at intervals by barking and capering in front of her he got but little notice however for his pains nanina was thinking again of all that the physician had said the day before by fabios bedside and these thoughts brought with them others equally absorbing that were connected with the mysterious story of the young noblemans adventure with the yellow mask thus preoccupied she had little attention left for the gambols of the dog even the beauty of the morning appealed to her in vain she felt the refreshment of the cool fragrant air but she hardly noticed the lovely blue of the sky or the bright sunshine that gave a gayety and an interest to the commonest objects around her  after walking nearly an hour she began to feel tired and looked about for a shady place to rest in  beyond and behind her there was only the highroad and the flat country but by her side stood a little wooden building half inn half coffeehouse backed by a large shady pleasuregarden the gates of which stood invitingly open some workmen in the garden were putting up a stage for fireworks but the place was otherwise quiet and lonely enough it was only used at night as a sort of rustic ranelagh to which the citizens of pisa resorted for pure air and amusement after the fatigues of the day observing that there were no visitors in the grounds nanina ventured in intending to take a quarter of an hours rest in the coolest place she could find before returning to pisa  she had passed the back of a wooden summerhouse in a secluded part of the gardens when she suddenly missed the dog from her side and looking round after him saw that he was standing behind the summerhouse with his ears erect and his nose to the ground having evidently that instant scented something that excited his suspicion  thinking it possible that he might be meditating an attack on some unfortunate cat she turned to see what he was watching the carpenters engaged on the firework stage were just then hammering at it violently the noise prevented her from hearing that scarammuccia was growling but she could feel that he was the moment she laid her hand on his back her curiosity was excited and she stooped down close to him to look through a crack in the boards before which he stood into the summerhouse  she was startled at seeing a lady and gentleman sitting inside the place she was looking through was not high enough up to enable her to see their faces but she recognized or thought she recognized the pattern of the ladys dress as one which she had noticed in former days in the demoiselle grifonis showroom rising quickly her eye detected a hole in the boards about the level of her own height caused by a knot having been forced out of the wood she looked through it to ascertain without being discovered if the wearer of the familiar dress was the person she had taken her to be and saw not brigida only as she had expected but father rocco as well at the same moment the carpenters left off hammering and began to saw the new sound from the firework stage was regular and not loud the voices of the occupants of the summerhouse reached her through it and she heard brigida pronounce the name of count fabio  instantly stooping down once more by the dogs side she caught his muzzle firmly in both her hands it was the only way to keep scarammuccia from growling again at a time when there was no din of hammering to prevent him from being heard those two words count fabio in the mouth of another woman excited a jealous anxiety in her what could brigida have to say in connection with that name she never came near the ascoli palacewhat right or reason could she have to talk of fabio  did you hear what i said she heard brigida ask in her coolest hardest tone  no the priest answered at least not all of it  i will repeat it then i asked what had so suddenly determined you to give up all idea of making any future experiments on the superstitious fears of count fabio  in the first place the result of the experiment already tried has been so much more serious than i had anticipated that i believe the end i had in view in making it has been answered already  well that is not your only reason  another shock to his mind might be fatal to him i can use what i believe to be a justifiable fraud to prevent his marrying again but i cannot burden myself with a crime  that is your second reason but i believe you have another yet the suddenness with which you sent to me last night to appoint a meeting in this lonely place the emphatic manner in which you requestedi may almost say orderedme to bring the wax mask here suggest to my mind that something must have happened what is it i am a woman and my curiosity must be satisfied after the secrets you have trusted to me already you need not hesitate i think to trust me with one more  perhaps not the secret this time is moreover of no great importance you know that the wax mask you wore at the ball was made in a plaster mold taken off the face of my brothers statue  yes i know that  my brother has just returned to his studio has found a morsel of the plaster i used for the mold sticking in the hair of the statue and has asked me as the person left in charge of his workrooms for an explanation such an explanation as i could offer has not satisfied him and he talks of making further inquiries considering that it will be used no more i think it safest to destroy the wax mask and i asked you to bring it here that i might see it burned or broken up with my own eyes now you know all you wanted to know and now therefore it is my turn to remind you that i have not yet had a direct answer to the first question i addressed to you when we met here have you brought the wax mask with you or have you not  i have not  and why  just as that question was put nanina felt the dog dragging himself free of her grasp on his mouth she had been listening hitherto with such painful intensity with such allabsorbing emotions of suspense terror and astonishment that she had not noticed his efforts to get away and had continued mechanically to hold his mouth shut but now she was aroused by the violence of his struggles to the knowledge that unless she hit upon some new means of quieting him he would have his mouth free and would betray her by a growl  in an agony of apprehension lest she should lose a word of the momentous conversation she made a desperate attempt to appeal to the dogs fondness for her by suddenly flinging both her arms round his neck and kissing his rough hairy cheek the stratagem succeeded scarammuccia had for many years past never received any greater marks of his mistresss kindness for him than such as a pat on the head or a present of a lump of sugar might convey his dogs nature was utterly confounded by the unexpected warmth of naninas caress and he struggled up vigorously in her arms to try and return it by licking her face she could easily prevent him from doing this and could so gain a few minutes more to listen behind the summerhouse without danger of discovery  she had lost brigidas answer to father roccos question but she was in time to hear her next words  we are alone here said brigida i am a woman and i dont know that you may not have come armed it is only the commonest precaution on my part not to give you a chance of getting at the wax mask till i have made my conditions  you never said a word about conditions before  true i remember telling you that i wanted nothing but the novelty of going to the masquerade in the character of my dead enemy and the luxury of being able to terrify the man who had brutally ridiculed me in old days in the studio that was the truth but it is not the less the truth that our experiment on count fabio has detained me in this city much longer than i ever intended that i am all but penniless and that i deserve to be paid in plain words will you buy the mask of me for two hundred scudi  i have not twenty scudi in the world at my own free disposal  you must find two hundred if you want the wax mask i dont wish to threatenbut money i must have i mention the sum of two hundred scudi because that is the exact amount offered in the public handbills by count fabios friends for the discovery of the woman who wore the yellow mask at the marquis melanis ball what have i to do but to earn that money if i please by going to the palace taking the wax mask with me and telling them that i am the woman suppose i confess in that way they can do nothing to hurt me and i should be two hundred scudi the richer you might be injured to be sure if they insisted on knowing who made the wax model and who suggested the ghastly disguise  wretch do you believe that my character could be injured on the unsupported evidence of any words from your lips  father rocco for the first time since i have enjoyed the pleasure of your acquaintance i find you committing a breach of good manners i shall leave you until you become more like yourself if you wish to apologize for calling me a wretch and if you want to secure the wax mask honor me with a visit before four oclock this afternoon and bring two hundred scudi with you delay till after four and it will be too late  an instant of silence followed and then nanina judged that brigida must be departing for she heard the rustling of a dress on the lawn in front of the summerhouse unfortunately scarammuccia heard it too he twisted himself round in her arms and growled  the noise disturbed father rocco she heard him rise and leave the summerhouse there would have been time enough perhaps for her to conceal herself among some trees if she could have recovered her selfpossession at once but she was incapable of making an effort to regain it she could neither think nor moveher breath seemed to die away on her lipsas she saw the shadow of the priest stealing over the grass slowly from the front to the back of the summerhouse in another moment they were face to face  he stopped a few paces from her and eyed her steadily in dead silence she still crouched against the summerhouse and still with one hand mechanically kept her hold of the dog it was well for the priest that she did so scarammuccias formidable teeth were in full view his shaggy coat was bristling his eyes were starting his growl had changed from the surly to the savage note he was ready to tear down not father rocco only but all the clergy in pisa at a moments notice  you have been listening said the priest calmly i see it in your face you have heard all  she could not answer a word she could not take her eyes from him there was an unnatural stillness in his face a steady unrepentant unfathomable despair in his eyes that struck her with horror she would have given worlds to be able to rise to her feet and fly from his presence  i once distrusted you and watched you in secret he said speaking after a short silence thoughtfully and with a strange tranquil sadness in his voice and now what i did by you you do by me you put the hope of your life once in my hands is it because they were not worthy of the trust that discovery and ruin overtake me and that you are the instrument of the retribution can this be the decree of heavenor is it nothing but the blind justice of chance  he looked upward doubtingly to the lustrous sky above him and sighed naninas eyes still followed his mechanically he seemed to feel their influence for he suddenly looked down at her again  what keeps you silent why are you afraid he said i can do you no harm with your dog at your side and the workmen yonder within call i can do you no harm and i wish to do you none go back to pisa tell what you have heard restore the man you love to himself and ruin me that is your work do it i was never your enemy even when i distrusted you i am not your enemy now it is no fault of yours that a fatality has been accomplished through youno fault of yours that i am rejected as the instrument of securing a righteous restitution to the church rise child and go your way while i go mine and prepare for what is to come if we never meet again remember that i parted from you without one hard saying or one harsh lookparted from you so knowing that the first words you speak in pisa will be death to my character and destruction to the great purpose of my life  speaking these words always with the same calmness which had marked his manner from the first he looked fixedly at her for a little while sighed again and turned away just before he disappeared among the trees he said farewell but so softly that she could barely hear it some strange confusion clouded her mind as she lost sight of him had she injured him or had he injured her his words bewildered and oppressed her simple heart vague doubts and fears and a sudden antipathy to remaining any longer near the summerhouse overcame her she started to her feet and keeping the dog still at her side hurried from the garden to the highroad there the wide glow of sunshine the sight of the city lying before her changed the current of her thoughts and directed them all to fabio and to the future  a burning impatience to be back in pisa now possessed her she hastened toward the city at her utmost speed the doctor was reported to be in the palace when she passed the servants lounging in the courtyard he saw the moment she came into his presence that something had happened and led her away from the sickroom into fabios empty study there she told him all  you have saved him said the doctor joyfully i will answer for his recovery only let that woman come here for the reward and leave me to deal with her as she deserves in the meantime my dear dont go away from the palace on any account until i give you permission i am going to send a message immediately to signor andrea darbino to come and hear the extraordinary disclosure that you have made to me go back to read to the count as usual until i want you again but remember you must not drop a word to him yet of what you have said to me he must be carefully prepared for all that we have to tell him and must be kept quite in the dark until those preparations are made  darbino answered the doctors summons in person and nanina repeated her story to him he and the doctor remained closeted together for some time after she had concluded her narrative and had retired a little before four oclock they sent for her again into the study the doctor was sitting by the table with a bag of money before him and darbino was telling one of the servants that if a lady called at the palace on the subject of the handbill which he had circulated she was to be admitted into the study immediately  as the clock struck four nanina was requested to take possession of a windowseat and to wait there until she was summoned when she had obeyed the doctor loosened one of the windowcurtains to hide her from the view of any one entering the room  about a quarter of an hour elapsed and then the door was thrown open and brigida herself was shown into the study the doctor bowed and darbino placed a chair for her she was perfectly collected and thanked them for their politeness with her best grace  i believe i am addressing confidential friends of count fabio dascoli brigida began may i ask if you are authorized to act for the count in relation to the reward which this handbill offers  the doctor having examined the handbill said that the lady was quite right and pointed significantly to the bag of money  you are prepared then pursued brigida smiling to give a reward of two hundred scudi to any one able to tell you who the woman is who wore the yellow mask at the marquis melanis ball and how she contrived to personate the face and figure of the late countess dascoli  of course we are prepared answered darbino a little irritably as men of honor we are not in the habit of promising anything that we are not perfectly willing under proper conditions to perform  pardon me my dear friend said the doctor i think you speak a little too warmly to the lady she is quite right to take every precaution we have the two hundred scudi here madam he continued patting the moneybag and we are prepared to pay that sum for the information we want but here the doctor suspiciously moved the bag of scudi from the table to his lap we must have proofs that the person claiming the reward is really entitled to it  brigidas eyes followed the moneybag greedily  proofs she exclaimed taking a small flat box from under her cloak and pushing it across to the doctor proofs there you will find one proof that establishes my claim beyond the possibility of doubt  the doctor opened the box and looked at the wax mask inside it then handed it to darbino and replaced the bag of scudi on the table  the contents of that box seem certainly to explain a great deal he said pushing the bag gently toward brigida but always keeping his hand over it the woman who wore the yellow domino was i presume of the same height as the late countess  exactly said brigida her eyes were also of the same color as the late countesss she wore yellow of the same shade as the hangings in the late countesss room and she had on under her yellow mask the colorless wax model of the late countesss face now in your friends hand so much for that part of the secret nothing remains now to be cleared up but the mystery of who the lady was have the goodness sir to push that bag an inch or two nearer my way and i shall be delighted to tell you  thank you madam said the doctor with a very perceptible change in his manner we know who the lady was already  he moved the bag of scudi while he spoke back to his own side of the table brigidas cheeks reddened and she rose from her seat  am i to understand sir she said haughtily that you take advantage of my position here as a defenseless woman to cheat me out of the reward  by no means madam rejoined the doctor we have covenanted to pay the reward to the person who could give us the information we required  well sir have i not given you part of it and am i not prepared to give you the whole  certainly but the misfortune is that another person has been beforehand with you we ascertained who the lady in the yellow domino was and how she contrived to personate the face of the late countess dascoli several hours ago from another informant that person has consequently the prior claim and on every principle of justice that person must also have the reward nanina this bag belongs to youcome and take it  nanina appeared from the windowseat brigida thunderstruck looked at her in silence for a moment gasped out that girlthen stopped again breathless  that girl was at the back of the summerhouse this morning while you and your accomplice were talking together said the doctor  darbino had been watching brigidas face intently from the moment of naninas appearance and had quietly stolen close to her side this was a fortunate movement for the doctors last words were hardly out of his mouth before brigida seized a heavy ruler lying with some writing materials on the table in another instant if darbino had not caught her arm she would have hurled it at naninas head  you may let go your hold sir she said dropping the ruler and turning toward darbino with a smile on her white lips and a wicked calmness in her steady eyes i can wait for a better opportunity  with those words she walked to the door and turning round there regarded nanina fixedly  i wish i had been a moment quicker with the ruler she said and went out  there exclaimed the doctor i told you i knew how to deal with her as she deserved one thing i am certainly obliged to her forshe has saved us the trouble of going to her house and forcing her to give up the mask and now my child he continued addressing nanina you can go home and one of the menservants shall see you safe to your own door in case that woman should still be lurking about the palace stop you are leaving the bag of scudi behind you  i cant take it sir  and why not  she would have taken money saying those words nanina reddened and looked toward the door  the doctor glanced approvingly at darbino well well we wont argue about that now he said i will lock up the money with the mask for today come here tomorrow morning as usual my dear by that time i shall have made up my mind on the right means for breaking your discovery to count fabio only let us proceed slowly and cautiously and i answer for success    chapter vii  the next morning among the first visitors at the ascoli palace was the mastersculptor luca lomi he seemed as the servants thought agitated and said he was especially desirous of seeing count fabio on being informed that this was impossible he reflected a little and then inquired if the medical attendant of the count was at the palace and could be spoken with both questions were answered in the affirmative and he was ushered into the doctors presence  i know not how to preface what i want to say luca began looking about him confusedly may i ask you in the first place if the workgirl named nanina was here yesterday  she was said the doctor  did she speak in private with any one  yes with me  then you know everything  absolutely everything  i am glad at least to find that my object in wishing to see the count can be equally well answered by seeing you my brother i regret to say he stopped perplexedly and drew from his pocket a roll of papers  you may speak of your brother in the plainest terms said the doctor i know what share he has had in promoting the infamous conspiracy of the yellow mask  my petition to you and through you to the count is that your knowledge of what my brother has done may go no further if this scandal becomes public it will ruin me in my profession and i make little enough by it already said luca with his old sordid smile breaking out again faintly on his face  pray do you come from your brother with this petition inquired the doctor  no i come solely on my own account my brother seems careless what happens he has made a full statement of his share in the matter from the first has forwarded it to his ecclesiastical superior who will send it to the archbishop and is now awaiting whatever sentence they choose to pass on him i have a copy of the document to prove that he has at least been candid and that he does not shrink from consequences which he might have avoided by flight the law cannot touch him but the church canand to the church he has confessed all i ask is that he may be spared a public exposure such an exposure would do no good to the count and it would do dreadful injury to me look over the papers yourself and show them whenever you think proper to the master of this house i have every confidence in his honor and kindness and in yours  he laid the roll of papers open on the table and then retired with great humility to the window the doctor looked over them with some curiosity  the statement or confession began by boldly avowing the writers conviction that part of the property which the count fabio dascoli had inherited from his ancestors had been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation from the church the various authorities on which this assertion was based were then produced in due order along with some curious particles of evidence culled from old manuscripts which it must have cost much trouble to collect and decipher  the second section was devoted at great length to the reasons which induced the writer to think it his absolute duty as an affectionate son and faithful servant of the church not to rest until he had restored to the successors of the apostles in his day the property which had been fraudulently taken from them in days gone by the writer held himself justified in the last resort and in that only in using any means for effecting this restoration except such as might involve him in mortal sin  the third section described the priests share in promoting the marriage of maddalena lomi with fabio and the hopes he entertained of securing the restitution of the church property through his influence over his niece in the first place and when she had died through his influence over her child in the second the necessary failure of all his projects if fabio married again was next glanced at and the time at which the first suspicion of the possible occurrence of this catastrophe occurred to his mind was noted with scrupulous accuracy  the fourth section narrated the manner in which the conspiracy of the yellow mask had originated the writer described himself as being in his brothers studio on the night of his nieces death harassed by forebodings of the likelihood of fabios marrying again and filled with the resolution to prevent any such disastrous second union at all hazards he asserted that the idea of taking the wax mask from his brothers statue flashed upon him on a sudden and that he knew of nothing to lead to it except perhaps that he had been thinking just before of the superstitious nature of the young mans character as he had himself observed it in the studio he further declared that the idea of the wax mask terrified him at first that he strove against it as against a temptation of the devil that from fear of yielding to this temptation he abstained even from entering the studio during his brothers absence at naples and that he first faltered in his good resolution when fabio returned to pisa and when it was rumored not only that the young nobleman was going to the ball but that he would certainly marry for the second time  the fifth section related that the writer upon this yielded to temptation rather than forego the cherished purpose of his life by allowing fabio a chance of marrying againthat he made the wax mask in a plaster mold taken from the face of his brothers statueand that he then had two separate interviews with a woman named brigida of whom he had some previous knowledge  who was ready and anxious from motives of private malice to personate the deceased countess at the masquerade this woman had suggested that some anonymous letters to fabio would pave the way in his mind for the approaching impersonation and had written the letters herself however even when all the preparations were made the writer declared that he shrank from proceeding to extremities and that he would have abandoned the whole project but for the woman brigida informing him one day that a workgirl named nanina was to be one of the attendants at the ball he knew the count to have been in love with this girl even to the point of wishing to marry her he suspected that her engagement to wait at the ball was preconcerted and in consequence he authorized his female accomplice to perform her part in the conspiracy  the sixth section detailed the proceedings at the masquerade and contained the writers confession that on the night before it he had written to the count proposing the reconciliation of a difference that had taken place between them solely for the purpose of guarding himself against suspicion he next acknowledged that he had borrowed the key of the campo santo gate keeping the authority to whom it was intrusted in perfect ignorance of the purpose for which he wanted it that purpose was to carry out the ghastly delusion of the wax mask in the very probable event of the wearer being followed and inquired after by having the woman brigida taken up and set down at the gate of the cemetery in which fabios wife had been buried  the seventh section solemnly averred that the sole object of the conspiracy was to prevent the young nobleman from marrying again by working on his superstitious fears the writer repeating after this avowal that any such second marriage would necessarily destroy his project for promoting the ultimate restoration of the church possessions by diverting count fabios property in great part from his first wifes child over whom the priest would always have influence to another wife and probably other children over whom he could hope to have none  the eighth and last section expressed the writers contrition for having allowed his zeal for the church to mislead him into actions liable to bring scandal on his cloth reiterated in the strongest language his conviction that whatever might be thought of the means employed the end he had proposed to himself was a most righteous one and concluded by asserting his resolution to suffer with humility any penalties however severe which his ecclesiastical superiors might think fit to inflict on him  having looked over this extraordinary statement the doctor addressed himself again to luca lomi  i agree with you he said that no useful end is to be gained now by mentioning your brothers conduct in publicalways provided however that his ecclesiastical superiors do their duty i shall show these papers to the count as soon as he is fit to peruse them and i have no doubt that he will be ready to take my view of the matter  this assurance relieved luca lomi of a great weight of anxiety he bowed and withdrew  the doctor placed the papers in the same cabinet in which he had secured the wax mask before he locked the doors again he took out the flat box opened it and looked thoughtfully for a few minutes at the mask inside then sent for nanina  now my child he said when she appeared i am going to try our first experiment with count fabio and i think it of great importance that you should be present while i speak to him  he took up the box with the mask in it and beckoning to nanina to follow him led the way to fabios chamber    chapter viii  about six months after the events already related signor andrea darbino and the cavaliere finello happened to be staying with a friend in a seaside villa on the castellamare shore of the bay of naples most of their time was pleasantly occupied on the sea in fishing and sailing a boat was placed entirely at their disposal sometimes they loitered whole days along the shore sometimes made trips to the lovely islands in the bay  one evening they were sailing near sorrento with a light wind the beauty of the coast tempted them to keep the boat close inshore a short time before sunset they rounded the most picturesque headland they had yet passed and a little bay with a whitesand beach opened on their view they noticed first a villa surrounded by orange and olive trees on the rocky heights inland then a path in the cliffside leading down to the sands then a little family party on the beach enjoying the fragrant evening air  the elders of the group were a lady and gentleman sitting together on the sand the lady had a guitar in her lap and was playing a simple dance melody close at her side a young child was rolling on the beach in high glee in front of her a little girl was dancing to the music with a very extraordinary partner in the shape of a dog who was capering on his hind legs in the most grotesque manner the merry laughter of the girl and the lively notes of the guitar were heard distinctly across the still water  edge a little nearer in shore said darbino to his friend who was steering and keep as i do in the shadow of the sail i want to see the faces of those persons on the beach without being seen by them  finello obeyed after approaching just near enough to see the countenances of the party on shore and to be barked at lustily by the dog they turned the boats head again toward the offing  a pleasant voyage gentlemen cried the clear voice of the little girl they waved their hats in return and then saw her run to the dog and take him by the forelegs play nanina they heard her say i have not half done with my partner yet the guitar sounded once more and the grotesque dog was on his hind legs in a moment  i had heard that he was well again that he had married her lately and that he was away with her and her sister and his child by the first wife said darbino but i had no suspicion that their place of retirement was so near us it is too soon to break in upon their happiness or i should have felt inclined to run the boat on shore  i never heard the end of that strange adventure of the yellow mask said finello there was a priest mixed up in it was there not  yes but nobody seems to know exactly what has become of him he was sent for to rome and has never been heard of since one report is that he has been condemned to some mysterious penal seclusion by his ecclesiastical superiorsanother that he has volunteered as a sort of forlorn hope to accept a colonial curacy among rough people and in a pestilential climate i asked his brother the sculptor about him a little while ago but he only shook his head and said nothing  and the woman who wore the yellow mask  she too has ended mysteriously at pisa she was obliged to sell off everything she possessed to pay her debts some friends of hers at a milliners shop to whom she applied for help would have nothing to do with her she left the city alone and penniless  the boat had approached the next headland on the coast while they were talking they looked back for a last glance at the beach still the notes of the guitar came gently across the quiet water but there mingled with them now the sound of the ladys voice she was singing the little girl and the dog were at her feet and the gentleman was still in his old place close at her side  in a few minutes more the boat rounded the next headland the beach vanished from view and the music died away softly in the distance  last leaves from leahs diary  3d of juneour stories are ended our pleasant work is done it is a lovely summer afternoon the great hall at the farmhouse after having been filled with people is now quite deserted i sit alone at my little worktable with rather a crying sensation at my heart and with the pen trembling in my fingers as if i was an old woman already our manuscript has been sealed up and taken away the one precious object of all our most anxious thoughts for months pastour third child as we have got to call ithas gone out from us on this summers day to seek its fortune in the world  a little before twelve oclock last night my husband dictated to me the last words of the yellow mask i laid down the pen and closed the paper thoughtfully with that simple action the work that we had wrought at together so carefully and so long came to a close we were both so silent and still that the murmuring of the trees in the night air sounded audibly and solemnly in our room  williams collection of stories has not thus far been half exhausted yet but those who understand the public taste and the interests of bookselling better than we think it advisable not to risk offering too much to the reader at first if individual opinions can be accepted as a fair test our prospects of success seem hopeful the doctor but we must not forget that he is a friend was so pleased with the two specimen stories we sent to him that he took them at once to his friend the editor of the newspaper who showed his appreciation of what he read in a very gratifying manner he proposed that william should publish in the newspaper on very fair terms any short anecdotes and curious experiences of his life as a portraitpainter which might not be important enough to put into a book the money which my husband has gained from time to time in this way has just sufficed to pay our expenses at the farmhouse up to within the last month and now our excellent friends here say they will not hear anything more from us on the subject of the rent until the book is sold and we have plenty of money this is one great relief and happiness another for which i feel even more grateful is that williams eyes have gained so much by their long rest that even the doctor is surprised at the progress he has made he only puts on his green shade now when he goes out into the sun or when the candles are lit his spirits are infinitely raised and he is beginning to talk already of the time when he will unpack his palette and brushes and take to his old portraitpainting occupations again  with all these reasons for being happy it seems unreasonable and ungracious in me to be feeling sad as i do just at this moment i can only say in my own justification that it is a mournful ceremony to take leave of an old friend and i have taken leave twice over of the book that has been like an old friend to meonce when i had written the last word in it and once again when i saw it carried away to london  i packed the manuscript up with my own hands this morning in thick brown paper wasting a great deal of sealingwax i am afraid in my anxiety to keep the parcel from bursting open in case it should be knocked about on its journey to town oh me how cheap and common it looked in its new form as i carried it downstairs a dozen pairs of worsted stockings would have made a larger parcel and half a crowns worth of groceries would have weighed a great deal heavier  just as we had done dinner the doctor and the editor came in the first had called to fetch the parceli mean the manuscript the second had come out with him to appletreewick for a walk as soon as the farmer heard that the book was to be sent to london he insisted that we should drink success to it all round the children in high glee were mounted up on the table with a glass of currantwine apiece the rest of us had ale the farmer proposed the toast and his sailor son led the cheers we all joined in the children included except the editorwho being the only important person of the party could not i suppose afford to compromise his dignity by making a noise he was extremely polite however in a lofty way to me waving his hand and bowing magnificently every time he spoke this discomposed me a little and i was still more flurried when he said that he had written to the london publishers that very day to prepare them for the arrival of our book  do you think they will print it sir i ventured to ask  my dear madam you may consider it settled said the editor confidently the letter is writtenthe thing is done look upon the book as published already pray oblige me by looking upon the book as published already  then the only uncertainty now is about how the public will receive it said my husband fidgeting in his chair and looking nervously at me  just so my dear sir just so answered the editor everything depends upon the publiceverything i pledge you my word of honor  dont look doubtful mrs kerby there isnt a doubt about it whispered the kind doctor giving the manuscript a confident smack as he passed by me with it on his way to the door  in another minute he and the editor and the poor cheaplooking brown paper parcel were gone the others followed them out and i was left in the hall alone  oh public public it all depends now upon you the children are to have new clothes from top to toe i am to have a black silk gown william is to buy a beautiful traveling colorbox the rent is to be paid all our kind friends at the farmhouse are to have little presents and our future way in this hard world is to be smoothed for us at the outset if you will only accept a poor painters stories which his wife has written down for him after dark
