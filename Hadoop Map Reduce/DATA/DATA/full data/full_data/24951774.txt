chorusmaster all but captious criticaster would accept as the choregus of the early attic stage this return to classic ages is considered in their wages which are always calculated by the day or by the week  and ill pay em if theyll back me all in oboloi and drachmae which theyll get if they prefer it at the kalends that are greek  at this juncture i may mention that this erudition sham is but classical pretension the result of steady cram periphrastic methods spurning to my readers all discerning i admit this show of learning is the fruit of steady cram  in the period socratic every diningroom was attic which suggests an architecture of a topsyturvy kind there theyd satisfy their twist on a recherche cold greek text which cannot be reproduced which is what they called their lunch  and so may you if youre inclined as they gradually got on theyd greek text which cannot be reproduced which is attic for a steady and a conscientious drink but they mixed their wine with water  which im sure they didnt oughter  and we anglosaxons know a trick worth two of that i think then came rather risky dances under certain circumstances which would shock that worthy gentleman the licenser of plays corybantian maniac kick  dionysiac or bacchic  and the dithyrambic revels of those indecorous days  and perhaps id better mention lest alarming you i am that it isnt our intention to perform a dithyramb  it displays a lot of stocking which is always very shocking and of course im only mocking at the prevalence of cram  yes on reconsideration there are customs of that nation which are not in strict accordance with the habits of our day and when i come to codify their rules i mean to modify or mrs grundy praps may have a word or two to say for they hadnt macintoshes or umbrellas or goloshes  and a shower with their dresses must have played the very deuce and it must have been unpleasing when they caught a fit of sneezing for it seems of pockethandkerchiefs they didnt know the use they wore little underclothing  scarcely anything  or nothing  and their dress of coan silk was quite transparent in design  well in fact in summer weather something like the altogether and its

unexpected flash burns eyebrows and moustache when people dine no kind of wine beats ipecacuanha but common sense suggests you keep it for your guests  then naught annoys the organ boys like throwing redhot coppers and much amusement bides in common butterslides and stringy snares across the stairs cause unexpected croppers coal scuttles recollect produce the same effect a man possessed of common

a monarch is pestered with cares though no doubt he can often trepan them but one comes in a shape he can never escape  the implacable national anthem though for quiet and rest he may yearn it pursues

tenor    a tenor all singers above this doesnt admit of a question should keep himself quiet attend to his diet and carefully nurse his digestion but when he is madly in love its certain to tell on his singing  you cant do chromatics with proper emphatics when anguish your bosom is wringing when distracted with worries in plenty and his pulse is a hundred and twenty and his fluttering bosom the slave of mistrust is a tenor cant do himself justice now observe  sings a high note  you see i cant do myself justice  i could sing if my fervour were mock its easy enough if youre acting but when ones emotion is born of devotion you mustnt be overexacting one ought to be firm as a rock to venture a shake in vibrato when fervours expected keep cool and collected or never attempt agitato but of course when his tongue is of leather and his lips appear pasted together and his sensitive palate as dry as a crust is a tenor cant do himself justice now observe  sings a cadence  its no use  i cant do myself justice    ballad the playedout humorist    quixotic is his enterprise and hopeless his adventure is who seeks for jocularities that havent yet been said the world has joked incessantly for over fifty centuries and every joke thats possible has long ago been made i started as a humorist with lots of mental fizziness but humour is a drug which its the fashion to abuse for my stockintrade my fixtures and the goodwill of the business no reasonable offer i am likely to refuse and if anybody choose he may circulate the news that no reasonable offer im likely to refuse  oh happy was that humorist  the first that made a pun at all  who when a joke occurred to him however poor and mean was absolutely certain that it never had been done at all  how popular at dinners must that humorist have been  oh the days when some stepfather for the query held a handle out the doormat from the scraper is it distant very far and when no one knew where moses was when aaron blew the candle out and no one had discovered that a door could be ajar but your modern hearers are in their tastes particular and they sneer if you inform them that a door can be ajar  in search of quip and quiddity ive sat all day alone apart  and all that i could hit on as a problem was  to find analogy between a scrag of mutton and a bonypart which offers slight employment to the speculative mind for you cannot call it very good however great your charity  its not the sort of humour that is greeted with a shout  and ive come to the conclusion that my mine of jocularity in present anno domini is worked completely out though the notion you may scout i can prove beyond a doubt that my mine of jocularity is utterly worked out
