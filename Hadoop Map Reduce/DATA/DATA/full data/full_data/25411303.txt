25411303	intentions     contents  the decay of lying pen pencil and poison the critic as artist the truth of masks    the decay of lying  an observation    a dialogue  persons  cyril and vivian  scene  the library of a country house in nottinghamshire  cyril coming in through the open window from the terrace  my dear vivian dont coop yourself up all day in the library  it is a perfectly lovely afternoon  the air is exquisite  there is a mist upon the woods like the purple bloom upon a plum  let us go and lie on the grass and smoke cigarettes and enjoy nature  vivian  enjoy nature  i am glad to say that i have entirely lost that faculty  people tell us that art makes us love nature more than we loved her before that it reveals her secrets to us and that after a careful study of corot and constable we see things in her that had escaped our observation  my own experience is that the more we study art the less we care for nature  what art really reveals to us is natures lack of design her curious crudities her extraordinary monotony her absolutely unfinished condition  nature has good intentions of course but as aristotle once said she cannot carry them out  when i look at a landscape i cannot help seeing all its defects  it is fortunate for us however that nature is so imperfect as otherwise we should have no art at all  art is our spirited protest our gallant attempt to teach nature her proper place  as for the infinite variety of nature that is a pure myth  it is not to be found in nature herself  it resides in the imagination or fancy or cultivated blindness of the man who looks at her  cyril  well you need not look at the landscape  you can lie on the grass and smoke and talk  vivian  but nature is so uncomfortable  grass is hard and lumpy and damp and full of dreadful black insects  why even morriss poorest workman could make you a more comfortable seat than the whole of nature can  nature pales before the furniture of the street which from oxford has borrowed its name as the poet you love so much once vilely phrased it  i dont complain  if nature had been comfortable mankind would never have invented architecture and i prefer houses to the open air  in a house we all feel of the proper proportions  everything is subordinated to us fashioned for our use and our pleasure  egotism itself which is so necessary to a proper sense of human dignity is entirely the result of indoor life  out of doors one becomes abstract and impersonal  ones individuality absolutely leaves one  and then nature is so indifferent so unappreciative  whenever i am walking in the park here i always feel that i am no more to her than the cattle that browse on the slope or the burdock that blooms in the ditch  nothing is more evident than that nature hates mind thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world and people die of it just as they die of any other disease  fortunately in england at any rate thought is not catching  our splendid physique as a people is entirely due to our national stupidity  i only hope we shall be able to keep this great historic bulwark of our happiness for many years to come but i am afraid that we are beginning to be overeducated at least everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teachingthat is really what our enthusiasm for education has come to  in the meantime you had better go back to your wearisome uncomfortable nature and leave me to correct my proofs  cyril  writing an article  that is not very consistent after what you have just said  vivian  who wants to be consistent  the dullard and the doctrinaire the tedious people who carry out their principles to the bitter end of action to the reductio ad absurdum of practice not i  like emerson i write over the door of my library the word whim  besides my article is really a most salutary and valuable warning  if it is attended to there may be a new renaissance of art  cyril  what is the subject  vivian  i intend to call it the decay of lying  a protest  cyril  lying  i should have thought that our politicians kept up that habit  vivian  i assure you that they do not  they never rise beyond the level of misrepresentation and actually condescend to prove to discuss to argue  how different from the temper of the true liar with his frank fearless statements his superb irresponsibility his healthy natural disdain of proof of any kind  after all what is a fine lie  simply that which is its own evidence  if a man is sufficiently unimaginative to produce evidence in support of a lie he might just as well speak the truth at once  no the politicians wont do  something may perhaps be urged on behalf of the bar the mantle of the sophist has fallen on its members  their feigned ardours and unreal rhetoric are delightful  they can make the worse appear the better cause as though they were fresh from leontine schools and have been known to wrest from reluctant juries triumphant verdicts of acquittal for their clients even when those clients as often happens were clearly and unmistakeably innocent  but they are briefed by the prosaic and are not ashamed to appeal to precedent  in spite of their endeavours the truth will out  newspapers even have degenerated  they may now be absolutely relied upon  one feels it as one wades through their columns  it is always the unreadable that occurs  i am afraid that there is not much to be said in favour of either the lawyer or the journalist  besides what i am pleading for is lying in art  shall i read you what i have written  it might do you a great deal of good  cyril  certainly if you give me a cigarette  thanks  by the way what magazine do you intend it for  vivian  for the retrospective review  i think i told you that the elect had revived it  cyril  whom do you mean by the elect  vivian  oh the tired hedonists of course  it is a club to which i belong  we are supposed to wear faded roses in our buttonholes when we meet and to have a sort of cult for domitian  i am afraid you are not eligible  you are too fond of simple pleasures  cyril  i should be blackballed on the ground of animal spirits i suppose  vivian  probably  besides you are a little too old  we dont admit anybody who is of the usual age  cyril  well i should fancy you are all a good deal bored with each other  vivian  we are  this is one of the objects of the club  now if you promise not to interrupt too often i will read you my article  cyril  you will find me all attention  vivian reading in a very clear musical voice  the decay of lying  a protestone of the chief causes that can be assigned for the curiously commonplace character of most of the literature of our age is undoubtedly the decay of lying as an art a science and a social pleasure  the ancient historians gave us delightful fiction in the form of fact the modem novelist presents us with dull facts under the guise of fiction  the bluebook is rapidly becoming his ideal both for method and manner  he has his tedious document humain his miserable little coin de la creation into which he peers with his microscope  he is to be found at the librairie nationale or at the british museum shamelessly reading up his subject  he has not even the courage of other peoples ideas but insists on going directly to life for everything and ultimately between encyclopaedias and personal experience he comes to the ground having drawn his types from the family circle or from the weekly washerwoman and having acquired an amount of useful information from which never even in his most meditative moments can he thoroughly free himself  the lose that results to literature in general from this false ideal of our time can hardly be overestimated  people have a careless way of talking about a born liar just as they talk about a born poet  but in both cases they are wrong  lying and poetry are artsarts as pinto saw not unconnected with each otherand they require the most careful study the most disinterested devotion  indeed they have their technique just as the more material arts of painting and sculpture have their subtle secrets of form and colour their craftmysteries their deliberate artistic methods  as one knows the poet by his fine music so one can recognise the liar by his rich rhythmic utterance and in neither case will the casual inspiration of the moment suffice here as elsewhere practice must precede perfection  but in modern days while the fashion of writing poetry has become far too common and should if possible be discouraged the fashion of lying has almost fallen into disrepute  many a young man starts in life with a natural gift for exaggeration which if nurtured in congenial and sympathetic surroundings or by the imitation of the best models might grow into something really great and wonderful but as a rule he comes to nothing  he either falls into careless habits of accuracy  cyril  my dear fellow  vivian  please dont interrupt in the middle of a sentence  he either falls into careless habits of accuracy or takes to frequenting the society of the aged and the wellinformed  both things are equally fatal to his imagination as indeed they would be fatal to the imagination of anybody and in a short time he develops a morbid and unhealthy faculty of truthtelling begins to verify all statements made in his presence has no hesitation in contradicting people who are much younger than himself and often ends by writing novels which are so lifelike that no one can possibly believe in their probability  this is no isolated instance that we are giving  it is simply one example out of many and if something cannot be done to check or at least to modify our monstrous worship of facts art will become sterile and beauty will pass away from the land  even mr robert louis stevenson that delightful master of delicate and fanciful prose is tainted with this modern vice for we know positively no other name for it  there is such a thing as robbing a story of its reality by trying to make it too true and the black arrow is so inartistic as not to contain a single anachronism to boast of while the transformation of dr jekyll reads dangerously like an experiment out of the lancet  as for mr rider haggard who really has or had once the makings of a perfectly magnificent liar he is now so afraid of being suspected of genius that when he does tell us anything marvellous he feels bound to invent a personal reminiscence and to put it into a footnote as a kind of cowardly corroboration  nor are our other novelists much better  mr henry james writes fiction as if it were a painful duty and wastes upon mean motives and imperceptible points of view his neat literary style his felicitous phrases his swift and caustic satire  mr hall caine it is true aims at the grandiose but then he writes at the top of his voice  he is so loud that one cannot bear what he says  mr james payn is an adept in the art of concealing what is not worth finding  he hunts down the obvious with the enthusiasm of a shortsighted detective as one turns over the pages the suspense of the author becomes almost unbearable  the horses of mr william blacks phaeton do not soar towards the sun  they merely frighten the sky at evening into violent chromolithographic effects  on seeing them approach the peasants take refuge in dialect  mrs oliphant prattles pleasantly about curates lawntennis parties domesticity and other wearisome things  mr marion crawford has immolated himself upon the altar of local colour  he is like the lady in the french comedy who keeps talking about le beau ciel ditalie  besides he has fallen into the bad habit of uttering moral platitudes  he is always telling us that to be good is to be good and that to be bad is to be wicked  at times he is almost edifying  robert elsmere is of course a masterpiecea masterpiece of the genre ennuyeux the one form of literature that the english people seems thoroughly to enjoy  a thoughtful young friend of ours once told us that it reminded him of the sort of conversation that goes on at a meat tea in the house of a serious nonconformist family and we can quite believe it  indeed it is only in england that such a book could be produced  england is the home of lost ideas  as for that great and daily increasing school of novelists for whom the sun always rises in the eastend the only thing that can be said about them is that they find life crude and leave it raw  in france though nothing so deliberately tedious as robert elsmere has been produced things are not much better  m guy de maupassant with his keen mordant irony and his hard vivid style strips life of the few poor rags that still cover her and shows us foul sore and festering wound  he writes lurid little tragedies in which everybody is ridiculous bitter comedies at which one cannot laugh for very tears  m zola true to the lofty principle that he lays down in one of his pronunciamientos on literature lhomme de genie na jamais desprit is determined to show that if he has not got genius he can at least be dull  and how well he succeeds he is not without power  indeed at times as in germinal there is something almost epic in his work  but his work is entirely wrong from beginning to end and wrong not on the ground of morals but on the ground of art  from any ethical standpoint it is just what it should be  the author is perfectly truthful and describes things exactly as they happen  what more can any moralist desire we have no sympathy at all with the moral indignation of our time against m zola  it is simply the indignation of tartuffe on being exposed  but from the standpoint of art what can be said in favour of the author of lassommoir nana and potbouille nothing  mr ruskin once described the characters in george eliots novels as being like the sweepings of a pentonville omnibus but m zolas characters are much worse  they have their dreary vices and their drearier virtues  the record of their lives is absolutely without interest  who cares what happens to them  in literature we require distinction charm beauty and imaginative power  we dont want to be harrowed and disgusted with an account of the doings of the lower orders  m daudet is better he has wit a light touch and an amusing style  but he has lately committed literary suicide  nobody can possibly care for delobelle with his il faut lutter pour lart or for valmajour with his eternal refrain about the nightingale or for the poet in jack with his mots cruels now that we have learned from vingt ans de ma vie litteraire that these characters were taken directly from life to us they seem to have suddenly lost all their vitality all the few qualities they ever possessed  the only real people are the people who never existed and if a novelist is base enough to go to life for his personages he should at least pretend that they are creations and not boast of them as copies  the justification of a character in a novel is not that other persons are what they are but that the author is what he is  otherwise the novel is not a work of art  as for m paul bourget the master of the roman psychologique he commits the error of imagining that the men and women of modern life are capable of being infinitely analysed for an innumerable series of chapters  in point of fact what is interesting about people in good societyand m bourget rarely moves out of the faubourg st germain except to come to london is the mask that each one of them wears not the reality that lies behind the mask  it is a humiliating confession but we are all of us made out of the same stuff  in falstaff there is something of hamlet in hamlet there is not a little of falstaff  the fat knight has his moods of melancholy and the young prince his moments of coarse humour  where we differ from each other is purely in accidentals  in dress manner tone of voice religious opinions personal appearance tricks of habit and the like  the more one analyses people the more all reasons for analysis disappear  sooner or later one comes to that dreadful universal thing called human nature  indeed as any one who has ever worked among the poor knows only too well the brotherhood of man is no mere poets dream it is a most depressing and humiliating reality and if a writer insists upon analysing the upper classes he might just as well write of matchgirls and costermongers at once however my dear cyril i will not detain you any further just here  i quite admit that modern novels have many good points  all i insist on is that as a class they are quite unreadable  cyril  that is certainly a very grave qualification but i must say that i think you are rather unfair in some of your strictures i like the deemster and the daughter of heth and le disciple and mr isaacs and as for robert elsmere i am quite devoted to it not that i can look upon it as a serious work  as a statement of the problems that confront the earnest christian it is ridiculous and antiquated  it is simply arnolds literature and dogma with the literature left out  it is as much behind the age as paleys evidences or colensos method of biblical exegesis  nor could anything be less impressive than the unfortunate hero gravely heralding a dawn that rose long ago and so completely missing its true significance that he proposes to carry on the business of the old firm under the new name  on the other hand it contains several clever caricatures and a heap of delightful quotations and greens philosophy very pleasantly sugars the somewhat bitter pill of the authors fiction  i also cannot help expressing my surprise that you have said nothing about the two novelists whom you are always reading balzac and george meredith  surely they are realists both of them  vivian  ah  meredith  who can define him  his style is chaos illumined by flashes of lightning  as a writer he has mastered everything except language  as a novelist he can do everything except tell a story  as an artist he is everything except articulate  somebody in shakespearetouchstone i thinktalks about a man who is always breaking his shins over his own wit and it seems to me that this might serve as the basis for a criticism of merediths method  but whatever he is he is not a realist  or rather i would say that he is a child of realism who is not on speaking terms with his father  by deliberate choice he has made himself a romanticist  he has refused to bow the knee to baal and after all even if the mans fine spirit did not revolt against the noisy assertions of realism his style would be quite sufficient of itself to keep life at a respectful distance  by its means he has planted round his garden a hedge full of thorns and red with wonderful roses  as for balzac he was a most remarkable combination of the artistic temperament with the scientific spirit the latter he bequeathed to his disciples  the former was entirely his own  the difference between such a book as m zolas lassommoir and balzacs illusions perdues is the difference between unimaginative realism and imaginative reality  all balzacs characters said baudelaire are gifted with the same ardour of life that animated himself  all his fictions are as deeply coloured as dreams  each mind is a weapon loaded to the muzzle with will  the very scullions have genius  a steady course of balzac reduces our living friends to shadows and our acquaintances to the shadows of shades  his characters have a kind of fervent fierycoloured existence  they dominate us and defy scepticism  one of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of lucien de rubempre  it is a grief from which i have never been able completely to rid myself  it haunts me in my moments of pleasure  i remember it when i laugh  but balzac is no more a realist than holbein was  he created life he did not copy it  i admit however that he set far too high a value on modernity of form and that consequently there is no book of his that as an artistic masterpiece can rank with salammbo or esmond or the cloister and the hearth or the vicomte de bragelonne  cyril  do you object to modernity of form then  vivian  yes  it is a huge price to pay for a very poor result pure modernity of form is always somewhat vulgarising  it cannot help being so  the public imagine that because they are interested in their immediate surroundings art should be interested in them also and should take them as her subject matter  but the mere fact that they are interested in these things makes them unsuitable subjects for art  the only beautiful things as somebody once said are the things that do not concern us  as long as a thing is useful or necessary to us or affects us in any way either for pain or for pleasure or appeals strongly to our sympathies or is a vital part of the environment in which we live it is outside the proper sphere of art  to arts subjectmatter we should be more or less indifferent  we should at any rate have no preferences no prejudices no partisan feeling of any kind  it is exactly because hecuba is nothing to us that her sorrows are such an admirable motive for a tragedy  i do not know anything in the whole history of literature sadder than the artistic career of charles reade  he wrote one beautiful book the cloister and the hearth a book as much above romola as romola is above daniel deronda and wasted the rest of his life in a foolish attempt to be modern to draw public attention to the state of our convict prisons and the management of our private lunatic asylums charles dickens was depressing enough in all conscience when he tried to arouse our sympathy for the victims of the poorlaw administration but charles reade an artist a scholar a man with a true sense of beauty raging and roaring over the abuses of contemporary life like a common pamphleteer or a sensational journalist is really a sight for the angels to weep over  believe me my dear cyril modernity of form and modernity of subject matter are entirely and absolutely wrong  we have mistaken the common livery of the age for the vesture of the muses and spend our days in the sordid streets and hideous suburbs of our vile cities when we should be out on the hillside with apollo certainly we are a degraded race and have sold our birthright for a mess of facts  cyril  there is something in what you say and there is no doubt that whatever amusement we may find in reading a purely model novel we have rarely any artistic pleasure in rereading it  and this is perhaps the best rough test of what is literature and what is not  if one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again there is no use reading it at all  but what do you say about the return to life and nature  this is the panacea that is always being recommended to us  vivian  i will read you what i say on that subject  the passage comes later on in the article but i may as well give it to you now  the popular cry of our time is let us return to life and nature they will recreate art for us and send the red blood coursing through her veins they will shoe her feet with swiftness and make her hand strong  but alas we are mistaken in our amiable and wellmeaning efforts  nature is always behind the age  and as for life she is the solvent that breaks up art the enemy that lays waste her house  cyril  what do you mean by saying that nature is always behind the age  vivian  well perhaps that is rather cryptic  what i mean is this  if we take nature to mean natural simple instinct as opposed to selfconscious culture the work produced under this influence is always oldfashioned antiquated and out of date  one touch of nature may make the whole world kin but two touches of nature will destroy any work of art  if on the other hand we regard nature as the collection of phenomena external to man people only discover in her what they bring to her  she has no suggestions of her own  wordsworth went to the lakes but he was never a lake poet  he found in stones the sermons he had already hidden there he went moralising about the district but his good work was produced when he returned not to nature but to poetry  poetry gave him laodamia and the fine sonnets and the great ode such as it is  nature gave him martha ray and peter bell and the address to mr wilkinsons spade  cyril  i think that view might be questioned  i am rather inclined to believe in the impulse from a vernal wood though of course the artistic value of such an impulse depends entirely on the kind of temperament that receives it so that the return to nature would come to mean simply the advance to a great personality  you would agree with that i fancy  however proceed with your article  vivian reading  art begins with abstract decoration with purely imaginative and pleasurable work dealing with what is unreal and nonexistent  this is the first stage  then life becomes fascinated with this new wonder and asks to be admitted into the charmed circle  art takes life as part of her rough material recreates it and refashions it in fresh forms is absolutely indifferent to fact invents imagines dreams and keeps between herself and reality the impenetrable barrier of beautiful style of decorative or ideal treatment  the third stage is when life gets the upper hand and drives art out into the wilderness  that is the true decadence and it is from this that we are now suffering  take the case of the english drama  at first in the hands of the monks dramatic art was abstract decorative and mythological  then she enlisted life in her service and using some of lifes external forms she created an entirely new race of beings whose sorrows were more terrible than any sorrow man has ever felt whose joys were keener than lovers joys who had the rage of the titans and the calm of the gods who had monstrous and marvellous sins monstrous and marvellous virtues  to them she gave a language different from that of actual use a language full of resonant music and sweet rhythm made stately by solemn cadence or made delicate by fanciful rhyme jewelled with wonderful words and enriched with lofty diction  she clothed her children in strange raiment and gave them masks and at her bidding the antique world rose from its marble tomb  a new caesar stalked through the streets of risen rome and with purple sail and fluteled oars another cleopatra passed up the river to antioch  old myth and legend and dream took shape and substance  history was entirely rewritten and there was hardly one of the dramatists who did not recognise that the object of art is not simple truth but complex beauty  in this they were perfectly right  art itself is really a form of exaggeration and selection which is the very spirit of art is nothing more than an intensified mode of overemphasis  but life soon shattered the perfection of the form  even in shakespeare we can see the beginning of the end  it shows itself by the gradual breakingup of the blankverse in the later plays by the predominance given to prose and by the overimportance assigned to characterisation  the passages in shakespeareand they are manywhere the language is uncouth vulgar exaggerated fantastic obscene even are entirely due to life calling for an echo of her own voice and rejecting the intervention of beautiful style through which alone should life be suffered to find expression  shakespeare is not by any means a flawless artist  he is too fond of going directly to life and borrowing lifes natural utterance  he forgets that when art surrenders her imaginative medium she surrenders everything  goethe says somewhere    in der beschrankung zeigt fsich erst der meister   it is in working within limits that the master reveals himself and the limitation the very condition of any art is style however we need not linger any longer over shakespeares realism the tempest is the most perfect of palinodes  all that we desired to point out was that the magnificent work of the elizabethan and jacobean artists contained within itself the seeds of its own dissolution and that if it drew some of its strength from using life as rough material it drew all its weakness from using life as an artistic method  as the inevitable result of this substitution of an imitative for a creative medium this surrender of an imaginative form we have the modern english melodrama  the characters in these plays talk on the stage exactly as they would talk off it they have neither aspirations nor aspirates they are taken directly from life and reproduce its vulgarity down to the smallest detail they present the gait manner costume and accent of real people they would pass unnoticed in a thirdclass railway carriage  and yet how wearisome the plays are  they do not succeed in producing even that impression of reality at which they aim and which is their only reason for existing  as a method realism is a complete failure  what is true about the drama and the novel is no less true about those arts that we call the decorative arts  the whole history of these arts in europe is the record of the struggle between orientalism with its frank rejection of imitation its love of artistic convention its dislike to the actual representation of any object in nature and our own imitative spirit  wherever the former has been paramount as in byzantium sicily and spain by actual contact or in the rest of europe by the influence of the crusades we have had beautiful and imaginative work in which the visible things of life are transmuted into artistic conventions and the things that life has not are invented and fashioned for her delight  but wherever we have returned to life and nature our work has always become vulgar common and uninteresting  modern tapestry with its aerial effects its elaborate perspective its broad expanses of waste sky its faithful and laborious realism has no beauty whatsoever  the pictorial glass of germany is absolutely detestable  we are beginning to weave possible carpets in england but only because we have returned to the method and spirit of the east  our rugs and carpets of twenty years ago with their solemn depressing truths their inane worship of nature their sordid reproductions of visible objects have become even to the philistine a source of laughter  a cultured mahomedan once remarked to us you christians are so occupied in misinterpreting the fourth commandment that you have never thought of making an artistic application of the second  he was perfectly right and the whole truth of the matter is this  the proper school to learn art in is not life but art  and now let me read you a passage which seems to me to settle the question very completely  it was not always thus  we need not say anything about the poets for they with the unfortunate exception of mr wordsworth have been really faithful to their high mission and are universally recognised as being absolutely unreliable  but in the works of herodotus who in spite of the shallow and ungenerous attempts of modem sciolists to verify his history may justly be called the father of lies in the published speeches of cicero and the biographies of suetonius in tacitus at his best in plinys natural history in hannos periplus in all the early chronicles in the lives of the saints in froissart and sir thomas malory in the travels of marco polo in olaus magnus and aldrovandus and conrad lycosthenes with his magnificent prodigiorum et ostentorum chronicon in the autobiography of benvenuto cellini in the memoirs of casanova in defoes history of the plague in boswells life of johnson in napoleons despatches and in the works of our own carlyle whose french revolution is one of the most fascinating historical novels ever written facts are either kept in their proper subordinate position or else entirely excluded on the general ground of dulness  now everything is changed  facts are not merely finding a footingplace in history but they are usurping the domain of fancy and have invaded the kingdom of romance  their chilling touch is over everything  they are vulgarising mankind  the crude commercialism of america its materialising spirit its indifference to the poetical side of things and its lack of imagination and of high unattainable ideals are entirely due to that country having adopted for its national hero a man who according to his own confession was incapable of telling a lie and it is not too much to say that the story of george washington and the cherrytree has done more harm and in a shorter space of time than any other moral tale in the whole of literature  cyril  my dear boy  vivian  i assure you it is the case and the amusing part of the whole thing is that the story of the cherrytree is an absolute myth  however you must not think that i am too despondent about the artistic future either of america or of our own country listen to this  that some change will take place before this century has drawn to its close we have no doubt whatsoever  bored by the tedious and improving conversation of those who have neither the wit to exaggerate nor the genius to romance tired of the intelligent person whose reminiscences are always based upon memory whose statements are invariably limited by probability and who is at any time liable to be corroborated by the merest philistine who happens to be present society sooner or later must return to its lost leader the cultured and fascinating liar  who he was who first without ever having gone out to the rude chase told the wandering cavemen at sunset how he had dragged the megatherium from the purple darkness of its jasper cave or slain the mammoth in single combat and brought back its gilded tusks we cannot tell and not one of our modern anthropologists for all their muchboasted science has had the ordinary courage to tell us  whatever was his name or race he certainly was the true founder of social intercourse  for the aim of the liar is simply to charm to delight to give pleasure  he is the very basis of civilised society and without him a dinnerparty even at the mansions of the great is as dull as a lecture at the royal society or a debate at the incorporated authors or one of mr burnands farcical comedies  nor will he be welcomed by society alone  art breaking from the prisonhouse of realism will run to greet him and will kiss his false beautiful lips knowing that he alone is in possession of the great secret of all her manifestations the secret that truth is entirely and absolutely a matter of style while lifepoor probable uninteresting human lifetired of repeating herself for the benefit of mr herbert spencer scientific historians and the compilers of statistics in general will follow meekly after him and try to reproduce in her own simple and untutored way some of the marvels of which he talks  no doubt there will always be critics who like a certain writer in the saturday review will gravely censure the teller of fairy tales for his defective knowledge of natural history who will measure imaginative work by their own lack of any imaginative faculty and will hold up their inkstained hands in horror if some honest gentleman who has never been farther than the yewtrees of his own garden pens a fascinating book of travels like sir john mandeville or like great raleigh writes a whole history of the world without knowing anything whatsoever about the past  to excuse themselves they will try and shelter under the shield of him who made prospero the magician and gave him caliban and ariel as his servants who heard the tritons blowing their horns round the coral reefs of the enchanted isle and the fairies singing to each other in a wood near athens who led the phantom kings in dim procession across the misty scottish heath and hid hecate in a cave with the weird sisters  they will call upon shakespearethey always doand will quote that hackneyed passage forgetting that this unfortunate aphorism about art holding the mirror up to nature is deliberately said by hamlet in order to convince the bystanders of his absolute insanity in all artmatters  cyril  ahem  another cigarette please  vivian  my dear fellow whatever you may say it is merely a dramatic utterance and no more represents shakespeares real views upon art than the speeches of iago represent his real views upon morals  but let me get to the end of the passage  art finds her own perfection within and not outside of herself she is not to be judged by any external standard of resemblance she is a veil rather than a mirror  she has flowers that no forests know of birds that no woodland possesses  she makes and unmakes many worlds and can draw the moon from heaven with a scarlet thread  hers are the forms more real than living man and hers the great archetypes of which things that have existence are but unfinished copies  nature has in her eyes no laws no uniformity  she can work miracles at her will and when she calls monsters from the deep they come  she can bid the almondtree blossom in winter and send the snow upon the ripe cornfield  at her word the frost lays its silver finger on the burning mouth of june and the winged lions creep out from the hollows of the lydian hills  the dryads peer from the thicket as she passes by and the brown fauns smile strangely at her when she comes near them  she has hawkfaced gods that worship her and the centaurs gallop at her side  cyril  i like that  i can see it  is that the end  vivian  no  there is one more passage but it is purely practical  it simply suggests some methods by which we could revive this lost art of lying  cyril  well before you read it to me i should like to ask you a question  what do you mean by saying that life poor probable uninteresting human life will try to reproduce the marvels of art  i can quite understand your objection to art being treated as a mirror  you think it would reduce genius to the position of a cracked lookingglass  but you dont mean to say that you seriously believe that life imitates art that life in fact is the mirror and art the reality  vivian  certainly i do  paradox though it may seemand paradoxes are always dangerous thingsit is none the less true that life imitates art far more than art imitates life  we have all seen in our own day in england how a certain curious and fascinating type of beauty invented and emphasised by two imaginative painters has so influenced life that whenever one goes to a private view or to an artistic salon one sees here the mystic eyes of rossettis dream the long ivory throat the strange squarecut jaw the loosened shadowy hair that he so ardently loved there the sweet maidenhood of the golden stair the blossomlike mouth and weary loveliness of the laus amoris the passionpale face of andromeda the thin hands and lithe beauty of the vivian in merlins dream  and it has always been so  a great artist invents a type and life tries to copy it to reproduce it in a popular form like an enterprising publisher  neither holbein nor vandyck found in england what they have given us  they brought their types with them and life with her keen imitative faculty set herself to supply the master with models  the greeks with their quick artistic instinct understood this and set in the brides chamber the statue of hermes or of apollo that she might bear children as lovely as the works of art that she looked at in her rapture or her pain  they knew that life gains from art not merely spirituality depth of thought and feeling soulturmoil or soul peace but that she can form herself on the very lines and colours of art and can reproduce the dignity of pheidias as well as the grace of praxiteles  hence came their objection to realism  they disliked it on purely social grounds  they felt that it inevitably makes people ugly and they were perfectly right  we try to improve the conditions of the race by means of good air free sunlight wholesome water and hideous bare buildings for the better housing of the lower orders  but these things merely produce health they do not produce beauty  for this art is required and the true disciples of the great artist are not his studioimitators but those who become like his works of art be they plastic as in greek days or pictorial as in modern times in a word life is arts best arts only pupil  as it is with the visible arts so it is with literature  the most obvious and the vulgarest form in which this is shown is in the case of the silly boys who after reading the adventures of jack sheppard or dick turpin pillage the stalls of unfortunate apple women break into sweetshops at night and alarm old gentlemen who are returning home from the city by leaping out on them in suburban lanes with black masks and unloaded revolvers  this interesting phenomenon which always occurs after the appearance of a new edition of either of the books i have alluded to is usually attributed to the influence of literature on the imagination  but this is a mistake  the imagination is essentially creative and always seeks for a new form  the boyburglar is simply the inevitable result of lifes imitative instinct  he is fact occupied as fact usually is with trying to reproduce fiction and what we see in him is repeated on an extended scale throughout the whole of life  schopenhauer has analysed the pessimism that characterises modern thought but hamlet invented it  the world has become sad because a puppet was once melancholy  the nihilist that strange martyr who has no faith who goes to the stake without enthusiasm and dies for what he does not believe in is a purely literary product  he was invented by tourgenieff and completed by dostoieffski  robespierre came out of the pages of rousseau as surely as the peoples palace rose out of the debris of a novel literature always anticipates life  it does not copy it but moulds it to its purpose  the nineteenth century as we know it is largely an invention of balzac  our luciens de rubempre our rastignacs and de marsays made their first appearance on the stage of the comedie humaine  we are merely carrying out with footnotes and unnecessary additions the whim or fancy or creative vision of a great novelist  i once asked a lady who knew thackeray intimately whether he had had any model for becky sharp  she told me that becky was an invention but that the idea of the character had been partly suggested by a governess who lived in the neighbourhood of kensington square and was the companion of a very selfish and rich old woman  i inquired what became of the governess and she replied that oddly enough some years after the appearance of vanity fair she ran away with the nephew of the lady with whom she was living and for a short time made a great splash in society quite in mrs rawdon crawleys style and entirely by mrs rawdon crawleys methods  ultimately she came to grief disappeared to the continent and used to be occasionally seen at monte carlo and other gambling places  the noble gentleman from whom the same great sentimentalist drew colonel newcome died a few months after the newcomer had reached a fourth edition with the word adsum on his lips  shortly after mr stevenson published his curious psychological story of transformation a friend of mine called mr hyde was in the north of london and being anxious to get to a railway station took what he thought would be a short cut lost his way and found himself in a network of mean evillooking streets  feeling rather nervous he began to walk extremely fast when suddenly out of an archway ran a child right between his legs  it fell on the pavement he tripped over it and trampled upon it  being of course very much frightened and a little hurt it began to scream and in a few seconds the whole street was full of rough people who came pouring out of the houses like ants  they surrounded him and asked him his name  he was just about to give it when he suddenly remembered the opening incident in mr stevensons story  he was so filled with horror at having realised in his own person that terrible and wellwritten scene and at having done accidentally though in fact what the mr hyde of fiction had done with deliberate intent that he ran away as hard as he could go  he was however very closely followed and finally he took refuge in a surgery the door of which happened to be open where he explained to a young assistant who happened to be there exactly what had occurred  the humanitarian crowd were induced to go away on his giving them a small sum of money and as soon as the coast was clear he left  as he passed out the name on the brass doorplate of the surgery caught his eye  it was jekyll  at least it should have been  here the imitation as far as it went was of course accidental in the following case the imitation was selfconscious  in the year 1879 just after i had left oxford i met at a reception at the house of one of the foreign ministers a woman of very curious exotic beauty  we became great friends and were constantly together  and yet what interested me most in her was not her beauty but her character her entire vagueness of character  she seemed to have no personality at all but simply the possibility of many types  sometimes she would give herself up entirely to art turn her drawingroom into a studio and spend two or three days a week at picture galleries or museums  then she would take to attending racemeetings wear the most horsey clothes and talk about nothing but betting  she abandoned religion for mesmerism mesmerism for politics and politics for the melodramatic excitements of philanthropy  in fact she was a kind of proteus and as much a failure in all her transformations as was that wondrous seagod when odysseus laid hold of him  one day a serial began in one of the french magazines  at that time i used to read serial stories and i well remember the shock of surprise i felt when i came to the description of the heroine  she was so like my friend that i brought her the magazine and she recognised herself in it immediately and seemed fascinated by the resemblance  i should tell you by the way that the story was translated from some dead russian writer so that the author had not taken his type from my friend  well to put the matter briefly some months afterwards i was in venice and finding the magazine in the readingroom of the hotel i took it up casually to see what had become of the heroine  it was a most piteous tale as the girl had ended by running away with a man absolutely inferior to her not merely in social station but in character and intellect also  i wrote to my friend that evening about my views on john bellini and the admirable ices at florians and the artistic value of gondolas but added a postscript to the effect that her double in the story had behaved in a very silly manner  i dont know why i added that but i remember i had a sort of dread over me that she might do the same thing  before my letter had reached her she had run away with a man who deserted her in six months  i saw her in 1884 in paris where she was living with her mother and i asked her whether the story had had anything to do with her action  she told me that she had felt an absolutely irresistible impulse to follow the heroine step by step in her strange and fatal progress and that it was with a feeling of real terror that she had looked forward to the last few chapters of the story  when they appeared it seemed to her that she was compelled to reproduce them in life and she did so  it was a most clear example of this imitative instinct of which i was speaking and an extremely tragic one  however i do not wish to dwell any further upon individual instances  personal experience is a most vicious and limited circle  all that i desire to point out is the general principle that life imitates art far more than art imitates life and i feel sure that if you think seriously about it you will find that it is true  life holds the mirror up to art and either reproduces some strange type imagined by painter or sculptor or realises in fact what has been dreamed in fiction  scientifically speaking the basis of lifethe energy of life as aristotle would call itis simply the desire for expression and art is always presenting various forms through which this expression can be attained  life seizes on them and uses them even if they be to her own hurt young men have committed suicide because rolla did so have died by their own hand because by his own hand werther died  think of what we owe to the imitation of christ of what we owe to the imitation of caesar  cyril  the theory is certainly a very curious one but to make it complete you must show that nature no less than life is an imitation of art  are you prepared to prove that  vivian  my dear fellow i am prepared to prove anything  cyril  nature follows the landscape painter then and takes her effects from him  vivian  certainly  where if not from the impressionists do we get those wonderful brown fogs that come creeping down our streets blurring the gaslamps and changing the houses into monstrous shadows  to whom if not to them and their master do we owe the lovely silver mists that brood over our river and turn to faint forms of fading grace curved bridge and swaying barge  the extraordinary change that has taken place in the climate of london during the last ten years is entirely due to a particular school of art  you smile  consider the matter from a scientific or a metaphysical point of view and you will find that i am right  for what is nature  nature is no great mother who has borne us  she is our creation  it is in our brain that she quickens to life things are because we see them and what we see and how we see it depends on the arts that have influenced us  to look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing  one does not see anything until one sees its beauty  then and then only does it come into existence  at present people see fogs not because there are fogs but because poets and painters have taught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects  there may have been fogs for centuries in london  i dare say there were  but no one saw them and so we do not know anything about them  they did not exist till art had invented them  now it must be admitted fogs are carried to excess  they have become the mere mannerism of a clique and the exaggerated realism of their method gives dull people bronchitis  where the cultured catch an effect the uncultured catch cold  and so let us be humane and invite art to turn her wonderful eyes elsewhere  she has done so already indeed  that white quivering sunlight that one sees now in france with its strange blotches of mauve and its restless violet shadows is her latest fancy and on the whole nature reproduces it quite admirably  where she used to give us corots and daubignys she gives us now exquisite monets and entrancing pissaros  indeed there are moments rare it is true but still to be observed from time to time when nature becomes absolutely modern  of course she is not always to be relied upon  the fact is that she is in this unfortunate position  art creates an incomparable and unique effect and having done so passes on to other things  nature upon the other hand forgetting that imitation can be made the sincerest form of insult keeps on repeating this effect until we all become absolutely wearied of it nobody of any real culture for instance ever talks nowadays about the beauty of a sunset  sunsets are quite oldfashioned  they belong to the time when turner was the last note in art  to admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism of temperament  upon the other hand they go on  yesterday evening mrs arundel insisted on my going to the window and looking at the glorious sky as she called it  of course i had to look at it  she is one of those absurdly pretty philistines to whom one can deny nothing  and what was it  it was simply a very secondrate turner a turner of a bad period with all the painters worst faults exaggerated and over emphasised  of course i am quite ready to admit that life very often commits the same error  she produces her false renes and her sham vautrins just as nature gives us on one day a doubtful cuyp and on another a more than questionable rousseau  still nature irritates one more when she does things of that kind  it seems so stupid so obvious so unnecessary  a false vautrin might be delightful  a doubtful cuyp is unbearable  however i dont want to be too hard on nature  i wish the channel especially at hastings did not look quite so often like a henry moore grey pearl with yellow lights but then when art is more varied nature will no doubt be more varied also  that she imitates art i dont think even her worst enemy would deny now  it is the one thing that keeps her in touch with civilised man  but have i proved my theory to your satisfaction  cyril  you have proved it to my dissatisfaction which is better but even admitting this strange imitative instinct in life and nature surely you would acknowledge that art expresses the temper of its age the spirit of its time the moral and social conditions that surround it and under whose influence it is produced  vivian  certainly not  art never expresses anything but itself this is the principle of my new aesthetics and it is this more than that vital connection between form and substance on which mr pater dwells that makes music the type of all the arts  of course nations and individuals with that healthy natural vanity which is the secret of existence are always under the impression that it is of them that the muses are talking always trying to find in the calm dignity of imaginative art some mirror of their own turbid passions always forgetting that the singer of life is not apollo but marsyas  remote from reality and with her eyes turned away from the shadows of the cave art reveals her own perfection and the wondering crowd that watches the opening of the marvellous manypetalled rose fancies that it is its own history that is being told to it its own spirit that is finding expression in a new form  but it is not so  the highest art rejects the burden of the human spirit and gains more from a new medium or a fresh material than she does from any enthusiasm for art or from any lofty passion or from any great awakening of the human consciousness  she develops purely on her own lines  she is not symbolic of any age  it is the ages that are her symbols  even those who hold that art is representative of time and place and people cannot help admitting that the more imitative an art is the less it represents to us the spirit of its age  the evil faces of the roman emperors look out at us from the foul porphyry and spotted jasper in which the realistic artists of the day delighted to work and we fancy that in those cruel lips and heavy sensual jaws we can find the secret of the ruin of the empire  but it was not so  the vices of tiberius could not destroy that supreme civilisation any more than the virtues of the antonines could save it  it fell for other for less interesting reasons  the sibyls and prophets of the sistine may indeed serve to interpret for some that new birth of the emancipated spirit that we call the renaissance but what do the drunken boors and bawling peasants of dutch art tell us about the great soul of holland  the more abstract the more ideal an art is the more it reveals to us the temper of its age  if we wish to understand a nation by means of its art let us look at its architecture or its music  cyril  i quite agree with you there  the spirit of an age may be best expressed in the abstract ideal arts for the spirit itself is abstract and ideal  upon the other hand for the visible aspect of an age for its look as the phrase goes we must of course go to the arts of imitation  vivian  i dont think so  after all what the imitative arts really give us are merely the various styles of particular artists or of certain schools of artists  surely you dont imagine that the people of the middle ages bore any resemblance at all to the figures on mediaeval stained glass or in mediaeval stone and wood carving or on mediaeval metalwork or tapestries or illuminated mss  they were probably very ordinarylooking people with nothing grotesque or remarkable or fantastic in their appearance  the middle ages as we know them in art are simply a definite form of style and there is no reason at all why an artist with this style should not be produced in the nineteenth century  no great artist ever sees things as they really are  if he did he would cease to be an artist  take an example from our own day  i know that you are fond of japanese things  now do you really imagine that the japanese people as they are presented to us in art have any existence  if you do you have never understood japanese art at all  the japanese people are the deliberate selfconscious creation of certain individual artists  if you set a picture by hokusai or hokkei or any of the great native painters beside a real japanese gentleman or lady you will see that there is not the slightest resemblance between them  the actual people who live in japan are not unlike the general run of english people that is to say they are extremely commonplace and have nothing curious or extraordinary about them  in fact the whole of japan is a pure invention  there is no such country there are no such people one of our most charming painters went recently to the land of the chrysanthemum in the foolish hope of seeing the japanese  all he saw all he had the chance of painting were a few lanterns and some fans  he was quite unable to discover the inhabitants as his delightful exhibition at messrs dowdeswells gallery showed only too well  he did not know that the japanese people are as i have said simply a mode of style an exquisite fancy of art  and so if you desire to see a japanese effect you will not behave like a tourist and go to tokio  on the contrary you will stay at home and steep yourself in the work of certain japanese artists and then when you have absorbed the spirit of their style and caught their imaginative manner of vision you will go some afternoon and sit in the park or stroll down piccadilly and if you cannot see an absolutely japanese effect there you will not see it anywhere or to return again to the past take as another instance the ancient greeks  do you think that greek art ever tells us what the greek people were like  do you believe that the athenian women were like the stately dignified figures of the parthenon frieze or like those marvellous goddesses who sat in the triangular pediments of the same building  if you judge from the art they certainly were so  but read an authority like aristophanes for instance you will find that the athenian ladies laced tightly wore high heeled shoes dyed their hair yellow painted and rouged their faces and were exactly like any silly fashionable or fallen creature of our own day  the fact is that we look back on the ages entirely through the medium of art and art very fortunately has never once told us the truth  cyril  but modern portraits by english painters what of them surely they are like the people they pretend to represent  vivian  quite so  they are so like them that a hundred years from now no one will believe in them  the only portraits in which one believes are portraits where there is very little of the sitter and a very great deal of the artist  holbeins drawings of the men and women of his time impress us with a sense of their absolute reality  but this is simply because holbein compelled life to accept his conditions to restrain itself within his limitations to reproduce his type and to appear as he wished it to appear  it is style that makes us believe in a thingnothing but style  most of our modern portrait painters are doomed to absolute oblivion they never paint what they see  they paint what the public sees and the public never sees anything  cyril  well after that i think i should like to hear the end of your article  vivian  with pleasure  whether it will do any good i really cannot say  ours is certainly the dullest and most prosaic century possible  why even sleep has played us false and has closed up the gates of ivory and opened the gates of horn  the dreams of the great middle classes of this country as recorded in mr myerss two bulky volumes on the subject and in the transactions of the psychical society are the most depressing things that i have ever read  there is not even a fine nightmare among them they are commonplace sordid and tedious  as for the church i cannot conceive anything better for the culture of a country than the presence in it of a body of men whose duty it is to believe in the supernatural to perform daily miracles and to keep alive that mythopoeic faculty which is so essential for the imagination  but in the english church a man succeeds not through his capacity for belief but through his capacity for disbelief  ours is the only church where the sceptic stands at the altar and where st thomas is regarded as the ideal apostle  many a worthy clergyman who passes his life in admirable works of kindly charity lives and dies unnoticed and unknown but it is sufficient for some shallow uneducated passman out of either university to get up in his pulpit and express his doubts about noahs ark or balaams ass or jonah and the whale for half of london to flock to hear him and to sit openmouthed in rapt admiration at his superb intellect  the growth of common sense in the english church is a thing very much to be regretted  it is really a degrading concession to a low form of realism  it is silly too  it springs from an entire ignorance of psychology  man can believe the impossible but man can never believe the improbable  however i must read the end of my article  what we have to do what at any rate it is our duty to do is to revive this old art of lying  much of course may be done in the way of educating the public by amateurs in the domestic circle at literary lunches and at afternoon teas  but this is merely the light and graceful side of lying such as was probably heard at cretan dinnerparties  there are many other forms  lying for the sake of gaining some immediate personal advantage for instance lying with a moral purpose as it is usually calledthough of late it has been rather looked down upon was extremely popular with the antique world  athena laughs when odysseus tells her his words of sly devising as mr william morris phrases it and the glory of mendacity illumines the pale brow of the stainless hero of euripidean tragedy and sets among the noble women of the past the young bride of one of horaces most exquisite odes  later on what at first had been merely a natural instinct was elevated into a selfconscious science  elaborate rules were laid down for the guidance of mankind and an important school of literature grew up round the subject  indeed when one remembers the excellent philosophical treatise of sanchez on the whole question one cannot help regretting that no one has ever thought of publishing a cheap and condensed edition of the works of that great casuist  a short primer when to lie and how if brought out in an attractive and not too expensive a form would no doubt command a large sale and would prove of real practical service to many earnest and deep thinking people  lying for the sake of the improvement of the young which is the basis of home education still lingers amongst us and its advantages are so admirably set forth in the early books of platos republic that it is unnecessary to dwell upon them here  it is a mode of lying for which all good mothers have peculiar capabilities but it is capable of still further development and has been sadly overlooked by the school board lying for the sake of a monthly salary is of course well known in fleet street and the profession of a political leaderwriter is not without its advantages  but it is said to be a somewhat dull occupation and it certainly does not lead to much beyond a kind of ostentatious obscurity  the only form of lying that is absolutely beyond reproach is lying for its own sake and the highest development of this is as we have already pointed out lying in art  just as those who do not love plato more than truth cannot pass beyond the threshold of the academe so those who do not love beauty more than truth never know the inmost shrine of art  the solid stolid british intellect lies in the desert sands like the sphinx in flauberts marvellous tale and fantasy la chimere dances round it and calls to it with her false flutetoned voice it may not hear her now but surely some day when we are all bored to death with the commonplace character of modern fiction it will hearken to her and try to borrow her wings  and when that day dawns or sunset reddens how joyous we shall all be  facts will be regarded as discreditable truth will be found mourning over her fetters and romance with her temper of wonder will return to the land  the very aspect of the world will change to our startled eyes  out of the sea will rise behemoth and leviathan and sail round the highpooped galleys as they do on the delightful maps of those ages when books on geography were actually readable  dragons will wander about the waste places and the phoenix will soar from her nest of fire into the air  we shall lay our hands upon the basilisk and see the jewel in the toads head  champing his gilded oats the hippogriff will stand in our stalls and over our heads will float the blue bird singing of beautiful and impossible things of things that are lovely and that never happen of things that are not and that should be  but before this comes to pass we must cultivate the lost art of lying  cyril  then we must entirely cultivate it at once  but in order to avoid making any error i want you to tell me briefly the doctrines of the new aesthetics  vivian  briefly then they are these  art never expresses anything but itself  it has an independent life just as thought has and develops purely on its own lines  it is not necessarily realistic in an age of realism nor spiritual in an age of faith so far from being the creation of its time it is usually in direct opposition to it and the only history that it preserves for us is the history of its own progress  sometimes it returns upon its footsteps and revives some antique form as happened in the archaistic movement of late greek art and in the preraphaelite movement of our own day  at other times it entirely anticipates its age and produces in one century work that it takes another century to understand to appreciate and to enjoy  in no case does it reproduce its age  to pass from the art of a time to the time itself is the great mistake that all historians commit  the second doctrine is this  all bad art comes from returning to life and nature and elevating them into ideals  life and nature may sometimes be used as part of arts rough material but before they are of any real service to art they must be translated into artistic conventions  the moment art surrenders its imaginative medium it surrenders everything  as a method realism is a complete failure and the two things that every artist should avoid are modernity of form and modernity of subjectmatter  to us who live in the nineteenth century any century is a suitable subject for art except our own  the only beautiful things are the things that do not concern us  it is to have the pleasure of quoting myself exactly because hecuba is nothing to us that her sorrows are so suitable a motive for a tragedy  besides it is only the modern that ever becomes oldfashioned  m zola sits down to give us a picture of the second empire  who cares for the second empire now it is out of date  life goes faster than realism but romanticism is always in front of life  the third doctrine is that life imitates art far more than art imitates life  this results not merely from lifes imitative instinct but from the fact that the selfconscious aim of life is to find expression and that art offers it certain beautiful forms through which it may realise that energy  it is a theory that has never been put forward before but it is extremely fruitful and throws an entirely new light upon the history of art  it follows as a corollary from this that external nature also imitates art  the only effects that she can show us are effects that we have already seen through poetry or in paintings  this is the secret of natures charm as well as the explanation of natures weakness  the final revelation is that lying the telling of beautiful untrue things is the proper aim of art  but of this i think i have spoken at sufficient length  and now let us go out on the terrace where droops the milkwhite peacock like a ghost while the evening star washes the dusk with silver  at twilight nature becomes a wonderfully suggestive effect and is not without loveliness though perhaps its chief use is to illustrate quotations from the poets  come  we have talked long enough    pen pencil and poisona study in green    it has constantly been made a subject of reproach against artists and men of letters that they are lacking in wholeness and completeness of nature  as a rule this must necessarily be so that very concentration of vision and intensity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic temperament is in itself a mode of limitation  to those who are preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of much importance  yet there are many exceptions to this rule  rubens served as ambassador and goethe as state councillor and milton as latin secretary to cromwell sophocles held civic office in his own city the humourists essayists and novelists of modern america seem to desire nothing better than to become the diplomatic representatives of their country and charles lambs friend thomas griffiths wainewright the subject of this brief memoir though of an extremely artistic temperament followed many masters other than art being not merely a poet and a painter an artcritic an antiquarian and a writer of prose an amateur of beautiful things and a dilettante of things delightful but also a forger of no mean or ordinary capabilities and as a subtle and secret poisoner almost without rival in this or any age  this remarkable man so powerful with pen pencil and poison as a great poet of our own day has finely said of him was born at chiswick in 1794  his father was the son of a distinguished solicitor of grays inn and hatton garden  his mother was the daughter of the celebrated dr griffiths the editor and founder of the monthly review the partner in another literary speculation of thomas davis that famous bookseller of whom johnson said that he was not a bookseller but a gentleman who dealt in books the friend of goldsmith and wedgwood and one of the most wellknown men of his day  mrs wainewright died in giving him birth at the early age of twentyone and an obituary notice in the gentlemans magazine tells us of her amiable disposition and numerous accomplishments and adds somewhat quaintly that she is supposed to have understood the writings of mr locke as well as perhaps any person of either sex now living  his father did not long survive his young wife and the little child seems to have been brought up by his grandfather and on the death of the latter in 1803 by his uncle george edward griffiths whom he subsequently poisoned  his boyhood was passed at linden house turnham green one of those many fine georgian mansions that have unfortunately disappeared before the inroads of the suburban builder and to its lovely gardens and welltimbered park he owed that simple and impassioned love of nature which never left him all through his life and which made him so peculiarly susceptible to the spiritual influences of wordsworths poetry  he went to school at charles burneys academy at hammersmith  mr burney was the son of the historian of music and the near kinsman of the artistic lad who was destined to turn out his most remarkable pupil  he seems to have been a man of a good deal of culture and in after years mr wainewright often spoke of him with much affection as a philosopher an archaeologist and an admirable teacher who while he valued the intellectual side of education did not forget the importance of early moral training  it was under mr burney that he first developed his talent as an artist and mr hazlitt tells us that a drawingbook which he used at school is still extant and displays great talent and natural feeling  indeed painting was the first art that fascinated him  it was not till much later that he sought to find expression by pen or poison  before this however he seems to have been carried away by boyish dreams of the romance and chivalry of a soldiers life and to have become a young guardsman  but the reckless dissipated life of his companions failed to satisfy the refined artistic temperament of one who was made for other things  in a short time he wearied of the service  art he tells us in words that still move many by their ardent sincerity and strange fervour art touched her renegade by her pure and high influence the noisome mists were purged my feelings parched hot and tarnished were renovated with cool fresh bloom simple beautiful to the simplehearted but art was not the only cause of the change  the writings of wordsworth he goes on to say did much towards calming the confusing whirl necessarily incident to sudden mutations  i wept over them tears of happiness and gratitude  he accordingly left the army with its rough barracklife and coarse messroom tittle tattle and returned to linden house full of this newborn enthusiasm for culture  a severe illness in which to use his own words he was broken like a vessel of clay prostrated him for a time  his delicately strung organisation however indifferent it might have been to inflicting pain on others was itself most keenly sensitive to pain  he shrank from suffering as a thing that mars and maims human life and seems to have wandered through that terrible valley of melancholia from which so many great perhaps greater spirits have never emerged  but he was youngonly twentyfive years of ageand he soon passed out of the dead black waters as he called them into the larger air of humanistic culture  as he was recovering from the illness that had led him almost to the gates of death he conceived the idea of taking up literature as an art  i said with john woodvil he cries it were a life of gods to dwell in such an element to see and hear and write brave things   these high and gusty relishes of life have no allayings of mortality   it is impossible not to feel that in this passage we have the utterance of a man who had a true passion for letters  to see and hear and write brave things this was his aim  scott the editor of the london magazine struck by the young mans genius or under the influence of the strange fascination that he exercised on every one who knew him invited him to write a series of articles on artistic subjects and under a series of fanciful pseudonym he began to contribute to the literature of his day janus weathercock egomet bonmot and van vinkvooms were some of the grotesque masks under which he choose to hide his seriousness or to reveal his levity  a mask tells us more than a face  these disguises intensified his personality  in an incredibly short time he seems to have made his mark  charles lamb speaks of kind lighthearted wainewright whose prose is capital  we hear of him entertaining macready john forster maginn talfourd sir wentworth dilke the poet john clare and others at a petitdiner like disraeli he determined to startle the town as a dandy and his beautiful rings his antique cameo breastpin and his pale lemoncoloured kid gloves were well known and indeed were regarded by hazlitt as being the signs of a new manner in literature  while his rich curly hair fine eyes and exquisite white hands gave him the dangerous and delightful distinction of being different from others  there was something in him of balzacs lucien de rubempre  at times he reminds us of julien sorel  de quincey saw him once  it was at a dinner at charles lambs  amongst the company all literary men sat a murderer he tells us and he goes on to describe how on that day he had been ill and had hated the face of man and woman and yet found himself looking with intellectual interest across the table at the young writer beneath whose affectations of manner there seemed to him to lie so much unaffected sensibility and speculates on what sudden growth of another interest would have changed his mood had he known of what terrible sin the guest to whom lamb paid so much attention was even then guilty  his lifework falls naturally under the three heads suggested by mr swinburne and it may be partly admitted that if we set aside his achievements in the sphere of poison what he has actually left to us hardly justifies his reputation  but then it is only the philistine who seeks to estimate a personality by the vulgar test of production  this young dandy sought to be somebody rather than to do something  he recognised that life itself is in art and has its modes of style no less than the arts that seek to express it  nor is his work without interest  we hear of william blake stopping in the royal academy before one of his pictures and pronouncing it to be very fine his essays are prefiguring of much that has since been realised he seems to have anticipated some of those accidents of modern culture that are regarded by many as true essentials  he writes about la gioconda and early french poets and the italian renaissance  he loves greek gems and persian carpets and elizabethan translations of cupid and psyche and the hypnerotomachia and bookbinding and early editions and wide margined proofs  he is keenly sensitive to the value of beautiful surroundings and never wearies of describing to us the rooms in which he lived or would have liked to live  he had that curious love of green which in individuals is always the sign of a subtle artistic temperament and in nations is said to denote a laxity if not a decadence of morals  like baudelaire he was extremely fond of cats and with gautier he was fascinated by that sweet marble monster of both sexes that we can still see at florence and in the louvre  there is of course much in his descriptions and his suggestions for decoration that shows that he did not entirely free himself from the false taste of his time  but it is clear that he was one of the first to recognise what is indeed the very keynote of aesthetic eclecticism i mean the true harmony of all really beautiful things irrespective of age or place of school or manner he saw that in decorating a room which is to be not a room for show but a room to live in we should never aim at any archaeological reconstruction of the past nor burden ourselves with any fanciful necessity for historical accuracy  in this artistic perception he was perfectly right  all beautiful things belong to the same age  and so in his own library as he describes it we find the delicate fictile vase of the greek with its exquisitely painted figures and the faint greek text which cannot be reproduced finely traced upon its side and behind it hangs an engraving of the delphic sibyl of michael angelo or of the pastoral of giorgione  here is a bit of florentine majolica and here a rude lamp from some old roman tomb on the table lies a book of hours cased in a cover of solid silver gilt wrought with quaint devices and studded with small brilliants and rubies and close by it squats a little ugly monster a lar perhaps dug up in the sunny fields of cornbearing sicily  some dark antique bronzes contrast with the pale gleam of two noble christi crucifixi one carved in ivory the other moulded in wax  he has his trays of tassies gems his tiny louisquatorze bonbonniere with a miniature by petitot his highly prized brownbiscuit teapots filagree worked his citron morocco lettercase and his pomonagreen chair  one can fancy him lying there in the midst of his books and casts and engravings a true virtuoso a subtle connoisseur turning over his fine collection of mare antonios and his turners liber studiorum of which he was a warm admirer or examining with a magnifier some of his antique gems and cameos the head of alexander on an onyx of two strata or that superb altissimo relievo on cornelian jupiter aegiochus  he was always a great amateur of engravings and gives some very useful suggestions as to the best means of forming a collection  indeed while fully appreciating modern art he never lost sight of the importance of reproductions of the great masterpieces of the past and all that he says about the value of plaster casts is quite admirable  as an artcritic he concerned himself primarily with the complex impressions produced by a work of art and certainly the first step in aesthetic criticism is to realise ones own impressions  he cared nothing for abstract discussions on the nature of the beautiful and the historical method which has since yielded such rich fruit did not belong to his day but he never lost sight of the great truth that arts first appeal is neither to the intellect nor to the emotions but purely to the artistic temperament and he more than once points out that this temperament this taste as he calls it being unconsciously guided and made perfect by frequent contact with the best work becomes in the end a form of right judgment  of course there are fashions in art just as there are fashions in dress and perhaps none of us can ever quite free ourselves from the influence of custom and the influence of novelty  he certainly could not and he frankly acknowledges how difficult it is to form any fair estimate of contemporary work but on the whole his taste was good and sound  he admired turner and constable at a time when they were not so much thought of as they are now and saw that for the highest landscape art we require more than mere industry and accurate transcription  of cromes heath scene near norwich he remarks that it shows how much a subtle observation of the elements in their wild moods does for a most uninteresting flat and of the popular type of landscape of his day he says that it is simply an enumeration of hill and dale stumps of trees shrubs water meadows cottages and houses little more than topography a kind of pictorial mapwork in which rainbows showers mists haloes large beams shooting through rifted clouds storms starlight all the most valued materials of the real painter are not  he had a thorough dislike of what is obvious or commonplace in art and while he was charmed to entertain wilkie at dinner he cared as little for sir davids pictures as he did for mr crabbes poems  with the imitative and realistic tendencies of his day he had no sympathy and he tells us frankly that his great admiration for fuseli was largely due to the fact that the little swiss did not consider it necessary that an artist should paint only what he sees  the qualities that he sought for in a picture were composition beauty and dignity of line richness of colour and imaginative power  upon the other hand he was not a doctrinaire  i hold that no work of art can be tried otherwise than by laws deduced from itself  whether or not it be consistent with itself is the question  this is one of his excellent aphorisms  and in criticising painters so different as landseer and martin stothard and etty he shows that to use a phrase now classical he is trying to see the object as in itself it really is  however as i pointed out before he never feels quite at his ease in his criticisms of contemporary work  the present he says is about as agreeable a confusion to me as ariosto on the first perusal    modern things dazzle me  i must look at them through times telescope  elia complains that to him the merit of a ms poem is uncertain print as he excellently says settles it  fifty years toning does the same thing to a picture  he is happier when he is writing about watteau and lancret about rubens and giorgione about rembrandt corregio and michael angelo happiest of all when he is writing about greek things  what is gothic touched him very little but classical art and the art of the renaissance were always dear to him  he saw what our english school could gain from a study of greek models and never wearies of pointing out to the young student the artistic possibilities that lie dormant in hellenic marbles and hellenic methods of work in his judgments on the great italian masters says de quincey there seemed a tone of sincerity and of native sensibility as in one who spoke for himself and was not merely a copier from books the highest praise that we can give to him is that he tried to revive style as a conscious tradition  but he saw that no amount of art lectures or art congresses or plans for advancing the fine arts will ever produce this result  the people he says very wisely and in the true spirit of toynbee hall must always have the best models constantly before their eyes  as is to be expected from one who was a painter he is often extremely technical in his art criticisms  of tintorets st george delivering the egyptian princess from the dragon he remarks   the robe of sabra warmly glazed with prussian blue is relieved from the pale greenish background by a vermilion scarf and the full hues of both are beautifully echoed as it were in a lower key by the purplelake coloured stuffs and bluish iron armour of the saint besides an ample balance to the vivid azure drapery on the foreground in the indigo shades of the wild wood surrounding the castle   and elsewhere he talks learnedly of a delicate schiavone various as a tulipbed with rich broken tints of a glowing portrait remarkable for morbidezza by the scarce moroni and of another picture being pulpy in the carnations  but as a rule he deals with his impressions of the work as an artistic whole and tries to translate those impressions into words to give as it were the literary equivalent for the imaginative and mental effect  he was one of the first to develop what has been called the artliterature of the nineteenth century that form of literature which has found in mr ruskin and mr browning its two most perfect exponents  his description of lancrets repas italien in which a darkhaired girl amorous of mischief lies on the daisypowdered grass is in some respects very charming  here is his account of the crucifixion by rembrandt  it is extremely characteristic of his style   darknesssooty portentous darknessshrouds the whole scene only above the accursed wood as if through a horrid rift in the murky ceiling a rainy delugesleetyflaw discoloured water streams down amain spreading a grisly spectral light even more horrible than that palpable night  already the earth pants thick and fast the darkened cross trembles the winds are droptthe air is stagnanta muttering rumble growls underneath their feet and some of that miserable crowd begin to fly down the hill  the horses snuff the coming terror and become unmanageable through fear  the moment rapidly approaches when nearly torn asunder by his own weight fainting with loss of blood which now runs in narrower rivulets from his slit veins his temples and breast drowned in sweat and his black tongue parched with the fiery deathfever jesus cries i thirst  the deadly vinegar is elevated to him  his head sinks and the sacred corpse swings senseless of the cross  a sheet of vermilion flame shoots sheer through the air and vanishes the rocks of carmel and lebanon cleave asunder the sea rolls on high from the sands its black weltering waves  earth yawns and the graves give up their dwellers  the dead and the living are mingled together in unnatural conjunction and hurry through the holy city  new prodigies await them there  the veil of the templethe unpierceable veilis rent asunder from top to bottom and that dreaded recess containing the hebrew mysteries the fatal ark with the tables and sevenbranched candelabrumis disclosed by the light of unearthly flames to the goddeserted multitude  rembrandt never painted this sketch and he was quite right  it would have lost nearly all its charms in losing that perplexing veil of indistinctness which affords such ample range wherein the doubting imagination may speculate  at present it is like a thing in another world  a dark gulf is betwixt us  it is not tangible by the body  we can only approach it in the spirit   in this passage written the author tells us in awe and reverence there is much that is terrible and very much that is quite horrible but it is not without a certain crude form of power or at any rate a certain crude violence of words a quality which this age should highly appreciate as it is its chief defect  it is pleasanter however to pass to this description of giulio romanos cephalus and procris   we should read moschuss lament for bion the sweet shepherd before looking at this picture or study the picture as a preparation for the lament  we have nearly the same images in both  for either victim the high groves and forest dells murmur the flowers exhale sad perfume from their buds the nightingale mourns on the craggy lands and the swallow in the longwinding vales the satyrs too and fauns darkveiled groan and the fountain nymphs within the wood melt into tearful waters  the sheep and goats leave their pasture and oreads who love to scale the most inaccessible tops of all uprightest rocks hurry down from the song of their windcourting pines while the dryads bend from the branches of the meeting trees and the rivers moan for white procris with manysobbing streams   filling the farseen ocean with a voice   the golden bees are silent on the thymy hymettus and the knelling horn of auroras love no more shall scatter away the cold twilight on the top of hymettus  the foreground of our subject is a grassy sunburnt bank broken into swells and hollows like waves a sort of landbreakers rendered more uneven by many foottripping roots and stumps of trees stocked untimely by the axe which are again throwing out lightgreen shoots  this bank rises rather suddenly on the right to a clustering grove penetrable to no star at the entrance of which sits the stunned thessalian king holding between his knees that ivorybright body which was but an instant agone parting the rough boughs with her smooth forehead and treading alike on thorns and flowers with jealousystung footnow helpless heavy void of all motion save when the breeze lifts her thick hair in mockery  from between the closelyneighboured boles astonished nymphs press forward with loud cries    and deerskinvested satyrs crowned with ivy twists advance and put strange pity in their horned countenance   laelaps lies beneath and shows by his panting the rapid pace of death  on the other side of the group virtuous love with vans dejected holds forth the arrow to an approaching troop of sylvan people fauns rams goats satyrs and satyrmothers pressing their children tighter with their fearful hands who hurry along from the left in a sunken path between the foreground and a rocky wall on whose lowest ridge a brookguardian pours from her urn her grieftelling waters  above and more remote than the ephidryad another female rending her locks appears among the vinefestooned pillars of an unshorn grove  the centre of the picture is filled by shady meadows sinking down to a rivermouth beyond is the vast strength of the ocean stream from whose floor the extinguisher of stars rosy aurora drives furiously up her brine washed steeds to behold the deathpangs of her rival   were this description carefully rewritten it would be quite admirable  the conception of making a prose poem out of paint is excellent  much of the best modern literature springs from the same aim  in a very ugly and sensible age the arts borrow not from life but from each other  his sympathies too were wonderfully varied  in everything connected with the stage for instance he was always extremely interested and strongly upheld the necessity for archaeological accuracy in costume and scenepainting  in art he says in one of his essays whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well and he points out that once we allow the intrusion of anachronisms it becomes difficult to say where the line is to be drawn  in literature again like lord beaconsfield on a famous occasion he was on the side of the angels  he was one of the first to admire keats and shelleythe tremulouslysensitive and poetical shelley as he calls him  his admiration for wordsworth was sincere and profound  he thoroughly appreciated william blake one of the best copies of the songs of innocence and experience that is now in existence was wrought specially for him  he loved alain chartier and ronsard and the elizabethan dramatists and chaucer and chapman and petrarch  and to him all the arts were one  our critics he remarks with much wisdom seem hardly aware of the identity of the primal seeds of poetry and painting nor that any true advancement in the serious study of one art co generates a proportionate perfection in the other and he says elsewhere that if a man who does not admire michael angelo talks of his love for milton he is deceiving either himself or his listeners  to his fellowcontributors in the london magazine he was always most generous and praises barry cornwall allan cunningham hazlitt elton and leigh hunt without anything of the malice of a friend  some of his sketches of charles lamb are admirable in their way and with the art of the true comedian borrow their style from their subject   what can i say of thee more than all know that thou hadst the gaiety of a boy with the knowledge of a man  as gentle a heart as ever sent tears to the eyes  how wittily would he mistake your meaning and put in a conceit most seasonably out of season  his talk without affectation was compressed like his beloved elizabethans even unto obscurity like grains of fine gold his sentences would beat out into whole sheets  he had small mercy on spurious fame and a caustic observation on the fashion for men of genius was a standing dish sir thomas browne was a bosom cronie of his so was burton and old fuller  in his amorous vein he dallied with that peerless duchess of manyfolio odour and with the heyday comedies of beaumont and fletcher he induced light dreams  he would deliver critical touches on these like one inspired but it was good to let him choose his own game if another began even on the acknowledged pets he was liable to interrupt or rather append in a mode difficult to define whether as misapprehensive or mischievous  one night at cs the above dramatic partners were the temporary subject of chat  mr x commended the passion and haughty style of a tragedy i dont know which of them but was instantly taken up by elia who told him that was nothing the lyrics were the high thingsthe lyrics   one side of his literary career deserves especial notice  modern journalism may be said to owe almost as much to him as to any man of the early part of this century  he was the pioneer of asiatic prose and delighted in pictorial epithets and pompous exaggerations  to have a style so gorgeous that it conceals the subject is one of the highest achievements of an important and much admired school of fleet street leaderwriters and this school janus weathercock may be said to have invented  he also saw that it was quite easy by continued reiteration to make the public interested in his own personality and in his purely journalistic articles this extraordinary young man tells the world what he had for dinner where he gets his clothes what wines he likes and in what state of health he is just as if he were writing weekly notes for some popular newspaper of our own time  this being the least valuable side of his work is the one that has had the most obvious influence  a publicist nowadays is a man who bores the community with the details of the illegalities of his private life  like most artificial people he had a great love of nature  i hold three things in high estimation he says somewhere  to sit lazily on an eminence that commands a rich prospect to be shadowed by thick trees while the sun shines around me and to enjoy solitude with the consciousness of neighbourhood  the country gives them all to me  he writes about his wandering over fragrant furze and heath repeating collinss ode to evening just to catch the fine quality of the moment about smothering his face in a watery bed of cowslips wet with may dews and about the pleasure of seeing the sweetbreathed kine pass slowly homeward through the twilight and hearing the distant clank of the sheepbell  one phrase of his the polyanthus glowed in its cold bed of earth like a solitary picture of giorgione on a dark oaken panel is curiously characteristic of his temperament and this passage is rather pretty in its way   the short tender grass was covered with margueritessuch that men called daisies in our townthick as stars on a summers night the harsh caw of the busy rooks came pleasantly mellowed from a high dusky grove of elms at some distance off and at intervals was heard the voice of a boy scaring away the birds from the newlysown seeds  the blue depths were the colour of the darkest ultramarine not a cloud streaked the calm aether only round the horizons edge streamed a light warm film of misty vapour against which the near village with its ancient stone church showed sharply out with blinding whiteness  i thought of wordsworths lines written in march   however we must not forget that the cultivated young man who penned these lines and who was so susceptible to wordsworthian influences was also as i said at the beginning of this memoir one of the most subtle and secret poisoners of this or any age how he first became fascinated by this strange sin he does not tell us and the diary in which he carefully noted the results of his terrible experiments and the methods that he adopted has unfortunately been lost to us  even in later days too he was always reticent on the matter and preferred to speak about the excursion and the poems founded on the affections  there is no doubt however that the poison that he used was strychnine  in one of the beautiful rings of which he was so proud and which served to show off the fine modelling of his delicate ivory hands he used to carry crystals of the indian nux vomica a poison one of his biographers tells us nearly tasteless difficult of discovery and capable of almost infinite dilution  his murders says de quincey were more than were ever made known judicially this is no doubt so and some of them are worthy of mention  his first victim was his uncle mr thomas griffiths  he poisoned him in 1829 to gain possession of linden house a place to which he had always been very much attached  in the august of the next year he poisoned mrs abercrombie his wifes mother and in the following december he poisoned the lovely helen abercrombie his sisterin law  why he murdered mrs abercrombie is not ascertained  it may have been for a caprice or to quicken some hideous sense of power that was in him or because she suspected something or for no reason  but the murder of helen abercrombie was carried out by himself and his wife for the sake of a sum of about 18000 pounds for which they had insured her life in various offices  the circumstances were as follows  on the 12th of december he and his wife and child came up to london from linden house and took lodgings at no 12 conduit street regent street  with them were the two sisters helen and madeleine abercrombie  on the evening of the 14th they all went to the play and at supper that night helen sickened  the next day she was extremely ill and dr locock of hanover square was called in to attend her  she lived till monday the 20th when after the doctors morning visit mr and mrs wainewright brought her some poisoned jelly and then went out for a walk  when they returned helen abercrombie was dead she was about twenty years of age a tall graceful girl with fair hair  a very charming redchalk drawing of her by her brotherin law is still in existence and shows how much his style as an artist was influenced by sir thomas lawrence a painter for whose work he had always entertained a great admiration  de quincey says that mrs wainewright was not really privy to the murder  let us hope that she was not  sin should be solitary and have no accomplices  the insurance companies suspecting the real facts of the case declined to pay the policy on the technical ground of misrepresentation and want of interest and with curious courage the poisoner entered an action in the court of chancery against the imperial it being agreed that one decision should govern all the cases  the trial however did not come on for five years when after one disagreement a verdict was ultimately given in the companies favour  the judge on the occasion was lord abinger egomet bonmot was represented by mr erle and sir william follet and the attorneygeneral and sir frederick pollock appeared for the other side  the plaintiff unfortunately was unable to be present at either of the trials  the refusal of the companies to give him the 18000 pounds had placed him in a position of most painful pecuniary embarrassment  indeed a few months after the murder of helen abercrombie he had been actually arrested for debt in the streets of london while he was serenading the pretty daughter of one of his friends  this difficulty was got over at the time but shortly afterwards he thought it better to go abroad till he could come to some practical arrangement with his creditors  he accordingly went to boulogne on a visit to the father of the young lady in question and while he was there induced him to insure his life with the pelican company for 3000 pounds  as soon as the necessary formalities had been gone through and the policy executed he dropped some crystals of strychnine into his coffee as they sat together one evening after dinner  he himself did not gain any monetary advantage by doing this  his aim was simply to revenge himself on the first office that had refused to pay him the price of his sin  his friend died the next day in his presence and he left boulogne at once for a sketching tour through the most picturesque parts of brittany and was for some time the guest of an old french gentleman who had a beautiful country house at st omer  from this he moved to paris where he remained for several years living in luxury some say while others talk of his skulking with poison in his pocket and being dreaded by all who knew him  in 1837 he returned to england privately  some strange mad fascination brought him back  he followed a woman whom he loved  it was the month of june and he was staying at one of the hotels in covent garden  his sittingroom was on the ground floor and he prudently kept the blinds down for fear of being seen  thirteen years before when he was making his fine collection of majolica and marc antonios he had forged the names of his trustees to a power of attorney which enabled him to get possession of some of the money which he had inherited from his mother and had brought into marriage settlement  he knew that this forgery had been discovered and that by returning to england he was imperilling his life  yet he returned  should one wonder  it was said that the woman was very beautiful  besides she did not love him  it was by a mere accident that he was discovered  a noise in the street attracted his attention and in his artistic interest in modern life he pushed aside the blind for a moment  some one outside called out thats wainewright the bankforger  it was forrester the bow street runner  on the 5th of july he was brought up at the old bailey  the following report of the proceedings appeared in the times   before mr justice vaughan and mr baron alderson thomas griffiths wainewright aged fortytwo a man of gentlemanly appearance wearing mustachios was indicted for forging and uttering a certain power of attorney for 2259 pounds with intent to defraud the governor and company of the bank of england  there were five indictments against the prisoner to all of which he pleaded not guilty when he was arraigned before mr serjeant arabin in the course of the morning  on being brought before the judges however he begged to be allowed to withdraw the former plea and then pleaded guilty to two of the indictments which were not of a capital nature  the counsel for the bank having explained that there were three other indictments but that the bank did not desire to shed blood the plea of guilty on the two minor charges was recorded and the prisoner at the close of the session sentenced by the recorder to transportation for life   he was taken back to newgate preparatory to his removal to the colonies  in a fanciful passage in one of his early essays he had fancied himself lying in horsemonger gaol under sentence of death for having been unable to resist the temptation of stealing some marc antonios from the british museum in order to complete his collection  the sentence now passed on him was to a man of his culture a form of death  he complained bitterly of it to his friends and pointed out with a good deal of reason some people may fancy that the money was practically his own having come to him from his mother and that the forgery such as it was had been committed thirteen years before which to use his own phrase was at least a circonstance attenuante  the permanence of personality is a very subtle metaphysical problem and certainly the english law solves the question in an extremely roughandready manner there is however something dramatic in the fact that this heavy punishment was inflicted on him for what if we remember his fatal influence on the prose of modern journalism was certainly not the worst of all his sins  while he was in gaol dickens macready and hablot browne came across him by chance  they had been going over the prisons of london searching for artistic effects and in newgate they suddenly caught sight of wainewright  he met them with a defiant stare forster tells us but macready was horrified to recognise a man familiarly known to him in former years and at whose table he had dined  others had more curiosity and his cell was for some time a kind of fashionable lounge  many men of letters went down to visit their old literary comrade  but he was no longer the kind lighthearted janus whom charles lamb admired  he seems to have grown quite cynical  to the agent of an insurance company who was visiting him one afternoon and thought he would improve the occasion by pointing out that after all crime was a bad speculation he replied sir you city men enter on your speculations and take the chances of them  some of your speculations succeed some fail  mine happen to have failed yours happen to have succeeded  that is the only difference sir between my visitor and me  but sir i will tell you one thing in which i have succeeded to the last  i have been determined through life to hold the position of a gentleman i have always done so  i do so still  it is the custom of this place that each of the inmates of a cell shall take his mornings turn of sweeping it out  i occupy a cell with a bricklayer and a sweep but they never offer me the broom  when a friend reproached him with the murder of helen abercrombie he shrugged his shoulders and said yes it was a dreadful thing to do but she had very thick ankles  from newgate he was brought to the hulks at portsmouth and sent from there in the susan to van diemens land along with three hundred other convicts  the voyage seems to have been most distasteful to him and in a letter written to a friend he spoke bitterly about the ignominy of the companion of poets and artists being compelled to associate with country bumpkins  the phrase that he applies to his companions need not surprise us  crime in england is rarely the result of sin  it is nearly always the result of starvation  there was probably no one on board in whom he would have found a sympathetic listener or even a psychologically interesting nature  his love of art however never deserted him  at hobart town he started a studio and returned to sketching and portraitpainting and his conversation and manners seem not to have lost their charm nor did he give up his habit of poisoning and there are two cases on record in which he tried to make away with people who had offended him  but his hand seems to have lost its cunning  both of his attempts were complete failures and in 1844 being thoroughly dissatisfied with tasmanian society he presented a memorial to the governor of the settlement sir john eardley wilmot praying for a ticketofleave  in it he speaks of himself as being tormented by ideas struggling for outward form and realisation barred up from increase of knowledge and deprived of the exercise of profitable or even of decorous speech  his request however was refused and the associate of coleridge consoled himself by making those marvellous paradis artificiels whose secret is only known to the eaters of opium  in 1852 he died of apoplexy his sole living companion being a cat for which he had evinced at extraordinary affection  his crimes seem to have had an important effect upon his art  they gave a strong personality to his style a quality that his early work certainly lacked  in a note to the life of dickens forster mentions that in 1847 lady blessington received from her brother major power who held a military appointment at hobart town an oil portrait of a young lady from his clever brush and it is said that he had contrived to put the expression of his own wickedness into the portrait of a nice kindhearted girl  m zola in one of his novels tells us of a young man who having committed a murder takes to art and paints greenish impressionist portraits of perfectly respectable people all of which bear a curious resemblance to his victim  the development of mr wainewrights style seems to me far more subtle and suggestive  one can fancy an intense personality being created out of sin  this strange and fascinating figure that for a few years dazzled literary london and made so brilliant a debut in life and letters is undoubtedly a most interesting study  mr w carew hazlitt his latest biographer to whom i am indebted for many of the facts contained in this memoir and whose little book is indeed quite invaluable in its way is of opinion that his love of art and nature was a mere pretence and assumption and others have denied to him all literary power  this seems to me a shallow or at least a mistaken view  the fact of a man being a poisoner is nothing against his prose  the domestic virtues are not the true basis of art though they may serve as an excellent advertisement for secondrate artists  it is possible that de quincey exaggerated his critical powers and i cannot help saying again that there is much in his published works that is too familiar too common too journalistic in the bad sense of that bad word  here and there he is distinctly vulgar in expression and he is always lacking in the selfrestraint of the true artist  but for some of his faults we must blame the time in which he lived and after all prose that charles lamb thought capital has no small historic interest that he had a sincere love of art and nature seems to me quite certain  there is no essential incongruity between crime and culture  we cannot rewrite the whole of history for the purpose of gratifying our moral sense of what should be  of course he is far too close to our own time for us to be able to form any purely artistic judgment about him  it is impossible not to feel a strong prejudice against a man who might have poisoned lord tennyson or mr gladstone or the master of balliol  but had the man worn a costume and spoken a language different from our own had he lived in imperial rome or at the time of the italian renaissance or in spain in the seventeenth century or in any land or any century but this century and this land we would be quite able to arrive at a perfectly unprejudiced estimate of his position and value  i know that there are many historians or at least writers on historical subjects who still think it necessary to apply moral judgments to history and who distribute their praise or blame with the solemn complacency of a successful schoolmaster this however is a foolish habit and merely shows that the moral instinct can be brought to such a pitch of perfection that it will make its appearance wherever it is not required  nobody with the true historical sense ever dreams of blaming nero or scolding tiberius or censuring caesar borgia  these personages have become like the puppets of a play  they may fill us with terror or horror or wonder but they do not harm us  they are not in immediate relation to us  we have nothing to fear from them  they have passed into the sphere of art and science and neither art nor science knows anything of moral approval or disapproval  and so it may be some day with charles lambs friend  at present i feel that he is just a little too modern to be treated in that fine spirit of disinterested curiosity to which we owe so many charming studies of the great criminals of the italian renaissance from the pens of mr john addington symonds miss a mary f robinson miss vernon lee and other distinguished writers  however art has not forgotten him  he is the hero of dickenss hunted down the varney of bulwers lucretia and it is gratifying to note that fiction has paid some homage to one who was so powerful with pen pencil and poison  to be suggestive for fiction is to be of more importance than a fact    the critic as artist  with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing    a dialogue  part i  persons  gilbert and ernest  scene  the library of a house in piccadilly overlooking the green park  gilbert at the piano  my dear ernest what are you laughing at  ernest looking up  at a capital story that i have just come across in this volume of reminiscences that i have found on your table  gilbert  what is the book  ah i see  i have not read it yet is it good  ernest  well while you have been playing i have been turning over the pages with some amusement though as a rule i dislike modern memoirs  they are generally written by people who have either entirely lost their memories or have never done anything worth remembering which however is no doubt the true explanation of their popularity as the english public always feels perfectly at its ease when a mediocrity is talking to it  gilbert  yes  the public is wonderfully tolerant  it forgives everything except genius  but i must confess that i like all memoirs  i like them for their form just as much as for their matter  in literature mere egotism is delightful  it is what fascinates us in the letters of personalities so different as cicero and balzac flaubert and berlioz byron and madame de sevigne  whenever we come across it and strangely enough it is rather rare we cannot but welcome it and do not easily forget it humanity will always love rousseau for having confessed his sins not to a priest but to the world and the couchant nymphs that cellini wrought in bronze for the castle of king francis the green and gold perseus even that in the open loggia at florence shows the moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone have not given it more pleasure than has that autobiography in which the supreme scoundrel of the renaissance relates the story of his splendour and his shame  the opinions the character the achievements of the man matter very little  he may be a sceptic like the gentle sieur de montaigne or a saint like the bitter son of monica but when he tells us his own secrets he can always charm our ears to listening and our lips to silence  the mode of thought that cardinal newman representedif that can be called a mode of thought which seeks to solve intellectual problems by a denial of the supremacy of the intellectmay not cannot i think survive but the world will never weary of watching that troubled soul in its progress from darkness to darkness  the lonely church at littlemore where the breath of the morning is damp and worshippers are few will always be dear to it and whenever men see the yellow snapdragon blossoming on the wall of trinity they will think of that gracious undergraduate who saw in the flowers sure recurrence a prophecy that he would abide for ever with the benign mother of his daysa prophecy that faith in her wisdom or her folly suffered not to be fulfilled  yes autobiography is irresistible  poor silly conceited mr secretary pepys has chattered his way into the circle of the immortals and conscious that indiscretion is the better part of valour bustles about among them in that shaggy purple gown with gold buttons and looped lace which he is so fond of describing to us perfectly at his ease and prattling to his own and our infinite pleasure of the indian blue petticoat that he bought for his wife of the good hogs hars let and the pleasant french fricassee of veal that he loved to eat of his game of bowls with will joyce and his gadding after beauties and his reciting of hamlet on a sunday and his playing of the viol on week days and other wicked or trivial things  even in actual life egotism is not without its attractions  when people talk to us about others they are usually dull  when they talk to us about themselves they are nearly always interesting and if one could shut them up when they become wearisome as easily as one can shut up a book of which one has grown wearied they would be perfect absolutely  ernest  there is much virtue in that if as touchstone would say but do you seriously propose that every man should become his own boswell  what would become of our industrious compilers of lives and recollections in that case  gilbert  what has become of them  they are the pest of the age nothing more and nothing less  every great man nowadays has his disciples and it is always judas who writes the biography  ernest  my dear fellow  gilbert  i am afraid it is true  formerly we used to canonise our heroes  the modern method is to vulgarise them  cheap editions of great books may be delightful but cheap editions of great men are absolutely detestable  ernest  may i ask gilbert to whom you allude  gilbert  oh to all our secondrate litterateurs  we are overrun by a set of people who when poet or painter passes away arrive at the house along with the undertaker and forget that their one duty is to behave as mutes  but we wont talk about them  they are the mere bodysnatchers of literature  the dust is given to one and the ashes to another and the soul is out of their reach  and now let me play chopin to you or dvorak  shall i play you a fantasy by dvorak  he writes passionate curiouslycoloured things  ernest  no i dont want music just at present  it is far too indefinite  besides i took the baroness bernstein down to dinner last night and though absolutely charming in every other respect she insisted on discussing music as if it were actually written in the german language  now whatever music sounds like i am glad to say that it does not sound in the smallest degree like german there are forms of patriotism that are really quite degrading  no gilbert dont play any more  turn round and talk to me  talk to me till the whitehorned day comes into the room  there is something in your voice that is wonderful  gilbert rising from the piano  i am not in a mood for talking tonight  i really am not  how horrid of you to smile  where are the cigarettes  thanks  how exquisite these single daffodils are they seem to be made of amber and cool ivory  they are like greek things of the best period  what was the story in the confessions of the remorseful academician that made you laugh  tell it to me after playing chopin i feel as if i had been weeping over sins that i had never committed and mourning over tragedies that were not my own  music always seems to me to produce that effect  it creates for one a past of which one has been ignorant and fills one with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden from ones tears i can fancy a man who had led a perfectly commonplace life hearing by chance some curious piece of music and suddenly discovering that his soul without his being conscious of it had passed through terrible experiences and known fearful joys or wild romantic loves or great renunciations  and so tell me this story ernest  i want to be amused  ernest  oh  i dont know that it is of any importance  but i thought it a really admirable illustration of the true value of ordinary artcriticism  it seems that a lady once gravely asked the remorseful academician as you call him if his celebrated picture of a springday at whiteleys or waiting for the last omnibus or some subject of that kind was all painted by hand  gilbert  and was it  ernest  you are quite incorrigible  but seriously speaking what is the use of artcriticism  why cannot the artist be left alone to create a new world if he wishes it or if not to shadow forth the world which we already know and of which i fancy we would each one of us be wearied if art with her fine spirit of choice and delicate instinct of selection did not as it were purify it for us and give to it a momentary perfection  it seems to me that the imagination spreads or should spread a solitude around it and works best in silence and in isolation  why should the artist be troubled by the shrill clamour of criticism  why should those who cannot create take upon themselves to estimate the value of creative work  what can they know about it  if a mans work is easy to understand an explanation is unnecessary     gilbert  and if his work is incomprehensible an explanation is wicked  ernest  i did not say that  gilbert  ah but you should have  nowadays we have so few mysteries left to us that we cannot afford to part with one of them  the members of the browning society like the theologians of the broad church party or the authors of mr walter scotts great writers series seem to me to spend their time in trying to explain their divinity away  where one had hoped that browning was a mystic they have sought to show that he was simply inarticulate where one had fancied that he had something to conceal they have proved that he had but little to reveal  but i speak merely of his incoherent work  taken as a whole the man was great  he did not belong to the olympians and had all the incompleteness of the titan  he did not survey and it was but rarely that he could sing  his work is marred by struggle violence and effort and he passed not from emotion to form but from thought to chaos  still he was great  he has been called a thinker and was certainly a man who was always thinking and always thinking aloud but it was not thought that fascinated him but rather the processes by which thought moves  it was the machine he loved not what the machine makes  the method by which the fool arrives at his folly was as dear to him as the ultimate wisdom of the wise  so much indeed did the subtle mechanism of mind fascinate him that he despised language or looked upon it as an incomplete instrument of expression  rhyme that exquisite echo which in the muses hollow hill creates and answers its own voice rhyme which in the hands of the real artist becomes not merely a material element of metrical beauty but a spiritual element of thought and passion also waking a new mood it may be or stirring a fresh train of ideas or opening by mere sweetness and suggestion of sound some golden door at which the imagination itself had knocked in vain rhyme which can turn mans utterance to the speech of gods rhyme the one chord we have added to the greek lyre became in robert brownings hands a grotesque misshapen thing which at times made him masquerade in poetry as a low comedian and ride pegasus too often with his tongue in his cheek  there are moments when he wounds us by monstrous music  nay if he can only get his music by breaking the strings of his lute he breaks them and they snap in discord and no athenian tettix making melody from tremulous wings lights on the ivory horn to make the movement perfect or the interval less harsh  yet he was great  and though he turned language into ignoble clay he made from it men and women that live  he is the most shakespearian creature since shakespeare  if shakespeare could sing with myriad lips browning could stammer through a thousand mouths  even now as i am speaking and speaking not against him but for him there glides through the room the pageant of his persons  there creeps fra lippo lippi with his cheeks still burning from some girls hot kiss  there stands dread saul with the lordly malesapphires gleaming in his turban mildred tresham is there and the spanish monk yellow with hatred and blougram and ben ezra and the bishop of st praxeds  the spawn of setebos gibbers in the corner and sebald hearing pippa pass by looks on ottimas haggard face and loathes her and his own sin and himself  pale as the white satin of his doublet the melancholy king watches with dreamy treacherous eyes too loyal strafford pass forth to his doom and andrea shudders as he hears the cousins whistle in the garden and bids his perfect wife go down  yes browning was great  and as what will he be remembered as a poet  ah not as a poet  he will be remembered as a writer of fiction as the most supreme writer of fiction it may be that we have ever had  his sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled and if he could not answer his own problems he could at least put problems forth and what more should an artist do  considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made hamlet  had he been articulate he might have sat beside him  the only man who can touch the hem of his garment is george meredith  meredith is a prose browning and so is browning he used poetry as a medium for writing in prose  ernest  there is something in what you say but there is not everything in what you say  in many points you are unjust  gilbert  it is difficult not to be unjust to what one loves  but let us return to the particular point at issue  what was it that you said  ernest  simply this  that in the best days of art there were no artcritics  gilbert  i seem to have heard that observation before ernest  it has all the vitality of error and all the tediousness of an old friend  ernest  it is true  yes  there is no use your tossing your head in that petulant manner  it is quite true  in the best days of art there were no artcritics  the sculptor hewed from the marble block the great whitelimbed hermes that slept within it  the waxers and gilders of images gave tone and texture to the statue and the world when it saw it worshipped and was dumb  he poured the glowing bronze into the mould of sand and the river of red metal cooled into noble curves and took the impress of the body of a god  with enamel or polished jewels he gave sight to the sightless eyes  the hyacinthlike curls grew crisp beneath his graver  and when in some dim frescoed fane or pillared sunlit portico the child of leto stood upon his pedestal those who passed by greek text which cannot be reproduced became conscious of a new influence that had come across their lives and dreamily or with a sense of strange and quickening joy went to their homes or daily labour or wandered it may be through the city gates to that nymphhaunted meadow where young phaedrus bathed his feet and lying there on the soft grass beneath the tall windwhispering planes and flowering agnus castus began to think of the wonder of beauty and grew silent with unaccustomed awe  in those days the artist was free  from the river valley he took the fine clay in his fingers and with a little tool of wood or bone fashioned it into forms so exquisite that the people gave them to the dead as their playthings and we find them still in the dusty tombs on the yellow hillside by tanagra with the faint gold and the fading crimson still lingering about hair and lips and raiment on a wall of fresh plaster stained with bright sandyx or mixed with milk and saffron he pictured one who trod with tired feet the purple whitestarred fields of asphodel one in whose eyelids lay the whole of the trojan war polyxena the daughter of priam or figured odysseus the wise and cunning bound by tight cords to the maststep that he might listen without hurt to the singing of the sirens or wandering by the clear river of acheron where the ghosts of fishes flitted over the pebbly bed or showed the persian in trews and mitre flying before the greek at marathon or the galleys clashing their beaks of brass in the little salaminian bay he drew with silverpoint and charcoal upon parchment and prepared cedar  upon ivory and rosecoloured terracotta he painted with wax making the wax fluid with juice of olives and with heated irons making it firm  panel and marble and linen canvas became wonderful as his brush swept across them and life seeing her own image was still and dared not speak  all life indeed was his from the merchants seated in the marketplace to the cloaked shepherd lying on the hill from the nymph hidden in the laurels and the faun that pipes at noon to the king whom in long green curtained litter slaves bore upon oilbright shoulders and fanned with peacock fans  men and women with pleasure or sorrow in their faces passed before him  he watched them and their secret became his  through form and colour he recreated a world  all subtle arts belonged to him also  he held the gem against the revolving disk and the amethyst became the purple couch for adonis and across the veined sardonyx sped artemis with her hounds  he beat out the gold into roses and strung them together for necklace or armlet  he beat out the gold into wreaths for the conquerors helmet or into palmates for the tyrian robe or into masks for the royal dead  on the back of the silver mirror he graved thetis borne by her nereids or lovesick phaedra with her nurse or persephone weary of memory putting poppies in her hair the potter sat in his shed and flowerlike from the silent wheel the vase rose up beneath his hands  he decorated the base and stem and ears with pattern of dainty oliveleaf or foliated acanthus or curved and crested wave  then in black or red he painted lads wrestling or in the race  knights in full armour with strange heraldic shields and curious visors leaning from shellshaped chariot over rearing steeds  the gods seated at the feast or working their miracles  the heroes in their victory or in their pain  sometimes he would etch in thin vermilion lines upon a ground of white the languid bridegroom and his bride with eros hovering round theman eros like one of donatellos angels a little laughing thing with gilded or with azure wings  on the curved side he would write the name of his friend  greek text which cannot be reproduced or greek text which cannot be reproduced tells us the story of his days  again on the rim of the wide flat cup he would draw the stag browsing or the lion at rest as his fancy willed it  from the tiny perfumebottle laughed aphrodite at her toilet and with barelimbed maenads in his train dionysus danced round the winejar on naked muststained feet while satyrlike the old silenus sprawled upon the bloated skins or shook that magic spear which was tipped with a fretted fircone and wreathed with dark ivy  and no one came to trouble the artist at his work  no irresponsible chatter disturbed him he was not worried by opinions  by the ilyssus says arnold somewhere there was no higginbotham  by the ilyssus my dear gilbert there were no silly art congresses bringing provincialism to the provinces and teaching the mediocrity how to mouth  by the ilyssus there were no tedious magazines about art in which the industrious prattle of what they do not understand  on the reed grown banks of that little stream strutted no ridiculous journalism monopolising the seat of judgment when it should be apologising in the dock  the greeks had no artcritics  gilbert  ernest you are quite delightful but your views are terribly unsound  i am afraid that you have been listening to the conversation of some one older than yourself  that is always a dangerous thing to do and if you allow it to degenerate into a habit you will find it absolutely fatal to any intellectual development  as for modern journalism it is not my business to defend it  it justifies its own existence by the great darwinian principle of the survival of the vulgarest  i have merely to do with literature  ernest  but what is the difference between literature and journalism  gilbert  oh journalism is unreadable and literature is not read that is all  but with regard to your statement that the greeks had no artcritics i assure you that is quite absurd  it would be more just to say that the greeks were a nation of artcritics  ernest  really  gilbert  yes a nation of artcritics  but i dont wish to destroy the delightfully unreal picture that you have drawn of the relation of the hellenic artist to the intellectual spirit of his age  to give an accurate description of what has never occurred is not merely the proper occupation of the historian but the inalienable privilege of any man of parts and culture  still less do i desire to talk learnedly  learned conversation is either the affectation of the ignorant or the profession of the mentally unemployed  and as for what is called improving conversation that is merely the foolish method by which the still more foolish philanthropist feebly tries to disarm the just rancour of the criminal classes  no  let me play to you some mad scarlet thing by dvorak  the pallid figures on the tapestry are smiling at us and the heavy eyelids of my bronze narcissus are folded in sleep dont let us discuss anything solemnly  i am but too conscious of the fact that we are born in an age when only the dull are treated seriously and i live in terror of not being misunderstood  dont degrade me into the position of giving you useful information education is an admirable thing but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught through the parted curtains of the window i see the moon like a clipped piece of silver  like gilded bees the stars cluster round her  the sky is a hard hollow sapphire  let us go out into the night  thought is wonderful but adventure is more wonderful still  who knows but we may meet prince florizel of bohemia and hear the fair cuban tell us that she is not what she seems  ernest  you are horribly wilful  i insist on your discussing this matter with me  you have said that the greeks were a nation of artcritics  what artcriticism have they left us  gilbert  my dear ernest even if not a single fragment of art criticism had come down to us from hellenic or hellenistic days it would be none the less true that the greeks were a nation of art critics and that they invented the criticism of art just as they invented the criticism of everything else  for after all what is our primary debt to the greeks  simply the critical spirit  and this spirit which they exercised on questions of religion and science of ethics and metaphysics of politics and education they exercised on questions of art also and indeed of the two supreme and highest arts they have left us the most flawless system of criticism that the world has ever seen  ernest  but what are the two supreme and highest arts  gilbert  life and literature life and the perfect expression of life  the principles of the former as laid down by the greeks we may not realise in an age so marred by false ideals as our own the principles of the latter as they laid them down are in many cases so subtle that we can hardly understand them  recognising that the most perfect art is that which most fully mirrors man in all his infinite variety they elaborated the criticism of language considered in the light of the mere material of that art to a point to which we with our accentual system of reasonable or emotional emphasis can barely if at all attain studying for instance the metrical movements of a prose as scientifically as a modern musician studies harmony and counterpoint and i need hardly say with much keener aesthetic instinct  in this they were right as they were right in all things  since the introduction of printing and the fatal development of the habit of reading amongst the middle and lower classes of this country there has been a tendency in literature to appeal more and more to the eye and less and less to the ear which is really the sense which from the standpoint of pure art it should seek to please and by whose canons of pleasure it should abide always  even the work of mr pater who is on the whole the most perfect master of english prose now creating amongst us is often far more like a piece of mosaic than a passage in music and seems here and there to lack the true rhythmical life of words and the fine freedom and richness of effect that such rhythmical life produces  we in fact have made writing a definite mode of composition and have treated it as a form of elaborate design  the greeks upon the other hand regarded writing simply as a method of chronicling  their test was always the spoken word in its musical and metrical relations  the voice was the medium and the ear the critic  i have sometimes thought that the story of homers blindness might be really an artistic myth created in critical days and serving to remind us not merely that the great poet is always a seer seeing less with the eyes of the body than he does with the eyes of the soul but that he is a true singer also building his song out of music repeating each line over and over again to himself till he has caught the secret of its melody chaunting in darkness the words that are winged with light  certainly whether this be so or not it was to his blindness as an occasion if not as a cause that englands great poet owed much of the majestic movement and sonorous splendour of his later verse  when milton could no longer write he began to sing  who would match the measures of comus with the measures of samson agonistes or of paradise lost or regained when milton became blind he composed as every one should compose with the voice purely and so the pipe or reed of earlier days became that mighty manystopped organ whose rich reverberant music has all the stateliness of homeric verse if it seeks not to have its swiftness and is the one imperishable inheritance of english literature sweeping through all the ages because above them and abiding with us ever being immortal in its form  yes  writing has done much harm to writers  we must return to the voice  that must be our test and perhaps then we shall be able to appreciate some of the subtleties of greek artcriticism  as it now is we cannot do so  sometimes when i have written a piece of prose that i have been modest enough to consider absolutely free from fault a dreadful thought comes over me that i may have been guilty of the immoral effeminacy of using trochaic and tribrachic movements a crime for which a learned critic of the augustan age censures with most just severity the brilliant if somewhat paradoxical hegesias  i grow cold when i think of it and wonder to myself if the admirable ethical effect of the prose of that charming writer who once in a spirit of reckless generosity towards the uncultivated portion of our community proclaimed the monstrous doctrine that conduct is threefourths of life will not some day be entirely annihilated by the discovery that the paeons have been wrongly placed  ernest  ah now you are flippant  gilbert  who would not be flippant when he is gravely told that the greeks had no artcritics  i can understand it being said that the constructive genius of the greeks lost itself in criticism but not that the race to whom we owe the critical spirit did not criticise  you will not ask me to give you a survey of greek art criticism from plato to plotinus  the night is too lovely for that and the moon if she heard us would put more ashes on her face than are there already  but think merely of one perfect little work of aesthetic criticism aristotles treatise on poetry it is not perfect in form for it is badly written consisting perhaps of notes dotted down for an art lecture or of isolated fragments destined for some larger book but in temper and treatment it is perfect absolutely  the ethical effect of art its importance to culture and its place in the formation of character had been done once for all by plato but here we have art treated not from the moral but from the purely aesthetic point of view  plato had of course dealt with many definitely artistic subjects such as the importance of unity in a work of art the necessity for tone and harmony the aesthetic value of appearances the relation of the visible arts to the external world and the relation of fiction to fact  he first perhaps stirred in the soul of man that desire that we have not yet satisfied the desire to know the connection between beauty and truth and the place of beauty in the moral and intellectual order of the kosmos  the problems of idealism and realism as he sets them forth may seem to many to be somewhat barren of result in the metaphysical sphere of abstract being in which he places them but transfer them to the sphere of art and you will find that they are still vital and full of meaning  it may be that it is as a critic of beauty that plato is destined to live and that by altering the name of the sphere of his speculation we shall find a new philosophy  but aristotle like goethe deals with art primarily in its concrete manifestations taking tragedy for instance and investigating the material it uses which is language its subject matter which is life the method by which it works which is action the conditions under which it reveals itself which are those of theatric presentation its logical structure which is plot and its final aesthetic appeal which is to the sense of beauty realised through the passions of pity and awe  that purification and spiritualising of the nature which he calls greek text which cannot be reproduced is as goethe saw essentially aesthetic and is not moral as lessing fancied  concerning himself primarily with the impression that the work of art produces aristotle sets himself to analyse that impression to investigate its source to see how it is engendered  as a physiologist and psychologist he knows that the health of a function resides in energy  to have a capacity for a passion and not to realise it is to make oneself incomplete and limited  the mimic spectacle of life that tragedy affords cleanses the bosom of much perilous stuff and by presenting high and worthy objects for the exercise of the emotions purifies and spiritualises the man nay not merely does it spiritualise him but it initiates him also into noble feelings of which he might else have known nothing the word greek text which cannot be reproduced having it has sometimes seemed to me a definite allusion to the rite of initiation if indeed that be not as i am occasionally tempted to fancy its true and only meaning here  this is of course a mere outline of the book  but you see what a perfect piece of aesthetic criticism it is  who indeed but a greek could have analysed art so well  after reading it one does not wonder any longer that alexandria devoted itself so largely to artcriticism and that we find the artistic temperaments of the day investigating every question of style and manner discussing the great academic schools of painting for instance such as the school of sicyon that sought to preserve the dignified traditions of the antique mode or the realistic and impressionist schools that aimed at reproducing actual life or the elements of ideality in portraiture or the artistic value of the epic form in an age so modern as theirs or the proper subjectmatter for the artist  indeed i fear that the inartistic temperaments of the day busied themselves also in matters of literature and art for the accusations of plagiarism were endless and such accusations proceed either from the thin colourless lips of impotence or from the grotesque mouths of those who possessing nothing of their own fancy that they can gain a reputation for wealth by crying out that they have been robbed and i assure you my dear ernest that the greeks chattered about painters quite as much as people do nowadays and had their private views and shilling exhibitions and arts and crafts guilds and preraphaelite movements and movements towards realism and lectured about art and wrote essays on art and produced their arthistorians and their archaeologists and all the rest of it why even the theatrical managers of travelling companies brought their dramatic critics with them when they went on tour and paid them very handsome salaries for writing laudatory notices whatever in fact is modern in our life we owe to the greeks whatever is an anachronism is due to mediaevalism  it is the greeks who have given us the whole system of artcriticism and how fine their critical instinct was may be seen from the fact that the material they criticised with most care was as i have already said language  for the material that painter or sculptor uses is meagre in comparison with that of words  words have not merely music as sweet as that of viol and lute colour as rich and vivid as any that makes lovely for us the canvas of the venetian or the spaniard and plastic form no less sure and certain than that which reveals itself in marble or in bronze but thought and passion and spirituality are theirs also are theirs indeed alone  if the greeks had criticised nothing but language they would still have been the great artcritics of the world  to know the principles of the highest art is to know the principles of all the arts  but i see that the moon is hiding behind a sulphurcoloured cloud out of a tawny mane of drift she gleams like a lions eye  she is afraid that i will talk to you of lucian and longinus of quinctilian and dionysius of pliny and fronto and pausanias of all those who in the antique world wrote or lectured upon art matters  she need not be afraid  i am tired of my expedition into the dim dull abyss of facts  there is nothing left for me now but the divine greek text which cannot be reproduced of another cigarette  cigarettes have at least the charm of leaving one unsatisfied  ernest  try one of mine  they are rather good  i get them direct from cairo  the only use of our attaches is that they supply their friends with excellent tobacco  and as the moon has hidden herself let us talk a little longer  i am quite ready to admit that i was wrong in what i said about the greeks  they were as you have pointed out a nation of artcritics  i acknowledge it and i feel a little sorry for them  for the creative faculty is higher than the critical  there is really no comparison between them  gilbert  the antithesis between them is entirely arbitrary without the critical faculty there is no artistic creation at all worthy of the name  you spoke a little while ago of that fine spirit of choice and delicate instinct of selection by which the artist realises life for us and gives to it a momentary perfection  well that spirit of choice that subtle tact of omission is really the critical faculty in one of its most characteristic moods and no one who does not possess this critical faculty can create anything at all in art  arnolds definition of literature as a criticism of life was not very felicitous in form but it showed how keenly he recognised the importance of the critical element in all creative work  ernest  i should have said that great artists work unconsciously that they were wiser than they knew as i think emerson remarks somewhere  gilbert  it is really not so ernest  all fine imaginative work is selfconscious and deliberate  no poet sings because he must sing  at least no great poet does  a great poet sings because he chooses to sing  it is so now and it has always been so  we are sometimes apt to think that the voices that sounded at the dawn of poetry were simpler fresher and more natural than ours and that the world which the early poets looked at and through which they walked had a kind of poetical quality of its own and almost without changing could pass into song  the snow lies thick now upon olympus and its steep scarped sides are bleak and barren but once we fancy the white feet of the muses brushed the dew from the anemones in the morning and at evening came apollo to sing to the shepherds in the vale  but in this we are merely lending to other ages what we desire or think we desire for our own  our historical sense is at fault  every century that produces poetry is so far an artificial century and the work that seems to us to be the most natural and simple product of its time is always the result of the most selfconscious effort  believe me ernest there is no fine art without selfconsciousness and self consciousness and the critical spirit are one  ernest  i see what you mean and there is much in it  but surely you would admit that the great poems of the early world the primitive anonymous collective poems were the result of the imagination of races rather than of the imagination of individuals  gilbert  not when they became poetry  not when they received a beautiful form  for there is no art where there is no style and no style where there is no unity and unity is of the individual no doubt homer had old ballads and stories to deal with as shakespeare had chronicles and plays and novels from which to work but they were merely his rough material  he took them and shaped them into song  they become his because he made them lovely they were built out of music   and so not built at all and therefore built for ever   the longer one studies life and literature the more strongly one feels that behind everything that is wonderful stands the individual and that it is not the moment that makes the man but the man who creates the age  indeed i am inclined to think that each myth and legend that seems to us to spring out of the wonder or terror or fancy of tribe and nation was in its origin the invention of one single mind  the curiously limited number of the myths seems to me to point to this conclusion  but we must not go off into questions of comparative mythology  we must keep to criticism  and what i want to point out is this  an age that has no criticism is either an age in which art is immobile hieratic and confined to the reproduction of formal types or an age that possesses no art at all  there have been critical ages that have not been creative in the ordinary sense of the word ages in which the spirit of man has sought to set in order the treasures of his treasurehouse to separate the gold from the silver and the silver from the lead to count over the jewels and to give names to the pearls  but there has never been a creative age that has not been critical also  for it is the critical faculty that invents fresh forms  the tendency of creation is to repeat itself it is to the critical instinct that we owe each new school that springs up each new mould that art finds ready to its hand  there is really not a single form that art now uses that does not come to us from the critical spirit of alexandria where these forms were either stereotyped or invented or made perfect  i say alexandria not merely because it was there that the greek spirit became most selfconscious and indeed ultimately expired in scepticism and theology but because it was to that city and not to athens that rome turned for her models and it was through the survival such as it was of the latin language that culture lived at all  when at the renaissance greek literature dawned upon europe the soil had been in some measure prepared for it  but to get rid of the details of history which are always wearisome and usually inaccurate let us say generally that the forms of art have been due to the greek critical spirit  to it we owe the epic the lyric the entire drama in every one of its developments including burlesque the idyll the romantic novel the novel of adventure the essay the dialogue the oration the lecture for which perhaps we should not forgive them and the epigram in all the wide meaning of that word  in fact we owe it everything except the sonnet to which however some curious parallels of thought movement may be traced in the anthology american journalism to which no parallel can be found anywhere and the ballad in sham scotch dialect which one of our most industrious writers has recently proposed should be made the basis for a final and unanimous effort on the part of our secondrate poets to make themselves really romantic  each new school as it appears cries out against criticism but it is to the critical faculty in man that it owes its origin  the mere creative instinct does not innovate but reproduces  ernest  you have been talking of criticism as an essential part of the creative spirit and i now fully accept your theory  but what of criticism outside creation  i have a foolish habit of reading periodicals and it seems to me that most modern criticism is perfectly valueless  gilbert  so is most modern creative work also  mediocrity weighing mediocrity in the balance and incompetence applauding its brotherthat is the spectacle which the artistic activity of england affords us from time to time  and yet i feel i am a little unfair in this matter  as a rule the criticsi speak of course of the higher class of those in fact who write for the sixpenny papersare far more cultured than the people whose work they are called upon to review  this is indeed only what one would expect for criticism demands infinitely more cultivation than creation does  ernest  really  gilbert  certainly  anybody can write a threevolumed novel  it merely requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature the difficulty that i should fancy the reviewer feels is the difficulty of sustaining any standard  where there is no style a standard must be impossible  the poor reviewers are apparently reduced to be the reporters of the policecourt of literature the chroniclers of the doings of the habitual criminals of art  it is sometimes said of them that they do not read all through the works they are called upon to criticise  they do not  or at least they should not  if they did so they would become confirmed misanthropes or if i may borrow a phrase from one of the pretty newnham graduates confirmed womanthropes for the rest of their lives  nor is it necessary  to know the vintage and quality of a wine one need not drink the whole cask  it must be perfectly easy in half an hour to say whether a book is worth anything or worth nothing  ten minutes are really sufficient if one has the instinct for form  who wants to wade through a dull volume  one tastes it and that is quite enoughmore than enough i should imagine  i am aware that there are many honest workers in painting as well as in literature who object to criticism entirely  they are quite right  their work stands in no intellectual relation to their age  it brings us no new element of pleasure  it suggests no fresh departure of thought or passion or beauty  it should not be spoken of  it should be left to the oblivion that it deserves  ernest  but my dear fellowexcuse me for interrupting youyou seem to me to be allowing your passion for criticism to lead you a great deal too far  for after all even you must admit that it is much more difficult to do a thing than to talk about it  gilbert  more difficult to do a thing than to talk about it  not at all  that is a gross popular error  it is very much more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it  in the sphere of actual life that is of course obvious  anybody can make history only a great man can write it  there is no mode of action no form of emotion that we do not share with the lower animals  it is only by language that we rise above them or above each otherby language which is the parent and not the child of thought action indeed is always easy and when presented to us in its most aggravated because most continuous form which i take to be that of real industry becomes simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatsoever to do  no ernest dont talk about action  it is a blind thing dependent on external influences and moved by an impulse of whose nature it is unconscious  it is a thing incomplete in its essence because limited by accident and ignorant of its direction being always at variance with its aim its basis is the lack of imagination  it is the last resource of those who know not how to dream  ernest  gilbert you treat the world as if it were a crystal ball you hold it in your hand and reverse it to please a wilful fancy you do nothing but rewrite history  gilbert  the one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it  that is not the least of the tasks in store for the critical spirit when we have fully discovered the scientific laws that govern life we shall realise that the one person who has more illusions than the dreamer is the man of action  he indeed knows neither the origin of his deeds nor their results  from the field in which he thought that he had sown thorns we have gathered our vintage and the figtree that he planted for our pleasure is as barren as the thistle and more bitter  it is because humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find its way  ernest  you think then that in the sphere of action a conscious aim is a delusion  gilbert  it is worse than a delusion  if we lived long enough to see the results of our actions it may be that those who call themselves good would be sickened with a dull remorse and those whom the world calls evil stirred by a noble joy  each little thing that we do passes into the great machine of life which may grind our virtues to powder and make them worthless or transform our sins into elements of a new civilisation more marvellous and more splendid than any that has gone before  but men are the slaves of words  they rage against materialism as they call it forgetting that there has been no material improvement that has not spiritualised the world and that there have been few if any spiritual awakenings that have not wasted the worlds faculties in barren hopes and fruitless aspirations and empty or trammelling creeds  what is termed sin is an essential element of progress without it the world would stagnate or grow old or become colourless  by its curiosity sin increases the experience of the race  through its intensified assertion of individualism it saves us from monotony of type  in its rejection of the current notions about morality it is one with the higher ethics  and as for the virtues  what are the virtues  nature m renan tells us cares little about chastity and it may be that it is to the shame of the magdalen and not to their own purity that the lucretias of modern life owe their freedom from stain  charity as even those of whose religion it makes a formal part have been compelled to acknowledge creates a multitude of evils  the mere existence of conscience that faculty of which people prate so much nowadays and are so ignorantly proud is a sign of our imperfect development  it must be merged in instinct before we become fine  selfdenial is simply a method by which man arrests his progress and selfsacrifice a survival of the mutilation of the savage part of that old worship of pain which is so terrible a factor in the history of the world and which even now makes its victims day by day and has its altars in the land  virtues  who knows what the virtues are  not you not i  not any one  it is well for our vanity that we slay the criminal for if we suffered him to live he might show us what we had gained by his crime  it is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom  he is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest  ernest  gilbert you sound too harsh a note  let us go back to the more gracious fields of literature  what was it you said that it was more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it  gilbert after a pause  yes  i believe i ventured upon that simple truth  surely you see now that i am right  when man acts he is a puppet  when he describes he is a poet  the whole secret lies in that  it was easy enough on the sandy plains by windy ilion to send the notched arrow from the painted bow or to hurl against the shield of hide and flamelike brass the long ashhandled spear  it was easy for the adulterous queen to spread the tyrian carpets for her lord and then as he lay couched in the marble bath to throw over his head the purple net and call to her smoothfaced lover to stab through the meshes at the heart that should have broken at aulis  for antigone even with death waiting for her as her bridegroom it was easy to pass through the tainted air at noon and climb the hill and strew with kindly earth the wretched naked corse that had no tomb  but what of those who wrote about these things  what of those who gave them reality and made them live for ever  are they not greater than the men and women they sing of  hector that sweet knight is dead and lucian tells us how in the dim underworld menippus saw the bleaching skull of helen and marvelled that it was for so grim a favour that all those horned ships were launched those beautiful mailed men laid low those towered cities brought to dust  yet every day the swanlike daughter of leda comes out on the battlements and looks down at the tide of war  the greybeards wonder at her loveliness and she stands by the side of the king  in his chamber of stained ivory lies her leman  he is polishing his dainty armour and combing the scarlet plume  with squire and page her husband passes from tent to tent  she can see his bright hair and hears or fancies that she hears that clear cold voice  in the courtyard below the son of priam is buckling on his brazen cuirass  the white arms of andromache are around his neck  he sets his helmet on the ground lest their babe should be frightened  behind the embroidered curtains of his pavilion sits achilles in perfumed raiment while in harness of gilt and silver the friend of his soul arrays himself to go forth to the fight  from a curiously carven chest that his mother thetis had brought to his shipside the lord of the myrmidons takes out that mystic chalice that the lip of man had never touched and cleanses it with brimstone and with fresh water cools it and having washed his hands fills with black wine its burnished hollow and spills the thick grapeblood upon the ground in honour of him whom at dodona barefooted prophets worshipped and prays to him and knows not that he prays in vain and that by the hands of two knights from troy panthous son euphorbus whose lovelocks were looped with gold and the priamid the lionhearted patroklus the comrade of comrades must meet his doom  phantoms are they  heroes of mist and mountain  shadows in a song  no  they are real  action  what is action  it dies at the moment of its energy  it is a base concession to fact  the world is made by the singer for the dreamer  ernest  while you talk it seems to me to be so  gilbert  it is so in truth  on the mouldering citadel of troy lies the lizard like a thing of green bronze  the owl has built her nest in the palace of priam  over the empty plain wander shepherd and goatherd with their flocks and where on the wine surfaced oily sea greek text which cannot be reproduced as homer calls it copperprowed and streaked with vermilion the great galleys of the danaoi came in their gleaming crescent the lonely tunnyfisher sits in his little boat and watches the bobbing corks of his net  yet every morning the doors of the city are thrown open and on foot or in horsedrawn chariot the warriors go forth to battle and mock their enemies from behind their iron masks  all day long the fight rages and when night comes the torches gleam by the tents and the cresset burns in the hall those who live in marble or on painted panel know of life but a single exquisite instant eternal indeed in its beauty but limited to one note of passion or one mood of calm  those whom the poet makes live have their myriad emotions of joy and terror of courage and despair of pleasure and of suffering  the seasons come and go in glad or saddening pageant and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them  they have their youth and their manhood they are children and they grow old  it is always dawn for st helena as veronese saw her at the window  through the still morning air the angels bring her the symbol of gods pain the cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from her brow  on that little hill by the city of florence where the lovers of giorgione are lying it is always the solstice of noon of noon made so languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slim naked girl dip into the marble tank the round bubble of clear glass and the long fingers of the luteplayer rest idly upon the chords  it is twilight always for the dancing nymphs whom corot set free among the silver poplars of france  in eternal twilight they move those frail diaphanous figures whose tremulous white feet seem not to touch the dewdrenched grass they tread on  but those who walk in epos drama or romance see through the labouring months the young moons wax and wane and watch the night from evening unto morning star and from sunrise unto sunsetting can note the shifting day with all its gold and shadow  for them as for us the flowers bloom and wither and the earth that green tressed goddess as coleridge calls her alters her raiment for their pleasure  the statue is concentrated to one moment of perfection  the image stained upon the canvas possesses no spiritual element of growth or change  if they know nothing of death it is because they know little of life for the secrets of life and death belong to those and those only whom the sequence of time affects and who possess not merely the present but the future and can rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame movement that problem of the visible arts can be truly realised by literature alone  it is literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in its unrest  ernest  yes i see now what you mean  but surely the higher you place the creative artist the lower must the critic rank  gilbert  why so  ernest  because the best that he can give us will be but an echo of rich music a dim shadow of clearoutlined form  it may indeed be that life is chaos as you tell me that it is that its martyrdoms are mean and its heroisms ignoble and that it is the function of literature to create from the rough material of actual existence a new world that will be more marvellous more enduring and more true than the world that common eyes look upon and through which common natures seek to realise their perfection  but surely if this new world has been made by the spirit and touch of a great artist it will be a thing so complete and perfect that there will be nothing left for the critic to do  i quite understand now and indeed admit most readily that it is far more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it  but it seems to me that this sound and sensible maxim which is really extremely soothing to ones feelings and should be adopted as its motto by every academy of literature all over the world applies only to the relations that exist between art and life and not to any relations that there may be between art and criticism  gilbert  but surely criticism is itself an art  and just as artistic creation implies the working of the critical faculty and indeed without it cannot be said to exist at all so criticism is really creative in the highest sense of the word  criticism is in fact both creative and independent  ernest  independent  gilbert  yes independent  criticism is no more to be judged by any low standard of imitation or resemblance than is the work of poet or sculptor  the critic occupies the same relation to the work of art that he criticises as the artist does to the visible world of form and colour or the unseen world of passion and of thought  he does not even require for the perfection of his art the finest materials  anything will serve his purpose  and just as out of the sordid and sentimental amours of the silly wife of a small country doctor in the squalid village of yonvillelabbaye near rouen gustave flaubert was able to create a classic and make a masterpiece of style so from subjects of little or of no importance such as the pictures in this years royal academy or in any years royal academy for that matter mr lewis morriss poems m ohnets novels or the plays of mr henry arthur jones the true critic can if it be his pleasure so to direct or waste his faculty of contemplation produce work that will be flawless in beauty and instinct with intellectual subtlety  why not  dulness is always an irresistible temptation for brilliancy and stupidity is the permanent bestia trionfans that calls wisdom from its cave to an artist so creative as the critic what does subjectmatter signify  no more and no less than it does to the novelist and the painter  like them he can find his motives everywhere  treatment is the test  there is nothing that has not in it suggestion or challenge  ernest  but is criticism really a creative art  gilbert  why should it not be  it works with materials and puts them into a form that is at once new and delightful  what more can one say of poetry  indeed i would call criticism a creation within a creation  for just as the great artists from homer and aeschylus down to shakespeare and keats did not go directly to life for their subjectmatter but sought for it in myth and legend and ancient tale so the critic deals with materials that others have as it were purified for him and to which imaginative form and colour have been already added  nay more i would say that the highest criticism being the purest form of personal impression is in its way more creative than creation as it has least reference to any standard external to itself and is in fact its own reason for existing and as the greeks would put it in itself and to itself an end  certainly it is never trammelled by any shackles of verisimilitude  no ignoble considerations of probability that cowardly concession to the tedious repetitions of domestic or public life affect it ever one may appeal from fiction unto fact  but from the soul there is no appeal  ernest  from the soul  gilbert  yes from the soul  that is what the highest criticism really is the record of ones own soul  it is more fascinating than history as it is concerned simply with oneself  it is more delightful than philosophy as its subject is concrete and not abstract real and not vague  it is the only civilised form of autobiography as it deals not with the events but with the thoughts of ones life not with lifes physical accidents of deed or circumstance but with the spiritual moods and imaginative passions of the mind  i am always amused by the silly vanity of those writers and artists of our day who seem to imagine that the primary function of the critic is to chatter about their second rate work  the best that one can say of most modern creative art is that it is just a little less vulgar than reality and so the critic with his fine sense of distinction and sure instinct of delicate refinement will prefer to look into the silver mirror or through the woven veil and will turn his eyes away from the chaos and clamour of actual existence though the mirror be tarnished and the veil be torn  his sole aim is to chronicle his own impressions  it is for him that pictures are painted books written and marble hewn into form  ernest  i seem to have heard another theory of criticism  gilbert  yes  it has been said by one whose gracious memory we all revere and the music of whose pipe once lured proserpina from her sicilian fields and made those white feet stir and not in vain the cumnor cowslips that the proper aim of criticism is to see the object as in itself it really is  but this is a very serious error and takes no cognisance of criticisms most perfect form which is in its essence purely subjective and seeks to reveal its own secret and not the secret of another  for the highest criticism deals with art not as expressive but as impressive purely  ernest  but is that really so  gilbert  of course it is  who cares whether mr ruskins views on turner are sound or not  what does it matter  that mighty and majestic prose of his so fervid and so fierycoloured in its noble eloquence so rich in its elaborate symphonic music so sure and certain at its best in subtle choice of word and epithet is at least as great a work of art as any of those wonderful sunsets that bleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in englands gallery greater indeed one is apt to think at times not merely because its equal beauty is more enduring but on account of the fuller variety of its appeal soul speaking to soul in those longcadenced lines not through form and colour alone though through these indeed completely and without loss but with intellectual and emotional utterance with lofty passion and with loftier thought with imaginative insight and with poetic aim greater i always think even as literature is the greater art  who again cares whether mr pater has put into the portrait of monna lisa something that lionardo never dreamed of  the painter may have been merely the slave of an archaic smile as some have fancied but whenever i pass into the cool galleries of the palace of the louvre and stand before that strange figure set in its marble chair in that cirque of fantastic rocks as in some faint light under sea i murmur to myself she is older than the rocks among which she sits like the vampire she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave and has been a diver in deep seas and keeps their fallen day about her  and trafficked for strange webs with eastern merchants and as leda was the mother of helen of troy and as st anne the mother of mary and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments and tinged the eyelids and the hands  and i say to my friend the presence that thus so strangely rose beside the waters is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years man had come to desire and he answers me hers is the head upon which all the ends of the world are come and the eyelids are a little weary  and so the picture becomes more wonderful to us than it really is and reveals to us a secret of which in truth it knows nothing and the music of the mystical prose is as sweet in our ears as was that fluteplayers music that lent to the lips of la gioconda those subtle and poisonous curves  do you ask me what lionardo would have said had any one told him of this picture that all the thoughts and experience of the world had etched and moulded therein that which they had of power to refine and make expressive the outward form the animalism of greece the lust of rome the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves the return of the pagan world the sins of the borgias  he would probably have answered that he had contemplated none of these things but had concerned himself simply with certain arrangements of lines and masses and with new and curious colour harmonies of blue and green  and it is for this very reason that the criticism which i have quoted is criticism of the highest kind it treats the work of art simply as a startingpoint for a new creation  it does not confine itselflet us at least suppose so for the momentto discovering the real intention of the artist and accepting that as final  and in this it is right for the meaning of any beautiful created thing is at least as much in the soul of him who looks at it as it was in his soul who wrought it  nay it is rather the beholder who lends to the beautiful thing its myriad meanings and makes it marvellous for us and sets it in some new relation to the age so that it becomes a vital portion of our lives and a symbol of what we pray for or perhaps of what having prayed for we fear that we may receive  the longer i study ernest the more clearly i see that the beauty of the visible arts is as the beauty of music impressive primarily and that it may be marred and indeed often is so by any excess of intellectual intention on the part of the artist  for when the work is finished it has as it were an independent life of its own and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips to say sometimes when i listen to the overture to tannhauser i seem indeed to see that comely knight treading delicately on the flower strewn grass and to hear the voice of venus calling to him from the caverned hill  but at other times it speaks to me of a thousand different things of myself it may be and my own life or of the lives of others whom one has loved and grown weary of loving or of the passions that man has known or of the passions that man has not known and so has sought for  tonight it may fill one with that os o o that amour de limpossible which falls like a madness on many who think they live securely and out of reach of harm so that they sicken suddenly with the poison of unlimited desire and in the infinite pursuit of what they may not obtain grow faint and swoon or stumble  tomorrow like the music of which aristotle and plato tell us the noble dorian music of the greek it may perform the office of a physician and give us an anodyne against pain and heal the spirit that is wounded and bring the soul into harmony with all right things  and what is true about music is true about all the arts  beauty has as many meanings as man has moods  beauty is the symbol of symbols beauty reveals everything because it expresses nothing  when it shows us itself it shows us the whole fierycoloured world  ernest  but is such work as you have talked about really criticism  gilbert  it is the highest criticism for it criticises not merely the individual work of art but beauty itself and fills with wonder a form which the artist may have left void or not understood or understood incompletely  ernest  the highest criticism then is more creative than creation and the primary aim of the critic is to see the object as in itself it really is not that is your theory i believe  gilbert  yes that is my theory  to the critic the work of art is simply a suggestion for a new work of his own that need not necessarily bear any obvious resemblance to the thing it criticises  the one characteristic of a beautiful form is that one can put into it whatever one wishes and see in it whatever one chooses to see and the beauty that gives to creation its universal and aesthetic element makes the critic a creator in his turn and whispers of a thousand different things which were not present in the mind of him who carved the statue or painted the panel or graved the gem  it is sometimes said by those who understand neither the nature of the highest criticism nor the charm of the highest art that the pictures that the critic loves most to write about are those that belong to the anecdotage of painting and that deal with scenes taken out of literature or history  but this is not so  indeed pictures of this kind are far too intelligible  as a class they rank with illustrations and even considered from this point of view are failures as they do not stir the imagination but set definite bounds to it  for the domain of the painter is as i suggested before widely different from that of the poet  to the latter belongs life in its full and absolute entirety not merely the beauty that men look at but the beauty that men listen to also not merely the momentary grace of form or the transient gladness of colour but the whole sphere of feeling the perfect cycle of thought  the painter is so far limited that it is only through the mask of the body that he can show us the mystery of the soul only through conventional images that he can handle ideas only through its physical equivalents that he can deal with psychology  and how inadequately does he do it then asking us to accept the torn turban of the moor for the noble rage of othello or a dotard in a storm for the wild madness of lear  yet it seems as if nothing could stop him  most of our elderly english painters spend their wicked and wasted lives in poaching upon the domain of the poets marring their motives by clumsy treatment and striving to render by visible form or colour the marvel of what is invisible the splendour of what is not seen  their pictures are as a natural consequence insufferably tedious  they have degraded the invisible arts into the obvious arts and the one thing not worth looking at is the obvious  i do not say that poet and painter may not treat of the same subject  they have always done so and will always do so  but while the poet can be pictorial or not as he chooses the painter must be pictorial always  for a painter is limited not to what he sees in nature but to what upon canvas may be seen  and so my dear ernest pictures of this kind will not really fascinate the critic  he will turn from them to such works as make him brood and dream and fancy to works that possess the subtle quality of suggestion and seem to tell one that even from them there is an escape into a wider world  it is sometimes said that the tragedy of an artists life is that he cannot realise his ideal  but the true tragedy that dogs the steps of most artists is that they realise their ideal too absolutely  for when the ideal is realised it is robbed of its wonder and its mystery and becomes simply a new startingpoint for an ideal that is other than itself  this is the reason why music is the perfect type of art music can never reveal its ultimate secret  this also is the explanation of the value of limitations in art  the sculptor gladly surrenders imitative colour and the painter the actual dimensions of form because by such renunciations they are able to avoid too definite a presentation of the real which would be mere imitation and too definite a realisation of the ideal which would be too purely intellectual  it is through its very incompleteness that art becomes complete in beauty and so addresses itself not to the faculty of recognition nor to the faculty of reason but to the aesthetic sense alone which while accepting both reason and recognition as stages of apprehension subordinates them both to a pure synthetic impression of the work of art as a whole and taking whatever alien emotional elements the work may possess uses their very complexity as a means by which a richer unity may be added to the ultimate impression itself  you see then how it is that the aesthetic critic rejects these obvious modes of art that have but one message to deliver and having delivered it become dumb and sterile and seeks rather for such modes as suggest reverie and mood and by their imaginative beauty make all interpretations true and no interpretation final  some resemblance no doubt the creative work of the critic will have to the work that has stirred him to creation but it will be such resemblance as exists not between nature and the mirror that the painter of landscape or figure may be supposed to hold up to her but between nature and the work of the decorative artist  just as on the flowerless carpets of persia tulip and rose blossom indeed and are lovely to look on though they are not reproduced in visible shape or line just as the pearl and purple of the sea shell is echoed in the church of st mark at venice just as the vaulted ceiling of the wondrous chapel at ravenna is made gorgeous by the gold and green and sapphire of the peacocks tail though the birds of juno fly not across it so the critic reproduces the work that he criticises in a mode that is never imitative and part of whose charm may really consist in the rejection of resemblance and shows us in this way not merely the meaning but also the mystery of beauty and by transforming each art into literature solves once for all the problem of arts unity  but i see it is time for supper  after we have discussed some chambertin and a few ortolans we will pass on to the question of the critic considered in the light of the interpreter  ernest  ah you admit then that the critic may occasionally be allowed to see the object as in itself it really is  gilbert  i am not quite sure  perhaps i may admit it after supper  there is a subtle influence in supper    the critic as artistwith some remarks upon the importance of discussing everything    a dialogue  part ii  persons  the same  scene  the same  ernest  the ortolans were delightful and the chambertin perfect and now let us return to the point at issue  gilbert  ah dont let us do that  conversation should touch everything but should concentrate itself on nothing  let us talk about moral indignation its cause and cure a subject on which i think of writing  or about the survival of thersites as shown by the english comic papers or about any topic that may turn up  ernest  no i want to discuss the critic and criticism  you have told me that the highest criticism deals with art not as expressive but as impressive purely and is consequently both creative and independent is in fact an art by itself occupying the same relation to creative work that creative work does to the visible world of form and colour or the unseen world of passion and of thought  well now tell me will not the critic be sometimes a real interpreter  gilbert  yes the critic will be an interpreter if he chooses he can pass from his synthetic impression of the work of art as a whole to an analysis or exposition of the work itself and in this lower sphere as i hold it to be there are many delightful things to be said and done  yet his object will not always be to explain the work of art  he may seek rather to deepen its mystery to raise round it and round its maker that mist of wonder which is dear to both gods and worshippers alike  ordinary people are terribly at ease in zion  they propose to walk arm in arm with the poets and have a glib ignorant way of saying why should we read what is written about shakespeare and milton  we can read the plays and the poems  that is enough  but an appreciation of milton is as the late rector of lincoln remarked once the reward of consummate scholarship  and he who desires to understand shakespeare truly must understand the relations in which shakespeare stood to the renaissance and the reformation to the age of elizabeth and the age of james he must be familiar with the history of the struggle for supremacy between the old classical forms and the new spirit of romance between the school of sidney and daniel and johnson and the school of marlowe and marlowes greater son he must know the materials that were at shakespeares disposal and the method in which he used them and the conditions of theatric presentation in the sixteenth and seventeenth century their limitations and their opportunities for freedom and the literary criticism of shakespeares day its aims and modes and canons he must study the english language in its progress and blank or rhymed verse in its various developments he must study the greek drama and the connection between the art of the creator of the agamemnon and the art of the creator of macbeth in a word he must be able to bind elizabethan london to the athens of pericles and to learn shakespeares true position in the history of european drama and the drama of the world  the critic will certainly be an interpreter but he will not treat art as a riddling sphinx whose shallow secret may be guessed and revealed by one whose feet are wounded and who knows not his name  rather he will look upon art as a goddess whose mystery it is his province to intensify and whose majesty his privilege to make more marvellous in the eyes of men  and here ernest this strange thing happens  the critic will indeed be an interpreter but he will not be an interpreter in the sense of one who simply repeats in another form a message that has been put into his lips to say  for just as it is only by contact with the art of foreign nations that the art of a country gains that individual and separate life that we call nationality so by curious inversion it is only by intensifying his own personality that the critic can interpret the personality and work of others and the more strongly this personality enters into the interpretation the more real the interpretation becomes the more satisfying the more convincing and the more true  ernest  i would have said that personality would have been a disturbing element  gilbert  no it is an element of revelation  if you wish to understand others you must intensify your own individualism  ernest  what then is the result  gilbert  i will tell you and perhaps i can tell you best by definite example  it seems to me that while the literary critic stands of course first as having the wider range and larger vision and nobler material each of the arts has a critic as it were assigned to it  the actor is a critic of the drama  he shows the poets work under new conditions and by a method special to himself  he takes the written word and action gesture and voice become the media of revelation  the singer or the player on lute and viol is the critic of music  the etcher of a picture robs the painting of its fair colours but shows us by the use of a new material its true colourquality its tones and values and the relations of its masses and so is in his way a critic of it for the critic is he who exhibits to us a work of art in a form different from that of the work itself and the employment of a new material is a critical as well as a creative element  sculpture too has its critic who may be either the carver of a gem as he was in greek days or some painter like mantegna who sought to reproduce on canvas the beauty of plastic line and the symphonic dignity of processional basrelief  and in the case of all these creative critics of art it is evident that personality is an absolute essential for any real interpretation  when rubinstein plays to us the sonata appassionata of beethoven he gives us not merely beethoven but also himself and so gives us beethoven absolutelybeethoven reinterpreted through a rich artistic nature and made vivid and wonderful to us by a new and intense personality  when a great actor plays shakespeare we have the same experience  his own individuality becomes a vital part of the interpretation  people sometimes say that actors give us their own hamlets and not shakespeares and this fallacyfor it is a fallacyis i regret to say repeated by that charming and graceful writer who has lately deserted the turmoil of literature for the peace of the house of commons i mean the author of obiter dicta  in point of fact there is no such thing as shakespeares hamlet  if hamlet has something of the definiteness of a work of art he has also all the obscurity that belongs to life  there are as many hamlets as there are melancholies  ernest  as many hamlets as there are melancholies  gilbert  yes  and as art springs from personality so it is only to personality that it can be revealed and from the meeting of the two comes right interpretative criticism  ernest  the critic then considered as the interpreter will give no less than he receives and lend as much as he borrows  gilbert  he will be always showing us the work of art in some new relation to our age  he will always be reminding us that great works of art are living thingsare in fact the only things that live  so much indeed will he feel this that i am certain that as civilisation progresses and we become more highly organised the elect spirits of each age the critical and cultured spirits will grow less and less interested in actual life and will seek to gain their impressions almost entirely from what art has touched  for life is terribly deficient in form  its catastrophes happen in the wrong way and to the wrong people  there is a grotesque horror about its comedies and its tragedies seem to culminate in farce one is always wounded when one approaches it  things last either too long or not long enough  ernest  poor life  poor human life  are you not even touched by the tears that the roman poet tells us are part of its essence  gilbert  too quickly touched by them i fear  for when one looks back upon the life that was so vivid in its emotional intensity and filled with such fervent moments of ecstasy or of joy it all seems to be a dream and an illusion  what are the unreal things but the passions that once burned one like fire  what are the incredible things but the things that one has faithfully believed what are the improbable things  the things that one has done oneself  no ernest life cheats us with shadows like a puppet master  we ask it for pleasure  it gives it to us with bitterness and disappointment in its train  we come across some noble grief that we think will lend the purple dignity of tragedy to our days but it passes away from us and things less noble take its place and on some grey windy dawn or odorous eve of silence and of silver we find ourselves looking with callous wonder or dull heart of stone at the tress of goldflecked hair that we had once so wildly worshipped and so madly kissed  ernest  life then is a failure  gilbert  from the artistic point of view certainly  and the chief thing that makes life a failure from this artistic point of view is the thing that lends to life its sordid security the fact that one can never repeat exactly the same emotion  how different it is in the world of art  on a shelf of the bookcase behind you stands the divine comedy and i know that if i open it at a certain place i shall be filled with a fierce hatred of some one who has never wronged me or stirred by a great love for some one whom i shall never see  there is no mood or passion that art cannot give us and those of us who have discovered her secret can settle beforehand what our experiences are going to be  we can choose our day and select our hour  we can say to ourselves to morrow at dawn we shall walk with grave virgil through the valley of the shadow of death and lo the dawn finds us in the obscure wood and the mantuan stands by our side  we pass through the gate of the legend fatal to hope and with pity or with joy behold the horror of another world  the hypocrites go by with their painted faces and their cowls of gilded lead  out of the ceaseless winds that drive them the carnal look at us and we watch the heretic rending his flesh and the glutton lashed by the rain  we break the withered branches from the tree in the grove of the harpies and each dullhued poisonous twig bleeds with red blood before us and cries aloud with bitter cries  out of a horn of fire odysseus speaks to us and when from his sepulchre of flame the great ghibelline rises the pride that triumphs over the torture of that bed becomes ours for a moment  through the dim purple air fly those who have stained the world with the beauty of their sin and in the pit of loathsome disease dropsystricken and swollen of body into the semblance of a monstrous lute lies adamo di brescia the coiner of false coin  he bids us listen to his misery we stop and with dry and gaping lips he tells us how he dreams day and night of the brooks of clear water that in cool dewy channels gush down the green casentine hills  sinon the false greek of troy mocks at him  he smites him in the face and they wrangle we are fascinated by their shame and loiter till virgil chides us and leads us away to that city turreted by giants where great nimrod blows his horn  terrible things are in store for us and we go to meet them in dantes raiment and with dantes heart  we traverse the marshes of the styx and argenti swims to the boat through the slimy waves  he calls to us and we reject him  when we hear the voice of his agony we are glad and virgil praises us for the bitterness of our scorn  we tread upon the cold crystal of cocytus in which traitors stick like straws in glass  our foot strikes against the head of bocca  he will not tell us his name and we tear the hair in handfuls from the screaming skull alberigo prays us to break the ice upon his face that he may weep a little  we pledge our word to him and when he has uttered his dolorous tale we deny the word that we have spoken and pass from him such cruelty being courtesy indeed for who more base than he who has mercy for the condemned of god  in the jaws of lucifer we see the man who sold christ and in the jaws of lucifer the men who slew caesar  we tremble and come forth to rebehold the stars  in the land of purgation the air is freer and the holy mountain rises into the pure light of day  there is peace for us and for those who for a season abide in it there is some peace also though pale from the poison of the maremma madonna pia passes before us and ismene with the sorrow of earth still lingering about her is there  soul after soul makes us share in some repentance or some joy  he whom the mourning of his widow taught to drink the sweet wormwood of pain tells us of nella praying in her lonely bed and we learn from the mouth of buonconte how a single tear may save a dying sinner from the fiend  sordello that noble and disdainful lombard eyes us from afar like a couchant lion  when he learns that virgil is one of mantuas citizens he falls upon his neck and when he learns that he is the singer of rome he falls before his feet  in that valley whose grass and flowers are fairer than cleft emerald and indian wood and brighter than scarlet and silver they are singing who in the world were kings but the lips of rudolph of hapsburg do not move to the music of the others and philip of france beats his breast and henry of england sits alone  on and on we go climbing the marvellous stair and the stars become larger than their wont and the song of the kings grows faint and at length we reach the seven trees of gold and the garden of the earthly paradise  in a griffindrawn chariot appears one whose brows are bound with olive who is veiled in white and mantled in green and robed in a vesture that is coloured like live fire  the ancient flame wakes within us  our blood quickens through terrible pulses  we recognise her  it is beatrice the woman we have worshipped  the ice congealed about our heart melts  wild tears of anguish break from us and we bow our forehead to the ground for we know that we have sinned  when we have done penance and are purified and have drunk of the fountain of lethe and bathed in the fountain of eunoe the mistress of our soul raises us to the paradise of heaven  out of that eternal pearl the moon the face of piccarda donati leans to us her beauty troubles us for a moment and when like a thing that falls through water she passes away we gaze after her with wistful eyes  the sweet planet of venus is full of lovers cunizza the sister of ezzelin the lady of sordellos heart is there and folco the passionate singer of provence who in sorrow for azalais forsook the world and the canaanitish harlot whose soul was the first that christ redeemed  joachim of flora stands in the sun and in the sun aquinas recounts the story of st francis and bonaventure the story of st dominic  through the burning rubies of mars cacciaguida approaches  he tells us of the arrow that is shot from the bow of exile and how salt tastes the bread of another and how steep are the stairs in the house of a stranger  in saturn the soul sings not and even she who guides us dare not smile  on a ladder of gold the flames rise and fall  at last we see the pageant of the mystical rose  beatrice fixes her eyes upon the face of god to turn them not again  the beatific vision is granted to us we know the love that moves the sun and all the stars  yes we can put the earth back six hundred courses and make ourselves one with the great florentine kneel at the same altar with him and share his rapture and his scorn  and if we grow tired of an antique time and desire to realise our own age in all its weariness and sin are there not books that can make us live more in one single hour than life can make us live in a score of shameful years  close to your hand lies a little volume bound in some nilegreen skin that has been powdered with gilded nenuphars and smoothed with hard ivory  it is the book that gautier loved it is baudelaires masterpiece  open it at that sad madrigal that begins   que mimporte que tu sois sage sois belle et sois triste   and you will find yourself worshipping sorrow as you have never worshipped joy  pass on to the poem on the man who tortures himself let its subtle music steal into your brain and colour your thoughts and you will become for a moment what he was who wrote it nay not for a moment only but for many barren moonlit nights and sunless sterile days will a despair that is not your own make its dwelling within you and the misery of another gnaw your heart away  read the whole book suffer it to tell even one of its secrets to your soul and your soul will grow eager to know more and will feed upon poisonous honey and seek to repent of strange crimes of which it is guiltless and to make atonement for terrible pleasures that it has never known  and then when you are tired of these flowers of evil turn to the flowers that grow in the garden of perdita and in their dewdrenched chalices cool your fevered brow and let their loveliness heal and restore your soul or wake from his forgotten tomb the sweet syrian meleager and bid the lover of heliodore make you music for he too has flowers in his song red pomegranate blossoms and irises that smell of myrrh ringed daffodils and dark blue hyacinths and marjoram and crinkled oxeyes  dear to him was the perfume of the beanfield at evening and dear to him the odorous earedspikenard that grew on the syrian hills and the fresh green thyme the winecups charm  the feet of his love as she walked in the garden were like lilies set upon lilies  softer than sleepladen poppy petals were her lips softer than violets and as scented  the flamelike crocus sprang from the grass to look at her  for her the slim narcissus stored the cool rain and for her the anemones forgot the sicilian winds that wooed them  and neither crocus nor anemone nor narcissus was as fair as she was  it is a strange thing this transference of emotion  we sicken with the same maladies as the poets and the singer lends us his pain  dead lips have their message for us and hearts that have fallen to dust can communicate their joy  we run to kiss the bleeding mouth of fantine and we follow manon lescaut over the whole world  ours is the lovemadness of the tyrian and the terror of orestes is ours also  there is no passion that we cannot feel no pleasure that we may not gratify and we can choose the time of our initiation and the time of our freedom also  life life  dont let us go to life for our fulfilment or our experience  it is a thing narrowed by circumstances incoherent in its utterance and without that fine correspondence of form and spirit which is the only thing that can satisfy the artistic and critical temperament  it makes us pay too high a price for its wares and we purchase the meanest of its secrets at a cost that is monstrous and infinite  ernest  must we go then to art for everything  gilbert  for everything  because art does not hurt us  the tears that we shed at a play are a type of the exquisite sterile emotions that it is the function of art to awaken  we weep but we are not wounded  we grieve but our grief is not bitter  in the actual life of man sorrow as spinoza says somewhere is a passage to a lesser perfection  but the sorrow with which art fills us both purifies and initiates if i may quote once more from the great art critic of the greeks  it is through art and through art only that we can realise our perfection through art and through art only that we can shield ourselves from the sordid perils of actual existence  this results not merely from the fact that nothing that one can imagine is worth doing and that one can imagine everything but from the subtle law that emotional forces like the forces of the physical sphere are limited in extent and energy one can feel so much and no more  and how can it matter with what pleasure life tries to tempt one or with what pain it seeks to maim and mar ones soul if in the spectacle of the lives of those who have never existed one has found the true secret of joy and wept away ones tears over their deaths who like cordelia and the daughter of brabantio can never die  ernest  stop a moment  it seems to me that in everything that you have said there is something radically immoral  gilbert  all art is immoral  ernest  all art  gilbert  yes  for emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of art and emotion for the sake of action is the aim of life and of that practical organisation of life that we call society  society which is the beginning and basis of morals exists simply for the concentration of human energy and in order to ensure its own continuance and healthy stability it demands and no doubt rightly demands of each of its citizens that he should contribute some form of productive labour to the common weal and toil and travail that the days work may be done  society often forgives the criminal it never forgives the dreamer  the beautiful sterile emotions that art excites in us are hateful in its eyes and so completely are people dominated by the tyranny of this dreadful social ideal that they are always coming shamelessly up to one at private views and other places that are open to the general public and saying in a loud stentorian voice what are you doing whereas what are you thinking is the only question that any single civilised being should ever be allowed to whisper to another  they mean well no doubt these honest beaming folk perhaps that is the reason why they are so excessively tedious but some one should teach them that while in the opinion of society contemplation is the gravest sin of which any citizen can be guilty in the opinion of the highest culture it is the proper occupation of man  ernest  contemplation  gilbert  contemplation  i said to you some time ago that it was far more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it  let me say to you now that to do nothing at all is the most difficult thing in the world the most difficult and the most intellectual  to plato with his passion for wisdom this was the noblest form of energy to aristotle with his passion for knowledge this was the noblest form of energy also  it was to this that the passion for holiness led the saint and the mystic of mediaeval days  ernest  we exist then to do nothing  gilbert  it is to do nothing that the elect exist  action is limited and relative  unlimited and absolute is the vision of him who sits at ease and watches who walks in loneliness and dreams but we who are born at the close of this wonderful age are at once too cultured and too critical too intellectually subtle and too curious of exquisite pleasures to accept any speculations about life in exchange for life itself  to us the citta divina is colourless and the fruitio dei without meaning  metaphysics do not satisfy our temperaments and religious ecstasy is out of date the world through which the academic philosopher becomes the spectator of all time and of all existence is not really an ideal world but simply a world of abstract ideas  when we enter it we starve amidst the chill mathematics of thought  the courts of the city of god are not open to us now  its gates are guarded by ignorance and to pass them we have to surrender all that in our nature is most divine  it is enough that our fathers believed they have exhausted the faithfaculty of the species  their legacy to us is the scepticism of which they were afraid  had they put it into words it might not live within us as thought  no ernest no  we cannot go back to the saint  there is far more to be learned from the sinner  we cannot go back to the philosopher and the mystic leads us astray  who as mr pater suggests somewhere would exchange the curve of a single roseleaf for that formless intangible being which plato rates so high  what to us is the illumination of philo the abyss of eckhart the vision of bohme the monstrous heaven itself that was revealed to swedenborgs blinded eyes  such things are less than the yellow trumpet of one daffodil of the field far less than the meanest of the visible arts for just as nature is matter struggling into mind so art is mind expressing itself under the conditions of matter and thus even in the lowliest of her manifestations she speaks to both sense and soul alike  to the aesthetic temperament the vague is always repellent  the greeks were a nation of artists because they were spared the sense of the infinite  like aristotle like goethe after he had read kant we desire the concrete and nothing but the concrete can satisfy us  ernest  what then do you propose  gilbert  it seems to me that with the development of the critical spirit we shall be able to realise not merely our own lives but the collective life of the race and so to make ourselves absolutely modern in the true meaning of the word modernity  for he to whom the present is the only thing that is present knows nothing of the age in which he lives  to realise the nineteenth century one must realise every century that has preceded it and that has contributed to its making  to know anything about oneself one must know all about others  there must be no mood with which one cannot sympathise no dead mode of life that one cannot make alive  is this impossible  i think not  by revealing to us the absolute mechanism of all action and so freeing us from the self imposed and trammelling burden of moral responsibility the scientific principle of heredity has become as it were the warrant for the contemplative life  it has shown us that we are never less free than when we try to act  it has hemmed us round with the nets of the hunter and written upon the wall the prophecy of our doom  we may not watch it for it is within us  we may not see it save in a mirror that mirrors the soul  it is nemesis without her mask  it is the last of the fates and the most terrible  it is the only one of the gods whose real name we know  and yet while in the sphere of practical and external life it has robbed energy of its freedom and activity of its choice in the subjective sphere where the soul is at work it comes to us this terrible shadow with many gifts in its hands gifts of strange temperaments and subtle susceptibilities gifts of wild ardours and chill moods of indifference complex multiform gifts of thoughts that are at variance with each other and passions that war against themselves  and so it is not our own life that we live but the lives of the dead and the soul that dwells within us is no single spiritual entity making us personal and individual created for our service and entering into us for our joy  it is something that has dwelt in fearful places and in ancient sepulchres has made its abode  it is sick with many maladies and has memories of curious sins  it is wiser than we are and its wisdom is bitter it fills us with impossible desires and makes us follow what we know we cannot gain  one thing however ernest it can do for us it can lead us away from surroundings whose beauty is dimmed to us by the mist of familiarity or whose ignoble ugliness and sordid claims are marring the perfection of our development  it can help us to leave the age in which we were born and to pass into other ages and find ourselves not exiled from their air  it can teach us how to escape from our experience and to realise the experiences of those who are greater than we are  the pain of leopardi crying out against life becomes our pain  theocritus blows on his pipe and we laugh with the lips of nymph and shepherd  in the wolfskin of pierre vidal we flee before the hounds and in the armour of lancelot we ride from the bower of the queen  we have whispered the secret of our love beneath the cowl of abelard and in the stained raiment of villon have put our shame into song  we can see the dawn through shelleys eyes and when we wander with endymion the moon grows amorous of our youth  ours is the anguish of atys and ours the weak rage and noble sorrows of the dane  do you think that it is the imagination that enables us to live these countless lives  yes  it is the imagination and the imagination is the result of heredity  it is simply concentrated raceexperience  ernest  but where in this is the function of the critical spirit  gilbert  the culture that this transmission of racial experiences makes possible can be made perfect by the critical spirit alone and indeed may be said to be one with it  for who is the true critic but he who bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriad generations and to whom no form of thought is alien no emotional impulse obscure  and who the true man of culture if not he who by fine scholarship and fastidious rejection has made instinct selfconscious and intelligent and can separate the work that has distinction from the work that has it not and so by contact and comparison makes himself master of the secrets of style and school and understands their meanings and listens to their voices and develops that spirit of disinterested curiosity which is the real root as it is the real flower of the intellectual life and thus attains to intellectual clarity and having learned the best that is known and thought in the world livesit is not fanciful to say sowith those who are the immortals  yes ernest  the contemplative life the life that has for its aim not doing but being and not being merely but becomingthat is what the critical spirit can give us  the gods live thus  either brooding over their own perfection as aristotle tells us or as epicurus fancied watching with the calm eyes of the spectator the tragicomedy of the world that they have made  we too might live like them and set ourselves to witness with appropriate emotions the varied scenes that man and nature afford  we might make ourselves spiritual by detaching ourselves from action and become perfect by the rejection of energy  it has often seemed to me that browning felt something of this  shakespeare hurls hamlet into active life and makes him realise his mission by effort  browning might have given us a hamlet who would have realised his mission by thought  incident and event were to him unreal or unmeaning  he made the soul the protagonist of lifes tragedy and looked on action as the one undramatic element of a play  to us at any rate the greek text which cannot be reproduced is the true ideal  from the high tower of thought we can look out at the world  calm and selfcentred and complete the aesthetic critic contemplates life and no arrow drawn at a venture can pierce between the joints of his harness  he at least is safe  he has discovered how to live  is such a mode of life immoral  yes  all the arts are immoral except those baser forms of sensual or didactic art that seek to excite to action of evil or of good  for action of every kind belongs to the sphere of ethics  the aim of art is simply to create a mood  is such a mode of life unpractical  ah it is not so easy to be unpractical as the ignorant philistine imagines  it were well for england if it were so  there is no country in the world so much in need of unpractical people as this country of ours  with us thought is degraded by its constant association with practice  who that moves in the stress and turmoil of actual existence noisy politician or brawling social reformer or poor narrowminded priest blinded by the sufferings of that unimportant section of the community among whom he has cast his lot can seriously claim to be able to form a disinterested intellectual judgment about any one thing  each of the professions means a prejudice  the necessity for a career forces every one to take sides  we live in the age of the overworked and the under educated the age in which people are so industrious that they become absolutely stupid  and harsh though it may sound i cannot help saying that such people deserve their doom  the sure way of knowing nothing about life is to try to make oneself useful  ernest  a charming doctrine gilbert  gilbert  i am not sure about that but it has at least the minor merit of being true  that the desire to do good to others produces a plentiful crop of prigs is the least of the evils of which it is the cause  the prig is a very interesting psychological study and though of all poses a moral pose is the most offensive still to have a pose at all is something  it is a formal recognition of the importance of treating life from a definite and reasoned standpoint  that humanitarian sympathy wars against nature by securing the survival of the failure may make the man of science loathe its facile virtues  the political economist may cry out against it for putting the improvident on the same level as the provident and so robbing life of the strongest because most sordid incentive to industry  but in the eyes of the thinker the real harm that emotional sympathy does is that it limits knowledge and so prevents us from solving any single social problem  we are trying at present to stave off the coming crisis the coming revolution as my friends the fabianists call it by means of doles and alms  well when the revolution or crisis arrives we shall be powerless because we shall know nothing  and so ernest let us not be deceived  england will never be civilised till she has added utopia to her dominions  there is more than one of her colonies that she might with advantage surrender for so fair a land  what we want are unpractical people who see beyond the moment and think beyond the day  those who try to lead the people can only do so by following the mob  it is through the voice of one crying in the wilderness that the ways of the gods must be prepared  but perhaps you think that in beholding for the mere joy of beholding and contemplating for the sake of contemplation there is something that is egotistic  if you think so do not say so it takes a thoroughly selfish age like our own to deify self sacrifice  it takes a thoroughly grasping age such as that in which we live to set above the fine intellectual virtues those shallow and emotional virtues that are an immediate practical benefit to itself  they miss their aim too these philanthropists and sentimentalists of our day who are always chattering to one about ones duty to ones neighbour  for the development of the race depends on the development of the individual and where self culture has ceased to be the ideal the intellectual standard is instantly lowered and often ultimately lost  if you meet at dinner a man who has spent his life in educating himselfa rare type in our time i admit but still one occasionally to be met withyou rise from table richer and conscious that a high ideal has for a moment touched and sanctified your days  but oh my dear ernest to sit next to a man who has spent his life in trying to educate others  what a dreadful experience that is  how appalling is that ignorance which is the inevitable result of the fatal habit of imparting opinions  how limited in range the creatures mind proves to be  how it wearies us and must weary himself with its endless repetitions and sickly reiteration  how lacking it is in any element of intellectual growth  in what a vicious circle it always moves  ernest  you speak with strange feeling gilbert  have you had this dreadful experience as you call it lately   gilbert  few of us escape it people say that the schoolmaster is abroad  i wish to goodness he were  but the type of which after all he is only one and certainly the least important of the representatives seems to me to be really dominating our lives and just as the philanthropist is the nuisance of the ethical sphere so the nuisance of the intellectual sphere is the man who is so occupied in trying to educate others that he has never had any time to educate himself  no ernest selfculture is the true ideal of man  goethe saw it and the immediate debt that we owe to goethe is greater than the debt we owe to any man since greek days the greeks saw it and have left us as their legacy to modern thought the conception of the contemplative life as well as the critical method by which alone can that life be truly realised  it was the one thing that made the renaissance great and gave us humanism  it is the one thing that could make our own age great also for the real weakness of england lies not in incomplete armaments or unfortified coasts not in the poverty that creeps through sunless lanes or the drunkenness that brawls in loathsome courts but simply in the fact that her ideals are emotional and not intellectual  i do not deny that the intellectual ideal is difficult of attainment still less that it is and perhaps will be for years to come unpopular with the crowd  it is so easy for people to have sympathy with suffering  it is so difficult for them to have sympathy with thought  indeed so little do ordinary people understand what thought really is that they seem to imagine that when they have said that a theory is dangerous they have pronounced its condemnation whereas it is only such theories that have any true intellectual value  an idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all  ernest  gilbert you bewilder me  you have told me that all art is in its essence immoral  are you going to tell me now that all thought is in its essence dangerous  gilbert  yes in the practical sphere it is so  the security of society lies in custom and unconscious instinct and the basis of the stability of society as a healthy organism is the complete absence of any intelligence amongst its members  the great majority of people being fully aware of this rank themselves naturally on the side of that splendid system that elevates them to the dignity of machines and rage so wildly against the intrusion of the intellectual faculty into any question that concerns life that one is tempted to define man as a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason  but let us turn from the practical sphere and say no more about the wicked philanthropists who indeed may well be left to the mercy of the almondeyed sage of the yellow river chuang tsu the wise who has proved that such wellmeaning and offensive busybodies have destroyed the simple and spontaneous virtue that there is in man  they are a wearisome topic and i am anxious to get back to the sphere in which criticism is free  ernest  the sphere of the intellect  gilbert  yes  you remember that i spoke of the critic as being in his own way as creative as the artist whose work indeed may be merely of value in so far as it gives to the critic a suggestion for some new mood of thought and feeling which he can realise with equal or perhaps greater distinction of form and through the use of a fresh medium of expression make differently beautiful and more perfect  well you seemed to be a little sceptical about the theory  but perhaps i wronged you  ernest  i am not really sceptical about it but i must admit that i feel very strongly that such work as you describe the critic producingand creative such work must undoubtedly be admitted to beis of necessity purely subjective whereas the greatest work is objective always objective and impersonal  gilbert  the difference between objective and subjective work is one of external form merely  it is accidental not essential  all artistic creation is absolutely subjective  the very landscape that corot looked at was as he said himself but a mood of his own mind and those great figures of greek or english drama that seem to us to possess an actual existence of their own apart from the poets who shaped and fashioned them are in their ultimate analysis simply the poets themselves not as they thought they were but as they thought they were not and by such thinking came in strange manner though but for a moment really so to be  for out of ourselves we can never pass nor can there be in creation what in the creator was not  nay i would say that the more objective a creation appears to be the more subjective it really is  shakespeare might have met rosencrantz and guildenstern in the white streets of london or seen the servingmen of rival houses bite their thumbs at each other in the open square but hamlet came out of his soul and romeo out of his passion  they were elements of his nature to which he gave visible form impulses that stirred so strongly within him that he had as it were perforce to suffer them to realise their energy not on the lower plane of actual life where they would have been trammelled and constrained and so made imperfect but on that imaginative plane of art where love can indeed find in death its rich fulfilment where one can stab the eavesdropper behind the arras and wrestle in a newmade grave and make a guilty king drink his own hurt and see ones fathers spirit beneath the glimpses of the moon stalking in complete steel from misty wall to wall  action being limited would have left shakespeare unsatisfied and unexpressed and just as it is because he did nothing that he has been able to achieve everything so it is because he never speaks to us of himself in his plays that his plays reveal him to us absolutely and show us his true nature and temperament far more completely than do those strange and exquisite sonnets even in which he bares to crystal eyes the secret closet of his heart  yes the objective form is the most subjective in matter  man is least himself when he talks in his own person  give him a mask and he will tell you the truth  ernest  the critic then being limited to the subjective form will necessarily be less able fully to express himself than the artist who has always at his disposal the forms that are impersonal and objective  gilbert  not necessarily and certainly not at all if he recognises that each mode of criticism is in its highest development simply a mood and that we are never more true to ourselves than when we are inconsistent  the aesthetic critic constant only to the principle of beauty in all things will ever be looking for fresh impressions winning from the various schools the secret of their charm bowing it may be before foreign altars or smiling if it be his fancy at strange new gods  what other people call ones past has no doubt everything to do with them but has absolutely nothing to do with oneself  the man who regards his past is a man who deserves to have no future to look forward to  when one has found expression for a mood one has done with it  you laugh but believe me it is so  yesterday it was realism that charmed one  one gained from it that nouveau frisson which it was its aim to produce  one analysed it explained it and wearied of it  at sunset came the luministe in painting and the symboliste in poetry and the spirit of mediaevalism that spirit which belongs not to time but to temperament woke suddenly in wounded russia and stirred us for a moment by the terrible fascination of pain  today the cry is for romance and already the leaves are tremulous in the valley and on the purple hilltops walks beauty with slim gilded feet  the old modes of creation linger of course  the artists reproduce either themselves or each other with wearisome iteration  but criticism is always moving on and the critic is always developing  nor again is the critic really limited to the subjective form of expression  the method of the drama is his as well as the method of the epos  he may use dialogue as he did who set milton talking to marvel on the nature of comedy and tragedy and made sidney and lord brooke discourse on letters beneath the penshurst oaks or adopt narration as mr pater is fond of doing each of whose imaginary portraitsis not that the title of the bookpresents to us under the fanciful guise of fiction some fine and exquisite piece of criticism one on the painter watteau another on the philosophy of spinoza a third on the pagan elements of the early renaissance and the last and in some respects the most suggestive on the source of that aufklarung that enlightening which dawned on germany in the last century and to which our own culture owes so great a debt  dialogue certainly that wonderful literary form which from plato to lucian and from lucian to giordano bruno and from bruno to that grand old pagan in whom carlyle took such delight the creative critics of the world have always employed can never lose for the thinker its attraction as a mode of expression  by its means he can both reveal and conceal himself and give form to every fancy and reality to every mood by its means he can exhibit the object from each point of view and show it to us in the round as a sculptor shows us things gaining in this manner all the richness and reality of effect that comes from those side issues that are suddenly suggested by the central idea in its progress and really illumine the idea more completely or from those felicitous afterthoughts that give a fuller completeness to the central scheme and yet convey something of the delicate charm of chance  ernest  by its means too he can invent an imaginary antagonist and convert him when he chooses by some absurdly sophistical argument  gilbert  ah it is so easy to convert others  it is so difficult to convert oneself  to arrive at what one really believes one must speak through lips different from ones own  to know the truth one must imagine myriads of falsehoods  for what is truth in matters of religion it is simply the opinion that has survived in matters of science it is the ultimate sensation  in matters of art it is ones last mood  and you see now ernest that the critic has at his disposal as many objective forms of expression as the artist has  ruskin put his criticism into imaginative prose and is superb in his changes and contradictions and browning put his into blank verse and made painter and poet yield us their secret and m renan uses dialogue and mr pater fiction and rossetti translated into sonnetmusic the colour of giorgione and the design of ingres and his own design and colour also feeling with the instinct of one who had many modes of utterance that the ultimate art is literature and the finest and fullest medium that of words  ernest  well now that you have settled that the critic has at his disposal all objective forms i wish you would tell me what are the qualities that should characterise the true critic  gilbert  what would you say they were  ernest  well i should say that a critic should above all things be fair  gilbert  ah not fair  a critic cannot be fair in the ordinary sense of the word  it is only about things that do not interest one that one can give a really unbiassed opinion which is no doubt the reason why an unbiassed opinion is always absolutely valueless the man who sees both sides of a question is a man who sees absolutely nothing at all  art is a passion and in matters of art thought is inevitably coloured by emotion and so is fluid rather than fixed and depending upon fine moods and exquisite moments cannot be narrowed into the rigidity of a scientific formula or a theological dogma  it is to the soul that art speaks and the soul may be made the prisoner of the mind as well as of the body  one should of course have no prejudices but as a great frenchman remarked a hundred years ago it is ones business in such matters to have preferences and when one has preferences one ceases to be fair  it is only an auctioneer who can equally and impartially admire all schools of art  no fairness is not one of the qualities of the true critic  it is not even a condition of criticism  each form of art with which we come in contact dominates us for the moment to the exclusion of every other form we must surrender ourselves absolutely to the work in question whatever it may be if we wish to gain its secret  for the time we must think of nothing else can think of nothing else indeed  ernest  the true critic will be rational at any rate will he not  gilbert  rational  there are two ways of disliking art ernest one is to dislike it  the other to like it rationally  for art as plato saw and not without regret creates in listener and spectator a form of divine madness  it does not spring from inspiration but it makes others inspired  reason is not the faculty to which it appeals  if one loves art at all one must love it beyond all other things in the world and against such love the reason if one listened to it would cry out  there is nothing sane about the worship of beauty  it is too splendid to be sane  those of whose lives it forms the dominant note will always seem to the world to be pure visionaries  ernest  well at least the critic will be sincere  gilbert  a little sincerity is a dangerous thing and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal  the true critic will indeed always be sincere in his devotion to the principle of beauty but he will seek for beauty in every age and in each school and will never suffer himself to be limited to any settled custom of thought or stereotyped mode of looking at things  he will realise himself in many forms and by a thousand different ways and will ever be curious of new sensations and fresh points of view  through constant change and through constant change alone he will find his true unity  he will not consent to be the slave of his own opinions  for what is mind but motion in the intellectual sphere the essence of thought as the essence of life is growth  you must not be frightened by word ernest  what people call insincerity is simply a method by which we can multiply our personalities  ernest  i am afraid i have not been fortunate in my suggestions  gilbert  of the three qualifications you mentioned two sincerity and fairness were if not actually moral at least on the borderland of morals and the first condition of criticism is that the critic should be able to recognise that the sphere of art and the sphere of ethics are absolutely distinct and separate  when they are confused chaos has come again  they are too often confused in england now and though our modern puritans cannot destroy a beautiful thing yet by means of their extraordinary prurience they can almost taint beauty for a moment  it is chiefly i regret to say through journalism that such people find expression  i regret it because there is much to be said in favour of modern journalism  by giving us the opinions of the uneducated it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community  by carefully chronicling the current events of contemporary life it shows us of what very little importance such events really are  by invariably discussing the unnecessary it makes us understand what things are requisite for culture and what are not  but it should not allow poor tartuffe to write articles upon modern art  when it does this it stultifies itself  and yet tartuffes articles and chadbands notes do this good at least  they serve to show how extremely limited is the area over which ethics and ethical considerations can claim to exercise influence  science is out of the reach of morals for her eyes are fixed upon eternal truths art is out of the reach of morals for her eyes are fixed upon things beautiful and immortal and everchanging  to morals belong the lower and less intellectual spheres  however let these mouthing puritans pass they have their comic side  who can help laughing when an ordinary journalist seriously proposes to limit the subjectmatter at the disposal of the artist  some limitation might well and will soon i hope be placed upon some of our newspapers and newspaper writers  for they give us the bald sordid disgusting facts of life  they chronicle with degrading avidity the sins of the secondrate and with the conscientiousness of the illiterate give us accurate and prosaic details of the doings of people of absolutely no interest whatsoever  but the artist who accepts the facts of life and yet transforms them into shapes of beauty and makes them vehicles of pity or of awe and shows their colourelement and their wonder and their true ethical import also and builds out of them a world more real than reality itself and of loftier and more noble importwho shall set limits to him  not the apostles of that new journalism which is but the old vulgarity writ large  not the apostles of that new puritanism which is but the whine of the hypocrite and is both writ and spoken badly  the mere suggestion is ridiculous  let us leave these wicked people and proceed to the discussion of the artistic qualifications necessary for the true critic  ernest  and what are they  tell me yourself  gilbert  temperament is the primary requisite for the critica temperament exquisitely susceptible to beauty and to the various impressions that beauty gives us  under what conditions and by what means this temperament is engendered in race or individual we will not discuss at present  it is sufficient to note that it exists and that there is in us a beautysense separate from the other senses and above them separate from the reason and of nobler import separate from the soul and of equal valuea sense that leads some to create and others the finer spirits as i think to contemplate merely  but to be purified and made perfect this sense requires some form of exquisite environment  without this it starves or is dulled  you remember that lovely passage in which plato describes how a young greek should be educated and with what insistence he dwells upon the importance of surroundings telling us how the lad is to be brought up in the midst of fair sights and sounds so that the beauty of material things may prepare his soul for the reception of the beauty that is spiritual  insensibly and without knowing the reason why he is to develop that real love of beauty which as plato is never weary of reminding us is the true aim of education  by slow degrees there is to be engendered in him such a temperament as will lead him naturally and simply to choose the good in preference to the bad and rejecting what is vulgar and discordant to follow by fine instinctive taste all that possesses grace and charm and loveliness  ultimately in its due course this taste is to become critical and selfconscious but at first it is to exist purely as a cultivated instinct and he who has received this true culture of the inner man will with clear and certain vision perceive the omissions and faults in art or nature and with a taste that cannot err while he praises and finds his pleasure in what is good and receives it into his soul and so becomes good and noble he will rightly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why  and so when later on the critical and selfconscious spirit develops in him he will recognise and salute it as a friend with whom his education has made him long familiar  i need hardly say ernest how far we in england have fallen short of this ideal and i can imagine the smile that would illuminate the glossy face of the philistine if one ventured to suggest to him that the true aim of education was the love of beauty and that the methods by which education should work were the development of temperament the cultivation of taste and the creation of the critical spirit  yet even for us there is left some loveliness of environment and the dulness of tutors and professors matters very little when one can loiter in the grey cloisters at magdalen and listen to some flutelike voice singing in waynfleetes chapel or lie in the green meadow among the strange snakespotted fritillaries and watch the sunburnt noon smite to a finer gold the towers gilded vanes or wander up the christ church staircase beneath the vaulted ceilings shadowy fans or pass through the sculptured gateway of lauds building in the college of st john  nor is it merely at oxford or cambridge that the sense of beauty can be formed and trained and perfected  all over england there is a renaissance of the decorative arts  ugliness has had its day  even in the houses of the rich there is taste and the houses of those who are not rich have been made gracious and comely and sweet to live in caliban poor noisy caliban thinks that when he has ceased to make mows at a thing the thing ceases to exist  but if he mocks no longer it is because he has been met with mockery swifter and keener than his own and for a moment has been bitterly schooled into that silence which should seal for ever his uncouth distorted lips  what has been done up to now has been chiefly in the clearing of the way  it is always more difficult to destroy than it is to create and when what one has to destroy is vulgarity and stupidity the task of destruction needs not merely courage but also contempt  yet it seems to me to have been in a measure done  we have got rid of what was bad  we have now to make what is beautiful  and though the mission of the aesthetic movement is to lure people to contemplate not to lead them to create yet as the creative instinct is strong in the celt and it is the celt who leads in art there is no reason why in future years this strange renaissance should not become almost as mighty in its way as was that new birth of art that woke many centuries ago in the cities of italy  certainly for the cultivation of temperament we must turn to the decorative arts  to the arts that touch us not to the arts that teach us  modern pictures are no doubt delightful to look at at least some of them are  but they are quite impossible to live with they are too clever too assertive too intellectual  their meaning is too obvious and their method too clearly defined  one exhausts what they have to say in a very short time and then they become as tedious as ones relations  i am very fond of the work of many of the impressionist painters of paris and london subtlety and distinction have not yet left the school  some of their arrangements and harmonies serve to remind one of the unapproachable beauty of gautiers immortal symphonie en blanc majeur that flawless masterpiece of colour and music which may have suggested the type as well as the titles of many of their best pictures  for a class that welcomes the incompetent with sympathetic eagerness and that confuses the bizarre with the beautiful and vulgarity with truth they are extremely accomplished  they can do etchings that have the brilliancy of epigrams pastels that are as fascinating as paradoxes and as for their portraits whatever the commonplace may say against them no one can deny that they possess that unique and wonderful charm which belongs to works of pure fiction  but even the impressionists earnest and industrious as they are will not do i like them  their white keynote with its variations in lilac was an era in colour  though the moment does not make the man the moment certainly makes the impressionist and for the moment in art and the moments monument as rossetti phrased it what may not be said  they are suggestive also  if they have not opened the eyes of the blind they have at least given great encouragement to the shortsighted and while their leaders may have all the inexperience of old age their young men are far too wise to be ever sensible  yet they will insist on treating painting as if it were a mode of autobiography invented for the use of the illiterate and are always prating to us on their coarse gritty canvases of their unnecessary selves and their unnecessary opinions and spoiling by a vulgar overemphasis that fine contempt of nature which is the best and only modest thing about them  one tires at the end of the work of individuals whose individuality is always noisy and generally uninteresting  there is far more to be said in favour of that newer school at paris the archaicistes as they call themselves who refusing to leave the artist entirely at the mercy of the weather do not find the ideal of art in mere atmospheric effect but seek rather for the imaginative beauty of design and the loveliness of fair colour and rejecting the tedious realism of those who merely paint what they see try to see something worth seeing and to see it not merely with actual and physical vision but with that nobler vision of the soul which is as far wider in spiritual scope as it is far more splendid in artistic purpose  they at any rate work under those decorative conditions that each art requires for its perfection and have sufficient aesthetic instinct to regret those sordid and stupid limitations of absolute modernity of form which have proved the ruin of so many of the impressionists  still the art that is frankly decorative is the art to live with  it is of all our visible arts the one art that creates in us both mood and temperament  mere colour unspoiled by meaning and unallied with definite form can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways the harmony that resides in the delicate proportions of lines and masses becomes mirrored in the mind  the repetitions of pattern give us rest  the marvels of design stir the imagination  in the mere loveliness of the materials employed there are latent elements of culture  nor is this all  by its deliberate rejection of nature as the ideal of beauty as well as of the imitative method of the ordinary painter decorative art not merely prepares the soul for the reception of true imaginative work but develops in it that sense of form which is the basis of creative no less than of critical achievement  for the real artist is he who proceeds not from feeling to form but from form to thought and passion  he does not first conceive an idea and then say to himself i will put my idea into a complex metre of fourteen lines but realising the beauty of the sonnetscheme he conceives certain modes of music and methods of rhyme and the mere form suggests what is to fill it and make it intellectually and emotionally complete  from time to time the world cries out against some charming artistic poet because to use its hackneyed and silly phrase he has nothing to say  but if he had something to say he would probably say it and the result would be tedious  it is just because he has no new message that he can do beautiful work  he gains his inspiration from form and from form purely as an artist should  a real passion would ruin him  whatever actually occurs is spoiled for art  all bad poetry springs from genuine feeling to be natural is to be obvious and to be obvious is to be inartistic  ernest  i wonder do you really believe what you say  gilbert  why should you wonder  it is not merely in art that the body is the soul  in every sphere of life form is the beginning of things  the rhythmic harmonious gestures of dancing convey plato tells us both rhythm and harmony into the mind  forms are the food of faith cried newman in one of those great moments of sincerity that make us admire and know the man  he was right though he may not have known how terribly right he was  the creeds are believed not because they are rational but because they are repeated  yes  form is everything  it is the secret of life find expression for a sorrow and it will become dear to you  find expression for a joy and you intensify its ecstasy  do you wish to love  use loves litany and the words will create the yearning from which the world fancies that they spring  have you a grief that corrodes your heart  steep yourself in the language of grief learn its utterance from prince hamlet and queen constance and you will find that mere expression is a mode of consolation and that form which is the birth of passion is also the death of pain and so to return to the sphere of art it is form that creates not merely the critical temperament but also the aesthetic instinct that unerring instinct that reveals to one all things under their conditions of beauty  start with the worship of form and there is no secret in art that will not be revealed to you and remember that in criticism as in creation temperament is everything and that it is not by the time of their production but by the temperaments to which they appeal that the schools of art should be historically grouped  ernest  your theory of education is delightful  but what influence will your critic brought up in these exquisite surroundings possess  do you really think that any artist is ever affected by criticism  gilbert  the influence of the critic will be the mere fact of his own existence  he will represent the flawless type  in him the culture of the century will see itself realised  you must not ask of him to have any aim other than the perfecting of himself  the demand of the intellect as has been well said is simply to feel itself alive  the critic may indeed desire to exercise influence but if so he will concern himself not with the individual but with the age which he will seek to wake into consciousness and to make responsive creating in it new desires and appetites and lending it his larger vision and his nobler moods  the actual art of today will occupy him less than the art of tomorrow far less than the art of yesterday and as for this or that person at present toiling away what do the industrious matter  they do their best no doubt and consequently we get the worst from them  it is always with the best intentions that the worst work is done  and besides my dear ernest when a man reaches the age of forty or becomes a royal academician or is elected a member of the athenaeum club or is recognised as a popular novelist whose books are in great demand at suburban railway stations one may have the amusement of exposing him but one cannot have the pleasure of reforming him  and this is i dare say very fortunate for him for i have no doubt that reformation is a much more painful process than punishment is indeed punishment in its most aggravated and moral forma fact which accounts for our entire failure as a community to reclaim that interesting phenomenon who is called the confirmed criminal  ernest  but may it not be that the poet is the best judge of poetry and the painter of painting  each art must appeal primarily to the artist who works in it  his judgment will surely be the most valuable  gilbert  the appeal of all art is simply to the artistic temperament  art does not address herself to the specialist  her claim is that she is universal and that in all her manifestations she is one  indeed so far from its being true that the artist is the best judge of art a really great artist can never judge of other peoples work at all and can hardly in fact judge of his own  that very concentration of vision that makes a man an artist limits by its sheer intensity his faculty of fine appreciation the energy of creation hurries him blindly on to his own goal  the wheels of his chariot raise the dust as a cloud around him  the gods are hidden from each other  they can recognise their worshippers  that is all  ernest  you say that a great artist cannot recognise the beauty of work different from his own  gilbert  it is impossible for him to do so  wordsworth saw in endymion merely a pretty piece of paganism and shelley with his dislike of actuality was deaf to wordsworths message being repelled by its form and byron that great passionate human incomplete creature could appreciate neither the poet of the cloud nor the poet of the lake and the wonder of keats was hidden from him  the realism of euripides was hateful to sophokles  those droppings of warm tears had no music for him  milton with his sense of the grand style could not understand the method of shakespeare any more than could sir joshua the method of gainsborough  bad artists always admire each others work  they call it being largeminded and free from prejudice  but a truly great artist cannot conceive of life being shown or beauty fashioned under any conditions other than those that he has selected  creation employs all its critical faculty within its own sphere  it may not use it in the sphere that belongs to others it is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the proper judge of it  ernest  do you really mean that  gilbert  yes for creation limits while contemplation widens the vision  ernest  but what about technique  surely each art has its separate technique  gilbert  certainly  each art has its grammar and its materials there is no mystery about either and the incompetent can always be correct  but while the laws upon which art rests may be fixed and certain to find their true realisation they must be touched by the imagination into such beauty that they will seem an exception each one of them  technique is really personality  that is the reason why the artist cannot teach it why the pupil cannot learn it and why the aesthetic critic can understand it  to the great poet there is only one method of musichis own  to the great painter there is only one manner of paintingthat which he himself employs  the aesthetic critic and the aesthetic critic alone can appreciate all forms and modes  it is to him that art makes her appeal  ernest  well i think i have put all my questions to you  and now i must admit   gilbert  ah dont say that you agree with me  when people agree with me i always feel that i must be wrong  ernest  in that case i certainly wont tell you whether i agree with you or not  but i will put another question  you have explained to me that criticism is a creative art  what future has it  gilbert  it is to criticism that the future belongs  the subject matter at the disposal of creation becomes every day more limited in extent and variety  providence and mr walter besant have exhausted the obvious  if creation is to last at all it can only do so on the condition of becoming far more critical than it is at present  the old roads and dusty highways have been traversed too often  their charm has been worn away by plodding feet and they have lost that element of novelty or surprise which is so essential for romance  he who would stir us now by fiction must either give us an entirely new background or reveal to us the soul of man in its innermost workings  the first is for the moment being done for us by mr rudyard kipling  as one turns over the pages of his plain tales from the hills one feels as if one were seated under a palmtree reading life by superb flashes of vulgarity  the bright colours of the bazaars dazzle ones eyes  the jaded secondrate angloindians are in exquisite incongruity with their surroundings the mere lack of style in the storyteller gives an odd journalistic realism to what he tells us  from the point of view of literature mr kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates from the point of view of life he is a reporter who knows vulgarity better than any one has ever known it  dickens knew its clothes and its comedy  mr kipling knows its essence and its seriousness  he is our first authority on the secondrate and has seen marvellous things through keyholes and his backgrounds are real works of art  as for the second condition we have had browning and meredith is with us  but there is still much to be done in the sphere of introspection  people sometimes say that fiction is getting too morbid  as far as psychology is concerned it has never been morbid enough  we have merely touched the surface of the soul that is all  in one single ivory cell of the brain there are stored away things more marvellous and more terrible than even they have dreamed of who like the author of le rouge et le noir have sought to track the soul into its most secret places and to make life confess its dearest sins  still there is a limit even to the number of untried backgrounds and it is possible that a further development of the habit of introspection may prove fatal to that creative faculty to which it seeks to supply fresh material  i myself am inclined to think that creation is doomed  it springs from too primitive too natural an impulse  however this may be it is certain that the subject matter at the disposal of creation is always diminishing while the subjectmatter of criticism increases daily  there are always new attitudes for the mind and new points of view  the duty of imposing form upon chaos does not grow less as the world advances there was never a time when criticism was more needed than it is now  it is only by its means that humanity can become conscious of the point at which it has arrived  hours ago ernest you asked me the use of criticism  you might just as well have asked me the use of thought  it is criticism as arnold points out that creates the intellectual atmosphere of the age  it is criticism as i hope to point out myself some day that makes the mind a fine instrument  we in our educational system have burdened the memory with a load of unconnected facts and laboriously striven to impart our laboriouslyacquired knowledge we teach people how to remember we never teach them how to grow it has never occurred to us to try and develop in the mind a more subtle quality of apprehension and discernment  the greeks did this and when we come in contact with the greek critical intellect we cannot but be conscious that while our subject matter is in every respect larger and more varied than theirs theirs is the only method by which this subjectmatter can be interpreted  england has done one thing it has invented and established public opinion which is an attempt to organise the ignorance of the community and to elevate it to the dignity of physical force  but wisdom has always been hidden from it considered as an instrument of thought the english mind is coarse and undeveloped  the only thing that can purify it is the growth of the critical instinct  it is criticism again that by concentration makes culture possible  it takes the cumbersome mass of creative work and distils it into a finer essence  who that desires to retain any sense of form could struggle through the monstrous multitudinous books that the world has produced books in which thought stammers or ignorance brawls  the thread that is to guide us across the wearisome labyrinth is in the hands of criticism  nay more where there is no record and history is either lost or was never written criticism can recreate the past for us from the very smallest fragment of language or art just as surely as the man of science can from some tiny bone or the mere impress of a foot upon a rock recreate for us the winged dragon or titan lizard that once made the earth shake beneath its tread can call behemoth out of his cave and make leviathan swim once more across the startled sea  prehistoric history belongs to the philological and archaeological critic  it is to him that the origins of things are revealed  the selfconscious deposits of an age are nearly always misleading  through philological criticism alone we know more of the centuries of which no actual record has been preserved than we do of the centuries that have left us their scrolls  it can do for us what can be done neither by physics nor metaphysics  it can give us the exact science of mind in the process of becoming  it can do for us what history cannot do  it can tell us what man thought before he learned how to write  you have asked me about the influence of criticism  i think i have answered that question already but there is this also to be said  it is criticism that makes us cosmopolitan  the manchester school tried to make men realise the brotherhood of humanity by pointing out the commercial advantages of peace  it sought to degrade the wonderful world into a common marketplace for the buyer and the seller  it addressed itself to the lowest instincts and it failed  war followed upon war and the tradesmans creed did not prevent france and germany from clashing together in bloodstained battle  there are others of our own day who seek to appeal to mere emotional sympathies or to the shallow dogmas of some vague system of abstract ethics they have their peace societies so dear to the sentimentalists and their proposals for unarmed international arbitration so popular among those who have never read history  but mere emotional sympathy will not do  it is too variable and too closely connected with the passions and a board of arbitrators who for the general welfare of the race are to be deprived of the power of putting their decisions into execution will not be of much avail  there is only one thing worse than injustice and that is justice without her sword in her hand  when right is not might it is evil  no  the emotions will not make us cosmopolitan any more than the greed for gain could do so  it is only by the cultivation of the habit of intellectual criticism that we shall be able to rise superior to raceprejudices  goetheyou will not misunderstand what i saywas a german of the germans  he loved his countryno man more so  its people were dear to him and he led them  yet when the iron hoof of napoleon trampled upon vineyard and cornfield his lips were silent  how can one write songs of hatred without hating he said to eckermann and how could i to whom culture and barbarism are alone of importance hate a nation which is among the most cultivated of the earth and to which i owe so great a part of my own cultivation  this note sounded in the modern world by goethe first will become i think the starting point for the cosmopolitanism of the future  criticism will annihilate raceprejudices by insisting upon the unity of the human mind in the variety of its forms  if we are tempted to make war upon another nation we shall remember that we are seeking to destroy an element of our own culture and possibly its most important element  as long as war is regarded as wicked it will always have its fascination  when it is looked upon as vulgar it will cease to be popular  the change will of course be slow and people will not be conscious of it  they will not say we will not war against france because her prose is perfect but because the prose of france is perfect they will not hate the land intellectual criticism will bind europe together in bonds far closer than those that can be forged by shopman or sentimentalist it will give us the peace that springs from understanding  nor is this all  it is criticism that recognising no position as final and refusing to bind itself by the shallow shibboleths of any sect or school creates that serene philosophic temper which loves truth for its own sake and loves it not the less because it knows it to be unattainable  how little we have of this temper in england and how much we need it  the english mind is always in a rage  the intellect of the race is wasted in the sordid and stupid quarrels of secondrate politicians or thirdrate theologians  it was reserved for a man of science to show us the supreme example of that sweet reasonableness of which arnold spoke so wisely and alas to so little effect  the author of the origin of species had at any rate the philosophic temper  if one contemplates the ordinary pulpits and platforms of england one can but feel the contempt of julian or the indifference of montaigne  we are dominated by the fanatic whose worst vice is his sincerity anything approaching to the free play of the mind is practically unknown amongst us  people cry out against the sinner yet it is not the sinful but the stupid who are our shame  there is no sin except stupidity  ernest  ah what an antinomian you are  gilbert  the artistic critic like the mystic is an antinomian always  to be good according to the vulgar standard of goodness is obviously quite easy  it merely requires a certain amount of sordid terror a certain lack of imaginative thought and a certain low passion for middleclass respectability  aesthetics are higher than ethics  they belong to a more spiritual sphere  to discern the beauty of a thing is the finest point to which we can arrive even a coloursense is more important in the development of the individual than a sense of right and wrong  aesthetics in fact are to ethics in the sphere of conscious civilisation what in the sphere of the external world sexual is to natural selection ethics like natural selection make existence possible aesthetics like sexual selection make life lovely and wonderful fill it with new forms and give it progress and variety and change  and when we reach the true culture that is our aim we attain to that perfection of which the saints have dreamed the perfection of those to whom sin is impossible not because they make the renunciations of the ascetic but because they can do everything they wish without hurt to the soul and can wish for nothing that can do the soul harm the soul being an entity so divine that it is able to transform into elements of a richer experience or a finer susceptibility or a newer mode of thought acts or passions that with the common would be commonplace or with the uneducated ignoble or with the shameful vile  is this dangerous  yes it is dangerousall ideas as i told you are so but the night wearies and the light flickers in the lamp  one more thing i cannot help saying to you  you have spoken against criticism as being a sterile thing  the nineteenth century is a turning point in history simply on account of the work of two men darwin and renan the one the critic of the book of nature the other the critic of the books of god  not to recognise this is to miss the meaning of one of the most important eras in the progress of the world  creation is always behind the age  it is criticism that leads us  the critical spirit and the worldspirit are one  ernest  and he who is in possession of this spirit or whom this spirit possesses will i suppose do nothing  gilbert  like the persephone of whom landor tells us the sweet pensive persephone around whose white feet the asphodel and amaranth are blooming he will sit contented in that deep motionless quiet which mortals pity and which the gods enjoy  he will look out upon the world and know its secret  by contact with divine things he will become divine  his will be the perfect life and his only  ernest  you have told me many strange things tonight gilbert you have told me that it is more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it and that to do nothing at all is the most difficult thing in the world you have told me that all art is immoral and all thought dangerous that criticism is more creative than creation and that the highest criticism is that which reveals in the work of art what the artist had not put there that it is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the proper judge of it and that the true critic is unfair insincere and not rational  my friend you are a dreamer  gilbert  yes  i am a dreamer  for a dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world  ernest  his punishment  gilbert  and his reward  but see it is dawn already  draw back the curtains and open the windows wide  how cool the morning air is  piccadilly lies at our feet like a long riband of silver  a faint purple mist hangs over the park and the shadows of the white houses are purple  it is too late to sleep  let us go down to covent garden and look at the roses  come  i am tired of thought    the truth of masksa note on illusion    in many of the somewhat violent attacks that have recently been made on that splendour of mounting which now characterises our shakespearian revivals in england it seems to have been tacitly assumed by the critics that shakespeare himself was more or less indifferent to the costumes of his actors and that could he see mrs langtrys production of antony and cleopatra he would probably say that the play and the play only is the thing and that everything else is leather and prunella  while as regards any historical accuracy in dress lord lytton in an article in the nineteenth century has laid it down as a dogma of art that archaeology is entirely out of place in the presentation of any of shakespeares plays and the attempt to introduce it one of the stupidest pedantries of an age of prigs  lord lyttons position i shall examine later on but as regards the theory that shakespeare did not busy himself much about the costumewardrobe of his theatre anybody who cares to study shakespeares method will see that there is absolutely no dramatist of the french english or athenian stage who relies so much for his illusionist effects on the dress of his actors as shakespeare does himself  knowing how the artistic temperament is always fascinated by beauty of costume he constantly introduces into his plays masques and dances purely for the sake of the pleasure which they give the eye and we have still his stagedirections for the three great processions in henry the eighth directions which are characterised by the most extraordinary elaborateness of detail down to the collars of ss and the pearls in anne boleyns hair  indeed it would be quite easy for a modern manager to reproduce these pageants absolutely as shakespeare had them designed and so accurate were they that one of the court officials of the time writing an account of the last performance of the play at the globe theatre to a friend actually complains of their realistic character notably of the production on the stage of the knights of the garter in the robes and insignia of the order as being calculated to bring ridicule on the real ceremonies much in the same spirit in which the french government some time ago prohibited that delightful actor m christian from appearing in uniform on the plea that it was prejudicial to the glory of the army that a colonel should be caricatured  and elsewhere the gorgeousness of apparel which distinguished the english stage under shakespeares influence was attacked by the contemporary critics not as a rule however on the grounds of the democratic tendencies of realism but usually on those moral grounds which are always the last refuge of people who have no sense of beauty  the point however which i wish to emphasise is not that shakespeare appreciated the value of lovely costumes in adding picturesqueness to poetry but that he saw how important costume is as a means of producing certain dramatic effects  many of his plays such as measure for measure twelfth night the two gentleman of verona alls well that ends well cymbeline and others depend for their illusion on the character of the various dresses worn by the hero or the heroine the delightful scene in henry the sixth on the modern miracles of healing by faith loses all its point unless gloster is in black and scarlet and the denoument of the merry wives of windsor hinges on the colour of anne pages gown  as for the uses shakespeare makes of disguises the instances are almost numberless  posthumus hides his passion under a peasants garb and edgar his pride beneath an idiots rags portia wears the apparel of a lawyer and rosalind is attired in all points as a man the cloakbag of pisanio changes imogen to the youth fidele jessica flees from her fathers house in boys dress and julia ties up her yellow hair in fantastic loveknots and dons hose and doublet henry the eighth woos his lady as a shepherd and romeo his as a pilgrim prince hal and poins appear first as footpads in buckram suits and then in white aprons and leather jerkins as the waiters in a tavern  and as for falstaff does he not come on as a highwayman as an old woman as herne the hunter and as the clothes going to the laundry  nor are the examples of the employment of costume as a mode of intensifying dramatic situation less numerous  after slaughter of duncan macbeth appears in his nightgown as if aroused from sleep timon ends in rags the play he had begun in splendour richard flatters the london citizens in a suit of mean and shabby armour and as soon as he has stepped in blood to the throne marches through the streets in crown and george and garter the climax of the tempest is reached when prospero throwing off his enchanters robes sends ariel for his hat and rapier and reveals himself as the great italian duke the very ghost in hamlet changes his mystical apparel to produce different effects and as for juliet a modern playwright would probably have laid her out in her shroud and made the scene a scene of horror merely but shakespeare arrays her in rich and gorgeous raiment whose loveliness makes the vault a feasting presence full of light turns the tomb into a bridal chamber and gives the cue and motive for romeos speech of the triumph of beauty over death  even small details of dress such as the colour of a majordomos stockings the pattern on a wifes handkerchief the sleeve of a young soldier and a fashionable womans bonnets become in shakespeares hands points of actual dramatic importance and by some of them the action of the play in question is conditioned absolutely  many other dramatists have availed themselves of costume as a method of expressing directly to the audience the character of a person on his entrance though hardly so brilliantly as shakespeare has done in the case of the dandy parolles whose dress by the way only an archaeologist can understand the fun of a master and servant exchanging coats in presence of the audience of shipwrecked sailors squabbling over the division of a lot of fine clothes and of a tinker dressed up like a duke while he is in his cups may be regarded as part of that great career which costume has always played in comedy from the time of aristophanes down to mr gilbert but nobody from the mere details of apparel and adornment has ever drawn such irony of contrast such immediate and tragic effect such pity and such pathos as shakespeare himself  armed capapie the dead king stalks on the battlements of elsinore because all is not right with denmark shylocks jewish gaberdine is part of the stigma under which that wounded and embittered nature writhes arthur begging for his life can think of no better plea than the handkerchief he had given hubert    have you the heart when your head did but ache i knit my handkerchief about your brows the best i had a princess wrought it me and i did never ask it you again   and orlandos bloodstained napkin strikes the first sombre note in that exquisite woodland idyll and shows us the depth of feeling that underlies rosalinds fanciful wit and wilful jesting   last night twas on my arm i kissed it i hope it be not gone to tell my lord that i kiss aught but he   says imogen jesting on the loss of the bracelet which was already on its way to rome to rob her of her husbands faith the little prince passing to the tower plays with the dagger in his uncles girdle duncan sends a ring to lady macbeth on the night of his own murder and the ring of portia turns the tragedy of the merchant into a wifes comedy  the great rebel york dies with a paper crown on his head hamlets black suit is a kind of colourmotive in the piece like the mourning of the chimene in the cid and the climax of antonys speech is the production of caesars cloak   i remember the first time ever caesar put it on twas on a summers evening in his tent the day he overcame the nervii look in this place ran cassius dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the wellbeloved brutus stabbed    kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesars vesture wounded   the flowers which ophelia carries with her in her madness are as pathetic as the violets that blossom on a grave the effect of lears wandering on the heath is intensified beyond words by his fantastic attire and when cloten stung by the taunt of that simile which his sister draws from her husbands raiment arrays himself in that husbands very garb to work upon her the deed of shame we feel that there is nothing in the whole of modern french realism nothing even in therese raquin that masterpiece of horror which for terrible and tragic significance can compare with this strange scene in cymbeline  in the actual dialogue also some of the most vivid passages are those suggested by costume  rosalinds   dost thou think though i am caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in my disposition   constances   grief fills the place of my absent child stuffs out his vacant garments with his form   and the quick sharp cry of elizabeth    ah cut my lace asunder    are only a few of the many examples one might quote  one of the finest effects i have ever seen on the stage was salvini in the last act of lear tearing the plume from kents cap and applying it to cordelias lips when he came to the line   this feather stirs she lives   mr booth whose lear had many noble qualities of passion plucked i remember some fur from his archaeologicallyincorrect ermine for the same business but salvinis was the finer effect of the two as well as the truer  and those who saw mr irving in the last act of richard the third have not i am sure forgotten how much the agony and terror of his dream was intensified by contrast through the calm and quiet that preceded it and the delivery of such lines as   what is my beaver easier than it was and all my armour laid into my tent look that my staves be sound and not too heavy    lines which had a double meaning for the audience remembering the last words which richards mother called after him as he was marching to bosworth   therefore take with thee my most grievous curse which in the day of battle tire thee more than all the complete armour that thou wearst   as regards the resources which shakespeare had at his disposal it is to be remarked that while he more than once complains of the smallness of the stage on which he has to produce big historical plays and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many effective openair incidents he always writes as a dramatist who had at his disposal a most elaborate theatrical wardrobe and who could rely on the actors taking pains about their makeup  even now it is difficult to produce such a play as the comedy of errors and to the picturesque accident of miss ellen terrys brother resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing twelfth night adequately performed  indeed to put any play of shakespeares on the stage absolutely as he himself wished it to be done requires the services of a good propertyman a clever wigmaker a costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures a master of the methods of makingup a fencingmaster a dancing master and an artist to direct personally the whole production for he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of each character  racine abhorre la realite says auguste vacquerie somewhere il ne daigne pas soccuper de son costume  si lon sen rapportait aux indications du poete agamemnon serait vetu dun sceptre et achille dune epee  but with shakespeare it is very different  he gives us directions about the costumes of perdita florizel autolycus the witches in macbeth and the apothecary in romeo and juliet several elaborate descriptions of his fat knight and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in which petruchio is to be married  rosalind he tells us is tall and is to carry a spear and a little dagger celia is smaller and is to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt  the children who play at fairies in windsor forest are to be dressed in white and greena compliment by the way to queen elizabeth whose favourite colours they wereand in white with green garlands and gilded vizors the angels are to come to katherine in kimbolton bottom is in homespun lysander is distinguished from oberon by his wearing an athenian dress and launce has holes in his boots  the duchess of gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband in mourning beside her  the motley of the fool the scarlet of the cardinal and the french lilies broidered on the english coats are all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue  we know the patterns on the dauphins armour and the pucelles sword the crest on warwicks helmet and the colour of bardolphs nose  portia has golden hair phoebe is blackhaired orlando has chestnut curls and sir andrew aguecheeks hair hangs like flax on a distaff and wont curl at all  some of the characters are stout some lean some straight some hunchbacked some fair some dark and some are to blacken their faces  lear has a white beard hamlets father a grizzled and benedick is to shave his in the course of the play indeed on the subject of stage beards shakespeare is quite elaborate tells us of the many different colours in use and gives a hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on there is a dance of reapers in ryestraw hats and of rustics in hairy coats like satyrs a masque of amazons a masque of russians and a classical masque several immortal scenes over a weaver in an asss head a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the lord mayor of london to quell and a scene between an infuriated husband and his wifes milliner about the slashing of a sleeve  as for the metaphors shakespeare draws from dress and the aphorisms he makes on it his hits at the costume of his age particularly at the ridiculous size of the ladies bonnets and the many descriptions of the mundus muliebris from the long of autolycus in the winters tale down to the account of the duchess of milans gown in much ado about nothing they are far too numerous to quote though it may be worth while to remind people that the whole of the philosophy of clothes is to be found in lears scene with edgara passage which has the advantage of brevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing metaphysics of sartor resartus  but i think that from what i have already said it is quite clear that shakespeare was very much interested in costume  i do not mean in that shallow sense by which it has been concluded from his knowledge of deeds and daffodils that he was the blackstone and paxton of the elizabethan age but that he saw that costume could be made at once impressive of a certain effect on the audience and expressive of certain types of character and is one of the essential factors of the means which a true illusionist has at his disposal  indeed to him the deformed figure of richard was of as much value as juliets loveliness he sets the serge of the radical beside the silks of the lord and sees the stage effects to be got from each  he has as much delight in caliban as he has in ariel in rags as he has in cloth of gold and recognises the artistic beauty of ugliness  the difficulty ducis felt about translating othello in consequence of the importance given to such a vulgar thing as a handkerchief and his attempt to soften its grossness by making the moor reiterate le bandeau le bandeau may be taken as an example of the difference between la tragedie philosophique and the drama of real life and the introduction for the first time of the word mouchoir at the theatre francais was an era in that romantic realistic movement of which hugo is the father and m zola the enfant terrible just as the classicism of the earlier part of the century was emphasised by talmas refusal to play greek heroes any longer in a powdered periwigone of the many instances by the way of that desire for archaeological accuracy in dress which has distinguished the great actors of our age  in criticising the importance given to money in la comedie humaine theophile gautier says that balzac may claim to have invented a new hero in fiction le heros metallique  of shakespeare it may be said he was the first to see the dramatic value of doublets and that a climax may depend on a crinoline  the burning of the globe theatrean event due by the way to the results of the passion for illusion that distinguished shakespeares stagemanagementhas unfortunately robbed us of many important documents but in the inventory still in existence of the costumewardrobe of a london theatre in shakespeares time there are mentioned particular costumes for cardinals shepherds kings clowns friars and fools green coats for robin hoods men and a green gown for maid marian a white and gold doublet for henry the fifth and a robe for longshanks besides surplices copes damask gowns gowns of cloth of gold and of cloth of silver taffeta gowns calico gowns velvet coats satin coats frieze coats jerkins of yellow leather and of black leather red suits grey suits french pierrot suits a robe for to goo invisibell which seems inexpensive at 3 pounds 10s and four incomparable fardingalesall of which show a desire to give every character an appropriate dress  there are also entries of spanish moorish and danish costumes of helmets lances painted shields imperial crowns and papal tiaras as well as of costumes for turkish janissaries roman senators and all the gods and goddesses of olympus which evidence a good deal of archaeological research on the part of the manager of the theatre  it is true that there is a mention of a bodice for eve but probably the donnee of the play was after the fall  indeed anybody who cares to examine the age of shakespeare will see that archaeology was one of its special characteristics  after that revival of the classical forms of architecture which was one of the notes of the renaissance and the printing at venice and elsewhere of the masterpieces of greek and latin literature had come naturally an interest in the ornamentation and costume of the antique world  nor was it for the learning that they could acquire but rather for the loveliness that they might create that the artists studied these things  the curious objects that were being constantly brought to light by excavations were not left to moulder in a museum for the contemplation of a callous curator and the ennui of a policeman bored by the absence of crime  they were used as motives for the production of a new art which was to be not beautiful merely but also strange  infessura tells us that in 1485 some workmen digging on the appian way came across an old roman sarcophagus inscribed with the name julia daughter of claudius  on opening the coffer they found within its marble womb the body of a beautiful girl of about fifteen years of age preserved by the embalmers skill from corruption and the decay of time  her eyes were half open her hair rippled round her in crisp curling gold and from her lips and cheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet departed  borne back to the capitol she became at once the centre of a new cult and from all parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at the wonderful shrine till the pope fearing lest those who had found the secret of beauty in a pagan tomb might forget what secrets judaeas rough and rockhewn sepulchre contained had the body conveyed away by night and in secret buried  legend though it may be yet the story is none the less valuable as showing us the attitude of the renaissance towards the antique world  archaeology to them was not a mere science for the antiquarian it was a means by which they could touch the dry dust of antiquity into the very breath and beauty of life and fill with the new wine of romanticism forms that else had been old and outworn  from the pulpit of niccola pisano down to mantegnas triumph of caesar and the service cellini designed for king francis the influence of this spirit can be traced nor was it confined merely to the immobile artsthe arts of arrested movementbut its influence was to be seen also in the great graecoroman masques which were the constant amusement of the gay courts of the time and in the public pomps and processions with which the citizens of big commercial towns were wont to greet the princes that chanced to visit them pageants by the way which were considered so important that large prints were made of them and publisheda fact which is a proof of the general interest at the time in matters of such kind  and this use of archaeology in shows so far from being a bit of priggish pedantry is in every way legitimate and beautiful  for the stage is not merely the meetingplace of all the arts but is also the return of art to life  sometimes in an archaeological novel the use of strange and obsolete terms seems to hide the reality beneath the learning and i dare say that many of the readers of notre dame de paris have been much puzzled over the meaning of such expressions as la casaque a mahoitres les voulgiers le gallimard tache dencre les craaquiniers and the like but with the stage how different it is  the ancient world wakes from its sleep and history moves as a pageant before our eyes without obliging us to have recourse to a dictionary or an encyclopaedia for the perfection of our enjoyment  indeed there is not the slightest necessity that the public should know the authorities for the mounting of any piece  from such materials for instance as the disk of theodosius materials with which the majority of people are probably not very familiar mr e w godwin one of the most artistic spirits of this century in england created the marvellous loveliness of the first act of claudian and showed us the life of byzantium in the fourth century not by a dreary lecture and a set of grimy casts not by a novel which requires a glossary to explain it but by the visible presentation before us of all the glory of that great town  and while the costumes were true to the smallest points of colour and design yet the details were not assigned that abnormal importance which they must necessarily be given in a piecemeal lecture but were subordinated to the rules of lofty composition and the unity of artistic effect  mr symonds speaking of that great picture of mantegnas now in hampton court says that the artist has converted an antiquarian motive into a theme for melodies of line the same could have been said with equal justice of mr godwins scene  only the foolish called it pedantry only those who would neither look nor listen spoke of the passion of the play being killed by its paint  it was in reality a scene not merely perfect in its picturesqueness but absolutely dramatic also getting rid of any necessity for tedious descriptions and showing us by the colour and character of claudians dress and the dress of his attendants the whole nature and life of the man from what school of philosophy he affected down to what horses he backed on the turf  and indeed archaeology is only really delightful when transfused into some form of art  i have no desire to underrate the services of laborious scholars but i feel that the use keats made of lemprieres dictionary is of far more value to us than professor max mullers treatment of the same mythology as a disease of language  better endymion than any theory however sound or as in the present instance unsound of an epidemic among adjectives and who does not feel that the chief glory of piranesis book on vases is that it gave keats the suggestion for his ode on a grecian urn  art and art only can make archaeology beautiful and the theatric art can use it most directly and most vividly for it can combine in one exquisite presentation the illusion of actual life with the wonder of the unreal world  but the sixteenth century was not merely the age of vitruvius it was the age of vecellio also  every nation seems suddenly to have become interested in the dress of its neighbours  europe began to investigate its own clothes and the amount of books published on national costumes is quite extraordinary  at the beginning of the century the nuremberg chronicle with its two thousand illustrations reached its fifth edition and before the century was over seventeen editions were published of munsters cosmography  besides these two books there were also the works of michael colyns of hans weigel of amman and of vecellio himself all of them well illustrated some of the drawings in vecellio being probably from the hand of titian  nor was it merely from books and treatises that they acquired their knowledge  the development of the habit of foreign travel the increased commercial intercourse between countries and the frequency of diplomatic missions gave every nation many opportunities of studying the various forms of contemporary dress after the departure from england for instance of the ambassadors from the czar the sultan and the prince of morocco henry the eighth and his friends gave several masques in the strange attire of their visitors  later on london saw perhaps too often the sombre splendour of the spanish court and to elizabeth came envoys from all lands whose dress shakespeare tells us had an important influence on english costume  and the interest was not confined merely to classical dress or the dress of foreign nations there was also a good deal of research amongst theatrical people especially into the ancient costume of england itself  and when shakespeare in the prologue to one of his plays expresses his regret at being unable to produce helmets of the period he is speaking as an elizabethan manager and not merely as an elizabethan poet  at cambridge for instance during his day a play of richard the third was performed in which the actors were attired in real dresses of the time procured from the great collection of historical costume in the tower which was always open to the inspection of managers and sometimes placed at their disposal  and i cannot help thinking that this performance must have been far more artistic as regards costume than garricks mounting of shakespeares own play on the subject in which he himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress and everybody else in the costume of the time of george the third richmond especially being much admired in the uniform of a young guardsman  for what is the use to the stage of that archaeology which has so strangely terrified the critics but that it and it alone can give us the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which the action of the play passes  it enables us to see a greek dressed like a greek and an italian like an italian to enjoy the arcades of venice and the balconies of verona and if the play deals with any of the great eras in our countrys history to contemplate the age in its proper attire and the king in his habit as he lived  and i wonder by the way what lord lytton would have said some time ago at the princesss theatre had the curtain risen on his fathers brutus reclining in a queen anne chair attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressinggown a costume which in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to an antique roman  for in those halcyon days of the drama no archaeology troubled the stage or distressed the critics and our inartistic grandfathers sat peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of anachronisms and beheld with the calm complacency of the age of prose an iachimo in powder and patches a lear in lace ruffles and a lady macbeth in a large crinoline  i can understand archaeology being attacked on the ground of its excessive realism but to attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark however to attack it for any reason is foolish one might just as well speak disrespectfully of the equator  for archaeology being a science is neither good nor bad but a fact simply  its value depends entirely on how it is used and only an artist can use it we look to the archaeologist for the materials to the artist for the method  in designing the scenery and costumes for any of shakespeares plays the first thing the artist has to settle is the best date for the drama  this should be determined by the general spirit of the play more than by any actual historical references which may occur in it  most hamlets i have seen were placed far too early hamlet is essentially a scholar of the revival of learning and if the allusion to the recent invasion of england by the danes puts it back to the ninth century the use of foils brings it down much later  once however that the date has been fixed then the archaeologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is to convert into effects  it has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show us that shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy and a great deal of capital has been made out of hectors indiscreet quotation from aristotle  upon the other hand the anachronisms are really few in number and not very important and had shakespeares attention been drawn to them by a brother artist he would probably have corrected them  for though they can hardly be called blemishes they are certainly not the great beauties of his work or at least if they are their anachronistic charm cannot be emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according to its proper date  in looking at shakespeares plays as a whole however what is really remarkable is their extraordinary fidelity as regards his personages and his plots  many of his dramatis personae are people who had actually existed and some of them might have been seen in real life by a portion of his audience indeed the most violent attack that was made on shakespeare in his time was for his supposed caricature of lord cobham  as for his plots shakespeare constantly draws them either from authentic history or from the old ballads and traditions which served as history to the elizabethan public and which even now no scientific historian would dismiss as absolutely untrue  and not merely did he select fact instead of fancy as the basis of much of his imaginative work but he always gives to each play the general character the social atmosphere in a word of the age in question stupidity he recognises as being one of the permanent characteristics of all european civilisations so he sees no difference between a london mob of his own day and a roman mob of pagan days between a silly watchman in messina and a silly justice of the peace in windsor  but when he deals with higher characters with those exceptions of each age which are so fine that they become its types he gives them absolutely the stamp and seal of their time  virgilia is one of those roman wives on whose tomb was written domi mansit lanam fecit as surely as juliet is the romantic girl of the renaissance  he is even true to the characteristics of race  hamlet has all the imagination and irresolution of the northern nations and the princess katharine is as entirely french as the heroine of divorcons  harry the fifth is a pure englishman and othello a true moor  again when shakespeare treats of the history of england from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries it is wonderful how careful he is to have his facts perfectly rightindeed he follows holinshed with curious fidelity  the incessant wars between france and england are described with extraordinary accuracy down to the names of the besieged towns the ports of landing and embarkation the sites and dates of the battles the titles of the commanders on each side and the lists of the killed and wounded  and as regards the civil wars of the roses we have many elaborate genealogies of the seven sons of edward the third the claims of the rival houses of york and lancaster to the throne are discussed at length and if the english aristocracy will not read shakespeare as a poet they should certainly read him as a sort of early peerage  there is hardly a single title in the upper house with the exception of course of the uninteresting titles assumed by the law lords which does not appear in shakespeare along with many details of family history creditable and discreditable  indeed if it be really necessary that the school board children should know all about the wars of the roses they could learn their lessons just as well out of shakespeare as out of shilling primers and learn them i need not say far more pleasurably  even in shakespeares own day this use of his plays was recognised  the historical plays teach history to those who cannot read it in the chronicles says heywood in a tract about the stage and yet i am sure that sixteenthcentury chronicles were much more delightful reading than nineteenthcentury primers are  of course the aesthetic value of shakespeares plays does not in the slightest degree depend on their facts but on their truth and truth is independent of facts always inventing or selecting them at pleasure  but still shakespeares use of facts is a most interesting part of his method of work and shows us his attitude towards the stage and his relations to the great art of illusion indeed he would have been very much surprised at any one classing his plays with fairy tales as lord lytton does for one of his aims was to create for england a national historical drama which should deal with incidents with which the public was well acquainted and with heroes that lived in the memory of a people patriotism i need hardly say is not a necessary quality of art but it means for the artist the substitution of a universal for an individual feeling and for the public the presentation of a work of art in a most attractive and popular form  it is worth noticing that shakespeares first and last successes were both historical plays  it may be asked what has this to do with shakespeares attitude towards costume  i answer that a dramatist who laid such stress on historical accuracy of fact would have welcomed historical accuracy of costume as a most important adjunct to his illusionist method and i have no hesitation in saying that he did so  the reference to helmets of the period in the prologue to henry the fifth may be considered fanciful though shakespeare must have often seen   the very casque that did affright the air at agincourt   where it still hangs in the dusky gloom of westminster abbey along with the saddle of that imp of fame and the dinted shield with its torn blue velvet lining and its tarnished lilies of gold but the use of military tabards in henry the sixth is a bit of pure archaeology as they were not worn in the sixteenth century and the kings own tabard i may mention was still suspended over his tomb in st georges chapel windsor in shakespeares day  for up to the time of the unfortunate triumph of the philistines in 1645 the chapels and cathedrals of england were the great national museums of archaeology and in them were kept the armour and attire of the heroes of english history  a good deal was of course preserved in the tower and even in elizabeths day tourists were brought there to see such curious relics of the past as charles brandons huge lance which is still i believe the admiration of our country visitors but the cathedrals and churches were as a rule selected as the most suitable shrines for the reception of the historic antiquities  canterbury can still show us the helm of the black prince westminster the robes of our kings and in old st pauls the very banner that had waved on bosworth field was hung up by richmond himself  in fact everywhere that shakespeare turned in london he saw the apparel and appurtenances of past ages and it is impossible to doubt that he made use of his opportunities  the employment of lance and shield for instance in actual warfare which is so frequent in his plays is drawn from archaeology and not from the military accoutrements of his day and his general use of armour in battle was not a characteristic of his age a time when it was rapidly disappearing before firearms  again the crest on warwicks helmet of which such a point is made in henry the sixth is absolutely correct in a fifteenthcentury play when crests were generally worn but would not have been so in a play of shakespeares own time when feathers and plumes had taken their placea fashion which as he tells us in henry the eighth was borrowed from france  for the historical plays then we may be sure that archaeology was employed and as for the others i feel certain that it was the case also  the appearance of jupiter on his eagle thunderbolt in hand of juno with her peacocks and of iris with her manycoloured bow the amazon masque and the masque of the five worthies may all be regarded as archaeological and the vision which posthumus sees in prison of sicilius leonatusan old man attired like a warrior leading an ancient matronis clearly so  of the athenian dress by which lysander is distinguished from oberon i have already spoken but one of the most marked instances is in the case of the dress of coriolanus for which shakespeare goes directly to plutarch  that historian in his life of the great roman tells us of the oakwreath with which caius marcius was crowned and of the curious kind of dress in which according to ancient fashion he had to canvass his electors and on both of these points he enters into long disquisitions investigating the origin and meaning of the old customs  shakespeare in the spirit of the true artist accepts the facts of the antiquarian and converts them into dramatic and picturesque effects  indeed the gown of humility the woolvish gown as shakespeare calls it is the central note of the play there are other cases i might quote but this one is quite sufficient for my purpose and it is evident from it at any rate that in mounting a play in the accurate costume of the time according to the best authorities we are carrying out shakespeares own wishes and method  even if it were not so there is no more reason that we should continue any imperfections which may be supposed to have characterised shakespeares stage mounting than that we should have juliet played by a young man or give up the advantage of changeable scenery  a great work of dramatic art should not merely be made expressive of modern passion by means of the actor but should be presented to us in the form most suitable to the modern spirit  racine produced his roman plays in louis quatorze dress on a stage crowded with spectators but we require different conditions for the enjoyment of his art  perfect accuracy of detail for the sake of perfect illusion is necessary for us what we have to see is that the details are not allowed to usurp the principal place  they must be subordinate always to the general motive of the play  but subordination in art does not mean disregard of truth it means conversion of fact into effect and assigning to each detail its proper relative value   les petits details dhistoire et de vie domestique says hugo doivent etre scrupuleusement etudies et reproduits par le poete mais uniquement comme des moyens daccroitre la realite de lensemble et de faire penetrer jusque dans les coins les plus obscurs de loeuvre cette vie generale et puissante au milieu de laquelle les personnages sont plus vrais et les catastrophes par consequeut plus poignantes  tout doit etre subordonne a ce but lhomme sur le premier plan le reste au fond   this passage is interesting as coming from the first great french dramatist who employed archaeology on the stage and whose plays though absolutely correct in detail are known to all for their passion not for their pedantryfor their life not for their learning  it is true that he has made certain concessions in the case of the employment of curious or strange expressions  ruy blas talks of m de priego as sujet du roi instead of noble du roi and angelo malipieri speaks of la croix rouge instead of la croix de gueules  but they are concessions made to the public or rather to a section of it  jen offre ici toute mes excuses aux spectateurs intelligents he says in a note to one of the plays esperons quun jour un seigneur venitien pourra dire tout bonnement sans peril son blason sur le theatre  cest un progres qui viendra  and though the description of the crest is not couched in accurate language still the crest itself was accurately right  it may of course be said that the public do not notice these things upon the other hand it should be remembered that art has no other aim but her own perfection and proceeds simply by her own laws and that the play which hamlet describes as being caviare to the general is a play he highly praises  besides in england at any rate the public have undergone a transformation there is far more appreciation of beauty now than there was a few years ago and though they may not be familiar with the authorities and archaeological data for what is shown to them still they enjoy whatever loveliness they look at  and this is the important thing better to take pleasure in a rose than to put its root under a microscope  archaeological accuracy is merely a condition of illusionist stage effect it is not its quality  and lord lyttons proposal that the dresses should merely be beautiful without being accurate is founded on a misapprehension of the nature of costume and of its value on the stage  this value is twofold picturesque and dramatic the former depends on the colour of the dress the latter on its design and character  but so interwoven are the two that whenever in our own day historical accuracy has been disregarded and the various dresses in a play taken from different ages the result has been that the stage has been turned into that chaos of costume that caricature of the centuries the fancy dress ball to the entire ruin of all dramatic and picturesque effect for the dresses of one age do not artistically harmonise with the dresses of another  and as far as dramatic value goes to confuse the costumes is to confuse the play  costume is a growth an evolution and a most important perhaps the most important sign of the manners customs and mode of life of each century  the puritan dislike of colour adornment and grace in apparel was part of the great revolt of the middle classes against beauty in the seventeenth century  a historian who disregarded it would give us a most inaccurate picture of the time and a dramatist who did not avail himself of it would miss a most vital element in producing an illusionist effect  the effeminacy of dress that characterised the reign of richard the second was a constant theme of contemporary authors  shakespeare writing two hundred years after makes the kings fondness for gay apparel and foreign fashions a point in the play from john of gaunts reproaches down to richards own speech in the third act on his deposition from the throne  and that shakespeare examined richards tomb in westminster abbey seems to me certain from yorks speech   see see king richard doth himself appear as doth the blushing discontented sun from out the fiery portal of the east when he perceives the envious clouds are bent to dim his glory   for we can still discern on the kings robe his favourite badge the sun issuing from a cloud  in fact in every age the social conditions are so exemplified in costume that to produce a sixteenthcentury play in fourteenthcentury attire or vice versa would make the performance seem unreal because untrue  and valuable as beauty of effect on the stage is the highest beauty is not merely comparable with absolute accuracy of detail but really dependent on it  to invent an entirely new costume is almost impossible except in burlesque or extravaganza and as for combining the dress of different centuries into one the experiment would be dangerous and shakespeares opinion of the artistic value of such a medley may be gathered from his incessant satire of the elizabethan dandies for imagining that they were well dressed because they got their doublets in italy their hats in germany and their hose in france  and it should be noted that the most lovely scenes that have been produced on our stage have been those that have been characterised by perfect accuracy such as mr and mrs bancrofts eighteenthcentury revivals at the haymarket mr iryings superb production of much ado about nothing and mr barretts claudian  besides and this is perhaps the most complete answer to lord lyttons theory it must be remembered that neither in costume nor in dialogue is beauty the dramatists primary aim at all  the true dramatist aims first at what is characteristic and no more desires that all his personages should be beautifully attired than he desires that they should all have beautiful natures or speak beautiful english  the true dramatist in fact shows us life under the conditions of art not art in the form of life  the greek dress was the loveliest dress the world has ever seen and the english dress of the last century one of the most monstrous yet we cannot costume a play by sheridan as we would costume a play by sophokles  for as polonius says in his excellent lecture a lecture to which i am glad to have the opportunity of expressing my obligations one of the first qualities of apparel is its expressiveness  and the affected style of dress in the last century was the natural characteristic of a society of affected manners and affected conversationa characteristic which the realistic dramatist will highly value down to the smallest detail of accuracy and the materials for which he can get only from archaeology  but it is not enough that a dress should be accurate it must be also appropriate to the stature and appearance of the actor and to his supposed condition as well as to his necessary action in the play  in mr hares production of as you like it at the st jamess theatre for instance the whole point of orlandos complaint that he is brought up like a peasant and not like a gentleman was spoiled by the gorgeousness of his dress and the splendid apparel worn by the banished duke and his friends was quite out of place  mr lewis wingfields explanation that the sumptuary laws of the period necessitated their doing so is i am afraid hardly sufficient  outlaws lurking in a forest and living by the chase are not very likely to care much about ordinances of dress  they were probably attired like robin hoods men to whom indeed they are compared in the course of the play  and that their dress was not that of wealthy noblemen may be seen by orlandos words when he breaks in upon them  he mistakes them for robbers and is amazed to find that they answer him in courteous and gentle terms  lady archibald campbells production under mr e w godwins direction of the same play in coombe wood was as regards mounting far more artistic  at least it seemed so to me the duke and his companions were dressed in serge tunics leathern jerkins high boots and gauntlets and wore bycocket hats and hoods  and as they were playing in a real forest they found i am sure their dresses extremely convenient  to every character in the play was given a perfectly appropriate attire and the brown and green of their costumes harmonised exquisitely with the ferns through which they wandered the trees beneath which they lay and the lovely english landscape that surrounded the pastoral players the perfect naturalness of the scene was due to the absolute accuracy and appropriateness of everything that was worn  nor could archaeology have been put to a severer test or come out of it more triumphantly  the whole production showed once for all that unless a dress is archaeologically correct and artistically appropriate it always looks unreal unnatural and theatrical in the sense of artificial  nor again is it enough that there should be accurate and appropriate costumes of beautiful colours there must be also beauty of colour on the stage as a whole and as long as the background is painted by one artist and the foreground figures independently designed by another there is the danger of a want of harmony in the scene as a picture  for each scene the colour scheme should be settled as absolutely as for the decoration of a room and the textures which it is proposed to use should be mixed and remixed in every possible combination and what is discordant removed  then as regards the particular kinds of colours the stage is often too glaring partly through the excessive use of hot violent reds and partly through the costumes looking too new shabbiness which in modern life is merely the tendency of the lower orders towards tone is not without its artistic value and modern colours are often much improved by being a little faded blue also is too frequently used  it is not merely a dangerous colour to wear by gaslight but it is really difficult in england to get a thoroughly good blue  the fine chinese blue which we all so much admire takes two years to dye and the english public will not wait so long for a colour  peacock blue of course has been employed on the stage notably at the lyceum with great advantage but all attempts at a good light blue or good dark blue which i have seen have been failures  the value of black is hardly appreciated it was used effectively by mr irving in hamlet as the central note of a composition but as a tonegiving neutral its importance is not recognised  and this is curious considering the general colour of the dress of a century in which as baudelaire says nous celebrons tous quelque enterrement  the archaeologist of the future will probably point to this age as the time when the beauty of black was understood but i hardly think that as regards stagemounting or house decoration it really is  its decorative value is of course the same as that of white or gold it can separate and harmonise colours  in modern plays the black frock coat of the hero becomes important in itself and should be given a suitable background  but it rarely is  indeed the only good background for a play in modern dress which i have ever seen was the dark grey and creamwhite scene of the first act of the princesse georges in mrs langtrys production  as a rule the hero is smothered in bricabrac and palmtrees lost in the gilded abyss of louis quatorze furniture or reduced to a mere midge in the midst of marqueterie whereas the background should always be kept as a background and colour subordinated to effect  this of course can only be done when there is one single mind directing the whole production  the facts of art are diverse but the essence of artistic effect is unity  monarchy anarchy and republicanism may contend for the government of nations but a theatre should be in the power of a cultured despot  there may be division of labour but there must be no division of mind  whoever understands the costume of an age understands of necessity its architecture and its surroundings also and it is easy to see from the chairs of a century whether it was a century of crinolines or not  in fact in art there is no specialism and a really artistic production should bear the impress of one master and one master only who not merely should design and arrange everything but should have complete control over the way in which each dress is to be worn  mademoiselle mars in the first production of hernani absolutely refused to call her lover mon lion unless she was allowed to wear a little fashionable toque then much in vogue on the boulevards and many young ladies on our own stage insist to the present day on wearing stiff starched petticoats under greek dresses to the entire ruin of all delicacy of line and fold but these wicked things should not be allowed  and there should be far more dress rehearsals than there are now  actors such as mr forbesrobertson mr conway mr george alexander and others not to mention older artists can move with ease and elegance in the attire of any century but there are not a few who seem dreadfully embarrassed about their hands if they have no side pockets and who always wear their dresses as if they were costumes  costumes of course they are to the designer but dresses they should be to those that wear them  and it is time that a stop should be put to the idea very prevalent on the stage that the greeks and romans always went about bareheaded in the open aira mistake the elizabethan managers did not fall into for they gave hoods as well as gowns to their roman senators  more dress rehearsals would also be of value in explaining to the actors that there is a form of gesture and movement that is not merely appropriate to each style of dress but really conditioned by it  the extravagant use of the arms in the eighteenth century for instance was the necessary result of the large hoop and the solemn dignity of burleigh owed as much to his ruff as to his reason  besides until an actor is at home in his dress he is not at home in his part  of the value of beautiful costume in creating an artistic temperament in the audience and producing that joy in beauty for beautys sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never be understood i will not here speak though it is worth while to notice how shakespeare appreciated that side of the question in the production of his tragedies acting them always by artificial light and in a theatre hung with black but what i have tried to point out is that archaeology is not a pedantic method but a method of artistic illusion and that costume is a means of displaying character without description and of producing dramatic situations and dramatic effects  and i think it is a pity that so many critics should have set themselves to attack one of the most important movements on the modern stage before that movement has at all reached its proper perfection  that it will do so however i feel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic critics in the future higher qualification than that they can remember macready or have seen benjamin webster we shall require of them indeed that they cultivate a sense of beauty  pour etre plus difficile la tache nen est que plus glorieuse  and if they will not encourage at least they must not oppose a movement of which shakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved for it has the illusion of truth for its method and the illusion of beauty for its result  not that i agree with everything that i have said in this essay  there is much with which i entirely disagree  the essay simply represents an artistic standpoint and in aesthetic criticism attitude is everything  for in art there is no such thing as a universal truth  a truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true  and just as it is only in art criticism and through it that we can apprehend the platonic theory of ideas so it is only in artcriticism and through it that we can realise hegels system of contraries  the truths of metaphysics are the truths of masks
