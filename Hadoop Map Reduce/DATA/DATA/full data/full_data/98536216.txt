wheelock stood with a brown hand on the tyees wheel as the deeploaded schooner slid out through vancouver narrows before a fresh easterly breeze dim heights of snow rose faintly white against the creeping dusk above her starboard hand and the busy british columbian city girt with mazy wires and towering telegraph poles was fading slowly amidst the great black pines astern an aromatic smell of burning followed the schooner and from the levels at the head of the inlet a long gray smear blew out across the water a fire which had as not infrequently happens passed the bounds of somebodys clearing was eating its way into that part of the great coniferous forest that rolls north from oregon to alaska along the wet seaboard of the pacific slope  the schooner was making her six knots with mainboom well out on her quarter and broad wisps of froth washing off beneath her bows slanted until her leeward scuppers were close above the sliding foam wheelock stood right aft with his shoulders just above the roof of the little deckhouse and foreshortened as the vessel was she seemed from that point of view a mere patch of scarred and somewhat uncleanly deck surmounted by a towering mass of sail two partly seen figures were busy bending on a gafftopsail about the foot of her foremast and wheelock turned as one of them came slouching aft when the sail had been sent aloft the man wore dungaree and jean with a dilapidated oilskin coat over them for the wind was keen he appeared to be at least fifty years of age leaning against the rail he grinned at wheelock confidentially  shell make a short trip of it if this breeze holds he said i guess you find things kind of different from what they were in the mailboats  jim wheelock nodded as he pulled up a spoke of his wheel for it was that difference that had brought the smile to his eyes it was several years now since he had touched a vessels wheel or done more than raise a directing hand to the trimly uniformed quartermaster who controlled the big liners steering engine he was twentyeight years of age and held an extramasters certificate and he had just completed the years training in a big british warship which gave him his commission as a lieutenant rnr it was certainly a distinct change to figure as supernumerary on board the canadian coasting schooner tyee but he did not resent the fact that it was the grizzled hardfaced man leaning on the rail beside him who had brought him there  arent you going to get the main gafftopsail on to her well carry smooth water with us most across the straits he said  this was not to the purpose as both of them felt but it gave the other man the opening for which he had been looking  no he replied i guess not well feel the wind fresher when she draws out from the land and theres a streak of dry rot in her mainmast round the partners that stick was sound right through when we put it into her but it has stood the wind and weather quite a while and i guess its getting shaky like its owner  now the redwood logs hewn in the british columbian forest as a rule make excellent masts but they naturally deteriorate with time and in some of them there is hidden a latent cause of trouble which now and then leads to premature decay jimmy was aware of this and fancied that he knew why his companion had reminded him of it it was scarcely two hours since he had arrived on board the tyee he had made a long journey to join her because his fathers kinsman prescott her mate had sent for him and now though he almost shrank from asking for the information there were points on which it was necessary that the latter should enlighten him he leaned on his wheel in silence a minute or two and the smile died out of his eyes prescott regarded him steadily  jim wheelock who hitherto had taken life lightly could bear inspection for he was a personable man as more than one of the young women who traveled in the big liner of which he had been mate had decided and he had seldom experienced much difficulty in finding a pretty partner at any of the dances given to the warships officers he had whimsical blue eyes and though he was colonialborn a face of the fair cleanskinned english type which had in it an occasional suggestion of latent force he had a wellproportioned frame and his life in the mailboats and the rnr training had set their stamp on him just then he was attired incongruously in an old skincap battered gumboots which reached to his knees trousers showing signs of wear and a steamboat mates jacket with gilt buttons on it in much the same condition but in spite of that he did not appear the kind of man one would have expected to come upon steering a coasting schooner  what do you think about my father bob he asked  what i said in the letter the other man replied i guess you ought to understand it now youve seen him toms going to looard fast most as fastand he seemed to search for a metaphoras a centerboarder when her board wont come down it kind of struck me it was bout time you came home and looked after things and him thats why i wrote you hed have never done it anyway  jim wheelock knew this was true prescotts letter which had come to hand at portsmouth just after he had finished his navy training had somewhat startled him and as the result of it he had forthwith started for vancouver traveling secondclass and by colonist car as one does not gain very much financially by serving in the rnr on arriving there he had been further startled by the change in his father whom he had last seen several years earlier when tom wheelock was apparently at least beyond the reach of adversity as the owner of several small coasting vessels one of which he insisted on sailing personally though this had not seemed needful at the time it was evident to jimmy that he had been going to leeward very fast in several ways since then  yes he said that is a sure thing when did the change begin i mean when did things first go wrong with him  when he lost the fishhawkthat was most four years ago anyway that was when i began to notice it then the cannery people put on their steamboat and he couldnt keep the eagle going without their trade she lay ashore in a bad berth with a big load of wellington coal in her and it cost him about a thousand dollars before she was fit for sea again things were slack that season and he gave merril a bond for the money i guess that made the real trouble merrils a mighty hard man and he has been putting the screw on him  jim wheelock looked thoughtful a thousand dollars isnt such a great deal of money after all the old man seemed to have plenty of it when i left home  well said prescott dryly its quite certain he hasnt got it now and ive more than a notion that theres a big bond on the tyee why did he bring your sister ellen back from toronto  jim wheelock did not know he had in fact once or twice asked himself the same question without finding an answer his sister eleanor who was an ambitious and capable young woman was now earning a pittance by teaching at a ranch near new westminster but she had never given him any reason in her letters for abandoning the studies she had gone east to pursue in toronto  anyway said prescott its quite clear to me that your father needs a man with sense and snap to stand right behind him and see that he worries out of merrils clutches i dont know whether you can do iti cantim no use at business tom and i were always honest then supposing you can do that youre bout halfway through with the thing  only halfway  bout that toms been drifting to looard you want to brace him sharp up on the wind again  he broke off somewhat abruptly for the scuttle slide in the deckhouse roof was flung back and a man below lifted his head above it  come right down and get your supper jimmy bob will take your wheel he said  jimmy left the helm to prescott and with an effort he braced himself for the interview before him as he descended to the little stuffy cabin it was dimly lighted by an oillamp that creaked as it swung though the tyee was ploughing her way westward steadily as yet a little stove made it almost intolerably hot and the swirl of brine beneath the lee quarter filled it with a sound that was like the rattle of sliding gravel jimmy sat down and ate the pork potatoes fresh bread and desiccated apples set before him which he surmised might be considered somewhat of a banquet on board the tyee and then he took out his pipe and turned toward his father as he filled his pannikin again with strong green tea he had arrived in vancouver only that afternoon and they had had no time for conversation in the hurry of getting to sea  take some whisky in it asked tom wheelock its not much of a supper after what youve been used to on board the liners  no thanks said jimmy im glad i didnt miss you  got your wire said wheelock who helped himself liberally to the whisky we werent through with the loading until yesterday and though the folks want those sawmill fixings bad i figured we could wait another twentyfour hours its good to see you sitting there but i dont know yet what brought you over its quite a long way  jimmy spent some time in filling his pipe he was a truthful person and prescott who wrote the letter had pledged him to secrecy then too he was by no means certain that his father would appreciate what either of them had done or would consider it in any way necessary he also had scarcely got used to the change in his circumstances and surroundings and did not feel quite at ease on the last liner he sailed in the officers dined in the saloon and though the battleships wardroom was less luxurious it was at least very different from the tyees quartercabin tin pannikins and plates of indurated ware lay on a soiled uncovered table a grimy brown blanket from the skippers bunk trailed down across the locker that served as a settee and the fishoil lamp smelt horribly then he glanced at his father who sat silent sipping his tea which was freely laced with whisky  tom wheelock was by no means dressed as neatly as most of the vancouver wharfhands and he looked like a man who had lost heart and pride as well he was gaunt and bigboned with a seamans weatherdarkened face but there was weariness and something that suggested vacancy in its expression he and jimmy had the same blue eyes and they were kindly and honest in the case of each but tom wheelocks were a trifle watery and there was a certain bagginess under them while his mouth was slack in fact the man as his son recognized appeared to have sunk into a state of limpness that was mental as well as physical  well said jimmy with a little laugh i dont quite know there were you see several reasons to begin with i had to come out of the mailboat for my years training and when that was over there were a good many men on the companys list to be worked off before they wanted me again trade is slack over there and it seemed wiser to await my turn after all it doesnt cost so much to come across secondclass and colonist and i guessed you would be glad to see me  so i am and there was no doubt that wheelock meant it ive been wanting you quite a while jimmy things arent going well with me take some whisky  it was evident to jimmy that his father already had taken as much as was good for most men and he did not often shrink from a responsibility that is when he recognized it as such which is now and then a little difficult when one is young  well he said this time i guess i will  he took the bottle and after helping himself sparingly contrived to slip it out of sight on the locker  hows eleanor he asked  quite well but though she has her mothers grit lifes hard on the girl ellen could have done most anything if shed got her diplomas or whatever they are and i had figured id do something for one of my children when i sent her back east it was your mothers brotherthe brains come from that side of the familydid everything for you a kind of pity you and he quarreled jimmy  jimmy smiled drily as he remembered the year he had spent in winnipeg with the grim business man before the call of the sea that he was born to listen to grew irresistible and the rupture came young as he was then he had proved himself equal in strength of purpose to the hard old man and had gone to sea in an english ship it cost his father fifty pounds for his outfit and premium and that was all that tom wheelock had done for him he had made his own way into the steamers and the extramaster certificate and the commission in the rnr he owed to himself now it was evident that he must renounce all that they might bring himat least for a while  i dont think we ever would have hit it off together and i cant help a fancy that after all he didnt blame me very much for taking my own way in spite of him he said still it is a pity eleanor had to come back i suppose keeping her in toronto was out of the question  wheelocks eyes seemed to grow a trifle bloodshot and his voice sank to a hoarser note quite i might have done it but for the bond i gave merril when the eagle went ashore it wasnt that big a one but he fixed up quite a lot of things i never figured on i was to insure to full value and have her repaired whenever his surveyor considered she wanted it twice the man ran me up a big unnecessary bill and i had to go to merril for the money now the boats his and theres a bond on the tyee when the old man goes under youll remember who it was squeezed the life out of him jimmy say where dyou put that whisky  im not quite through with it yet and jimmy who did not pass it to him smiled reassuringly anyway i wouldnt worry too much about merril ive a few dollars laid by and im going to stay right here and look after you bob prescott tells me the siwash wants to go ashore and that makes a berth for me its scarcely likely the company will want me for three months or more  the old man looked at him with a gleam of comprehension in his watery eyes jimmy he said you have been a good sonand it wasnt quite my fault i never did anything for you your mother was often ailing and when i sent her east twice to the specialists the freights i was getting would scarcely foot the bill oh yes things were generally tight with me now theyre tight again but when merril wants my blood youve come back to see it out with me  he made a gesture of weariness well i guess ill turn in ive been trailing round the city most of the day after a man who owes me forty dollarsand im way from being as young as i used to be  he climbed somewhat stiffly into his bunk and jimmy went up on deck it was dark now and the tyee leaning down until the foot of her lee bulwarks was almost in the foam swept through the dark water with a leisurely dip and swing a dim star or two hung over her mastheads and the peak of the big gafftopsail swung athwart them a little blacker than the night but there was no shimmer of light on all the water and the schooner swung out to westward vague and shadowy with one blurred shape gripping her straining wheel it reminded jimmy of the sailingship days when he had set his teeth and borne what came to himwet and cold utter weariness want of sleep purposeless exactions and brutal hazing those black days had gone he had lived through them and had been about to reap his reward when the summons had come and he had gone back west to his duty the brokendown man in the little cabin needed him as jimmy who tried not to admit the greatness of the change in him realized then he turned as prescott spoke to him from the wheel  now youve had a talk to him i guess youll understand why i sent for you he said youve got to take hold and straighten things toms been letting go fast  jimmy wheelock said nothing but he knew that in the meanwhile he must put his career aside and once more he set his lips and braced himself to face the task before him as he had done often in the sailingship days     chapter ii  to windward   two days had slipped away since jimmy joined the tyee when with her dewwet canvas slatting at every roll she crept out from the narrow waters into the pacific astern of her the olympians towered high above the forests of washington a great serrated ridge of frosted silver that cut coldly white against the blue of the morning sky to starboard the shore of vancouver island rose a faint blur of misty pines and ahead the sea was dimmed by drifting vapors out of which the long swell swung glassily at times a wandering zephyr crisped it with a darker smear and the tyee crawled ahead a little then she stopped again heaving her bows high out of the oily sea while everything in her banged and rattled  there was nothing that any one on board her could do but wait for the breeze and wonder whether it would come from the right direction jimmy sat on the deckhouse with his pipe in his hand and tom wheelock whose face looked careworn in the early light and showed pasty gray patches amidst its bronze glanced westward a trifle anxiously as he held the jerking wheel  its a kind of pity we lost that breeze he said the people up yonder want those sawmill fixings and with the wind from the east wed most have fetched the inlet tonight there was talk of somebody putting a steamboat on but the mills a small one and they figured theyd give me a show as long as i could keep them going ive got to do it theres a living in the contract  then his face hardened suddenly and he sighed that is there would have been if merril hadnt got his grip on me that man wants everything  he appeared about to say something further but just then prescott flung the scuttle slide back and a smell of coffee and frizzling pork flowed out of it  if you want your breakfast tom i guess youd better get it he said and lumbered round the deckhouse toward the wheel  wheelock went below and jimmy who seemed to forget that he had meant to light his pipe glanced thoughtfully at prescott  who is this merril bob he asked  prescott made a vague gesture i guess hes everything he has a finger in most of what goes on in this province and feels round with it for the money calls himself general broker and shipstore dealer but he has money in everything from bush ranches to steamboats  you mean he holds stock in them  no said prescott i guess i dont im not smart at business and tom isnt either or hed never have let merril get his claws on him but its quite plain to me that stocks dont count along with mortgages and bonds when you buy stock you take your chances and quite often thats bout all but when you hold a bond at a big interest you usually get the ship or mill anyway thats how merril fixes it  jimmy lighted his pipe but he looked more thoughtful than ever as in fact he was hitherto he had taken life lightly for after all wet and cold screaming gale and stinging spray are things one gets used to and faces unconcernedly but jimmy could recognize a responsibility and he realized that there was now to be a change tom wheelock was growing prematurely old and shaky and it was it seemed his sons part to free him from the load of debt that was crushing him if this by any means could be done if not at least to share it with him he feared it would be the latter hitherto he had waged only the clean primitive strife with the restless sea but he did not shrink from the prospect of the meaner and more arduous conflict with the wiles of man and the forces of capital or consider that in renouncing his career he was doing a commendable thing he was by no means brilliant intellectually though he had a certain shrewdness and a ready wit and it only occurred to him that the course he had decided on was the obvious one he did not even think it worth while to mention that he had done so which indeed would have been unnecessary since prescott seemed to take it for granted  i believe you had the wind from the east for several days he said why didnt you run across before  well replied prescott reflectively we might have done so but tom didnt seem greatly stuck on trying it took time over his loading when he got your wire perhaps he didnt want to leave you hanging round vancouver until we got back again  jimmy said nothinghe had partly expected this and while he smoked his second pipe the vapors were rolled apart and the breeze came down on them unfortunately it came from the northwest which as the sawmill they were bound for stood at the head of a deep inlet on the west coast of vancouver island was ahead of them so for a while they let her stretch out into the pacific closehauled upon the starboard tack  the tyee was comparatively fast and under all the sail they could pile on to her excepting the main gafftopsail she drove along with a wide curl of foam under her lee bow and the froth lapping high and white on her side then by degrees the long roll of the pacific heaved itself up into steep bluesided seas with tops of incandescent whiteness and as she lurched over them the spray whirled in filmy clouds from her plunging bows still the breeze freshened and by noon they hove her to with jibs aback while they hauled two reefs down in her mainsail and it became necessary for somebody to crawl out to the end of its tilting boom which stretched a good fathom beyond her stern prescott was a little too old for that work tom wheelock held the wheel and the siwash deckhand was busy forward jimmy laughed as he swung himself up to the footrope  its several years since ive done anything of this kind but i dare say i can tie those afterpoints in he said  he clawed his way out and as he hung with waist across the spar and both hands busy while the tyee flinging the spray all over her plunged upon the long foamtipped roll a big empress liner came up from the eastward white and majestic she drove close by the schooner with a slow and stately dip and swing and jimmy wheelock clinging to the tyees reefpoints smiled somewhat curiously as he glanced up at her her tall side rose above him like a wall and he saw the cluster of saloon passengers beneath the tier of deckhouses move toward the rail to gaze down upon the little dingy vessel and the two trim officers high above them in the sunshine on the slanting bridge that was his worldone in which steam did the hard work and man merely pressed the telegraph handle or laid a finger on a spoke of the little steering wheel but it was a world on which he had turned his back and there was nothing to be gained by repining  he broke two of his nails before he finished his task and dropped from the footrope to the tyees deck and the liner had sunk to a gleaming white blur and a smoketrail on the rim of the sea before they had reefed the foresail and once more got way on her then prescott grinned at jimmy as he glanced toward the fading smear of vapor  a headwinds quite a little matter to that boat he said i guess youd feel more at home on board of her  jimmy laughed goodhumoredly perhaps i would but after all i dont know that it counts for very much  they came round some hours later and heading her in for the land on the other tack found how little they had made to windward whereupon there followed a consultation prescott was for running back and coming to an anchor in smooth water to wait for a shift of wind but wheelock would go on he blinked at the white sea to windward with watery eyes while the tyee putting her bows in flung the spray all over her but there was a certain grimness in tom wheelocks eyes for if he was not smart at business he was at least a resolute seaman  those sawmill people want their fixings and if were to hold on to their contract i guess theyve got to have them he said she should thrash down to the inlet by tomorrow night i figure shed go along a little easier without her staysail  they hauled it down but the tyee being loaded deep with heavy machinery was not appreciably drier afterward and by the time the angry saffron sunset faded off the foamcrested sea she put her bows in somewhat frequently then there was a thud as she charged a big comber and the frothy cataract that seethed in over her weather rail swirled aft a foot deep while the spray blew all over her jimmy buttoned to the throat in oilskins stood at her wheel dripping through four hours of darkness and then crawling down into the little cabin which was intolerably foul flung himself into his bunk and incontinently fell asleep with the thud and swish of falling water going on above him when he awakened his first proceeding was to grope for the button that would summon a steward boy to bring him his morning coffee but as he could not find it he looked around and saw his wet oilskins which had shaken off the hook sliding amidst the water up and down the tyees cabin floor then he remembered suddenly and dropping from his bunk put on the oilskins and went up on deck  a sheet of spray temporarily blinded him as he crawled out of the scuttle and then there was little to be seen but a haze of it flying athwart a gray sea lined by frothy ridges and smears of lowdriving cloud the tyees slanted mastheads seemed to rake through the latter and she was wet everywhere but she was still hammering to windward with bows that swung up streaming over the long seas on the one hand a dingy smear that might have been a point with pines on it lifted itself out of the grayness and tom wheelock pointed to it as he swayed with his wheel his wet face was almost gray and jimmy could see the suggestive bagginess under his eyes  i guess we should fetch the inlet by dark if it doesnt harden any more but well have another reef down now youre up he said  they got the reef in with some difficulty for all of them were needed to haul the leechearing down and because the siwash hand was a better boatman than sailor jimmy went out to the end of the boom again to tie the afterpoints when he came back the tyee proceeded a little more dryly with the big gray seas that were topped with livid froth and had deep hollows between them rolling up in long succession to meet her she went through some of them for the sawmill machinery was a deadweight in her and a white cataract foamed across her forward when she plunged into one that was larger than usual prescott who now stood knee deep at her wheel shook his head  tom didnt ought to expect it of her he said he wouldnt have held her at it if he hadnt been mighty afraid of losing that contract  jimmy made no answer he understood by this time how his father was circumstanced and had discovered already that the man who stands between the devil and the deep sea cannot afford to be particular merril who held a bond on the tyee might it seemed very well stand for the devil  they thrashed her to windward most of that day the sea got worse and there was not a dry stitch on any of them but just at sunset the clouds were rent apart and wheelock who was standing on the deckhouse pointed to something that loomed amidst the vapor as they reeled inshore  the head he said the inlets about two miles beyond it  prescott glanced at jimmy as he pulled up the wheel with a blame ugly tiderip setting dead to windward across the mouth of it  jimmy said nothing though naturally he was aware that when the ocean streams run against the breeze they are very apt to pile up whatever sea there is into curling hollowcrested combers a craft of the tyees size will often snugly ride out a hard galethat is if she is hoveto under a strip or two of canvas but to drive her to windward when she must meet the onslaught of the seas and go through them is an altogether different matter and it seemed to him that she was already doing as much as any one reasonably could expect from her then his father came down from the deckhouse  well he said she has got to go through it those people want their fixings i guess well heave her round  the words were simple but they implied a good deal wheelock could have heaved his schooner to or could have run away for shelter in another inlet down the coast but as he had said the sawmill people wanted their machinery and when he must choose between it and the devil he would sooner face his ancient enemy the sea its attack was honest and open and the man with nerve enough might meet and withstand the charge of its seething combers quickness of hand and rude primitive valor counted here but it was otherwise in the insidious conflict with the human schemer tom wheelocks eyes were watery but there was a snap in them as he signed to prescott and laid his hands on the wheel  get forward jimmy and tend your headsheets he said well have her round  she came round but none too readily and as they stretched out seaward jimmy had a brief vision of great rocks and hollows filled with pines that opened out and closed on one another then as he glanced to windward he saw the seatops heave athwart a blaze of crimson and saffron low down under ragged wisps of cloud  they brought her round again presently and she reeled in shoreward to weather the second head on that side of the inlet with her little threereefed mainsail wet to its peak and the two jibs above her bowsprit streaming at every plunge while the big combers in the tideway smote her weatherbow and poured out to leeward in long wisps of brine still she was slowly opening up the sheltered inlet and it was only a question whether she would go clear enough of the head on that tack it was however a somewhat momentous question for it seemed to jimmy very doubtful whether she would come round with them again  tom wheelock stayed at the helm and the head that had grown dim again lifted its vast rock wall higher and higher out of the whirling vapors that streamed amid the shadowy pines it grew very close to them but the tyee was halfburied forward most of the time and the break beyond the crag where smooth water lay had crept a little forward instead of aft from under her leebow when a comber higher than the rest hove itself up to weather and fell upon her it foamed across her forward and when it went seething aft as she swung her bows up there was a crash and tom wheelock loosed the spinning wheel  jimmy saw him strike the bulwark and prescott clutch him but knowing that the plunge would probably make an end of the schooner if she rammed another sea he sprang to the wheel she was coming up when he seized it which almost threw him over it and there was a bang like a rifleshot as one of her streaming jibs was blown away the veins swelled on his forehead as he forced the helm up and as the tyee fell off on her course again he had a momentary vision of a great wall of rock that seemed to be creeping up on them he also saw a man lying in the water that sluiced about her deck while another who strove to hold him with one hand clung to a stanchion then while he set his teeth and braced himself against the drag of the wheel he could discern nothing but a haze of flying brine and could feel the hardpressed vessel strain and tremble under him  he did not know how long the tension lasted nor for a minute or two did he see much of prescott and his father but at last the rocks seemed to slide away and the tyee drove through the furious turmoil in the mouth of the inlet then the wind fell suddenly and rising upright the dripping schooner slid forward beneath long ranks of misty pines he left the helm to the siwash and prescott and he between them got wheelock down into the little cabin he gasped when they had put him into his bunk and poured a liberal measure of raw whisky down his throat  well he said faintly i guess weve saved that contract you weathered the head  we did answered prescott jimmy grabbed the wheel in time seems to me we had bout twenty fathoms to spare feel as if youd broke anything inside you  tom wheelock moved himself a little and groaned no he said i guess i havent but it hurt me considerably when i washed up against the rail mightnt have felt it one time but im getting old and shaky anyway you can light out and get your anchor clear im feeling kind of dizzy  prescott went up the ladder but jimmy stayed where he was and did not go up on deck until his fathers eyes closed it was quite dark and he could see only vague shadowy mountains black against the sky presently a long siwash canoe with several men paddling hard on board her came sliding down the dim lane of water that seemed to wind into the heart of the forests she stopped alongside and a man climbed on board  weve been expecting you the last two days and im glad you got in now he said merril who talks of running a steamer up this coast has been worrying our vancouver people to make him an offer for their carrying its quite likely theyd have made a deal with him if youd kept us waiting  they made the canoe fast and the tyee slowly crept on beneath the shadowy mountains and the misty pines for only a faint air of wind disturbed the deep stillness here jim wheelock however noticed very little as he leaned on the rail with a vindictive hatred in his heart for the man who it seemed was bent upon his fathers ruin     chapter iii  jimmy makes friends   they had landed the machinery and partly loaded the tyee with dressed lumber when jimmy wheelock who was aching in every limb after a days arduous toil sat cigar in hand in the office of the sawmill manager it was singularly untidy as well as unclean for few men in that country have time to consider their comfort odd bottles of engineoil and samples of belting lay amid the litter of sketches and specifications while the plates and provisioncans on the table suggested that the manager and his guest had just finished their evening meal the window was open wide and a clean smell of freshly cut cedar drifted in with the aromatic fragrance of the pines from where he sat wheelock could see them rolling up the steep hillside with the white mists streaming athwart them and the narrow lane of clear green water winding past their feet there was deep stillness among them for the mill was silent at last and it was only now and then that a voice rose faintly from the little wooden settlement which straggled up the riverside  the manager dressed in a store jacket and trousers of jean lay upon what seemed to be a toolchest and he had like wheelock a cigar of exceptional flavor in his hand he was a young darkeyed man somewhat spare of frame and when he spoke his quick nervous gestures rather than his accent which was by no means marked proclaimed him an american of the pacific slope it was characteristic that wheelock who had spent less than a week in his company already felt on familiar terms with him he had discovered that it is usually difficult to make the acquaintance of an insular englishman in anything like that time  old man feeling any better this afternoon inquired his companion  he says so and jimmy looked thoughtful as he had done somewhat frequently of late though this had not been a habit of his still he was flung rather heavily against the rail and though he insisted on working im not quite satisfied about him  the american nodded comprehendingly parents are a responsibility now and then i lost mine though raised myself somehow down in washington anyway your father has been going down grade fast the two years ive known him and im sorry hes a straight man i like him  a trace of darker color crept into jimmys bronze though he was aware that candor of that kind is usual on the pacific slope and there was nothing he could resent in his companions manner however he made no answer and the american spoke again  im glad you got in on time as i told prescott merril has a notion of going into the coasting trade and wants our carrying he has a pull on some of our stockholders but i dont like the man and youll get our freight as long as you can keep us going why did you let the old man borrow that money from merril  i wasnt here in fact its only a few weeks since i left an english ship at portsmouth  mailboat  no said jimmy a warship  the american looked at him hard a moment and then made a little gesture with the hand that held the cigar he had seen jimmy wheelock carrying boards on his shoulder all that day and now he was dressed in the canadian wharfhands jean but he had no difficulty in believing him  lieutenant in your second fighting line came back to look after the old man he said well i guess he needs you you want to keep your eye on merril too if you dont hell have the schooner its a sure thing  jimmy realized without knowing exactly why that he could give this man whom he had met only a few days ago his confidence  the same thing has occurred to me he said do you mind telling me what you know about merril  no its only what everybody else knows merrils a machine for stamping moneyout of anything got a shipsupply store in vancouver and is working himself into the general carrying business lends money on vessels and fits them out hell give you a long credit at a blame long interest and by and by he gets the vessel or a controlling share in her he cant touch the express freight and passenger trafficknows too much to kick against the cpr or the big sound steamers but theres the general freight for the mines sawmills and canneries up and down the coast and his vessels wont cost him much the way he buys them the trades going to be a big one if id forty thousand dollars id buy a steamer  jimmys eyes twinkled a steamboat isnt a sawmill would you know how to run her  the american laughed if i didnt i guess i could learn it cant be harder than playing the fiddle and ive worried into that  he stopped a moment and then announced quietly with the almost dramatic abruptness which usually characterized him anyway wed make something of it id put you in command of her  i wonder what leads you to believe i would suit you said jimmy reflectively  his companion waved his cigar saw you packing lumber you stayed right with the contract though youd never done the thing before know what the first few days areive been there stacked twoinch planks in washington when i was seventeen and my strength hadnt quite come to me and went home at nights walking double with every joint in my body aching then they started me logwedging and thats most enough to break a weak mans heart still i stayed with it and now im drawing royalties on my swingframe and gangsaw patents and hold stock in several mills  this was perhaps a trifle egotistical but then it was or would have been in most other countries somewhat of an achievement for one who had commenced with the lowest and most brutal labor to make himself patentee manager and stockholder while still a very young man and jimmy had met mailboat officers who gave themselves a good many airs on the strength of possessing a refined taste in uniform tailoring and a prepossessing personality individually he felt it was more reasonable to be satisfied with ones ability to invent and run a mill just then however the door opened and another man came in he wore a blue shirt which fell open at the neck for want of buttons and jean trousers which were very old and torn and there were smears of oil and paint on his hands  i came to ask when you are going to saw me those fir frames jordan he said  take a cigar said the american and turned to jimmy with a grin ever heard of thoreau who lived at walden pond  jimmy had as it happened read his book on board one of the mailboats though he scarcely would have fancied that jordan had done so the latter indicated the newcomer with a wave of his hand  well he said thats another of them though he lives in a yacht and his name is valentine there are menand theyre not all crankswho seem to think the life most other people lead isnt good enough for them  valentine who looked very different from any of the yachtsmen jimmy had seen on the english coast or elsewhere sat down and the latter was a trifle astonished when he said that wasnt why thoreau went to walden he was an abolitionist and made walden a station for running niggers into canada anyway why does a man want to go into business and slave to pile up money when he can have the greatest thing in nature for nothing at all  whats that asked jordan its not the young woman one may take a fancy to she usually costs a good deal  valentine laughed softly and looked hard at jimmy though you earn your bread upon it i think you know theres nothing in this little world to compare with the sea  then he stretched out his hand for the cigarbox ill take two its the brand your directors use saw those frames tomorrow or ill come round and raise the roof for you in the meanwhile if youll come along mr wheelock ill show you my boat  jordan grinned at jimmy better go along youll have to see her anyway  the two went out and left him and as they paddled down the inlet past the endless ranks of climbing pines whose aromatic odors were heavy in the dewchilled air valentine glanced at his companion  this world was made good except the cities but nothing was made much better than that smell he said it doesnt put unrest and longing into you like the smell of the seagrass and the sting of the powdered spray theres tranquillity and sound sleep in it and too it gives one comprehension  this was not what jimmy would have expected from his companion but he understood in that deep rift of the ranges where no wild wind ever entered and the sunlight called up clean healing savors from the solemn pines one could realize that there was a beneficent purpose behind the scheme of things and that the world was good still jimmy usually kept any fancies of that kind to himself  the introduction seems familiar he said i almost fancy i have heard something very much like it before  its quite likely and valentine laughed it has been said of several other things including tobacco  you come here often  usually to refit its quiet and clean and i like jordan hes a man with a mind and straight so far as it can be expected of any one in business  you dont follow any  valentine smiled somewhat curiously im a pariah i take toll of the deer and halibut instead of my fellowmenthat is except when i charter the boat now and then still its only when money is scarce that i shoot and fish for the market you see im not in any sense of the word a yachtsman i live at sea because i like it the boat makes an economical home  jimmy felt that this was as much as he was intended to know and he asked no more questions until presently they slid alongside a powerful cutter of some thirty tons which lay moored with an anchor outshore and a breastrope to the pines valentine took him into the little plainly fitted forecastle where he lived and afterwards led him through the ornate saloon and whiteenameled aftercabin that he said as they went up the ladder again is for the charterers though im by no means sure the next lot will be pleased its a little difficult to get the smell of halibut out of her  you sail her alone asked jimmy who sat down on the skylights  generally wages run high in this country but i have to ship a man or two when any of the city people charter her shes not so much of a handful when you get used to her  he did not seem to expect jimmy to talk and they sat silent a while the latter smoking thoughtfully as he looked about him it was growing dark and the lower pines were wrapped in fleecy mist out of which a rigid branch rose raggedly here and there but the heights of the range still cut hard and sharp against the cold blueness of the evening sky westward a soft smoky glow burned faintly behind a great hill shoulder and for no sound reached them from the little settlement it was impressively still  jimmy felt the vague influence of the country creeping over him it is a land of wild grandeur empty for the most part as yet though it is rich in coal and iron as well as in gold and silver and its hillsides are draped with forests whose timber would supply the world it is also as he seemed to feel for the bold man a land of possibilities enterprise and even labor is worth a good deal there and jimmy felt that if his heart were stout enough such a land might have more to offer him than a mates berth on a heavily mortgaged schooner jordan evidently believed that one might achieve affluence by making the requisite effort and jimmy considered himself equally as capable as the sawmiller still as he sat there in the dewy stillness breathing the clean scent of the pines he realized that there was also something to be said for his companions attitude he asked and strove for nothing but was content to live and enjoy what was so bountifully given him perhaps valentine guessed where his thoughts were leading him for once more he broke into his little soft laugh  one is as well off here as in the cities he said are you one of the hustlers like jordan yonder  though it was growing dark jimmy disregarding the question looked at him thoughtfully do you know have you tried the other thing  oh yes said valentine with a wry smile in his eyes i have tried them both and that is one reason why im here you havent answered me though after all i guess its an unnecessary question  this time jimmy laughed i dont know that i have any option it seems that a life of the kind jordan leads will be forced on me there are circumstances in which ones inclinations dont count for very much you see anyway its almost time i turned in ive been loading lumber since early morning  valentine got into the dory and paddled him to the little wharf where the tyee was lying  come off again and any time you see the boat along the coast ill expect you on board he said  jimmy climbed on board the schooner and descending to the little cabin found his father lying propped up in his bunk his eyes were more watery than ever and when he spoke his voice was a trifle thick the light of the fishoil lamp projected his worn face blackly in gaunt profile on the bulkhead  been talking to jordan hes a man to make friends with he said guess he and the other young ones with blood and grit in them are going to set their mark on this country it maynt count against you if you leave the mailboats jimmy manhood stands first here though my day has gone perhaps i fooled my chances or didnt see them when they came but youre going to be smarter you have red blood and brains  jimmy said nothing he had noticed already that tom wheelock had fallen into a habit of inconsequent rambling and there were times when it pained him to listen the old man who did not seem to notice his silence went on  you got them from your mother as eleanor has done she diedand im often thankfulbefore the bad days came guess it would break her heart if she could see her husband now a playedout broken man with a bond on which he cant pay the interest on his last vessel maybe things would have been different if she had lived i was never smart at businessi am a sailormanand it was your mother who showed me how to build the fleet up and save the money to buy each new boat when you went to sea we had four of them now theyre all gone the last was the fishhawk and she lies in six fathoms where she drove across the qualyclot reef with her starboard bilge ground in  merril doesnt own the tyee yet said jimmy  no said wheelock drowsily but unless you know enough to stop him hes going to youll have nothing jimmy when im gone but youll remember it was that man squeezed the blood out of me anyway it wont be long im played out and kind of tired of it all couldnt worry through without your mother never was smart at businessi am a sailorman it was she who made me boss of the wheelock fleet and now i guess shes waiting for the old and broken man  his elbow slipped from under him and falling back he lay inert and silent with eyes that slowly closed and his face showing very gaunt and unhealthily pallid in patches under the fishoil lamp there was no longer any suggestion of strength in it for dejection had slackened his mental grip as indulgence had sapped the vigor of his body jimmy wheelock who remembered what his father had been felt a haze creep across his eyes as he gazed at him and then a sudden thrill of anger seemed to fill his blood with fire merril who held a bond on the tyee had it seemed a good deal to answer for     chapter iv  in the toils   it was a month later when jimmy wheelock stood leaning on the tyees rail one morning while she lay alongside a sawmill wharf at vancouver the siwash deckhand had left them and jimmy who had done his work was very hot and grimy after trimming ballast in the hold he and prescott were waiting for another few loads of it and expected that the tyee would go to sea shortly after they got them this however was by no means certain since a surveyor had come on board a few days ago and tom wheelock who had been summoned to merrils office had not yet come back  it was then about eleven oclock and the broad inlet sparkled in a blaze of sunshine with a fresh breeze that came off from the black pine forests crisping it into little splashing ripples jimmy was glad of the chill of it on his dripping face and as grateful for the respite from toil with the shovel as he gazed at the climbing city it rose with the dark pines creeping close up to it ridged with mazy wires and towering poles roof above roof up the low rise and the air was filled with the sound of its activity a train of ponderous freightcars rolled clanging along the wharf a great locomotive with tolling bell was backing more cars in and the scream of saws rang stridently through the clatter of the winches as empress liner and sound steamer hove their cargo in jimmy wheelock had of course gazed upon a similar scene in other ports but there was he seemed to feel a difference here  in this new land the toiler was not bound by iron laws of caste and custom forever to his toil the mountain province was awakening to a recognition of its wealth and there was room in it and to spare for men with brains as well as men with muscle there were forests to be cleared roads to be built and mine adits to be driven and nobody troubled himself greatly about the antecedents of his hired hand if the latter professed himself able to do what was required of him he was as they say in that country given a show jimmy also knew that where all were ready to attempt the impossible and toiled as except in the new west man has seldom toiled before it was the english sailormen runagates from their vessels who had built the most perilous railroad trestles and marched with the vanguard when the treasureseekers pushed their way into the wilderness of rock and snow he felt as he listened to the scream of the saws and the tolling of the locomotive bells that amid all that feverish activity there must be some scope for him which was reassuring since it was becoming clear that he would have to find some means of supporting himself and his father before very long  then he looked around as prescott who touched his arm pointed to a trim white cutter which was sliding through the flashing water with an inclined spire of sail above her and a swath of foam at her lee bow  i guess thats valentines sorata he said got the biggest topsail on her and she has a deckplank in if shed only her lower canvas most men would find her quite a big handful to sail alone its when he rounds up to his mooring the circus will begin  the sorata came straight on toward them closehauled on the wind until they could hear the hissing of the brine that swept a foot deep along her slanted deck then there was a banging of canvas and she swung as on a pivot while a bent figure with its back against her tiller became furiously busy slanting sharply she drove away on the other tack and shot in with canvas shaking between a great fourmasted ship and a steamer with white tiers of decks then her headsails dropped and she stopped with a big iron buoy which valentine seized with his boathook close beneath her bowsprit after that there was a rattle of chain and prescott made a gesture of approval  smart he said i guess there are not many men in this province who could have brought her up in that berth without another hand on board  valentine appeared to see them for he waved his hand but the next minute jimmy who looked around lost his interest in him for tom wheelock was coming slowly across the wharf he walked wearily with head bent and dejection expressed in every languid movement prescotts face grew troubled as he glanced at him  i guess were not going to sea today he said your father has more to carry than he can stand thatmerril has been putting the screw on him  wheelock dropped somewhat heavily upon the tyees deck and though they looked at him questioningly he said nothing to either of them as he made his way to the little aftercabin when he reached it he sat down and wiped his forehead before he poured himself out a stiff drink of whisky then he made a little hopeless gesture as he turned to jimmy who stood at the foot of the ladder with prescott in the scuttle behind him  youll stop loading that ballast he said im fixed this time i guess merril has the ship carpenters to come on board tomorrow and as far as i can figure eight hundred dollars wont see them clear besides that its a sure thing well lose the coast mill contract  jimmy said nothing but he set his lips tight and tom wheelock had finished his whisky before he looked at him again his eyes were halfclosed and he sat huddled and limp with one hand trembling on his glass a broken man  carpenters will be here tomorrow i guess theres no use stopping themive got to see the thing right out he said still you can tell the boys we dont want that ballast i feel kind of shaky and im going to lie down not as strong as i used to be jimmy and i havent quite got over that thump i got against the rail  jimmy made a sign to prescott and went up the ladder and when he stood on deck the grizzled sailorman wondered at the change in him there was no geniality in his blue eyes now and his face was set and grim for pity was struggling within him with a vindictive hatred of the man who had brought his father down tom wheelock it was evident had been brought low in more ways than one  if youll see about that ballast ill go straight to merrils office i want this thing made clear he said  well advised prescott id walk round a few blocks first you want to simmer down before you talk to a man like that go slow and get a round turn on your temper  jimmy who made no answer swung himself up on the wharf and it was not until he had traversed part of the waterfront that he remembered it might have been advisable to change his clothes he was still clad in blue jean freely smeared with the red soil that he had been shoveling in the hold and his face and hands were grimy and damp with perspiration still that did not seem to matter greatly since after all it was a costume quite in accordance with his station the days when he had worn a naval uniform had passed  striding into an office in a great stone building he accosted a clerk who said that mr merril was busy and then appeared to grow a trifle disconcerted under jimmys gaze the latter smiled at him grimly  then its probably fortunate that im not busy at all he said in fact im quite prepared to stay here until this evening and since there seems to be only one door to the place it will perhaps save mr merril inconvenience if he sees me now you can explain that to him  the clerk who grinned at one of his companions disappeared and coming back ushered the insistent visitor into a sumptuously furnished office and when the door closed behind him jimmy was a little astonished to find himself as collected as he had ever been in his life he was one of the men who do not quite realize their own capabilities until driven by necessity into strenuous action an elderly gentleman with a pallid and somewhat expressionless face dressed with a precision not altogether usual in that country looked up at him  well he said inquiringly  jimmy drew forward a chair and sat down uninvited you know my name he said i want to understand exactly why you are sending those carpenters on board the schooner  merril looked at him gravely but jimmy did not appear to find his gaze in any way troublesome  i dont think you have anything to do with the matter he said still out of courtesy  no interrupted jimmy im not asking a favor only anticipating things a little it is i am afraid quite likely that i shall have to take over the schooner before very long  then in accordance with a clause in the agreement the vessel must be kept in efficient repair to the satisfaction of a qualified surveyor the man i sent down reports that she needs a new mast decks relaid and a good deal of new planking about her waterline your father has particulars  i suppose said jimmy very quietly there would be nothing gained by asking you to allow the repairs to stand over until we have brought down one or two more loads of lumber i expect you know it will cost us the sawmill contract if we lay the schooner off now  merril made a little gesture im afraid not i cant afford to take the risk of having the schooner lost to oblige you and the fact that you may not carry out the sawmill contract naturally does not concern me  has it occurred to you that we might question your surveyors report half the repairs are quite unnecessary as you no doubt know why the man recommended them is of course a question im not going into though it wouldnt be very difficult to hit on the reason there are however other men of his profession in this city  again merril looked at him steadily with a faint sardonic gleam which was more galling than anger in his eyes you will of course do what you consider advisable but if the repairs are not made i shall apply for an injunction to stop you from going to sea and the law is somewhat costly the redemption instalment and interest are overdue and if your father has any money with him one would fancy it would be more prudent for him to settle his obligations than to give it to the lawyers  jimmy realized that this was incontrovertible unless the arrears were paid within a fixed time merril could foreclose on the vessel and sell her to somebody acting in concert with him which was no doubt what he wished to do there was it seemed no wriggling out of his grip and though he felt it would be useless jimmy resolved to appeal to his sense of fairness  so far as i can figure you have been paid in interest and charges about forty cents on every dollar you lent and you still hold a bond for the original amount he said that would be enough to satisfy most men and all we ask is a little time and consideration you could let those repairs stand over and could wait a while for your interest it will most certainly be paid if we can keep hold of the sawmill contract  im afraid you are wasting time and merril glanced at the papers before him there are several reasons which make it necessary for me to insist on your fathers carrying out the conditions of his bond he owes me a good deal of money now  a hard glint crept into jimmys blue eyes and there was a trace of hoarseness in his voice i want you to understand that it will crush him he said he is an old and broken man and you would lose nothing by a little clemency i will take every dollar of his debts upon myself  im sorry but it cant be helped said merril with a shrug of his shoulders which seemed to suggest that his patience was becoming exhausted the conditions laid down must be carried out  jimmy rose slowly every nerve in him tingled though there was only the ominous scintillation in his eyes to indicate what he was feeling laying one hand on merrils desk he looked down at him and they faced each other so for perhaps half a minute the man who held in his grasp many a small industry in that province shrank inwardly beneath the sailors gaze  then said jimmy with a slow forcefulness that was the more impressive because of the restraint he put upon himself you shall have your money and everything else that is due you if i live long enoughallmy fathers debt will certainly be paid  he went out and merril to whom an interview of this description was not exactly a novelty was for once a little uneasy in his mind there was a certain suggestion of steadfastness in the seafarers manner that he did not like and he felt that he could be relied on to keep his promise if the opportunity were afforded him still the bondholder fancied it would not be insuperably difficult to contrive that the occasion did not arise  next day the carpenters duly arrived on board the tyee and when they took possession there was nothing for any one else to do which was partly why it happened that jimmy sat smoking on the skylights of the soratas saloon one hot afternoon he had told valentine who lay near him on the warm deck part of his troubles there was scarcely a breath of air and the smoke of the big mills hung in a long trail above the oily inlet and floated in a filmy cloud athwart the towering pines the tapping of the carpenters mallets on board the tyee came faintly across the water  it will be three weeks anyway before you get your new deck in and it may be longer said valentine all the carpenters on this coast are going up to the new railroad trestles where theyre getting almost any price they ask what are you going to do in the meanwhile  jimmy said he did not know and was sorry this was the case he had discovered that board costs a good deal in that country and while the tyee was practically gutted it would be necessary to live ashore valentine appeared to ruminate and then looked up at him  well he said reflectively im going up the coast and i want an experienced skipper thats easy because i know too much about charterers to let them have my boat without taking me yachtings just becoming popular here next theres to be a capable cook and that could be contrived because although louis is about the worst cook i know they neednt find it out until were well away to sea the third man is the difficulty hes to be warranted sober reliable and intelligent since he may be required to take the young ladies out fishing in the dory all to be civil and clean and provided with suitable uniform its in the charter they appear to be particular people  jimmy laughed evidently still i dont quite see what it all has to do with me since im not going wheres the man you had when you took the last party  on the wharf hell never come back again with me he was a bluewater man and one day he broke loose and got at the charterers whisky tried to kiss one of the young ladies as he was carrying her on board the dory and though i threw him in afterward her father made considerable unpleasantness over the thing  he stopped a moment and looked at jimmy with a whimsical twinkle in his eyes now i dont know any reason why you shouldnt come if you feel like it you seem reasonably sober and i guess you could be civil charterers arent quite so trying here as one would fancy they are in the old country ive been there but on the pacific slope we havent yet branded the people who work as quite outside the pale you could put on the steamboat jacket and ive an old manowar cap with gold letters on it the man who left it on board the sorata privately discharged himself from one of the pacific squadron it was a dark night and he was almost drowned when i got him well it would bring you twelve dollars a week all foundits what id have to pay another manbesides being a favor to me  jimmy laughed outright he had his cares just then but he was after all a young man of somewhat whimsical temperament and the prospect of the adventure appealed to him the twelve dollars a week were more attractive still since he had reasons for believing that the small sum he had brought with him to vancouver would be badly wanted before very long and while the tyee lay idle he could not trench upon his fathers scanty store  well he said it sounds a crazy kind of thing but that is perhaps why it attracts me ill come  valentine smiled then youll come off early tomorrow and try to remember youre a bluewater man who has hired out to me you want to get yourself up kind of smartly well go below and see what ive got its in the charter  half an hour later jimmy was rowed ashore and he walked back to the wharf where the tyee was lying with for the first time during several weeks a smile in his eyes it would be a relief to forget his troubles for a week or two and his father would not need him in the meanwhile naturally he did not know that the crazy venture on which he had embarked was to have somewhat important results for him as well as for other people     chapter v  valentines paid hand   it was about five oclock in the evening when jimmy stood on the vancouver wharf beside an express wagon from which the teamster had just flung down what appeared to him an inordinate quantity of baggage he was then attired in a steamboat officers jacket from which he had removed a row of buttons as well as the braid on the cuffs an old pair of valentines white duck trousers carefully mended with sailsewing twine a pair of canvas shoes with a burst in one of them and a somewhat dilapidated manowar cap in this getup he expected to pass muster as a professional yachthand though as yet there were very few men who followed that calling in vancouver or victoria had he been brought up in england he might have felt a little more uncomfortable than he did but the average westerner is troubled by no false pride and is usually willing to earn the money he requires by any means available still jimmy was not altogether at ease for he had at least to some extent become endued with his comrades notions during the time he had spent in the mailboats and the english warship  a little farther up the wharf valentine was talking to a grayhaired gentleman whose immaculate blue serge level voice and formal attitude seemed to stamp him as different from the men of the pacific slope who have as a rule no time to waste in considering appearances two young ladies stood not very far away and though the breeze was no more than pleasantly cool one of them was wrapped in a long cloak and shawl jimmy could not see the other very well because of the wagon but when she moved across the wharf her lithe step and graceful carriage at least suggested vigorous health  by and by the rattle of a neighboring steamers winch ceased suddenly and he heard the voice of the elderly gentleman who had been glancing in his direction  i suppose that is your man he said with a clear english intonation couldnt you have got him up a little more smartly that manowar cap for instance is a little out of keeping with the rest of his things  jimmy saw valentines badly suppressed smile and caught his answer he was in one of the warships sir and is a reliable man i can warrant him civil and sober  well said the other we may as well go off while he brings down the baggage  the party moved toward the soratas dory and jimmy was not exactly pleased when he found himself left to carry their baggage which appeared to be unusually heavy down a flight of awkward steps it was not very long since he had stood beside a mailboats hatch and merely raised a hand now and then while her deckhands stowed the baggage under his direction but he found something faintly humorous in the situation until hampered by an awkward load he lost his balance and fell down the steps still he contrived to deposit the charterers possessions at the waters edge and when valentine came back he packed them into the dory and about fifteen minutes later staggered into the little white ladies cabin on board the sorata with a big trunk in his arms one of the girls was busy unstrapping a valise but the other looked around as he came in  put it there she said with a swift glance at him and then though he noticed that apparently she had something in her hand she seemed to change her mind and turned around again  jimmy went out backwards with a faint warmth in his face and when he had brought in the rest of the baggage he went up and assisted louis their third hand to break out the anchor and get the sorata under way she was sliding out through the narrows when he dropped through the scuttle into the forecastle and found valentine filling a tray  its part of your business to carry the baggage he said you want to remember theyre particular people and youre expected to make yourself generally useful and agreeable still i guess theres no need to talk as you would in a mailboats saloon  jimmy took the tray but as it happened the sorata lurched on the wash from a passing steamer as he went through the sliding door in the bulkhead and plunging into the saloon with arms stretched out he fell against the table it was a moment or two before he partly recovered his equanimity and then as he looked about him a hoarse laugh fell through the open skylights to make things worse he fancied that the elderly gentleman cast a suspicious glance at him while he was quite sure that there was a twinkle in one of the young ladies eyes she leaned back somewhat wearily upon a locker cushion and her face was thin and fragile but her companion sat upright and jimmy saw that she also was regarding him she was tall and somewhat large of frame with a quiet face that had something patrician in it and reposeful brown eyes jimmy fancied that she and the others must have heard the laugh above  its only that idiot louis sir he said its a habit he has youll hear him laugh to himself now and then when hes at the helm  then it occurred to him that he was speaking more familiarly than an englishman would probably expect a yachthand to do and pulling himself up abruptly he commenced to lay out the table and pour the coffee  you take sugar miss he asked  she does said the man dryly when a spoon is not available she prefers her own fingers  the delicate girl laughed a little and jimmy felt his face grow warm for he was conscious that her companion was watching him with quiet amusement but he contrived to find the spoons he had forgotten and when he was about to withdraw the girl with the brown eyes made a little sign  i suppose we are at liberty to read any of those books she asked pointing to the hanging shelves they are the skippers  jimmy knew what she was thinking because the works in question were by no means of the kind one would have expected a professional yachthirer to own or to appreciate he also knew that the forecastle slide was open and that valentine was probably listening  of course miss he said take any of them if you can understand them i think its more than the skipper does still he has a little education and bought them cheap at book sales they give a kind of tone to the boat  i see said the girl with the reposeful eyes and jimmy backed out in haste he fancied a little ripple of musical laughter broke out after he had closed the forecastle slide then he glanced deprecatingly at valentine who did not appear by any means pleased with him  i didnt expect too much from you but the last piece of gratuitous foolery might have been left out he said did you ever come across a yacht steward who took passengers into his confidence in the casual way you do  no said jimmy candidly i dont think i ever did now i dont in the least know what came over me but i cant remember ever losing my head in quite the same way before it must have been the way the girl with the brown eyes looked at me in fact she seemed to be looking right through me who is she  miss merril  ah said jimmy a trifle sharply still it doesnt seem to be an unusual name in this country and after all one couldnt hold her responsible for her fathers doingsif she is the one i mean its quite possible they wouldnt please her if she were acquainted with them in fact its distinctly probable  i wonder why you seem so sure of that she is the one you mean  from her face you couldnt expect a girl with a face like that to approve of anything that was not  he saw valentines smile and broke off abruptly anyway it doesnt matter in the least to either of us what is she doing here and who are the others  valentine laughed i dont think i suggested that it did the man is austerly of the crownland offices and english as you can seeone of the men with a family pull on somebody in authority in the old country i believe he was a yachtclub commodore at home the delicate girls his daughter not enough blood in herphthisis too i thinkand its quite likely she has been recommended a trip at sea miss merril is i understand a friend of hers and she evidently knows something of yachting too  what do you know about phthisis  a shadow suddenly crept into valentines brown face well he said quietly as it happens i do know a little too much  jimmy asked no more questions but got his supper and contrived to keep out of the passengers way until about ten oclock that night when he sat at the helm as the sorata fled westward before a fresh breeze to port and very high above her a cold white line of snow gleamed ethereally under the full moon a long roll tipped by flashing froth came up behind her and she swung over it with the foam boiling at her bows and her boom well off rolling so that her topsail which cut black against the moonlight swung wildly athwart the softly luminous blue  jimmy was watching a long sea sweep by and break into a ridge of gleaming froth when miss merril came out from the little companion and stood close beside him with the silvery light upon her she had a soft wrap of some kind about her head and shoulders and though he could not at first see her face the way the fleecy fabric hung emphasized her shapely figure  i wonder whether you would let me steer she asked  for a moment or two jimmy hesitated the sorata was carrying a good deal of sail and running rather wildly while he knew that a very small blunder at the tiller would bring her big mainboom crashing over the result of which might be disaster still there was something in the girls manner which for no reason that he could think of impressed him with confidence he felt that she would not have asked him for the helm merely out of caprice or unless she could steer  well he said remembering he was supposed to be a yachthand we will see what kind of a show you make at it miss take hold and try to keep her bowsprit on the island its the little black smear in the moonlight yonder  the girl apparently had no difficulty in doing it though for a while he crouched upon the sidedeck with a brown hand close beside the ones she laid on the tiller then as feeling reassured he relaxed his grasp she appeared to indicate her hands with a glance  they are really stronger than you seem to think she said and i have sailed a yacht before  jimmy laughed i only thought they were very pretty  the girl looked around at him a moment without indignation but with a grave inquiry in her eyes which jimmy who suddenly remembered the rôle he was expected to play found curiously disconcerting  what made you say that she asked  i really dont know and jimmy had sense enough not to make matters worse by admitting that he had said anything unusual it seemed to come to me naturally perhaps it was because theyarepretty  this time miss merril laughed well she said i should just as soon they were capable but dont you think she would steer easier with the sheet slacked off a foot or two  jimmy had thought so already but while he let the sheet run around a cleat he asked himself whether this was intended as a tactful reminder that he was merely expected to do what was necessary on board the vessel on the whole he did not think it was one has after all a certain license at sea and though he had naturally met young ladies on board the mailboats who apparently found pleasure in treating every man not exactly of their own station with frigid discourtesy he fancied that miss merril differed from them however he sat silent and out of the way upon the soratas counter until presently a lordly fourmasted ship swept up out of the soft blueness of the night  she crossed the soratas bows braced up on the wind and for she carried american cotton sailcloth she gleamed majestically white with four great spires of slanted canvas tapering from the great arch of her courses to the little royals that swayed high up athwart the blue above a long line of dusky hull it was hove up on the side nearest the sorata and the sea frothed white beneath her bows which piled it high in a filmy flashing cloud miss merril could hear the roar of parted water and as the great vessel drove by the refrain of a sighing chantey that fell amidst a sharp clanking from the black figures on her spraydrenched forecastle  ah she said that is a picture to remember i wonder what those men have undergone and where they come from  jimmy smiled presuming that she was addressing him though he could not be sure of it  well he said i should fancy they have borne most everything that a man could be expected to face except want of food while they thrashed her round the horn shes american and if they drive men hard on board their ships they at least usually feed them well  you know what they have done  jimmy laughed and forgot his manowar cap as he saw that she was interested i believe i do theyve crawled out on those long topsail yards probably once every watch by night and day clawing at thundering folds of hard drenched canvas while the ship lay with her rail in the water when the cape horn squalls came down thick with blinding snow then theyve crawled down with bleeding hands and broken nails and flung themselves in their dripping oilskins into a soddened bunk to snatch a couple of hours sleep before they were roused to get sail on her again they have lived for days on cold provisions soaked in brine when the galley fire was drowned out and it is very likely have not stripped a long boot off for a week she carries a high rail but the icy sea that chilled them to the bone has poured across it at every roll  ah said the girl going west it would be to windward in one way its almost an epic i suppose its always more or less like that  yes said jimmy one of the epics nobody has ever written perhaps because nobody really could there are a good many of them as you say when one has to fight to windward things generally happen more or less that way  miss merril turned and looked at him as he sat on the soratas counter in the navy cap and a smile crept into her eyes  still she said perhaps it is after all worth while to face them  they both remembered that afterward but in the meanwhile it did not strike jimmy as in any way incongruous that she should talk to him in such a fashion or credit him with more comprehension than one would expect from a professional yachthand  i dont know he said simply ones heart is apt to fail when one looks forward and sees only the snowsqualls to drive one back to leeward and the steep head seas  then he stood up suddenly with a little laugh as louis came slouching aft from the forecastle scuttle  im relieved and i had better see whether they want anything in the saloon he said  it appeared that they wanted nothing and when he crawled into the forecastle valentine looked at him with evident curiosity  you had apparently a good deal to say to miss merril he observed might one ask what you found to talk about  the last topic was whether it is worth while to hang on and fight ones way to windward when the outlook is black if i understood her correctly she seems to believe it is  valentine grinned sardonically did you discuss it like a german philosopher or as a forecastle hand i suppose it never struck you that its rather an unusual subject for a yachting roustabout to go into with a young lady passenger  it is agreed jimmy making a little deprecatory gesture im afraid i didnt remember that before but it probably doesnt matter since its hardly likely that she did either  his comrade looked at him and shook his head you can believe thatat your age he said my dear man a young woman of miss merrils intelligence would notice anything that wasnt quite in character the moment you said it still that is your affair its the other one im worrying about  the other one  miss austerly the girls very sickprobably worse than her father realizesand its rather on my conscience that i told them that louis could cook anyway if this breeze holds well bring up off victoria early tomorrow and though were not going in ill slip ashore before breakfast and see what one can pick up at the stores  jimmy asked him no more questions but crept into his bunk about nine oclock on the morrow when the sorata was lying in a bight on the south coast of vancouver island he was aroused by the dory bumping alongside and he went out on deck it was then raining hard and all he could see was a stretch of gray sea and a strip of dripping boulder beach on which a little white surf was breaking there was a good deal of water in the dory and valentines oilskins were dripping when he climbed out of her with several packages under his arm stores open early in that country  now he said you can bail her out and come down in half an hour when ive fixed up a breakfast that any one could eat  jimmy did so but it was with some little diffidence that he carried the tray into the saloon it occurred to him that miss merril might regret that she had unbent so far the previous night and he wondered uneasily whether he had ventured further than was advisable he was also conscious for the first time that the repairs valentine had made in his garments were less artistic than evident the girl however looked up with a smile which might have meant anything and afterward confined her attention to the articles he was laying on the table there were chinese preserved dainties and fruit from california as well as the ordinary fare  an unusually good breakfast said austerly does your skipper always treat his charterers so well  yes sir said jimmy that is when he can you see he couldnt get these things in vancouver there isnt the same demand for them as there is in the capital  austerly did not appear altogether satisfied with the ingenious explanation but he said nothing further indeed he was not a man who said very much on any occasion and while he commenced his breakfast miss merril looked at jimmy with her little disconcerting smile still there was no malice in it  she was as fresh that morning as when she came off the previous evening though both austerly and his daughter appeared a trifle the worse for the nights run miss merril was wholly unostentatious in speech or bearing and there was a certain gracious tranquillity about her which suggested latent vigor instead of languidness she was then he decided tolerably correctly in her twentyfifth year brownhaired and browneyed with broad low forehead unusually straight brows and in spite of her smile a curiously steady gaze her face was a full oval her mouth by no means small and while he had seen women of a somewhat similar type whose vigor was tinged with coarseness or a hint of sensuality there was about this girl a certain daintiness of thought and speech and a quiet dignity what she said was however sufficiently prosaic  i presume that means he went to victoria for the extra stores this morning but how did he get there it must be some distance from what i know of the coast and he would have a headwind all the way back  he walked said jimmy its necessary for him one doesnt get very much exercise of that kind at sea in fact he walks miles whenever he can  miss austerly appeared a trifle astonished and her father looked up from his coffee  its a trifle difficult to understand how he manages it he said one would consider the sorata forty feet long  jimmy felt miss merrils gaze upon him and as had happened before his ingenuity failed him her smile vaguely suggested comprehension and for no ostensible reason that disturbed him he also saw louis grinning down at him through the skylights  sugar sir he said and this was so evidently an inspiration that miss austerly laughed and when her father said that he had been offered it twice already jimmy went out with all the haste available he closed the forecastle slide somewhat noisily and then sat down and frowned at valentine  well said the latter dryly been making an exhibition of yourself again  im afraid i have said jimmy if it happens another time you can carry the things in yourself and see how nice it is still i dont quite know why i lost my head i have naturally met quite a few young ladies in my time i suppose its wearing that confounded cap and these more confounded clothes  he kicked one foot out and disgustedly contemplated a burst white shoe while the duck trousers cracked valentine leaned back against the bulkhead and laughed  dont be rash or theyll split and the jackets opening at a seam he said its rather a pity a man cant rise above his clothes anyway you may as well give louis a hand to get the mainsail on to her as soon as theyve finished breakfast well break out the anchor     chapter vi  a vision of the sea   there was rain and thick weather for several days during which the sorata crept northward slowly along the wild west vancouver coast austerly it appeared had business with an indian agent who lived up an inlet near which the restless white prospectors were encroaching on a siwash reserve the boat was wet and clammy everywhere though a bark fire burned in the little saloon stove miss austerly lay for the most part silent on the leeward settee with a certain wistful patience in her hollow face which roused jimmys compassion he noticed that valentines voice was gentler than usual when he mentioned her and wondered why it was so though his comrade did not favor him with an adequate explanation then or afterward  at last one afternoon the drizzle ceased and during most of it miss merril sat at the tiller with jimmys oilskin jacket round her shoulders to shield her from the spray while the sorata drove northward closehauled across the long gray roll of the pacific which was tipped with livid foam sometimes she swung over it with dripping jib hove high but at least as often she dipped her bows in the creaming froth and flung the brine aft in showers while all the time the halfseen shore unrolled itself to starboard in a majestic panorama  great surflapped rocks rose out of the grayness and were lost in it again forests athwart which the vapors streamed in smoky wisps rolled by and at times there were brief entrancing visions of a towering range phantoms of mountains that vanished and appeared again there was water on the leedeck showers of it drove into the drenched mainsails luff but still miss merril sat at the tiller with her damp hair blown about her forehead a patch of carmine in her cheeks and a gleam in her eyes she seemed as she swung with the plunging fabric when the counter rose streaming high above the froth that swept astern wholly in harmony with the motive of the scene and at this jimmy wondered a little now and then though he discovered afterward that anthea merril almost invariably fitted herself to her surroundings there are men and women with that capacity which is perhaps born of comprehension and sympathy  her grasp was firm and steady on the straining helm her gaze quick to notice each gray comber that broke as it came down on them but when he looked at her jimmy saw in her eyes something deeper than the thrill of the encounter with the winds of heaven and the restless sea he could find no fitting name for it it eluded definition but it had its effect and he felt that a man might go far and do more than thrash a yacht to windward with such a companion though he also realized that this was after all no concern of his apart from that her quiet courage and readiness were noticeable though it was perhaps her understanding that appealed most to him anthea merril never asked an unnecessary question she seemed able to grasp ones thoughts and motives in a fashion that set those with whom she conversed at their ease and when in her company jimmy usually forgot his yachthands garments and the manowar cap  it was toward sunset that evening and miss austerly was sitting well wrapped up on a locker in the cockpit when the vapor melted and was blown away as not infrequently happens about that time at sea the dingy clouds that veiled the sky were rent and a blaze of weird coppery radiance smote the tumbling seas which changed under it to smears of incandescent whiteness with ruddy gleams in them and ridges of flashing green it was sudden and bewildering impelling one to hold ones breath but a more glorious pageant leaped out of the dimness over the starboard hand walls of rock that burned with many colors sprang into being with somber pines streaming upward behind them and far aloft there were lifted gleaming heights of nevertrodden snow whose stainless purity was intensified by their gray and turquoise shadows  the vision was vouchsafed them steeped in an immaterial splendor for perhaps five minutes and then it faded as though it had never been miss austerly who had gazed at it rapt and eagereyed drew in her breath  ah she said if it was only to see that i am glad i cameit may be the last time  jimmy who was sitting on the skylights saw the apprehension in anthea merrils eyes as she glanced down for a moment into the fragile face of her companion and he fancied that valentine did so too but the girl smiled wistfully  still she said it is a good deal to have seen the glory of this world and one would almost fancy that other onewhere the sea is glassycould not be much more beautiful  there was a hint of reproach in anthea merrils quiet voice which reached jimmy  nellie she said you have morbid fancies now and then we brought you on this trip to make you cheerful and strong  the sick girl smiled again and the pallor of her fragile face intensified the faint shining of her eyes i think you know that i shall never get strong again and after all why should i wish to stay here when i may leave my pains and weaknesses behind me you cant understand that you have the vigor of the sea in youand the world before you  it apparently occurred to valentine that he was hearing too much for he stood up swaying while the sorata plunged and called to austerly through one of the open skylights of the saloon  well have the breeze down on us twice as hard in a few minutes sir and theres an inlet we could lie snug in not far astern he said its quite likely we might come across a siwash or two who would pole you up the river at the head of the inlet to within easy reach of the agents place tomorrow  very well said austerly you can run her away  it appeared advisable for the sorata buried her bows in a smother of frothing brine and dipped her leedeck deep as a blast swept down valentine glanced at miss merril somewhat dubiously  do you think you could jibe her all standing he asked  jimmy almost expected anthea merril to say that she could not for unless the helmsman is skilful when a cutterrigged craft is brought round stern to a fresh breeze her great mainsail with the ponderous boom along the foot of it is apt to swing over with disastrous violence there was however no hesitation in the girls face and valentine made a little gesture that implied rather more than resignation  when youre ready he said stand by jimmy  they laid hands on the hard wet sheet and while the girl swayed with the helm and the sorata came round stern to sea dragged the big mainboom in foot by foot until it hung over them lifting with the great bellying sail ready to swing then though nobody knew quite how it happened jimmy got a loose turn of the rope about his arm as a sea washed in across the counter in another second or two the boom would swing over and it seemed very probable that his arm would at least be broken while the tightening hemp ground into his flesh he saw the color ebb in valentines face and then the girls voice reached him sharp and insistent  now was all she said  the soratas bows swung a trifle further and no more the boom went up with a jerk and while the blood started from jimmys compressed arm came down again for a second the turn of rope slackened and he shook it clear then the sheet whirred through the quarterblocks as the great sail swung over and the sorata rolled until one side of her was deep in the foam she shook herself out of it and jimmy who forgot the manowar cap and what he was supposed to be saw the girls eyes fixed on him with a faint smile in them and made her a little inclination he felt that she was asking him a question  thank you he said simply i dont think i was unduly frightened i seemed to know you would not fail me  anthea merril made no answer but a slight flush crept into her cheek she was very human and it was in one sense an eloquent compliment then jimmy went forward to haul the staysail down though he found he had to do it with one hand and he was kept busy until he went down with valentine into the little forecastle when the sorata lay snug in a strip of still green water close beneath the dusky pines louis had just gone ashore with the dory to gather bark for fuel and for the scuttle was open they could hear the splash of his oars through the deep stillness that was emphasized by the murmur of falling water valentine sat on a locker with the lamplight on his bronzed face which was a trifle grave  rain again and id sooner lose my next charter than have bad weather now he said  why asked jimmy  his comrade made a sign of impatience didnt you hear what that girl saidit was the last time she knew that she was right too though its probably only natural that her father wouldnt believe it a last treat shes gettingand shes as fond of the sea as i am or you are either  jimmy did not know why he smiled but perhaps it was because he was stirred a little and did not wish to show it in any case valentine frowned at him  oh yes he said i know its a dogs life and other things but you wouldnt quit it anyway and thats not the question cant you understand what that sickly girls life has been with all that other women might expect to have denied her  there was a certain hoarse insistence in valentines inquiry from which it seemed to jimmy who had noticed the solicitude with which he had endeavored to minister in every way to the comfort or pleasure of their delicate passenger that his companion had some special reason for understanding what the girls lot had been  well he said reflectively one would suppose that to be born foredoomed is hard upon such as miss austerly  valentine made a little abrupt gesture its evident they once had a yacht of their own any one could see how fond of it she is and im taking her fathers moneyhe hasnt too much of itlike amoneylender that she may have a last taste of the one thing she can take pleasure in lord when one has so much for nothing what selfish hogs we are  it cant be helped anyway you couldnt offer a favor to a man like austerly  no and valentine frowned hes a man with all the condemned prejudices of his class and he would naturally sooner see his daughters one wish ungratified after all women now and then rate the value of things more justly than we do theres miss merril who came with them and somehow it was she who brought this trip about she has her pride full measure of it but she has sense as well sense of proportion and if we had only her to deal with wed let every other charter slide and go south tomorrow to find the summer  jimmy was not in the least astonished he had of course listened to a certain amount of forecastle ribaldry though after all conversation and badinage of that nature is at least as frequent in a mailboats smokingroom but he knew the ways of his fellows and it seemed a very natural thing to him that valentine the pariah should in his own fashion reveal these depths of chivalrous compassion he had seen hardhanded men of coarse fiber do many a gentle deed with a curse on their lips that was probably worth a good deal more than a conventional platitude still it would have been wholly extraordinary if he had mentioned anything of this  one would fancy miss merril has a good deal of character he said  too much for the man she marries if theres anything small and mean in him thats a girl with a capacity for doing more than sail a boat to windward well and she will probably expect a good deal in one way theres something humorous in the fact that her father is one of the est rogues in this province though there are naturally a good many people who look up to him of course she isnt aware of it yet brought up back east i believe and somebody told me she had lived a good deal with her mothers people it probably means trouble for her when she understands the reality  he rose with a little shrug of his shoulders im talking like an old woman and these things have nothing to do with us we have our wet watches to keep at sea and perhaps we are better off than the rest of them because that is all you can turn in if you want to ill wait for louis  five minutes later jimmy crawled into his bunk and fell fast asleep when he awakened he found that the day had broken still and sunny there was a siwash rancherie a mile or two up the inlet and when an indian had been found who would carry a message through the forest austerly who never forgot what was due to a crownland official decided to stay where he was and allow the agent to visit him he was not in any way an active man and appeared quite content to sit in the cockpit reading when valentine who had procured a siwash river canoea long light shell of cedar with some two feet beamoffered to take his daughter up the inlet to see the rancherie miss austerly was pleased to go with him and anthea merril who watched the knifeedge craft slide away turned to jimmy  if you will get the trollingspoon i will go fishing she said  yes miss said jimmy touching his capa thing that is very seldom done in western canada hauling the dory alongside he handed her into it then he dipped the oars and they slid slowly up the inlet with the silver and vermilion spoon trailing astern he had laid valentines shotgun across the thwarts  the lane of clear green water was perhaps two hundred yards wide and the stately pines which shroud all that lonely coast rose in somber ranks on either side distilling their drowsy fragrance as their motionless needles dried in the sun there was not a sound when the splash of valentines paddle died away and jimmy dipped his oars leisurely now and then venturing a glance at his companion it seemed to him that the big white hat she wore became her wonderfully well and it is possible that she guessed as much and did not resent it for jimmy was after all a personable man  your skipper is very good to nellie austerly she said i am rather pleased with him because of it there are naturally not many things in which she can take any great interest  i suppose said jimmy reflectively there are people who would consider it good of him but in one way it really isnt it doesnt cost him anything and he cant help it that man would do what he could for anybody who didnt want to take advantage of him whats more he would do it almost without realizing what he was about  do you know why he lives as he does at sea  i dont probably because he likes it  anthea merril smiled is that all it has not occurred to you that there is perhaps a reason why he and nellie austerly understand each other  both fond of the sea  that mightnt go far enough nellie has had to give up so much or rather it has been taken away from her you can understand that  jimmy nodded assent it had already occurred to him that his comrade was a man who had lost something he greatly valued and it did not appear incongruous that miss merril should be speaking in this familiar fashion to him in fact she frequently contrived to make him forget that he was valentines hired hand and wore the manowar cap  what would a boat like the sorata cost to build she asked  perhaps four thousand dollars in this country  ah said the girl and with that sum one could probably set up a store buy one of the little sawmills near a rising settlement or start on one of the other paths that are supposed to lead to affluence  jimmy laughed supposing he owned the big hastings mill what more could it offer a man with his views as he will tell you he gets what he likes almost for nothing he may be right too after all it is clean dirt one has to eat at sea  there are not many men who could live as he does the rest would go to pieces and isnt it rather shirking a responsibility  you mean that one ought to make money  i think one ought to take ones part in the struggle that is going to make this the greatest province in the dominion but not exactly for that reason then miss merril apparently decided to change the subject you had a good halibut season  jimmy saw the twinkle in her eyes and understood it i hadnt im afraid i wouldnt know a halibut when i saw it there are one believes plenty of them but so far very few people go fishing  then you were probably killing the americans seals  i wasnt i am i may mention mate on board a lumbercarrying schooner  his companions nod might have meant anything i fancied she said you had not gone to sea very often as a yachthand  jimmy who was uncertain what she wished him to understand pulled on leisurely until as they crept along the shore a widening ripple that spread from beyond a point caught his eye and laying down the oars he reached for the gun  i was told to bring back a duck for miss austerly if i could he said you dont mind  anthea merril made a sign of indifference and the dory slid on until as they opened up a little bay jimmy flung up the gun for a slowly moving object swam in the midst of it then he felt a hand on his arm and a voice said sharply put it down  jimmy did so before he saw the reason and it was a moment later when he noticed a string of little fluffy bodies stretched out from the shore the mother bird paddled toward them and disregarding her own danger strove to drive them back among the boulders then he saw the curious gleam that was half anger and half compassion in his companions eyes and felt his face grow a trifle hot  i didnt know he said it must be an unusually late brood i never noticed them i shouldnt like you to think i did  open the gun and take out the cartridges ordered his companion  very well miss said jimmy who could not resist the impulse of adding with a whimsical twinkle in his eyes shall i take off the trollingspoon  anthea merril laughed no she said still i cant complain of the suggestion head out from shore and row faster  jimmy said nothing further but busied himself with his oars he had discovered by this time that he could talk more or less confidentially with anthea merril only when it was her pleasure that he should do so and she was able to make it clear when that time had gone still he did not for a moment believe she would have been more gracious had her companion not happened to be the soratas paid hand     chapter vii  blown off   the evening was cool and clear anthea merril and jimmy followed an indian path that wound through the primeval bush on the one hand a great smoothscarped wall of rock ran up far above the trees that clung about its feet into the wondrous green transparency but the light was dying out down in the hollow where towering fir and cedar clustered they were great of girth and very old and beneath them there was silence and solemnity  jimmy who carried his companions sketching materials went first to clear the dewwet fern away and the girl walked behind him silently but this was not because there had been any change in her attitude toward him indeed a certain camaraderie had grown up between them during the few days they had spent fishing and wandering in the bush and there was after all nothing astonishing in this for jimmy was guilty of no presumption and social distinctions which are indeed not very marked in that country do not count for much in the wilderness still that camaraderie had been a revelation to him and he was uneasily aware that during the rest of his life he would look back upon the time when he had been miss merrils guide and attendant  they had been up the bank of a river that afternoon and the girl who had spent an hour or two sketching a peak of the range had remained behind with jimmy when the rest had retraced their steps to the inlet lest miss austerly should suffer from the chill of the dew the two were accordingly coming back alone which indeed had happened several times before it was anthea who spoke at last  it will be dark very soon and it might have been wiser if we had gone back the way the others did she said still this trail looked nearer i suppose it must come out at the inlet  oh yes said jimmy i can hear the river though it doesnt seem to be quite where i expected the others will be on the beach by now  i shouldnt like to keep nellie there said anthea still i scarcely think they would wait long  of course not said jimmy tom is as careful of her as if she were his sister and they wouldnt worry about our not turning up to go off with them theyre probably getting used to it by this time  he realized next moment that this was perhaps not a particularly tactful observation but he could not see his companions face and as had happened before he had sense enough not to make things worse by any attempt to explain it which anthea merril who recognized that he had spoken unreflectively of course noticed what she thought of himand she had naturally formed certain opinionsdid not appear until some time later  in a few minutes he stopped abruptly where the trail wound round a screen of salmonberry for a creek came splashing down across their way it appeared to be at least two feet deep and when his companion saw it she turned to him with a little exclamation  oh she said how are we going to get across we certainly cant go back  im afraid not and jimmy glanced dubiously at the sliding water it will be dark in half an hour and this bush is bad enough to get through in the daylight ill go in anyway and see how deep it is  he plodded through rather above his knees in water which was mostly freshly melted snow and then turned and looked at the girl as she stood regarding him somewhat curiously from the opposite bank the light had not quite gone yet and he could see her standing tall and supple and shapely with her white serge skirt gathered in one hand and a patch of crimson wineberries at her feet the great brownandgray trunk of a redwood behind her forced up the fine outline of her figure and made a fitting background for the delicate coloring of the face that was turned toward him then as had happened once or twice before a little thrill ran through the man and he glanced down at the sliding water  you cant wade through and theres no use trying to look for a spot where its not running quite so fast i dont think a siwash could get through this bush he said  he stopped somewhat abruptly and was glad that the girl met his glance without wavering as she said well  jimmys tone was deprecatory theres only one way miss merril i must carry you over  anthea laughed though it cost her a slight effort she was at least glad that he had addressed her unconcernedly and as a yachthand would she was also quite aware that young ladies who go rowing in small dories or venture into the wilderness have to submit to being carried occasionally but for all that she would sooner the suggestion had been made by another man  do you really think you could she asked  jimmys eyes twinkled which was more reassuring than any sign of embarrassment  well he said reflectively and again she was pleased that he was very matteroffact and had sense enough to drop back into his rôle i guess im used to carrying threeinch redwood planks  he came splashing through the water though he did not look at her and in a moment or two she felt his arms about her she wondered vaguely whether he had often carried any one else for it was at least evident that he knew exactly what he meant to do and she recognized the strength the sea had given him as he stepped down easily into the creek holding her high above the water with the loose folds of her skirt wrapped about her anthea was reasonably substantial as she was of course aware but though he twice floundered a little in the depths of a pool he set her down safe on the other side and stood before her with flushed forehead which was as she promptly realized in one respect a mistake he said nothing and did not indeed look at her but as he drew in a deep breath from the physical effort she glanced at him and saw something in his face that suggested restraint that spoiled everything  it is getting late she said quietly doesnt the path go on again  they turned away jimmy walking first for which she was thankful because the moment or two when they had stood silent had been more than enough there was nothing for which she could blame the man his demeanor had been everything that one could have expected but she had seen the momentary light in his eyes and the tightening of his lips and knew that their relations could never be exactly what they had been something had come about for the fact that he had found it necessary to put a restraint upon himself had made a change perhaps he felt that silence was inadvisable and once more she appreciated the good sense that prompted him to talk much as a seaman would have done of the straightness of the shadowy redwoods they passed and their value as masts though this was naturally not a subject that greatly interested her  when they reached the beach they found that valentine had left them the siwash canoe and the rest with the exception of nellie austerly were sitting in the soratas cockpit when jimmy paddled alongside miss merril furnished a suitable explanation of their delay but she overlooked the fact that valentine was acquainted with the bush about that inlet  you must have struck the creek he said i should have remembered to tell you about it  he looked at jimmy but the latter wisely decided to leave it to miss merril and turned his attention to the canoe he felt that she was competent to handle the matter  i was almost waistdeep when i last went through said valentine who did not display his usual perspicacity how did you get across  anthea dismissed the subject with perfect composure then there could not have been anything like so much water jimmy helped me over  jimmy went forward and disappeared through the scuttle into the forecastle and some little while later valentine came down and looked at him with a dry smile  i dont yet understand how miss merril got across that creek he said  i fancied she told you and jimmy felt his face grow warm  valentine laughed perhaps she did but it seems to me that she wasnt remarkably explicit  jimmy said nothing and presently climbed into his berth where he lay for a while trying to recall every incident of the journey he and anthea merril had made through the shadowy bush until it occurred to him that he was only preparing trouble for himself by doing so and he went to sleep  it was raining when he awoke and it rained for most of three days as hard as it often does on that coast until the crystal depths of the inlet grew turbid and it flowed seaward between its dripping walls of mountains like a river at last one afternoon the clouds were rolled away and when fierce glaring sunshine beat down austerly decided that he would go ashore to fish the men went with him valentine to pull the dory into the swollen river jimmy and louis in the siwash canoe to gather bark for fuel when they approached the beach where they usually landed jimmy glanced thoughtfully at the great tornup pines that went sliding by  if one of those logs drove across her it might start a plank he said besides theres every sign of a vicious breeze and i think ill go off by and by and swing her in behind the next point she would lie snugger there out of the stream  valentine looked up at the hard blue sky across which ragged cloudwisps were driving and nodded it generally does blow quite fresh after rain like what we have had he said you could break the anchor out yourself i want louis to get a good load of bark  jimmy went ashore with louis who carried a big axe but by and by he left the latter busy and wandered back to the beach he did not like the angry glare of sunlight and the way the wind fell in whirling gusts down the steep hillside as it happened another big log drove by while he stood among the boulders and remembering that the two girls were alone in the yacht he launched the canoe and sat still just dipping the paddle while the stream swept him down to the sorata when he boarded her she was swinging uneasily in a swirl of muddy current and anthea who sat in the cockpit appeared pleased to see him  one would almost fancy it was going to blow very hard she said  jimmy laughed i believe it is but we should be snug against anything in the little cove yonder with a rope or two ashore i wonder whether you could sheer her for me while i break out the anchor  the girl went to the tiller and while jimmy standing forward plied the little winch the cable slowly rattled in then he broke out the anchor and the boat slid astern until a cove where dark fir branches stretched out over the still deep water opened up dropping the anchor he turned to the girl  starboard he said  anthea shoved over her tiller but the sorata did not swing into the cove as jimmy had expected her to do for a blast that set the pines roaring fell from the hillside and drove her out from the shore jimmy let more chain run and stood still looking about him when he felt the anchor grip the sunlight had faded obscured by ragged clouds the tall pines swayed above him and the sorata had swung well out athwart the stream  since i cant kedge her with this breeze ill take a line ashore and warp her in he said  it appeared advisable for there were more pinelogs coming down and he pitched a coil of rope into the canoe but the rest as he discovered was much more difficult jimmy had been used to boats in which one could stand up and row while a siwash river canoe is a very different kind of craft as a result he several times almost capsized her and lost a good deal of ground when a gust struck her lifted prow so that some time had passed when the line brought him up still a few yards from the beach he looked around at the sorata with a shout  i want a few more fathoms he called can you fasten on the other line miss merril  he saw the girl who moved forward along the deck stop and clutch at a shroud but that was all for just then the dark firs roared and the water seethed white about him as he plied the paddle the canoe turned around in spite of him drove out into the stream and while he strove desperately to steer her struck the sorata with a crash the boat lifted her side a little as he swung himself on board and there was a curious harsh grating forward anthea who stepped down into the cockpit had lost her hat and her hair whipped her face  i think she has started her anchor she said  jimmy was sure of it when he ran forward and let several fathoms of chain run without bringing her up for the bottom was apparently shingle washed down from the hillside  well have to get the kedge over he said  he dropped unceremoniously into the saloon where miss austerly lay on the settee and tore up the floorings beneath which as space is valuable on board a craft of the soratas size the smaller anchor is sometimes kept he could not however find it anywhere and when he swung himself hot and breathless out on deck the yacht was driving seaward stern foremost taking her anchor with her while the whole inlet was ridged with lines of white anthea merril looked at him with suppressed apprehension in her eyes  we must get a warp ashore somehow he said i might sheer her in under the staysail  the girl went forward with him and gasped as they hauled together at the halyard which hoisted the sail and when half of it was up she sped aft to the tiller and jimmy made desperate efforts to shorten in the cable there was another cove not far astern into which he might work the boat the anchor however came away before he expected it and though he did not think it was the girls fault the halfhoisted sail swung over and the sorata in place of creeping back toward the beach drove away toward the opposite shore where the stream swept over ragged rock jimmy jumping aft seized the tiller and while the inlet seethed into little splashing ridges the sorata swept on seaward with the breeze astern he stood still a moment gasping and then while the girl looked at him with inquiring eyes signed her to take the helm again  i must get the trysail on her and try to beat her back we may be able to do iti dont know he said its deep water along those rocks and shed chafe through and go down otherwise id ram her ashore  he spent several arduous minutes tearing every spare sail out of the stern locker before he reached the one he wanted and it was at least five minutes more before he had laced it to its gaff while by then there were only jagged rocks over which the sea that washed into the open entrance to the inlet seethed whitely under the soratas lee jimmy glanced at them and quietly lashed the trysail gaff to the boom before he turned to anthea merril  im sorry he said we couldnt stay her under the trysail with the puffs twisting all ways flung back by the trees besides shed probably drive down upon the reefs before i got it up its quite evident we cant go ashore there  the girl glanced ahead and her heart sank a little as she saw the long pacific roll heave across the opening in big gray slopes that were ridged with froth then she turned to jimmy who stood regarding her gravely in the steamboat jacket burst shoes and manowar cap and a look of confidence crept into her eyes she felt that this man could be depended on  we shall have to run out to sea she asked  jimmy nodded and she was glad that he answered frankly as to one who was his equal in courage  there is no help for it he said still shell go clear of the shore as she is and i dont think we need be anxious about her when shes under trysail in open water  anthea looked at him again with a spot of color in her cheek  it may blow for several days she said if i can help in any way  you can said jimmy abruptly go down now and fix miss austerly and yourself something to eat you mightnt be able to do it afterwards then you can bring me up some bread and coffee  anthea disappeared into the saloon with her cheeks tingling and a curious smile in her eyes she understood what had happened now that they were at close grip with the elements jimmy had asserted himself in primitive fashion and he could she felt be trusted to do his part     chapter viii  jimmy takes command   darkness was closing down on the waste of tumbling foam and the sorata was clear of the shore when jimmy made shift to hoist the trysail reduced by two reefs to a narrow strip of drenched canvas then while anthea merril held the helm he proceeded to set the little spitfire jib however he clung to the weathershrouds gasping and dripping with perspiration for the first few moments because the struggle with the trysail had tried his strength indeed anthea who stood bareheaded at the helm with her loosened hair whipping about her wondered how he had contrived to do it alone in that strength of wind  his figure shapeless in the streaming oilskins cut darkly against the livid foam as the sorata swung her bows high above the sea and then was almost lost in a filmy cloud as she plunged and buried them in the breast of a big comber suddenly however he dropped on hands and knees and crouching with one arm around the forestay hauled the strip of canvas out along the bowsprit until once more a sea smote the sorata and he sank into a rush of foam the girl caught her breath as she waited until the boat swung her head out again for it was very evident that the man alone stood between her and destruction  he swung into sight clinging with an arm around jib and bowsprit until he staggered to his feet and a strip of sailcloth that went aloft beat him with its wet folds amidst a frantic banging anthea scarcely dared to look at him as he struggled with the rope that hoisted it and she gasped with relief when at last he came scrambling back and pushed her from the tiller  thanks he said go down and get miss austerly on to the leeward settee and then try to sleep the boat ought to lieto dryly until the morning but i cant leave the tiller  anthea just heard him through the turmoil of the sea and did not resent the grasp he had laid on her shoulder quietly imperious as she usually was it seemed only fitting that she should obey him then she went down through the little companion and jimmy pulling the slide to after her settled himself for his long nightwatch as darkness rolled down upon the sea he was anxious but not unduly so for the boat was high of side and able and a comparatively small craft will usually ride out a vicious breeze if one can keep her hoveto under a strip or two of sail so as to meet the sea while not forging through it with her weatherbow indeed after the first halfhour he felt somewhat reassured and his thoughts went back to a subject which had occupied them somewhat frequently of late and that not unnaturally was anthea merril  she was he knew the daughter of the man who was ruining his father but that was an incident and no fault of hers it was he fancied clear that she knew nothing about merrils business operations and was unacquainted with one aspect of his character in fact it seemed to him that there was a painful shock in store for her when she made the discovery he had never met a woman with so much that compelled his appreciation besides her physical beauty her quiet graciousness and courage had their effect on him and he was sure at least that he would never feel quite the same regard for anybody else indeed he admitted that she was a woman with whom he might have fallen in love had circumstances been propitious but as they certainly were not he strove to assure himself that he had sense and will enough to refrain from thinking more of her than was advisable  these reflections were however fragmentary for the boat required attention and he fancied that a good deal of water was finding its way into her the sorata would not lieto without somebody at the helm and he could only leave the tiller lashed for a few minutes now and then while he labored at the little rotary pump once or twice when he did so a foot of brine came frothing into the cockpit across the coaming and he commenced to wonder how long the breeze would last for he was becoming sensible that another twelve hours of it would probably be as much as he could stand  in the meanwhile the night was wearing through and at last a faint light crept up from the east across the waste of tumbling seas they were not by any means mountainous for as a matter of fact it is very probable that the biggest ocean sea scarcely exceeds forty feet between its trough and summit but they rolled up out of the northwest in a continuous phalanx of steep gray ridges crested with spouting froth that looked quite big enough the drift whirled across them and now and then wrapped the craft in wisps of filmy smoke while jimmy with smarting and temporarily blinded eyes trusted to the feel of the tiller he was as wet as he could be as well as stiff and cold and it was with relief and some astonishment that he saw the saloon companion open and miss merril appear with a plate and a jug of steaming coffee  her skirt was woefully bedraggled from which he surmised that there was more water than there should be in the saloon and her hair was promptly powdered with glistening spray but her face was quiet and she sat down collectedly huddling herself on a locker where the after bulkhead of the saloon partly sheltered her jimmy dropped into the cockpit and crouched there with the tiller against his shoulder for nobody could have eaten in the face of that wind then he stretched out a hand for the coffee  im unusually glad to get it it was very kind of you he said  anthea smiled why she asked are you sure it wasnt selfishness we couldnt take the boat home without you and a man must eat if he has to go on with this kind of task  jimmy looked at her and finding no very apposite rejoinder nodded well he said i suppose he must but did you get anything for yourself or miss austerly you cant live on nothing any more than i can at least thats the conclusion ive come to after what ive noticed in the mailboats saloons  he was aware that he had made a slip but fancied it had escaped his companions attention which of course displayed very little perspicacity in the meanwhile he got a turn of the weather tiller line round a cleat and lowered himself further until he sat in the cockpit with several inches of water swishing about him  nellie is asleep at last i did not awaken her said his companion  that isnt all i asked did you get anything yourself  the girl said she had not done so and for a moment there was the faintest suspicion of color in her face  then you will share what you have brought with me said jimmy  there isnt a cup i couldnt find one that wasnt broken the forecastle shelf has torn away  you couldnt have kept the coffee in it if you had take what you want before it gets cold and jimmy pointed to the jug  anthea raised it to her lips and then pushed it back along the cockpit floor while though she had not meant to do so she flashed a swift glance at her companion when he held it in his hand as it happened jimmy looked at her just then and she saw the little glint in his eyes he felt that she had done so and while he would not have had it happen let his gaze rest on her steadily while he made her a little inclination then he drank and after he had thrust the plate in her direction broke off a portion of bread and canned meat some of which crumbled and stuck to his wet oilskins  he was quite aware that neither his attitude nor manner of eating was especially graceful but that could not be helped and he laughed when his companion clutched at the remnant on the plate she smiled at him too and he wondered why they were both apparently so much at ease still it did not seem in any way an unusual or unfitting thing that he and this delicately brought up girl should make their meal as equals in the little dripping cockpit with a single plate and one drinking vessel between them he felt that it was as a comrade she regarded him in place of tolerating him from necessity and he noticed that even under the very uncomfortable conditions she ate daintily  where are we she asked at last  about twenty miles to leeward of the inlet and perhaps eight off the shore at least i should like to believe we are how is it you look so fresh instead of worn out where did you learn to make yourself at home in a boat  in toronto said anthea i was there two years and they are fond of yachting in that city i once did some sailing in england too what do you think of their boats it is perhaps fortunate valentine made the sorata a cutter as they generally do instead of a sloop you could hardly have handled her under the latters single headsail last night  no said jimmy i dont think i could if she had been rigged that way she would probably have gone under by now still i dont see why you should expect me to know anything about english boats  anthea smiled as she looked at him perhaps you dont though you dont invariably express yourself as a man would who had never been away from the pacific slope  well said jimmy reflectively its not quite a sure thing that the way they talk in an english ships forecastle is very much nicer  there are more places in a mailboat than her forecastle  it seemed to jimmy advisable to change the subject and he made a little grimace as he glanced at the plate  im afraid ive cleaned up everything he said  anthea laughed which is quite as it should be i can get more and you cant still perhaps you have left some coffee  jimmy was about to point out that there was no cup but refrained for it flashed on him that his companion was of course aware of this and he gravely handed her the jug what her purpose was he did not know and indeed he was never clear on this point though he fancied that she had one but it was at least evident that she was damp and chilled and needed the physical stimulant the trifling act it seemed might equally be a pledge of camaraderie or a recognition of the fact that they were for the time being no more than man and woman between whom all distinctions had vanished in the face of peril but he seemed to feel it had a still deeper significance he had once held her in his arms and now they had shared the same plate and drunk from the same vessel  then the sorata reminded him that she required attention for a sea seethed on board her forward and when it poured into the cockpit he swung himself back to the coaming a minute or two later he stretched out his hand and the girl drew in her breath as she glanced ahead for a sail materialized suddenly out of the vapor it was suggestively slanted and a dusky strip that looked very small appeared beneath it when it swung high on the crest of a sea  siwashes said jimmy one of their sea canoes they have to keep her running she wouldnt lieto  the craft drew abreast of them traveling wonderfully fast and anthea long remembered how she drove by the sorata hove half her length out of water riding on the ridge of a big gray sea she was entirely open a long narrow birdheaded thing and the foam she flung off forward seemed to lap over her afterhalf a little drenched spritsail was spread from an insignificant mast and four crouching figures with dusky faces were partly visible amidst the wisps of spray that whirled about her one of them held a long paddle and looked fixedly ahead the others gazed at the sorata expressionlessly until the craft swooped down between two seas jimmy saw his companions hands clench on the coaming and the color ebb from her face and then she gasped as the little strip of canvas swung into sight again  ah she said its a trifle horrible to watch them and what must it be to steer her how many of us in the cities know what the struggle for existence really is  jimmy nodded assent at least he said the thing is tolerably clear to the men who live at sea if that siwash lost his nerve for a moment the next comber would swallow the canoe after all the sea knows no distinctions white men and red men alike must face the strain  in the big mailboats too  of course im not sure it isnt a little heavier there when you are traveling as fast as a freight train there is little time to decide how you will clear a crossing steamer or to pick out green from yellow among a blink of sliding lights the man who fails is very apt to hurl as much as fourteen thousand tons of hull and cargo into destruction and perhaps two thousand passengers into another world though some vessels now carry more than that the owner seldom gets rich when he doesnt and there is after all no very great difference between his lot and that of the siwash who stakes his life against the value of a few salmon or halibut  he broke off with a laugh hadnt you better go back you are getting very wet  anthea did so and it was almost noon when she came up again jimmy still sat at the tiller and his wet face looked a trifle worn but the breeze had softened and as the girl glanced round her a shaft of sunlight fell suddenly upon the foaming sea  yes said jimmy its blowing itself out i expect well be able to shake the reefs out of the trysail and beat up for the inlet before its dark if it were necessary i would run her before it now  wouldnt there be shelter in one of the inlets to leeward asked the girl with a very natural longing to escape from the strain and turmoil  its very probable said jimmy i dare say i could make one still you see  he stopped and anthea flushed ever so slightly for it was evident to her that she and her companion could not extend that cruise indefinitely in company with valentines hired man  of course she said austerly will be horribly anxious well if you think you could leave the tiller lashed i have dinner ready  i believe i could still it might be awkward to get back fast enough from the forecastle in case of necessity  i wonder said the girl whether you have any very decided objections to sitting down with us in the saloon if you have it would make it necessary for nellie or me to bring the things out to you  jimmy fancied that the last was an inspiration and after a glance to windward went down into the saloon which was very wet miss austerly who seemed to have stood the shaking better than he expected reclined on one settee with her feet drawn up for the sake of dryness and she smiled at him he wondered when he saw how the little swingtable was set miss merril finding the crockery kept for charterers mostly smashed had apparently come upon valentines enameled and indurated ware  there was no restraint upon any of them during the meal the fact that the breeze was undoubtedly falling would have been sufficient in itself to restore their cheerfulness but jimmy was also sensible of a curious exhilaration and discoursed whimsically upon various topics besides the sea in fact he was astonished to find that he had been away an hour when at last he went back to the cockpit the breeze was falling rapidly and before anthea prepared the supper which was as usual in that country at about six oclock he had set the whole trysail and soon afterward he got the reefed mainsail up by midnight the sorata was close in with the coast working fast to windward through smooth water with her biggest topsail set while a halfmoon hung low in the western sky the sea gleamed silver under it and scarcely half a mile away dim hillsides and long ranks of somber pines halfveiled in fleecy mists went sliding by  the soft gleam of the swinging lamps in the saloon shone out in faint streams of colored radiance through the skylights and late as it was nellie austerly nestled well wrapped up on a locker in the cockpit she watched the long swell break away from beneath the bows in glittering cascades and jimmy fancied he knew what she was thinking when she gazed aloft at the tall spire of canvas that shone in the moonlight as white as the peak ahead of them it was a nocturne in blue and silver and if sound were wanted the splashing at the bows and the deep rumble of the surf emphasized the softer harmonies of the night  you are not so very sorry we were blown off after all he asked  the girl smiled no she said i managed to sleep through a good deal of it and now i feel almost as fresh as if i had stayed ashore besides this would make up for anything one could almost wish we could sail south with the topsail up under the moonlightforever in spite of the bad weather i have been so well since i came to sea  just the three of us asked jimmy unguardedly  he saw the twinkle in the girls eyes as she glanced at her companion who sat close by  i wonder she said whether you would like that anthea i almost think i should  the moonlight sufficed to show the faint tinge of color in antheas face but she laughed and what about your father  nellie austerly did not appear concerned it is very undutiful for he must have been anxious but i really cant help feeling amused when i think of him and mr valentine being left on the beach to sleep in the siwash rancherie one understands they are rather dreadful places and he is so horribly particular you know  anthea said nothing further and presently the two girls went below but they were about again when soon after six oclock next morning jimmy beat the sorata into the inlet indeed he left anthea at the tiller while he went into the saloon to look for a piece of spun yarn which valentine kept in one of the lockers nellie austerly smiled at him as he opened it  i suppose we shall be in very soon and i want to thank you now for bringing me back safe she said anthea of course can thank you for herself  jimmy felt a trifle embarrassed i really dont see why she should i think the charter covers anything i have done  the girl made a little whimsical gesture does it you are not a regular yachthand really  i am at least mate of a lumbercarrying schooner which comes to much the same thing  the twinkle in nellie austerlys eyes grew plainer i can be quite frank with mr valentine and you and perhaps it is because i like you both you can make what you think fit of that still i havent asked you how long you have been on board the schooner and one understands there are a good many opportunities for menlike you and mr valentinein this country  jimmy was a little startled for it almost seemed that she had guessed his thoughts but he smiled  valentine seems to have all he wants already he is content with the sea  the girl laughed well she said i dont think the sea would altogether satisfy him but i must not keep you here hadnt you better make sure anthea isnt running us ashore  jimmy went up and found the sorata was smoothly slipping by the climbing pines and a little later her dory with three white men in it came sliding toward them as he hauled the topsail down     chapter ix  merril tightens the screw   the sorata went to sea again next morning and one night a week later she bore up for vancouver before a westerly breeze a thin crescent moon had just cleared the dim white line of the mainland snow and the sea glittered faintly in her frothing wake under a vast sweep of dusky blue the big topsail swayed across it blotting out the stars and there was a rhythmic splashing beneath the bows  anthea merril stood at the tiller outlined against the heave of sea for the night was warm and she was dressed in white nellie austerly sat on a locker in the cockpit and her father on the saloon skylights with a cigar in his hand valentine lay on the deck not far away and jimmy a little further forward  i suppose we will be in soon after daylight and im sorry said nellie austerly it has been an almost perfect cruise in spite of the bad weather dont you wish we were going back again instead of home anthea  jimmy roused himself to attention for he would very much have liked to hear miss merrils real thoughts on the matter but she laughed  i dont think it would be very much use if i did she said one cant go sailing alwaysand if you feel that that is a pity you can think of the rain and the wind  ah said nellie austerly one has to bear so much of them everywhere sometimes one wonders whether life is all gray days and rain but this trip has made me better and perhaps if mr valentine will take us we will go back next year and revel once more in the sea and the sunshinewe really had a good deal of the latter  jimmy saw his comrade make a little abrupt movement and guessed what he was thinking for he too realized that before another year nellie austerly would in all probability have slipped away from the sad gray weather to the shores of the glassy sea where there is eternal radiance  then austerly looked around and his observation was very matteroffact as usual  if circumstances are propitious i should be glad to arrange it he said i certainly think mr valentine has done everything he could for us indeed we owe it largely to him that this has been such a pleasant trip  he appeared to expect some expression of approval and anthea laughed of course its only unfortunate he couldnt arrange the weather  i wonder said nellie reflectively why you both leave jimmy out  there was a certain suggestiveness in the girls tone which jimmy noticed though he did not think her father did and he wished it had been light enough to see anthea merrils face but unfortunately it was not she appeared to disregard the question and glanced in valentines direction  couldnt we have the big spinnaker up she asked  valentine hesitated a little the breeze was moderately fresh and the sorata traveling fast enough while it is not a very easy thing to steer a craft running under the great threecornered sail which is apt to swing over in case of a blunder at the tiller  you could hold her steady before the wind he asked  if i dont i will make my father buy you a new mast said anthea  valentine made a little gesture which was expressive of resignation it was he had discovered singularly hard to say no to anthea merril but it seemed to him that the new mast might be needed if she ventured too far now he and jimmy between them got the great sail up and its boom run out though it cost them an effort and then jimmy glanced aft with more than a trace of uneasiness at the white figure at the helm the sorata had now on each side of her a swelling mass of canvas that dwarfed the narrow strip of hull and she swung each of them high in turn as she rolled viciously still as far as jimmy could see the girl stood very composedly at the tiller then as the great mainboom went up high above the sea valentine signed to him  you had better get out and steady it he said it wouldnt need much to bring that boom over  jimmy crawled out on the slippery spar and sat astride near the end of it while valentine made his way along the one beneath the spinnaker their weight checked the lifting of the sails in some degree but for the first few minutes it seemed to jimmy that they and their companions were hazarding a good deal if the girl at the helm let the tiller swing a handsbreadth too much when the sorata piling the froth about her rushed up a dim slope of water either mainsail or spinnaker would swing over and the men on the booms would have no opportunity for attempting to obviate the unpleasantness that would certainly succeed it in all probability they would be flung off headlong into the sea still the sail did not come over for the sorata drove along straight before the wind and once more jimmy paid silent homage to the girl at the tiller  he could see her only dimly a blurred white shape against the dusky sea but he could imagine the little glow in her eyes and the way in which her lips were pressed together he had seen her look that way when she sat beside him in the cockpit one wild morning as the sorata plunged over the great pacific combers and it seemed to him that she was one who would face difficulties and perils of any kind as unwaveringly indeed he was angry with himself for having fancied there was any hazard at all in leaving her to steer the sorata under spinnaker for he felt that anthea merril must necessarily be capable of carrying out anything she had undertaken  so he swung contentedly with the lifting boom now hove high above the dark water now dropped down until his feet were almost in the streaming froth while shadowy islets clothed with pines sprang out of the sea ahead grew into solid blurs of blackness and flitted by until at last austerly said that his daughter must go below then valentine and jimmy came in along the booms stowed the spinnaker with some difficulty and dropped the topsail too for the dim mainland shore was black ahead when the rest left the deck to them  that girl has quite excellent nerves said valentine still what i like about her is that she doesnt think it necessary to impress it on you her husband wont have much to complain of if she ever marries anybody though im not sure thats certain  not certain said jimmy  no replied valentine reflectively a girl of her kind is apt to be particular the man who pleases her would have to be quite straight and its scarcely likely hed go to leeward either  jimmy fancied that his comrade was right though he said nothing for after all it was as he compelled himself to admit no concern of his however he sighed a little as he went down and crawled into his cot leaving valentine to feel his way along the dusky shore  it was early next morning when they rowed austerly and his two companions ashore and the man shook hands with them on the wharf  i feel that i am indebted to both of you he said with somewhat unusual diffidence in fact i cant exactly consider that the attention you have shown my daughter is no more than one would expectfrom the charter  he seemed to feel that he was becoming involved and went on abruptly she desires me to say that it would be a pleasure should either of you care to call at any time  jimmy left him to valentine and when the latter had handed miss austerly into the waiting vehicle saw that anthea merril was looking at him  if you dont mind my saying so i think that was rather good of austerly she said you probably know his point of view and i daresay it cost him an effort i think your comrade should go nellie finds him amusing and there is naturally not very much in her life that pleases her  she stopped with a little soft laugh mr wheelockisnt it i havent the least difficulty in saying as much as austerly did any time you or mr valentine care to call i should be glad to receive you our house is always open and anybody will tell you where it is  jimmy once more remembered that he had on a pair of burst canvas shoes as well as old duck trousers cobbled with sail twine and a manowar cap that had grown shapeless with the rain he also realized that his companion was quite aware of it too  im afraid it wouldnt be a very appropriate thing if i did he said  anthea looked at him steadily pshaw she said still you really cant expect me to urge you  perhaps it was a slight relief to both of them that valentine signed to jimmy just then they want this box he said the rest of the things are to wait for the express wagon  jimmy who turned away heaved the box into the vehicle and did not see the curious little smile in anthea merrils eyes in a few minutes she had driven away and he fancied had passed out of his life altogether he stood still on the wharf and sighed  well said valentine where are you going now  straight back to the schooner said jimmy i see her lying outside the steamboat yonder you might bring my things across when you have straightened up the boat  valentine promised to do so and jimmy who strode away met jordan whom he had not expected to see there on the waterfront  what are you doing in vancouver he asked  looking after my patent rightsamong other things said jordan the mills shut down for two or three weeks anyway between the stone in the water and the new detergent the directors insisted on my using the boiler has most turned herself inside out our people have their office here as you know and my agreement with them only stands for another month while it seems that merril has been buying up their stock im not sure his notions are going to suit me you heard we had to break off your fathers contract  i hadnt though i was afraid it would happen said jimmy whose face grew a trifle grim that was merrils doing  it was i couldnt help the thing but we cant talk here wont you come along to my hotel  jimmy glanced at his garments and jordan grinned those things dont count for so much here he said anyway there was a time when i tramped into the wooden cities along puget sound looking way more like a deadbeat than you do now still if thats going to worry you cant you get a boat and take me for a sail  jimmy was sorry that it was out of the question he had spent only a few evenings with jordan at the mill but he liked the man and was vaguely sensible that jordan liked him  valentine and i have just run in and i must see how the old man is getting along he said after that i fancy i ought to go over to a ranch on the westminster road and look up my sister i havent seen her since i came home  well said jordan ive nothing on hand until tomorrow whats the matter with taking me ill hire a team somewhere and drive you i can drop you at the ranch and go on to westminster  they arranged it during the next few minutes and then jimmy was rowed off to the tyee prescott met him as he climbed on board and a glance at his face showed jimmy that things had not been going well  you will be wanted he said your father has been getting very shaky since you went away and i dont quite see how hes to hold on to the schooner now that he has lost that lumber contract and has to face the carpenters bill guess hes worrying over it hasnt got up the last three days and the doctor dont seem to know what is wrong with him  jimmy went down into the little stern cabin with a sinking heart and found tom wheelock lying propped up in his berth he looked very old and haggard and the perspiration stood beaded on his face in which pale patches showed through the bronze  glad youve got back boy he said youll have to take hold soonthat is if theres anything left to get a grip on the old mans played out  this it seemed to jimmy was painfully evident and though he contrived to hide it a sense of dismay crept over him as he sat down tom wheelock looked played out and though his son was ready to take up his burden he felt it would be heavy he realized that through the compassion he felt and then a sudden fit of anger against the man who had crushed his father came over him the color darkened a trifle in his face but he put a restraint upon himself  youll be about again in a day or two he said cheerily now tell me all about it but first of all what is the matter with you  the old man looked at him with a curious little smile the doctor bob brought off didnt quite seem to know but i could have told him guess im done boy its quite likely ill crawl out on deck for a little while but hows that going to count nobodys going to have any more use for your father jimmy and when the month is up merril will take the schooner from him  jimmy clenched a big brown fist but his voice was very quiet well he said i want to understand what has happened since i went away  wheelock reached out for the pipe that lay near him and fumbled with it spilling the tobacco with shaky fingers until jimmy quietly took it from him and struck a match as he handed it back to him the old man raised himself a trifle as he lighted it and then laid a trembling hand on his sons arm  i guess ive worked as hard as most other men but somehow i dont seem to have gone to windward as the rest did he said perhaps i was too easy with the money and a little slack in other ways still your bloods red jimmy and theres a streak of hard sand in you you got it from your mother it was she who made me hard work dont count boy you want to get your elbows into the other people whore standing in your way well im glad theres that streak of grit in you youll get those fingers on the throat of the man who brought your father down and gripe the life out of him some day  he broke off abruptly and fumbled with his pipe which had gone out again let that go its fool talk jimmy what do i want putting my trouble on to you guess youll have plenty of your own boy  i think i asked you to tell me what merril had done said jimmy  kept us here under repairs while the lumber was piling up on the sawmill wharf i most guess hed fixed the thing with the boss carpenter i was to bring all that the people at the inlet cut for victoria or vancouver down fast as it was ready or they were to let up on the contract but jordan would have made things easy if merril hadnt bought their stock and put the screw on hard  it wouldnt be worth his while to buy the stock for that  the things quite plain hes playing a bigger game wants control of all thats going on along that coast and its carrying guess i cant stop his getting the tyee and shes the second boat he has taken from me well i may get a freight of ore in a week or two and its quite likely a load from a cannerygo up lightfreight one way hows that going to count though when theres the carpenters bill to meet and a big instalment on the bond with interest due  how much jimmy asked harshly  he sat silent a while with a hard set face when his father told him  then he must have the vessel still hell have to sell her by auction he said by and by  that wont count when ive nobody to run the price up against him its quite easy for a man like merril to fix the thing hell get one of his friends to buy her in at bout half her value and the bond dont quite call for that it isnt everybody wants a vessel and the few men who do fix these things between them  jimmy set his lips and once more there was silence for a while then he looked up with a little abrupt movement theres a question in front of us to be facedand im going to find the answer but we wont talk any more about it now im going over with jordan this afternoon to see eleanor you can get along until tonight without me  wheelock made a sign of concurrence i guess its a thing you ought to do got a letter from her yesterday and she was asking about you eleanors like you take after your mother both of you and if anything the harder grits in her you have to remember jimmy you cant afford to show a soft spot when youre fighting a man like merril  he stopped a moment with a sigh guess he is too hard for your father wont you light me this pipe again my hands shaky     chapter x  eleanor wheelock   jordan was driving a spirited team along the waterfront when jimmy came up from the wharf and he smiled when the latter swung himself up into the light fourwheeled vehicle jimmy was dressed tastefully in his english shoregoing clothes and now looked very much unlike a yachthand he was well endued physically and though the bronze in his face and a certain steadiness of gaze betrayed his calling there was an indefinite but unmistakable stamp upon him which he had acquired on board the big mailboats and perhaps also in a greater measure from his comrades on the battleship jimmy had certainly not cultivated it and was in fact not aware that he possessed it but his companion had already recognized it  take a cigar and light it before i let the team out they look as if they could go he said  jimmy did so and then found it somewhat difficult to keep his seat as his comrade sent the horses through the city as fast as they could lay hoof to the ground and out of it past the clustering wooden hovels in its less reputable quarter and up the slope that led into the shadowy bush roads are not remarkable for their smoothness anywhere in that country but it was evident that jordan liked fast traveling and could handle a team he laughed when jimmy said so  i come of farmer stock and thats probably why i always had a notion of the sea he said if you look at it in one way the things quite natural  i suppose it is said jimmy why didnt you go to sea  it seemed to me one has mighty few chances of picking up money there though i found out quite early that the poor man has no great show anywhere it was a mortgage he couldnt pay off that broke up my father  he stopped for a moment with a little confidential gesture i guess thats why i wanted to do what i could for your father in one or two ways hes very much like the man i buried back in washington he was straightand it wasnt his fault if he didnt whale all the meanness out of mebut when smartness means getting your grip on what belongs to somebody else he was just a trifle slow he worked hard and gave every man a hundred cents worth for his dollarand thats quite likely why there was mighty little but a mortgage on the ranch when he died  jimmy was not astonished in view of their short acquaintance that his companion should tell him this he was aware that reticence is not a prominent characteristic of the men of the pacific slope and besides this there was a rapidly growing sympathy between himself and jordan still he sat silent and his companion spoke again  i was about sixteen then and i saw i had to make out differently he said well somehow ive done itlooked on this life as a battle where the hurt man gets no mercy and ive cleared quite a little money on my royaltiesbut now and then the memory of those old days on the ranch comes back to me then i feel that if ever its necessary for me to get my knife into any kind of mortgage man it will be red right to the hilt when it comes out again  the snap in his companions dark eyes and the hardening of his lips were comprehensible to jimmy for he had once or twice been sensible of much the same feeling jordan had as is usual in the land to which he belonged expressed himself frankly and perhaps a trifle crudely but jimmy recognized that it was with very genuine tenderness and regret he remembered the man he had buried long ago in washington he asked an abrupt question which did not however altogether change the subject  will you be here any time he said  i dont quite know theres no reason i shouldnt tell you what i can and i feel like talking now im quite pleased to run that mill up the inlet for our people that is while they leave me to fix things as i like them but as i told you merril has been getting his grip on the stock lately and his views about the royalties on my patents dont quite coincide with mine ive a couple of other notions that will save labor which our company has not bought up and its quite likely ill turn them over to the hastings people in the meanwhile im not going to rush things and its probable ill hang on until weve had the stockholders meeting  then its merril who is standing in your way  jordan smiled dryly now you understand the thing seems to me neither of us has any great reason to like that man  nothing more was said on that point and by and by they left the scented shadow of the pines and clattered across a wooden bridge which spanned the turbid green fraser into a stretch of sunlit meadows and oatfields formed by the silt the great river had brought down in due time they reached a wooden ranch flanked by shadowy bush and jordan pulling the team up before it glanced down the long white road that leads to new westminster a few miles away  i guess ill go on to town and come back for you he said still you had better make sure youre at the right place first  jimmy got down and a man who had apparently heard the beat of hoofs commenced to throw down the split sliprails which in western canada usually serve as gates  yes he said when jimmy spoke to him this is forsters ranch in fact that is my name  he was dressed in the bushranchers jean but he had a pleasant face with a certain hint of refinement in it and smiled when jimmy told him who he was  miss wheelocks brother come right in and put your team up he said its not more than an hour or so until supper your friend will come with you  supper is usually served at six oclock in that country and in no way differs from the other meals of the day while nobody acquainted with its customs would have considered it an unusual thing for the rancher to extend the invitation to jimmys companion jordan once more glanced down the road to new westminster and though none of them knew it a good deal was to depend on the fact that he elected to stay  well he said turning to jimmy i dont want to worry you but the fact is one of the lumber people yonder has been writing me about my gangsaw frame and after thinking the thing out last night id sooner hold him off a while id have to call on the man if i drove into town and after all it might be wiser to keep clear of him  then you had better get down said forster while miss wheelock talks to her brother you can walk round the ranch with me i dont see many strangers and im by no means busy  jordan got down and after spending an hour with forster was somewhat astonished when he was presented to miss wheelock in the big general room of the ranch it was roughly paneled with cedar very simply furnished and had as usual an uncovered floor while the sunlight that streamed through the uncurtained window fell upon the girl she stood still a moment looking at him when she had acknowledged his greeting and for once at least the sawmiller felt almost embarrassed for eleanor wheelock possessed as her brother did not a somewhat striking personality  jimmy might have passed for a quiet englishman but his sister was typically western in everything but speechtall wiry and a trifle straight of figure but with something that was almost imperious in her attitude she had light hair like jimmys but there was a reddish gleam in it and her eyes which had a glint in them were of a paler blue while her skin was of a curious colorless purity jordan could not analyze her features but he felt that she was beautiful and there was a suggestion of vigor about her that further attracted him one would scarcely have called her domineering but she had not as her brother recognized the quiet graciousness and composure which halfconcealed anthea merrils strength of character jordan however was not too discriminating he liked vigor in any guise and he noticed that one of the two little girls who had entered with her clung to her hand  i think i passed you twice in vancouver one day a month or two ago she said  jordan made her a little inclination and his western candor was free alike from awkwardness or any hint of presumption  then i didnt see you if i had done so i should certainly have remembered it  eleanor laughed and turned to the others its ten minutes since jake called you will you sit here jimmy with mr jordan next to you mrs forster is away just now  she moved to the head of the table and the usual ranch supper of pork potatoes flapjacks hot cakes desiccated fruits and green tea was brought in forster who appeared to be a man of education made an excellent host but it was eleanor and jordan who led most of the conversation and there was delicacy as well as keenness in their badinage almost an hour had passed before the party rose which was a very unusual thing in that country for the westerner seldom wastes much time over his meals then as it happened it was jimmy who walked round the ranch with forster while jordan sat on the veranda with eleanor and the little girls while the shadows of the firs crept slowly up to it they talked about a good many things while each felt that they were just skirting a confidence until the little girl who sat next to jordan looked up at him gravely  why dont you go and see the cows with father and the other man she asked  jordan laughed but he looked at eleanor well he said for one thing i guess its a good deal nicer here  miss wheelock met his glance with a directness which had his disposition and training been different he might have found disconcerting she was like himself absolutely devoid of affectation and he felt that she was quietly making an estimate of him still there was not a great deal in his character that he had occasion to hide from any one and the evident sincerity of his observation was in itself an excuse for it it was characteristic of the girl that she let it pass not with the obvious intention of ignoring it because that appeared advisable but as though she had never heard it when a thing did not appeal to eleanor wheelock she simply brushed it aside  have you met the miss merril jimmy mentioned she asked i almost fancy she is the girl i used to see now and then when i was in toronto what is she like  jordan who had met anthea merril in vancouver told her as well as he was able and eleanors lips set in a straight line  one could fancy you were not fond of miss merril he said  i have never spoken to her but i have no great reason to feel welldisposed toward anybody of that family  ah said jordan that means jimmy has told you what merril is doing im no friend of that mans either but im not quite sure one could reasonably hold the girl responsible for her father  especially when shes pretty still she is his daughter and must be like him in some respects  jordans eyes twinkled do you consider yourself like your father  eleanor flashed a swift glance at him you are keener than i expected in reality i am not like him in the least though i dont know why i should trouble to admit it in any case i think the rule generally holds good  she dismissed the subject abruptly with a laugh after all our affairs cant interest you you cant have seen very much of my brother  jordan appeared to consider this im not sure that counts he said i seem to have been a friend of jimmys quite a long while there are people who make you feel that even when it isnt so although they may not consciously want to one cant tell how they do itbut i think you have the power in you  i dont know said eleanor i am however by no means certain that i was ever very anxious to make friends with anybody  thats comprehensible you would sooner they wanted to make friends with you and if no one did you would be sufficient for yourself  eleanor looked at him with a chilly smile you have a certain penetration but i dont know that there is any reason why i should confess to you how do you come to know anything about mr merril  jordan who appeared to have no doubt as to her ability to understand him in which he was warranted told her  well she said suppose this mans influence is too strong for you and you have to break your connection with the mill  there are two or three other things i could turn to  one would suppose as much and jordan took it as a compliment which perhaps it was especially as the girl had not said it with the least desire to gratify him still that is not what i mean would you try to find any means of retaliating  if he afterward got in my waythat is thrust himself between me and something i wanted to doi would try all i could to get my foot on him and then perhaps keep it there a little longer than was necessary  you would go no further  jordan knew what she meant though he could not grasp her purpose in pressing the point it wouldnt be business if i did when a man starts out to make money he cant afford to load himself up with purely personal grievances if another man tries to get the things you want you naturally have to fight but its wiser to grin and bear it when hes too smart for you still there are cases when the feeling that you would like to get even afterward is apt to be most too much for human nature  and in some respects you could be very human  jordan turned to her with the twinkle still in his eyes well he said if i let any weakness of that kind master me in the present case i should be very much like the blacktail deer that turned around on the man with the rifle still one cant invariably be wise  his manner was whimsical but it seemed to eleanor there was something behind it for when he broke off a faint glint which she understood crept into his eyes  sometimes accidents happen to the man with the rifle she said in the meanwhile i rather fancy jimmy is making signs to you  then said jordan gravely im not sure im much obliged to him but before i go theres something i want to ask would it be a liberty if i came back here with him some day  you would like to come  of course why do i ask  eleanor laughed that is what i was wondering i almost think a man likely to get even with mr merril would do what he wanted anyway you know the customs of the country as well as i do and i scarcely think forster and his wife would mind  jordan rose and kissed the child he picked up and held high in his arms well he said sinceforster and his wifewouldnt mind i shall very probably come along again by and by  he turned and went down the veranda stairway while the little girl looked at her companion gravely  i like that man hes nice she said you like him too dont you  eleanor was beckoning jimmy but the child went on well she said he thinks you nice i know i could tell it by the way he looked at you perhaps you didnt see him but i did  eleanor laughed for she had naturally noticed every glance jordan had cast in her direction and had understood it that however did not count for very much with her she recognized in jordan something that pleased her and she had a vague fancy that there were things he might be able to do for jimmy and her father in the difficulties she foresaw there was she admitted reluctantly after all a good deal that a woman could not do but in the meanwhile the feeling went no further then while jordan and forster harnessed the team jimmy joined her  you will have to stay in the province jimmy you cant go back to sea she said your father will need somebody beside him now  jimmy only smiled but the girl made a little gesture of comprehension  oh she said i know how hard it is for you you will have to give up your career  it cant be helped said the man simply and i may make another here  eleanor laid her hand on his arm and pressed it i knew you would face it like that theres just one other thing hold on to that man jordan i think he will make you a good friend  you like him  that said eleanor is quite another matter anyway he is a man who could be depended onand i think he could be firm on points where you might waver you are a little too goodnatured jimmy  jordan drove his team up before they had said much more and forster shook hands with jimmy as he stood beside the vehicle  from what your sister has told us i dare say you are a trifle anxious aboutthings in generaljust now he said if it is any relief to you i would like to say that mrs forster and i think very highly of your sister and that so long as she cares to stay with us we should be very glad to do what we can for her  jimmy thanked the rancher and swung himself up into the vehicle while jordan turned to him as they drove away  they think very highly of her theyd beidiots if they didnt he said of course i dont know if thats quite the kind of thing you appreciate from me  jimmy said nothing as was usual with him when he was not sure what he felt but jordan went on  i never expected to find you had a sister like that he said shes very different from you in many ways one feels thats a girl with most enough capacity for anything  jimmy looked at him with a whimsical smile and jordan laughed  now he said i might have expressed myself differently what i mean is that youre a good deal more like your father than she is  ah said jimmy well perhaps youre right in fact the same thing has struck me occasionally     chapter xi  at auction   jimmy went back to the ranch beside the fraser once but jordan went without him several times for forster apparently found his company congenial it happened that he contrived to see a good deal of eleanor wheelock during his visits but neither of them mentioned this to jimmy who indeed would probably have concerned himself little about it had he heard of it since he had other things to think about just then merril had sent his father a formal notice that unless the money due should be paid by a certain time the schooner would be sold as stipulated in the bond and though tom wheelock had expected nothing else he apparently collapsed altogether under the final blow  jordan who had just come back from forsters ranch arrived on board the tyee while the doctor was talking to jimmy and strolling forward he sat down on the windlass and commenced a conversation with prescott with whom he had promptly made friends in the meanwhile jimmy looked at the doctor a trifle wearily as he leaned on the rail  perhaps my minds not as clear as usual today but these scientific terms dont convey very much to me he said  in plain english then said the doctor it is general breakdown your father is suffering from though it is intensified by a partial loss of control over the muscles on one side of him the latter trouble is perhaps the result of what one might call constitutional causes but as you seem to fancy worry and nervous strain or a shock of any kind may have accelerated it or brought about the climax  well said jimmy hoarsely the cure  the doctors tone was sympathetic to be quite frank there is none it is possible even probable that he may recover sufficiently to hobble about a little but he will never be fit for any active occupation again  ah said jimmy with a little indrawing of his breath still it is only what i expected and i suppose i must face it you are quite sure about that shock  the doctor looked at him curiously i want you to understand that it probably brought about the climax though such things dont often happen in the case of a vigorous man your father has i should fancy in ordinary language been losing his grip for several years in his case the natural decline of physical strength has perhaps been accelerated by undue anxiety and  he hesitated and jimmy made a quick sign of comprehension oh yes he said i know still im not sure that anybody could blame him under the circumstances well i think the thing that brought about the climax has been steadily preparing him to break down under it but after all that does not concern you  the doctor who admitted this gave him certain directions before he went away and jimmy descended to the little cabin where tom wheelock lay he looked up and nodded when his son came in  well he said with a faint smile i guess by the names that doctor calls it ive got enough to kill any man wouldnt talk quite straight but i know as well as he does that im not going to worry you very long and thats just as it should be merril takes the schooner and youll go back to the blue water i was never good for very much anyway after your mother had gone she stood behind me and kept things going  jimmy sat down and much as he desired it could think of nothing apposite to say he felt that there are occasions on which one should speak clearly but as not infrequently happens it was just then that he was usually dumb perhaps tom wheelock understood this for once more he smiled as he looked at him  i wouldnt worry about it jimmy he said  jimmy was still tonguetied but one result of his fathers observations was that fierce anger commenced to mingle with his distress and he felt his nature stir in protest merril would take the tyeethat could not be helpedbut it seemed an insufferable thing that for the paltry value of the schooner he should have crushed this frail and broken man jimmy clenched a firm brown hand and felt his fingers itch for a grip on the bondholders throat  there was silence for a while intensified by the soft splash of ripples against the tyees planking and jimmy afterward remembered how his fathers worn face showed up in the stream of light that shone down through the skylights into the shadowy cabin he lay wrapped in old and dirty blankets a wornout and broken man who stood in the way of one who was stronger he held an unlighted pipe in his limp and nerveless hand and the cabin reeked with unsavory odors it was unclean and wholly comfortless and it seemed to jimmy who was fresh from the luxury of the mailboats almost horrible that the man to whom he owed his being should lie there in sordid misery at last he straightened himself resolutely  there are several points to consider he said the schooner will be soldthats certainand i must find a room for you ashore its fortunate that one difficulty can be got over men who can work seem to be in demand here just now and when merril sells the tyee there ought to be a few dollars over  there might be if we had anybody to bid against him and run the figure up but we havent anyway bob and i have been talking things over this morning he has had most enough of the sea and one of the cpr men will put him on a soft thing on the wharf well were going to take one of the little framehouses just back of the town between us not quite a mansion jimmy but there are four rooms in it  jimmy felt inclined to groan for he had seen the very primitive and unattractive dwellings in question but he knew that rents are high in that city and money somewhat hard to earn anywhere still it was in one way a relief to turn the conversation in this direction and by and by he remembered that jordan was awaiting him and went up on deck the latter sat down and pulled out his cigarcase  take one and then tell me whats troubling you he said ill own up that i got some notion out of prescott  jimmy found it a relief to comply and talked for several minutes while jordan listened attentively  you have got to stay here said the latter thats a sure thing but theres not much sense in your notion of trackgrading for the railroad or wharflaboring you wait a week or two and i fancy i can suggest something by then that will suit you  i dont know why you should trouble about it said jimmy  well let that go and jordan looked at him with a smile in his keen dark eyes your sister and i have been talking about you she feels that you ought to stay with the old man too  it did not occur to jimmy that there was anything significant in this for he was too anxious to concern himself about anything then except the question as to how he was to secure his fathers comfort  ive been thinking about the auction he said  so have i said jordan now im going to talk straight to you ive invented one or two sawmill fixings and theyve brought me in some money as you know but i want considerably more and ive always had a notion that it was business and not sawing redwood logs i was meant for well merril wants me out of that mill and it seems to me theres room for a big extension of the coastcarrying trade of this country thats merrils notion too i once thought of buying this schoonerthat is wiping out your fathers loanand putting you in command of her now dont get hold of it the wrong wayit was the money there might be in it i was after  he smiled as he saw the faint flush on jimmys face then i fancied there might be more in steam and that since merril wants the tyee id let him have herat a figure anything she brings over and above the bond goes to your father well ill put on a broker to bid for her who knows his business if i have to take her i guess i could get my money back by sailing her and anyway the broker will run merril up you couldnt do it because youd be asked for security that you could put up the money now thats about all except that i want you not to take hold of anything that may be offered you until the auctions over and you have had a talk with me ive got to go back to the mill tomorrow for a week or two  i dont want to be ungracious but there is no reason why you should burden yourself with my affairs  no said jordan dryly i guess there isnt im out for money and thats why i figure that a man who knows as much about the sea as you do might be of some use to me youll promise anyway  jimmy did so and felt that he had done wisely when his comrade went away there was after all no reason why jordan should not befriend him if he wished to and he had a curious confidence in the man it was however two or three weeks later and only a few minutes before the auction which was to be held in a room ashore when he saw him again he did not know that jordan who had arrived in the city two days ago had spent most of one of them at forsters ranch jimmy who had promised tom wheelock to attend the sale was walking up and down the street waiting for the time announced when jordan strolled up to him with a cigar in his hand  had to come down to see our people here he said which was as it happened correct enough went round this morning and saw that broker man hes coming along and if it will be any relief to you ill hand you on his bill of course i could have made my own bid but these fellows know the tricks of the game and im not ready yet for a clean break with merril now we might as well walk in  they passed through part of a big stone building into a large room where a group of city men were talking together for there were timber lands and ranching properties to be sold that afternoon as well as the schooner it was very hot and jimmy found the waiting difficult to bear as he listened to the hum of voices and glanced at his watch until at last the auctioneer sat down at a raised table he hastily read out particulars of the vessel as well as his authority to sell her and then smiled at the assembly  now he said well get right down to business most of you have seen the vessel the rest of you have heard about her and all you have to do is to make me a reasonable bid there is no reserve on her  jimmy felt his face grow a trifle hot with anger the tyee had made his fathers living and since anything she might bring in excess of the loan on her would belong to him it did not seem fitting that she should be flung in this casual fashion on the hands of palpably indifferent purchasers the result of that sale was of vital interest to him and thomas wheelock and he glanced inquiringly at jordan  my man has not come said the latter tranquilly its a game hes accustomed to and when hes wanted hell be here thats one of the new cannery men starting the bidding their inlets a difficult place to make and the steamboat men dont care about calling there except for big loads its significant that he should think of buying her  jimmy did not understand why it should be so but his face grew hard at the laughter when the man made a nominal bid there was silence for almost a minute and he felt a little thrill of dismay run through him for if the tyee went at that figure it would leave his father still heavily in debt  the anchors and cables are worth more said the auctioneer is there nobody willing to raise him fifty dollars  one of the men nodded ill go that far he said still i dont know where i could get it back for her  somebody offered ten dollars more another man twenty and there was languid bidding until the price had almost doubled but then it stopped for a few moments and jimmy saw his companion glance somewhat uneasily toward the door  im beginning to wonder whats keeping my man he said  if he doesnt come soon he might as well stay away altogether said jimmy who turned in tense suspense and watched the hot faces of the men about him  the price then offered would just clear the debt but there were many things his father needed and jimmy had then only a few dollars in his pocket which he had earned by stacking dressed lumber at a sawmill  gentlemen said the auctioneer i dont feel warranted in letting her go at the figure shed bring you half as much again tomorrow if you sailed her over to victoria  ill raise it ten dollars said somebody and the bidding commenced again more indifferently than ever five ten twenty dollars were offered and then five again  jordan touched jimmys arm thats merrils manive been trying to spot himand i guess the cannery man would go up a hundred or two still by the way hes watching him nobody else seems to want her and its quite likely theyll crawl up by tens sit still while i run around and find out whats the matter with my broker  he slipped out but he was back within a few minutes flushed in face and thrust a strip of paper into jimmys hand  i think that makes the thing quite plain he said  jimmy glanced at the paper got a wire last minute and sent over to your hotel but didnt find you in he read had to go out unexpectedly on the sound steamer  he stopped your putting another man on he said  yes said jordan with a snap in his dark eyes knew he was going all the while played me for a sucker well i guess i was one or i wouldnt have given him an option of selling me to merril  selling you  exactly i might have known its quite hard for an outsider to kick against the people who boss these things still since merril knows theres no reason why i should keep my knife in the sheath raise them a hundred dollars ill stand sponsor  jimmy did not stop to consider he knew that every dollar the schooner brought now would go into the pockets of his father and that was enough for him  ill make the figure one hundred dollars more he said  the man jordan had pointed out as merrils agent leaned forward and whispered something to the auctioneer whereupon the latter turned to jimmy with a deprecatory air  the terms are strictly cash he said i presume you are in a position to put down the bills or a bank draft if you got her i have of course the pleasure of these other gentlemens acquaintance  jimmy felt jordan whom he had seen take out a wallet and a fountainpen thrust something into his hand he glanced at it before he faced the auctioneer  i dont know how far that was admissible or inspired he said anyway it doesnt matter this draft should i think speak for itself  the auctioneer apparently waited for him to take it across but jimmy quietly sat down  if you will send your clerk he said  the clerk came forward and a trace of amusement and awakening interest crept into the faces of the rest  thats satisfactory said the auctioneer the signature in question is quite sufficient ill record your bid will anybody raise it  then the men became intent and two of them went up by forties jimmy glanced at his companion who nodded  go right ahead merril and the other man want her he said  a few minutes later to jimmys astonishment forster came in and stood beside them  whats the figure he asked and when jordan told him is she worth it  yes said jimmy you could go up at least five hundred dollars further  ten advance said forster to the auctioneer and then turned to jordan i suppose youre not set on getting her  jordan smiled and forster made a little whimsical gesture i understand doing much the same thing myself miss wheelock and my wife are outside ive been hanging round in the vestibule until it seemed convenient for me to take a hand in  jimmy said nothing but when he looked around a few moments later he was somewhat astonished to see that jordans place was empty his comrade was in fact hastening down the street to where forsters light wagon stood outside a big drygoods store he went in and came upon eleanor wheelock standing very straight and slim in her long white dress she turned and looked at him with a curious little smile  have you come to tell me that forster is taking unnecessary trouble in this affair she said  jordan was not readily disconcerted but he showed a momentary trace of embarrassment  no he replied i havent im open to admit that im not quite as smart as i thought i was my man didnt turn up in fact he sold me to merril  eleanor still looked at him and his tone became deprecatory youre not pleased  no said the girl with a faint flush in her cheeks i like my friends to be successful  jordan winced perceptibly i wont fail next time  are you warranted in thinking there will be another time  i guess so i dont know that i deserve it but you wont be too hard on me  eleanor saw the gleam in his eyes it will depend where is jimmy  bidding against forster and the rest for the tyee  ah said eleanor and for a moment her face softened i dont know why you didnt tell me that earlier hadnt you better go back and see that he doesnt get her  i dont care if he does said jordan that is as long as he gives me half an hour of your company  eleanor laughed leaving out the compliment what would you do if jimmy bought her for you  run her against the first vessel merril put on a trip she was good for if i had to carry freight for nothing  the girl turned and glanced at him again and a hard glint crept into her eyes she looked imperious forceful and vindictive then but the man felt a thrill run through him for he knew his answer had pleased her  ah she said for that i could forgive you many a failure still you must go back and look after jimmy we shall not go away until we hear what you have done  jordan reluctantly turned away and as it happened met jimmy coming out of the auctionroom with perfect satisfaction in his face  i feel that i owe you a good deal in fact im afraid i cant express my gratitude as i ought he said merrils man has got her but i have a clear thousand dollars to hand over to my father still theres something that puzzles me what brought forster here  jordan laughed your sister  eleanor  of course said jordan dryly no doubt because she is your sister you dont credit her with any useful capacity  eleanor is clever said jimmy reflectively still there are subjects girls know nothing aboutand anyway there was mrs forsters attitude to consider its hardly in human nature that she should be pleased to see her husband staking his money to please her childrens teacher  exactly that is what made the thing cleverer she has mrs forsters goodwill too  then said jimmy decisively she must be a very kindly lady  or your sister a very capable young woman you seem to find it a little difficult to recognize that  jimmy dismissed the subject with a little gesture well he said im almost bewildered the thing was so simple why didnt merril think of it  i have no doubt he did still you saw what the little man has to expect if he makes a bid on thinking it over it seems to me that merril trusted to my broker he figured id back down once i realized that he knew my game and was a match for me there are big men like him who live by bluff and everybody makes way for them but theyre apt to show themselves very much the same as other people when you face them resolutely its just like putting a pin in a bubble  then forster joined them while his wife and eleanor came out of the store and a few minutes later the girl and jordan walked behind the other three as they turned toward the hotel where the wagon had been sent eleanor smiled at her companion  we are indebted to you after all she said and there was a faint but suggestive something in her voice which satisfied jordan     chapter xii  the shasta shipping company   two or three weeks had slipped away since the sale of the tyee when jimmy wheelock who had been specially requested to do so called at forsters ranch he did not know why his presence was required and when he arrived was somewhat astonished to find jordan valentine and a man he had not met sitting with his host about a little table in the big general room a decanter and a box of cigars stood on the table but the attitude of the men suggested that it was business that had brought them there jordan who was talking animatedly looked up when jimmy came in  youre not quite on time he said  for which i must make excuses and jimmy turned to forster the fact is i might not have got here at all if the american skipper whose new mizzenmast im helping to fit hadnt run out of wirerigging i couldnt well afford to offend a man who considers my services worth three dollars a day  the man he had not met made a little sign with his hand its an excuse that will pass in this country sit right down jordan insisted on having you here got any money to spare  about forty dollars said jimmy  the other man smiled that wont go very far well we can consider ourselves a quorum and mr jordan will go ahead  one moment said forster mr leeson jimmy help yourselfyou see the cigars  jimmy sat down and glanced at the gentleman who had previously addressed him he fancied he had heard jordan mention him as one interested in the then somewhat decadent sealing industry but there was not very much to be gathered from his appearance he was plainly dressed and elderly and had a lean expressionless face it was seamed with little wrinkles his figure was spare and he leaned forward with an elbow on the table as if it were too much trouble to hold himself upright in the meanwhile jordan recommenced  ill be quite frank with you as to how im fixed because it will help you to understand how i got on the track of the notion he said merril has now a controlling interest in the coast mill and i walked out because i couldnt agree with him well i have some money laid by as well as my royalties and im undertaking a few machinery agencies and starting as mill expert in vancouver in fact ill sell you an american stumppuller mr forster that will save you about half youre spending on grubbing out those firroots by hand labor  another time said leeson with an appreciative grin keep to the shipping business  jordan made a little gesture of resignation well as i told you already theres a good deal of odd freight to be moved up and down this coast and there would be more if there were better facilities i hear of ships held up because the salmonpackers cant get their cases down and men in vancouver island feeding fruit to hogs and cutting good oats for green fodder because they couldnt put them on the market if they thrashed them whats more mr merril has heard about it too and hes an enterprising man ran me out of that west coast mill because i wouldnt come down on my royaltieshim  off the track again said leeson merril has bounced a good many men out of things but if im to put any money into this venture i must have a better reason than that you want to get even  youll get it and jordans dark eyes snapped while his face grew animated what merril thinks safe is good enough for us he has been working up a notion of a coast shipping combine one thats to be all merrils and he has two or three schooners and a big unhandy lump of a coaleating steamer he got her cheap like the rest of them some of us know how he did it  he glanced at jimmy sharply before he went on again now ive been considering his programme and hes taking hold the wrong wayscrewing top freights out of everybody for a bad service cutting down wages and running his boats with cheap men who are going to learn to hate him well with a little handy steamboat that would crawl in wherever there was a beach the ranchers could haul their stuff down to and a policy of general conciliation one could cut the ground right from under him  quite sure of that said leeson without his finding it out  without his finding it outuntil weve got the trade and jordans eyes snapped again were going to oblige people and make our connection with the ranchers and small cannery men a personal thing when he offers a big rebate it will be a little too late and anyway we can carry freight as cheap as merril  how are you going to make it a personal connection asked forster  the things quite easy im going to send round a man who already knows most of those ranchers to take them up fruit packingboxes and statistics of produce prices hell fix it up with them for the boat to crawl in anywhere for a few jumper loads merril cant do it with his schooners or the big steamer i guess a rancher would sooner face a high freight than feed the stuff to hogs or haul it thirty miles over a bushtrail to the dunsmore road then im going to have a goodhumored skipper wholl bring the men off and make friends with them but one with grit enough to shove the boat round on time when she has a perishable freight in a gale of wind shes to be just the right size and to save us coal a modern tricompound  the three things seem essential the last two certainly are said forster with a suggestive smile i guess its scarcely necessary to ask whether you have any idea how to obtain them  jordan laughed and proceeded to astonish his companions which was however a habit of his  got them all he said the steamboats lying down the sound and i hold a weeks option on her jim wheelock would go in command of her and mr valentine can sail as soon as hes ready in the sorata and crawl into every inlet from which he can reach half a dozen ranchers ill have ready for him four or five tons of cut box frames that will only want nailing and theyll go into his saloon hell have everything fixed before merril knows weve despatched him  jimmy glanced at valentines face and broke into a soft laugh though he had been at least as far from expecting this proposition as his companion seemed to be jordan looked at them both and nodded tranquilly  youll go he said and then laid a sheet of paper on the table heres my notion of costs capital salaries and general expenses kind of prospectus shows the usual twentypercent profitonly were going to make it  it was quite clear that he meant it for this was a man who had a full share of the optimism which characterizes most of the inhabitants of the pacific slope he smiled reassuringly at his companions but there was silence for several minutes while leeson examined the paper and then passed it to forster jimmy who felt that his opinion would not be particularly valuable and had noticed the little smile in valentines eyes sat still looking out through the open window at the shadowy bush beyond forsters orchard  it cut vague and black and mysterious against the wondrous green and saffron glow of the sunset and the little trail that wound away into it had just then a curious interest for him he wondered where it led and how long it wandered through the dim shadow before it came out again into the garish brilliancy the thing seemed an allegory for when he came into that country and flung his career away he had felt lost and adrift without a mark to guide him while now jordan and those others were about to set his feet on the trail it must lead somewhere as all trails resolutely followed do though now and then they plunge into tangles of morasses where the rotting pines fall or climb the snowbarred passes of towering ranges he had a curious confidence in the daring american still he felt that in all probability there was a long and difficult march in front of him and the little party then sitting in the slowly darkening room of forsters ranch it was leeson who spoke first  there are men who would call the whole thing crazy and theyd have some reason for doing so he said most of us know what merril is  it was evident that his opinion carried weight and jimmy who felt a growing tension saw the sudden eagerness in jordans face  no he said thats just where youre wrong we know what he pretends to be and if a man puts up a big enough bluff most people back down and dont ask him to make it good you see the point of it  leeson made a little halfimpatient gesture what dyou figure on putting in mr jordan  ten thousand dollars  leeson said nothing but glanced at forster wrinkling his brows  i might manage five thousand said the rancher i havent found clearing virgin bush a very profitable occupation and i want more than the interest im getting from the bank mr jordan has naturally talked over the thing with me before and i fancy his scheme is workable but as i dont know a great deal about these matters id very much like to hear what your opinion of it is  he glanced inquiringly at leeson and it was evident to jimmy that the success or failure of the project depended on what the latter said he sat silent again for almost a minute drumming on the table  well he said youll be told its a fool game most of the men in vancouver city would consider that a sure thingbut im putting in fifteen thousand dollars  jimmy saw his comrades face relax and a little exultant sparkle creep into his eyes while he felt his own heart beat a trifle faster then valentine who had not spoken yet turned to the rest in that case i guess we can consider the thing feasible he said if the sum isnt beneath your notice ill venture a thousand dollars  what has given you a hankering after twenty per cent asked jordan it is not so very long since you told me that the sea which cost nothing was enough for you  valentine laughed i rather think its the occupation that appeals to me charterers have a trick of treading on ones toes occasionally and i dont think i should take kindly to business as it appears to be carried on in the neighboring city one can however talk to the bushranchers intelligently in any case i shouldnt regard that twenty per cent as a certainty  jordan grinned goodhumoredly but there was a twinkle of keener appreciation in forsters eyes there is a good deal the bush can teach the man who wants to understand he said i dare say you are right mr valentine  well said jordan dryly the only use i ever had for the bush was as a place for growing sawlogs but while talk of this kind has nothing to do with business theres something i want to mention i met austerly not long ago and he wants to see you and jim wheelock when you can make it convenient valentine now if youll keep quiet a few minutes ill get on a little  he went on for a considerable time with features hardening into intentness and dark eyes scintillating and when at last he stopped leeson made a sign of concurrence then questions were asked and answered and afterward forster who passed the decanter to his guests stood up  since mr jordan fancies he can raise another few thousand dollars privately if its wanted we can consider the affair arranged he said heres prosperity to the shasta steam shipping company  it was growing dusk when they drank the toast in the big shadowy room and as he glanced at his companions jimmy was momentarily troubled with a sense of his and their insignificance there were only four of them and none of them with the possible exception of old leeson were men of capital while he had an uneasy feeling that in view of merrils opposition it was a very big thing they had undertaken leeson set his wineglass down and shook his head  were going to have to fight for it he said  then the group broke up and jimmy who strolled away to ask for mrs forster saw nothing of his sister or as it happened of jordan either until the ranchers hired man brought his comrades team up jimmy drove home with him but jordan was unusually silent as the team swung along the dim white road once however he appeared to rouse himself  yes he said though jimmy had not spoken old man leeson is right we will have to fight for it still i have put my pile in and we have got to win  he glanced in jimmys direction but the latter said nothing and it was too dark to see his face just got to win he said again as he shook the reins it has been a pull up grade since i was sixteen but somehow i got the things i set my mind on one by one perhaps valentine would tell you they werent all worth while and he might be right about some of them but a man has to be what he was born to beand now i know theres nothing on this earth worth quite so much as what im fighting for  still jimmy did not understand and therefore as was usual with him in such cases made no observation and his comrade laughed curiously when he complained of the jolting instead as he essayed to light a cigar  well said jordan youll go down the sound and see about bringing the shasta up just as soon as youre ready  jimmy went next day and valentine who went alone to austerlys sailed for the west coast on the following day it was two weeks later when jimmy came back with a little twomasted steamer of 250 tons or so she was not by any means a new boat nor were her engines especially powerful and after finding out her various complaints during the sheltered voyage down the sound jimmy had hoped to spend a week or two overhauling her before he went to sea this however was not to be for he had hardly brought her up near the wharf when jordan came off and found him sitting wearily on the bridge begrimed all over and heavyeyed  well he said you look considerably more like the playedout mariner than the wedding guest what has been worrying you anything wrong with her  a good many things said jimmy if i went through the list i should probably scare you she has evidently been lyingup for a while and that is apt to have its effect on any steamboats constitution ive had no sleep all the way up and spent most of the time in manual labor when i wasnt at the helm the men i haveand theyre a tolerably decent crowdnaturally expected to rest now and then  whats the matter with your engineer  nothing except that hes playedoutand i dont wonder hell be fast asleep by now and i dont think id worry him if i were you  jordan looked suddenly thoughtful now be quick is this boat fit to go to sea or has that blamed surveyor swindled you and me  shes sound that is she will be when weve had a month in which to straighten her up or have had a carpenter and foundry gang sent on board her  jordans face showed his relief well he said you have got to take the month at sea you start tonight and can do whats wanted when you have the opportunity theres another thing we have arranged for a kind of inaugural banquet and youll have to straighten her up a little ill send you down some flowers and things  jimmy gazed at him in drowsy consternation if your guests expect anything fit to eat you had better send the banquet too who in the name of wonder are you bringing here  eleanorthat is miss wheelock austerly and his daughter i believe valentine invited them forster and mrs forster and old man leeson too you have got to brace up and face the thing  im going to sleep said jimmy with a gesture of resignation youll take these papers to the respective offices and i may be able to talk sensibly during the afternoon but what made you want to bring eleanor and mrs forster here  jordan laughed and laid his hand on his comrades shoulder ill tell you later youre too sleepy now in the meanwhile ill get round and fix things generally  he went away in a few minutes and jimmy dragging himself into the little room beneath the bridge flung himself down in the skippers berth dressed as he was     chapter xiii  the shasta goes to sea   it was a still clear evening when jimmy stood at the shastas gangway waiting to receive his guests she lay out in the inlet and he could see the two boats sliding across the smooth green water with a measured splash of oars while the voices of their occupants reached him faintly through the clatter of a cpr liners winches and the tolling of a locomotive bell ashore a thin jet of steam simmered about the shastas rusty funnel and she lay motionless on the glassy brine with cracked and splintered decks and what paint a long exposure to rain and sun had not removed peeling from her jimmy had had no time to spare for any attempt at decoration during the voyage down puget sound indeed he and his engineer felt thankful they had succeeded in bring her round at all  by and by the first boat ran alongside and because she belonged to the shasta jimmy was relieved to see that there was after all not a very great deal of water in her though his guests sat with their feet drawn up there were several of them jordan who wore among other somewhat unusual garments a frockcoat and was talking volubly eleanor in elaborate white dress and a very big white hat old leeson forster and his wife jimmy helped them up with difficulty for the shasta was floating high and light and had not been provided with a passenger ladder something in his sisters face perplexed him when at last they stood on deck eleanor was quieter than usual and when she looked at him there was a trace of color in her cheeks he could not quite account for  you seem almost astonished to see me she said even if i hadnt wanted to come charley would have insisted on it  jimmy gazed hard at both her and jordan and noticed that mrs forster seemed a trifle amused  charley he said  of course hasnt he told you said eleanor and though she laughed there was diffidence and pride in her eyes when she glanced at the man beside her it was also her brother felt rather more than the pride of possession  i must explain said jordan when i came off this morning jimmy was too sleepy to be entrusted with any information of the kind still i quite think i deserve a few congratulations  jimmy looked at him with a faint wrinkling of his brows and then involuntarily turned toward the rest of the company  well he said i suppose its only natural though of course i never expected this  mrs forster laughed outright then everybody else did and ventured to approve of it  jimmy stretched his hand out and grasped that of his comrade slowly and tenaciously after all there is nobody i should sooner trust her to and i dont think you could have got anybody morecapable generally he said eleanor you see is cleverer than i am  eleanor wheelock naturally understood her brother and there was whimsical toleration in her smile while the little twinkle grew more pronounced in jordans eyes he was a shrewd man and had already formed a reasonably accurate notion of jimmy and eleanor wheelocks respective capabilities  thank you he said the other boat should be almost alongside  he moved aft with eleanor and the rest of the guests while jimmy who had not quite recovered from his astonishment was leaning on the rail when another boat slid around the shastas stern he recognized austerly and his daughter on board her and then felt his heart beat and the blood creep into his face for anthea merril was sitting at miss austerlys side he had not seen her since he stood one morning on the wharf in the manowar cap but he had thought of her often and now though his pleasure at seeing her almost drove out the other feeling it seemed unfitting that she should be there to take her part in sending out the steamer that was if the shasta company could contrive it to bring to nothing her fathers scheme the boat was alongside in a few moments and when her occupants reached the deck austerly shook hands with jimmy  i must offer you my congratulations on being in command he said my daughter seemed to fancy we should be warranted in bringing miss merril  anthea smiled at jimmy yes she said i wanted to come but of course if it was presumptuous you can send me back again  i think you ought to know there is nobody i should sooner see and jimmy who was not so alert as usual that evening looked at her too steadily  anthea met his gaze for a moment and then considering that she was a young woman accustomed to hold her own in colonial society it was perhaps a trifle curious that she slowly looked away none of the others noticed this except miss austerly and she kept any conclusions she may have formed to herself then though it seemed to come about naturally without anybodys contrivance austerly and his daughter joined jordan and for a few minutes anthea and jimmy were left alone the girl leaned on the rail looking across the shining water toward the great white hull of the empress boat lying immaculate and beautiful in outline beneath the climbing town then she turned and jimmy felt that he knew what she was thinking as her eyes wandered over the little rusty shasta though he had not spoken she smiled in a manner which seemed to imply comprehension when he looked at her  yes she said there has been a change since i last saw youand i am glad you are in command one cant help thinking that you must find this at least a trifle more familiar  at least said jimmy  anthea nodded and her eyes rested on the big white mailboat again i think she said you quite know what i mean  once more jimmys prudence failed him well he said it is rather a curious thing that even when you dont express it i generally seem to i dont knowand he added this reflectivelywhy it should be so  i think that is rather a difficult questionone in fact that we should gain nothing by going into how long are you going to command the shasta  until and jimmy who had not quite recovered from his exertions during the voyage stopped abruptly he could not tell his companion that he expected to sail the dilapidated steamer until she had wrested away a sufficient share of the trade her father was laying hands upon to enable jordan to buy a larger one  i dont quite know he added anyway i was very glad to get her it is pleasanter to take command than to carry planks about the hastings wharf ashore  you were doing that and for no very ostensible reason a faint tinge of color crept into his companions face labor is held more or less honorable in that country but after all anthea merril was a young woman of station  it must have been a change she said a moment later  from the lumber schooner or valentines sorata  anthea looked at him with a sparkle in her eyes pshaw she said are you going to masquerade always or do you think i am quite without intelligence  then she turned and pointed to the beautiful white empress boat when are you going back again  jimmy understood her and made no further disclaimer still his face grew somewhat hard and he moved abruptly  i dont quite know he said very likely i shall never go back at all circumstances are rather against me  and cant you alter them  jimmy drew in his breath and unconsciously straightened himself a trifle the girl stood close beside him looking at himnot as one who asked a question but rather as though she had expressed her belief in his ability to do what he wished the confidence this suggested sent a thrill through him and her quiet graciousnesswhich though she addressed him as one of her own world was not without its trace of natural dignityand her physical beauty set his heart beating  i can try he said simply there are however difficulties  of course and anthea smiled there generally are still if one is resolute enough they can usually be got over  jimmy said nothing he was not after all especially apt at conversation and he could not tell her that among all the difficulties he might have to grapple with the greatest was probably her father  just then as it happened jordan turned and called to them and moving aft they descended to the little stern cabin with the rest it was draped with the least faded flags from the signal locker the table glittered with glass and silver and was set out with great bouquets of flowers the ports were wide open and the cool evening air fragrant in spite of the citys propinquity with the smell of the stanley pines flowed in eleanor wheelock looked around with a smile of appreciation and then turned to jordan  oh she said its pretty you have done it all jimmy would never have thought of that but why are both those flags there  jordan glanced at the two big crossed flags that streamed down upon the settee in the vessels counter they were new and athwart the broad red and white crosses gleamed the silver stars  well he said with a little smile i dont know any reason why they shouldnt be there side by side it seems to me thered be peace on earth right off if they always hung that way if only because all the rest of the world would be afraid to break it you have heard of the first message we sent your folks in the old country over the atlantic cable besides the things symbolical of another alliance thats not only to be wished for but going to be consummated  eleanor blushed becomingly amidst the approving laughter and as she stood there in the gleaming white dress and big white hat with the clear color in her cheeks it seemed to jimmy that he had never seen his sister look half so captivating in fact he was almost astonished that it had not occurred to him before that eleanor was so exceptionally wellfavored the quiet and somewhat plainfeatured mrs forster and austerlys sickly daughter served as fitting foils for her somewhat imperious beauty then as she glanced in his direction jimmy moved a pace or two and anthea came out of the shadow  my sister eleanormiss merril he said  there was a brief silence which jimmy at least found embarrassing for it seemed to him that everybody was watching the two girls with sudden interest he also felt that when anthea merril moved forward eleanor as it were receded into second place against her will his sister was wholly western tall and somewhat spare with the suppleness of a finely tempered spring rather than that of the willow in her figure her quick glance and almost incisive speech matched her bearing one could see that she was optimistic daring strenuous but with anthea merril it was different there was a reserve about her and a repose in voice and gesture which in some curious fashion made both more impressive she was also a trifle warmer in coloring and fuller in outline and stood for or so it seemed to jimmy cultivated ripeness as contrasted with his sisters vigorous and brilliant crudity quite apart from this he had noticed eleanors brows straighten almost imperceptibly and the slight hardness that crept into her eyes the others apparently did not see it but her brother understood those signs  miss merril what does she want here said old leeson who usually spoke somewhat loudly in what he evidently fancied was an aside and it seemed to jimmy that his sisters eyes asked the same question  anthea so far as he could see did not notice this and it was she who spoke first  i almost fancy i have met you somewhere miss wheelock though i do not think it was in vancouver she said toronto is rather a long way offbut i wonder whether you were ever there  i was said eleanor i also saw you though i never spoke to you under the circumstances it was however hardly to be expected  no said anthea with a note of inquiry in her voice and though eleanor smiled there was no softening of her eyes  i was being trained to earn my living and my few friends belonged to a very different set from yours  jimmy was not pleased with his sister she had spoken quietly indeed more quietly and indifferently than she usually did and anthea merril had not shown the least resentment but he felt that there was a sudden antagonism between the two women it was therefore a relief to him when the steward appeared with the dinner most of which jordan had wisely had sent from a big hotel and they sat down at the table  it was a convivial meal jordan talked volubly and there was a sparkle in most of what he said forster and austerly were quietly jocular and eleanor who sat next their host at the head of the table as his brideelect played her part in a fashion that pleased them all other things had also their effect upon the company there was the lovematch between the man who had staked every dollar he could raise to send out that little rusty steamer and the beautiful penniless girl as well as the presence of the daughter of the man who they felt reasonably sure would endeavor to crush him by any means available as it happened anthea merril talked quietly and apparently confidentially to jimmy most of the time and even old leeson who grinned at them sardonically seemed to feel that the situation was rife with dramatic possibilities  by and by the light commenced to fade but eleanors white dress still gleamed against the dull blue and crimson of the crossed flags and in afterdays when there was anger between them jimmy liked to remember her sitting there at jordans side to speed him on the shastas first voyage she made a somewhat imposing figure in the little dusky cabin and what she said struck the right note in the inauguration of that venture for she was optimistic and forceful in speech and gestureand anthea now sat in the shadow  at last old leeson rose with a little dry chuckle i dont know whether speeches are expected he said still i guess theres one toast we ought to honor and thats the engaged pair anyway its one thats especially fitting tonight since it seems to me that if it hadnt been for miss wheelock we wouldnt have been here with steam up on board the shasta  there was a little goodhumored laughter but leeson who appeared unconscious that his observations were open to misconception proceeded calmly  now he said in a general way the less women have to do with business the better but in miss wheelock we have an exception if it hadnt been for her forster would not have put five thousand dollars into the shasta and if he hadnt made the venture its quite likely i wouldnt either its quite a big one for people of our caliber but we have a live man to run the thing and he will have a wife as smart as he is standing right behind him well well wish the pair of them long life and happiness  jimmy rose with his companions but he was conscious that anthea was regarding his sister with grave inquiry then jordan made his reply conventionally and afterward stood still a moment looking at his guests until with a little abrupt gesture he commenced again  mr leesons right it is a big thing we have on hand he said were going to fight and break a monopoly and if all goes as we expect it put money into our pockets but in one way thats only half of it i want you to think of the honest effort the best thing a man has to offer that is being wasted in this country cant you picture the bushranchers hauling produce thirty miles over a trail a city man wouldnt ride a horse along to the railroad and watching fruit most as good as we can raise in california rotting by the ton i want you to think of the oat crops cut green and halfgrown and the men who raised them mending their clothes with flourbags and measuring out their groceries by the cents worth after spending half a lifetime chopping out the ranch its wrongclean against the economy of things we want every pound of whatever they can send us we have mines and mills and money but in this province our food is bad and dear while every man depends on his neighbor the greatest thing in civilization is facility of transport  he stopped a moment for breath and the keen sparkle in his dark eyes grew plainer well were going to provide it and do what we can for the men with the axe and the grubhoe some day this great province will remember what it owes them here its man against nature and the fight is hard while well do more than put money in our pockets if we make it a little easier we want a fair dealand well get it somehowbut we want no more and if we can hold on long enough it wont be only those who sent her out who will say speed the shasta  he stopped amidst acclamation for his mobile face and snapping eyes had amplified his words and while he handled his theme clumsily there was at least no mistaking the strident ring of the dominant note in it in that country it was for the most part man against nature and not man against man and the recognition of the fact was in all who heard him there men wrung their money from rocky hillside and shadowy forest with toil almost incredible creating wealth and not filching it from their fellows but nature is grim and somewhat terrible in the land of rock and snow and all down the great slope from wrangel to shasta the battle is a stern and arduous one so there was a little kindling in the listeners eyes and the women also raised their glasses high as they said speed the shasta knowing that this was in reality but a part of what they felt  then eleanor rose and the company scattering for the most part went back on deck where it once more happened by some means that anthea merril and jimmy found themselves some distance from any of the rest the girl looked up at him with a little smile  well she said what did you think of mr jordans observations  jimmy laughed my opinion wouldnt count i couldnt make a speech for my life  no said anthea still you can hold a steamers wheel and perhaps under the circumstances that is quite as much to the purpose in any case while your comrade was a little flamboyant which is much the same thing as western i think he meant it after all if we parade our sentiments we generally act up to them  jordan said jimmy seems to have quite a stock of them  and i understand he has put every dollar he has into the venture still i suppose he did it cheerfully and you may find it necessary to bring those bushranchers produce down against a gale of wind  there was a smile in her eyes as she looked at him but in spite of that jimmy felt his face grow slightly warm it was not however altogether because anthea noticed it that she changed the subject  there was one point that wasnt quite clear to me why did he say you were going to break up a monopoly  jimmy wished she had asked him anything else for he had already decided that miss merril knew very little about her fathers business  well he said awkwardly thats rather a difficult thing to answer you see he mentioned a monopoly  he certainly did  then to begin with there is the dunsmore road they naturally couldnt handle produce as cheaply as we could and anyway it isnt of much benefit to the ranchers who cant get at it  to begin with that implies more than one which is one would fancy the essential point of a monopoly  perhaps it is said jimmy vaguely still when we get our hand in there will be three  anthea may have had her reasons for not pressing the question then for she laughed of course she said three monopolies well i suppose one must excuse you you can hold a steamers wheel  jimmy on the whole felt relieved when the others sauntered in their direction and was less grieved than he might have been under different circumstances when austerly drew miss merril away he had felt once or twice before during discussions with his sister that keen intelligence is not invariably a commendable thing in a woman after that jordan had a good many instructions to give him and by the time they had been imparted the rest were clustering around the gangway while five minutes later jimmy leaned on the rail watching the boats slide away toward the dusky city then he climbed to his bridge and the windlass commenced to rattle but he did not know that anthea merril who heard his farewell whistle kept the others waiting on the wharf a moment or two while she watched the shasta slowly steam out to sea     chapter xiv  in distress   the clear night was falling when jimmy leaned on the bridgerails as the shasta steamed out of the inlet beneath a black wall of pines over her port quarter the pale lights of the climbing city twinkled tier on tier with dim forest rolling away behind them into the creeping mist beyond that in turn a faint blink of snow still gleamed against the dusky blueness of the east all this was familiar but he was leaving it behind and ahead there lay an empty waste of darkening water into which the shasta pushed her way with thumping engines and a drowsy gurgle at the bows it seemed to jimmy in one sense appropriate that it should be so he had cut himself adrift from all that he had been accustomed to and where the course he had launched upon would lead him he did not know  that however did not greatly trouble him his character was by no means a complex one and it was sufficient for him to do the obvious thing which after all usually saves everybody trouble it was clear that tom wheelock needed him and he could at least look back a little though this was an occupation to which he was not greatly addicted he understood now how his father who had perhaps never been a strong man had slowly broken down under a load of debt that was too heavy for him though the nature of the man who had with deliberate intent laid it on his shoulders was incomprehensible jimmy in fact could scarcely conceive the possibility of any man scheming and plotting to ruin a fellowbeing for the value of two old schooners the apparently insufficient motive made the thing almost devilish merril he felt was outside the pale of humanity a noxious creature to be shunned or on opportunity crushed by honest men  then he wondered for a moment whether the bondholders daughter had inherited any portion of her fathers nature and brushed the thought aside with a little involuntary shiver the thing was out of the question one could he felt perhaps illogically be sure of that after a glance at her and then he straightened himself with a little abrupt movement for it was very clear that this was after all no concern of his he had never met any woman who had made the same impression on him that anthea merril had done but he had already decided that he had sense enough to prevent himself from thinking of her too frequently and it was evident that if he had not he must endeavor to acquire it  he strove to divert his thoughts and listened to the flow of language that rose through the open skylights from the shastas engineroom taken together with the pungent smell of burning grease and a certain harsh thumping it suggested that things were not going well down there then looking forward he watched the black figure of the lookout on the forecastle cut sharp and clean against the pale gleaming of the western sky as the bows swung over the long heave with a rhythmic regularity for the shasta was drawing out into open water now she was making eight knots he fancied with mastheads swaying athwart the stars and a long smoketrail that was a little more solid than the dusky blue transparency streaking the sea astern of her jimmy pulled out his pipe when a faint cold breeze fanned his cheek and lighted it contentedly for a steamboat travels fastest in smooth water when what moving air there is blows against her and there was every sign of fine weather  it lasted several days and the shasta stopped only twice at sea once to cool a crankpin and again for a longer while because there was something wrong with her condenser in due time she crept into a deep mountainwalled inlet where the little white sorata lay and jimmy gazed in astonishment when he saw the piledup produce on the strip of shingle beach between still green water and climbing forest he was even more astonished when certain bronzed men in battered wide hats and soilstained jean came off and conveyed him almost by force to the rude banquet laid out in a little frame hotel hitherto they had hauled the few goods they put on the market rather more than eight leagues along an infamous trail which for a part of that distance led over a mountain range  jimmy feasted that day for the banquet was repeated with very little variation three times over and his last speech was very much to the purpose as well as characteristic of him  boys he said weve steam up and in view of the freight were charging you wellington coal is dear besides even to oblige you i really couldnt eat anything more  they paddled him off in state in a big siwash canoe and their shouts rang far across the silent pines when the little rusty shasta crawled away into the evening mist while long after it had hid her from their sight jimmy standing on his bridge heard the faint wail of the pipes there was as usual a north briton among them and the wild music of another land of rock and pine and inlet six thousand miles away crept up the screwtorn wake in elfin fashion jimmy at least knew the burden of it will ye no come back again  his blood tingled a little as he listened they had held out their hands to him and made him one of them and it was he vaguely felt a thing to be proud of for there was a certain greatness in these simple allenduring men they grappled with giant forests and rent stubborn rocks clearing the way for thousands yet to come with limbs that ached from the axe stroke and hands that bled upon the drill they feared nothing and looked for nothing except the prosperity which they would hardly share but which would surely come and all down the long slope their kind are perfecting a manhood that is probably worth more than all the gold silver iron and wheat raised beneath the beaver or the stars  it was the same at the next inlet for that trip was very much of the nature of a triumphal procession only that as yet the battle was not won and when at last the shasta turned her bows southward she was full to the hatches and deep in the water as it happened she met a strong southwester which piled the long pacific heave upon the reefs to port in big foamcrested walls and after the first twelve hours of it there was scarcely a dry inch on board her she went into it with dipping forecastle that swung up again veiled in cataracts of white and green until her forefoot was clear and with complaining engines made scarcely four knots an hour there were inlets that offered her shelter but hour by hour jimmy clinging battered by flying spray to his reeling bridge drove her ahead the time for making speeches at which he did not shine had gone and it was now his business to keep the promise he had made the ranchers that he would not lose an hour in conveying their produce to the market that at least was a thing he could do and though his drenched limbs grew stiff and his eyesight dim he did it with the dogged thoroughness of his kind standing high in the stinging drift as he drove her swept and streaming at the tumbling seas he too was one of the enduring toilers and like the invincible men with the axes who had recognized the stamp he bore he found a certain grim pleasure in the conflict  it was toward dusk on the second evening when they steamed into sight of a little schooner which showed as a gray smear of slanted canvas scarcely distinguishable from the crag a couple of miles to lee of her jimmy wondered what she was doing there in that weather with only one jib and a reefed boom foresail set until his glasses showed him that her mainmast was broken off that made the thing clearer and in case more should be wanted a flag fluttered aloft and blew out halfway up her foremast upside down it was an appeal that is very seldom made in vain at sea and meant in that particular case that she would be ashore in an hour or two unless somebody towed her off  jimmy closed his glasses with a snap and hailing a very wet seaman sent him for the engineer the latter climbed to the bridge and nodded when he glanced at the vessel  well he said youll have to take them off shes not going to claw off shore without her mainsail there would be a little money in the thing if we could tow her but we cant im taking steep chances of bringing the engines down about my head by shoving her into it as im doing  as though to give point to the speech the shasta flung her stern high just then and shook in every plate as with a frantic clanging the engines ran away then she put her bows in and dim crag and wallowing schooner were blotted out by a cloud of spray  we have got to try said jimmy quietly theres a point that would give us shelter twenty miles away  twenty miles and the engineer from whose blackened singlet the water streamed laughed scornfully its bout as likely wed tow her to honolulu still i guess youre skipper  jimmy nodded he had not troubled to impress the fact upon his crew but he invariably acted on it you had better raise a little more steam he said it is very likely that well want it  then as the dripping engineer vanished from the bridge he seized the whistle lanyard and signed to the man behind him who gripped the wheel a deep blast rent the turmoil of the sea and the shasta swinging around a trifle rolled away to the rescue it was some twenty minutes later when she stopped and lay plunging head to sea with the little wallowing schooner close to lee of her the light was going but jimmy could see a shapeless figure that clung to her rail gesticulating with flungup arm the wreck of a boat apparently smashed by the falling mast lay across her hatch and there was another halfseen man at her wheel jimmy stood still for a few moments with his hand on the telegraph and he was glad to remember that there were several former sealingschooner hands among his crew for what they do not know about boatwork is worth no mans learning  he let the shasta swing a little to give them a lee on one side of her and while the sea smote and spouted in green cataracts across her weatherrail they swung a boat over and two men one of whom was a siwash dropped into her that was enough to steer her while she blew to windward and jimmy dared risk no more they got her away apparently undamaged and he sent the shasta slowly ahead when she plunged over a seatop veiled in a cloud of spray it would be beyond the power of flesh and blood to pull that boat back and the shasta swung in a wide halfcircle to leeward of the schooner her crew had evidently tried to heave her to but without her aftercanvas she had fallen off again and was forging ahead with the shastas boat smothered in foam beneath her rail she was going to leeward bodily and jimmy fancied she was about a mile nearer the crag than when he had first seen her it was evident to everybody that he had no time to lose  he shouted with arm flung up and though it was doubtful whether anybody heard him the schooners boom foresail came thrashing down and two men who leapt upon her rail fell into the boat then he thrust down his telegraph and as the shasta forged by the boat drove down on her she struck the steamers hoveup side with a crash that stove several strakes of planking in and men jumped for the flungdown lines as she filled they scrambled up them four in all and for one of them had hooked on the davit falls the shastas winch banged and rattled as they hove the boat in with the water streaming out through her shattered side at every roll the men had however brought a rope with them and the winch next hove the schooners stoutest hawser off it was made fast and rose splashing from the sea when jimmy touched his telegraph again while when at last the schooner fell into line astern a very wet man clambered to the bridge  are you fit to pull her out he asked  i dont know said jimmy im going to try how did you get so far inshore and have you left anybody to steer her  the man made a vague gesture mainmast went beneath the hounds shes been driving to leeward since and shed have been ashore in another hour if we hadnt fallen in with you the old mans at her wheel built her himself most fifteen years ago and nothing would shift him out of her  jimmy glanced astern and for a few moments saw a gray face of rock loom out of the haze with the sea spouting dimly white at its feet then a thicker fold of vapor rolled about it and the daylight faded suddenly he could scarcely see the schooner lurching along behind them with jib still set though the sail thrashed now and then indeed his eyes were growing very heavy and he realized that after fortyeight hours continuous watching he could not keep himself awake much longer a simple calculation showed him that it would be daylight again before he could put his helm up and run for shelter when it would be imperatively necessary for him to be on his bridge and calling his scandinavian mate he left the shasta in his charge  keep her going as shes heading now he said youll see ive headed her up a few points to allow for the leeward drag of the tow you can call me in a couple of hours or earlier if theres any change in the weather  he clawed his way down from the bridge to the little room beneath it and shed only his streaming oilskins before he flung himself into his bunk he was asleep in two or three minutes and slept soundly while the water oozed from his wet garments until he was roused by a shouting then his door was flung open and a man thrust his head in  mr lindstrom figures youd better get up he said the tow has parted her hawser and gone adrift  jimmy was out of his bunk in a moment and in a few more had scrambled to his bridge lindstrom the scandinavian shouted something he did not hear but that did not very much matter for the one question was where was the schooner and jimmy was tolerably certain that nobody knew his light had been burning and for the first few moments he could see nothing but blackness out of which there drove continuous showers of stinging spray then he made out the filmy cloud it sprang from at the shastas bows and swept his gaze aloft toward the pale silver streak above her mastheads which showed where the halfmoon might come through as he did so the scandinavian gripped his shoulder and he saw a red twinkle widen into a windblown flame low down upon the sea now he could at least locate the tow  did you get a sight of the beach how far were we off he shouted  a low point said lindstrom which i do not know one mile i guess it and we head her out more off shore  jimmy was a trifle startled though the water is deep along that coast a mile leaves very small margin for contingencies and he fancied that the tow blowing to leeward would cover it in half an hour in that case there was not the slightest doubt as to what would then happen to her she might perhaps last five minutes as a vessel for the reefs are hard and there is a tremendous striking force in the long pacific seas another point was equally clear he had some twenty minutes in which to overhaul the schooner and take her skipper off and no boat to do the latter with if he failed to accomplish it in the time it was very probable that the shasta would go ashore and he did not think that any one would escape by swimming still he meant to do what he could and once more he set the whistle shrieking as he shouted to the helmsman  the shasta came round and drove away into the darkness for the light had died out again and there was nothing visible ahead but the dim white tops of frothing seas five minutes passed and jimmy felt the tension for they were steaming toward destruction and it was quite possible that they might run past the schooner or straight over her then a shaft of moonlight struck the climbing pines high up in front of him and it seemed to him that he was already almost under them he set his lips and clenched the hand he would not raise in warning to the helmsman while the pale watery moonlight crept lower and lower it rested for a moment on a fringe of creaming foam where the rock met the water and then a hoarse shout went up for as it swept toward him they saw the schooner  she was not far ahead of them with jib thrashed to ribands and the sea streaming from her swungup side jimmy thrust down his telegraph and shouted to lindstrom who dropped from the bridge as they drove past her stern then as he raised his hand the man behind him gasped as he struggled with his wheel and the shasta stopping lay rolling wildly beneath the schooners lee while a shadowy figure gesticulated to those on board her from her sprayswept rail jimmy glanced shoreward over his shoulder toward the tumbling surf and decided that he had at most five minutes to take that man off after that it would probably be too late for all of them  mercifully the moonlight still streamed down and he waited with lips set and hands clenched on the telegraph while the schooner being lighter drove down upon the shasta one blow might make an end of both of them but something must be hazarded and he spared a glance for the wet men who crouched upon the shastas rail with lines in their hands he had smashed one boat not long ago and the second and smaller one had been damaged a week earlier bringing a siwash to take them up a certain inlet off an unsheltered beach  the schooner was very near them and if he stayed where he was would come down on top of the steamer in another minute or so then lindstrom sprang out of the galley with a blue light in his hand and its radiance blazed windflung and intense on the narrowing gap of foam between the two wildly rolling hulls there was a hoarse shouting and though he might not have heard the words it was evident that the man on board the schooner realized what he was expected to do jimmy set his lips tighter as he pressed down the telegraph to slow ahead  the shastas propeller thudded and as the schooner reeled toward her she commenced to move and a black figure plunged with flungup hands from the latters shrouds it struck the seething water and vanished for a moment or two while men held their breath and strained their eyes then there was a hoarse clamor and lines went whirling down from the shastas rail in the midst of it black darkness succeeded as lindstroms light went out jimmy gasped wondering when the schooner would strike them while he clenched his hand on the telegraph there was faint moonlight still but it did not seem to touch the schooner for his eyes were dazzled by the blaze of the blue light  a moment later another shout rang out he has hold get down cant you stop her sir  jimmy knowing what the hazard was pressed his telegraph and held his breath until a harsh voice rose again  i have a grip of him it said heave weve got him sir go ahead shes coming down on the top of us  jimmy moved his hand and the gong clanged out fullspeed this time while glancing to windward he saw the black shape of the schooner hoveup apparently above him still quivering all through the shasta forged ahead and he leaned on the rails for now that the tension had slackened he felt curiously limp  the mans all right he asked  lindstrom who climbed halfway up the ladder said that he did not seem to have suffered very much and jimmy looking around saw nothing of the schooner for there was sudden darkness as the moon went out     chapter xv  eleanors bitterness   it was in a state of quiet contentment that jimmy stood on his bridge as the shasta steamed past the stanley pines into sight of the clustering roofs of vancouver his first voyage had been an unqualified success in every respect and it was clear that the shasta had done considerably more than cover her working expenses this was in several ways a great relief to him since it promised to obviate any difficulty in providing for his fathers comfort and also opened up the prospect of a career for himself jordan had assured him before he sailed that they would have no great trouble in raising funds to purchase another boat if the results of the venture warranted it he had also said that since one thing led to another there was no reason why the shasta company should not run several steamers by and by in which case jimmy would naturally become commodorecaptain or general superintendent of the fleet  as it happened jordan was the first person jimmys eyes rested on when he rang off his engines as the shasta slid in to the wharf and he climbed on board while they made her fast it however seemed to jimmy that his movements were less brisk than usual and he was also dressed in black which was a color he had once or twice expressed himself in his comrades hearing as having no use for he came up the bridgeladder quietly in place of scrambling up it in hot haste which would have been much more characteristic and jimmy noticed that there was a difference in his manner when he shook hands with him the latters satisfaction commenced to melt away and a vague disquietude grew upon him in place of it  everything straight here he asked veiling his anxiety  oh yes said jordan that is in most respects we have an outward freightcomox minesfor you youll take her up the straits that way when you go back again you seem to have her full  i had to leave a good many odds and ends behind and the ranchers expect to have more produce for us in a month or two one or two of them were talking about baling presses and a small thrashing mill ive an inquiry for the plant which you can attend to another fellow was contemplating putting on some tenas siwash to see whether there was anything to be made out of handsplit shingles and several more were going to plant every cleared acre with potatoes for victoria im to take up two of your mechanical stumpgrubbers as soon as you can get them if we can keep them pleased well get all their trade  jordan nodded without however any sign of the eagerness jimmy had expected well he said thats quite satisfactory so far as it goes still there are troubles that even the prospect of piling up money cant lift one over  of course said jimmy who looked at him with sudden sympathy still i fancied you told me you had no near relatives what are you wearing those clothes for  his comrade laid a hand on his shoulder its a thing i shouldnt have done on my own account i did itsteady jimmy you have to face itto please your sister  ah said jimmy with a sharp indrawing of his breath and leaned on the bridgerails for a moment or two his lips quivered and jordan saw him clench his hard brown hands busy wharf and climbing city faded from before his eyes and he was sensible only of a curious numbing stupor that for the time being banished grief then he felt his comrades grasp grow tighter  brace up said jordan its a thing we have all of us to stand up under  jimmy straightened himself slowly while the color paled in his face  when did it happenand how he asked  last night the doctor had been round once or twice since you went away and i understood from what prescott said that he was getting along satisfactorilythat is physically  jimmy said nothing but looked at him with hard questioning eyes  well it appears he was worrying himself considerably told prescott it was a pity he couldnt die right away nobody had any use for him and he didnt want to be a burden seems he went over it quite often the doctor had cut him off from the whisky  he stopped with evident embarrassment and pain in his face but jimmys eyes never wavered though a creeping horror came upon him in spite of the difficulty he had in thinking he felt that he had not yet heard all  go on he said in a low harsh voice  i dont think i could have told you only it would have fallen on eleanor if i hadnt and she has as much as she can bear youll keep that in mind wont you jimmy he got some whiskywe dont know howone of the wharfhands who used to look in bought it for him most probably prescott had to go out now and then you see  he stopped for a moment and made a little gesture of sympathy before he went on again somehow he fell over the table and the kerosene lamp went over with it too when one of the neighbors who heard him call went in nobody could have done anything for him  the last trace of color ebbed from jimmys face and he stood very still with set lips and tightly clenched hands then he turned aside with a groan of horror  lord he said hoarsely that at least might have been spared him  in another moment he swung around on his comrade almost savagely with a bitter laugh and you want to marry my sister eleanor  yes said jordan just as soon as it can decently be done jimmy you darent blame him  blame him and jimmys voice was strained if i had had his load to carry and felt it as he did i should probably have gone under long ago  he leaned heavily on the rail for a minute or two and then apparently rousing himself with an effort turned toward his comrade as you say i must stand up to it how is eleanor bearing it  quietlytoo quietly im most afraid of her shes herei went over to forsters for her insists on staying in the house ill send somebody around with your papers and then go along with you  five minutes later they went ashore together and it was falling dusk when they reached a little fourroomed framehouse which stood near a row of others of very much the same kind amidst the tall firstumps which straggled up a rise on the outskirts of the town it was such a one as the few wharf and sawmill hands who were married usually lived incomfortless primitive and rickety jimmy remembered how he had determined when he sailed south with the shasta full to the hatches that his father should not stay another month in it  he was almost startled when his sister led them into the little general room for it was evident that there had been a great change in her that at least was how he regarded it then but afterward he understood that it was only something which had been in her nature all the time making itself apparent he did not remember whether she kissed him but she sat down and looked at him with the light of the lamp upon her while jimmy who could find nothing at all to say gazed at her  eleanor had already provided herself with somber garments and they emphasized the severity of contour of her supple figure they also forced up the pallor of her face which was relieved only by a faint blotch of color in either cheek and in spite of this in a curious fashion made her beautiful jimmy had hitherto admitted that his sister was pretty but as he recognized that word was not the right one now she was imperious dominant a force embodied in a womans shape and her brother was vaguely conscious that he shrank a little from her eleanor did not seem to want his sympathy the coldness of her face repelled him the fastidious neatness of her goldbronze hair appeared unnatural and her paleblue eyes had a hard glitter like that of a diamond in them it was evident that in place of being crushed she was filled with an intense suppressed virility indeed there was something in her appearance and manner that was suggestive of a beautifully tempered spring one that would fly back the moment the strain slackened and perhaps cut deep into the hand that compressed it it was the girl who spoke first and her voice had a certain incisive quality in its evenness  charley has told you she said i can see that by your face he insisted on doing so to save me well i am grateful charleythat is as grateful as i am capable of beingbut i will not keep you  jordan looked disconcerted cant you let me stay there are one or two ways in which i could be of service  eleanor made a little imperious sign and though jimmy once more found it difficult to realize that this woman whose coldness suggested a whiteheat of passion was his sister he was not altogether astonished when jordan slowly rose  then im going no farther than the first firstump thats low enough to make a seat he said if im wanted jimmy has only to come out and call  he went out and eleanor turned to her brother i am afraid charley is going to be sorry i promised to marry him she said still i think i am fond of him or i might have been if this horrible thing hadnt come between us it is horrible jimmyone of the things after which one can never be quite the same i have a good deal to say to youbut you must see him  jimmy made a sign of concurrence and his sister rose first of all there is something else it is a hard thing but it must be done  she turned to a cupboard and taking out a bottle of corn whisky laid it before him with a composure that jarred on the man her portentous quietness troubled him far more than a flood of tears or a wild outbreak would have done then she laid her finger on the outside of the bottle as though to indicate how much had been taken out of it  i think that accounts for everything she said still he was driven to it i want you to remember that as long as you and the man who is responsible live prescott knows and charleyi had to tell him but nobody else must ever dream of it  of course you had to tell charley said jimmy hoarsely still the inquest  a scornful glitter crept into eleanors eyes that you will leave to me i have been drilling prescott as to what he is to say and if they question charley who got here before the doctor when prescott sent for him he will stand by me  jimmy looked somewhat startled but when he strove to frame his thoughts the girl silenced him if it were necessary to corrupt everybody who had ever been acquainted with him and i could do itat any costit would be done nowand she quietly took up the lampyou will come with me  jimmy shivered a little as he went with her into the adjoining room and set his lips tight when with a steady hand she drew the coverlet down then while his eyes grew a trifle hazy he drew in a little breath of relief for tom wheelock lay white and serene at last with closed eyes and no sign of pain in his quiet face from which all the weariness had vanished only a clean linen bandage which ran from one temple to behind the other ear was laid upon it there was nothing that one could shrink from and jimmy made a gesture of protest when eleanor laid her hand on the bandage  she met his eyes with something that suggested contempt in hers and quietly drew back the bandage and then the soft white sheet from the shoulder of the rigid figure jimmy sickened suddenly and seized her arm in a constraining grasp  put it back he said that is enoughenough i tell you  then while the girl obeyed him he turned from her with a groan gasped once or twice and sat down limply he could not look around again until her task was concluded and he would not look at her it seemed an almost interminable time before she spoke  still she said you must look at him again i should like you to remember him as he is now perhaps you can jimmy but that relief is not for me  jimmy rose and in another few moments turned his head away he stood still with a whirl of confused emotions that left him halfdazed rioting within him while he glanced vacantly round the room it was scantily furnished and generally comfortless and mean long smears of resinous matter exuded from the rough frame boarding of its walls and there were shrinkage rents in part of it that let the cool night air in in one place he could see where a drip from the shingle roof had spread into a wide damp patch on the uncovered floor and it seemed an almost insufferable thing that his father should have spent his last days in such surroundings then he glanced at eleanor standing a rigid somber figure with the lamp in her hand and it seemed that she guessed what he was thinking  it does not matter nowbut he was once considered a prosperous man she said the contrast was one of the things he never complained of but i think he felt it  jimmy turned and went out with her and sitting down in the adjoining room she looked at him with the quietness he was commencing to shrink from she seemed to understand that too  you think i am unnatural she said perhaps you are rightbut even if you are what does it matter still i believe i was fonder of him than you ever were if i hadnt been could i have done all this for you and him  she stopped for a moment and the hard gleam flashed back into her paleblue eyes he was horribly burned jimmy and until the last few minutes crazed with drink and pain still he was driven to his death and degradation  jimmy only gazed at her with a tightening of his lips and the girl went on in the clear incisive tones that so jarred on him i think it was more than murder can you remember him as anything but abstemious and only unwise in his easy kindliness until the man who crushed him held him in his clutches weak there are people who would tell you that and perhaps he was it was the load he had to bear made him so try to remember him jimmy as he used to bebrave and gentle devoted to your mother and mine the man who they said never ran for shelter in the fiercest breeze of wind tryi want you to  jimmy turned to her abruptly moistening his dry lips with his tongue eleanor have done i cant stand any more  you must and the girl laughed harshly i hold that he was murdered is there any real distinction between the man who holds you up with a pistol and kills you for your money suddenly and in one way mercifully and the one who with cold cunning slowly sucks your blood until he has drained the last drop out of you still that is not all if he had only died as most men die you must remember the upset lamp and the whisky jimmy  stop said jimmy hoarsely clenching a brown hand while the perspiration started from him i cant stand it it is horrible eleanor you are a womanyou have promised to marry my comrade  the girl rose and crossing to where he sat laid a hand on his shoulder as she looked down at him i feel all that you feel with a greater intensity but i can bear it and you must bear it too charley will not complain and i would be his slave or mistress as long as he would stand by me until i carry out my purpose he is only my lover but you are tom wheelocks son what are you going to do  what can i do and jimmy made a little hopeless gesture perhaps it would be only justice but i cant waylay merril with a pistol the man has no human nature in him i couldnt even provoke him to strike me  no said eleanor with a bitter laugh that would be foolishly theatrical and in one way too easy it would not satisfy me you will wait ever so long if its necessary and command the shasta while you take his trade away then we will find other meansbusiness means it can i think be done he must be slowly drained and ruined and flung aside a broken man as your father was then it would not matter whether he dies or not  jimmy shrank from her a little and she smiled as she noticed it there is a good deal of our mothers nature in both of us and you cannot get away from it it will make you a man jimmy in spite of all your amiable qualities  still said jimmy vaguely one has to be practical im afraid it isnt easy to ruin a man like merril just because you would like toive met him you see the shasta company was not started with that purpose either and it was only because jordan is a friend of mine that i was put in as skipper  didnt old leeson say that the shasta company would never have been formed if it hadnt been for me it is a struggling little company and merril is a big man and apparently rich but there are often chances for the men with nerve enough  jimmy rose if one ever comes in my way i shall try to profit by it that is all i can say im a little dazed eleanor i think ill go out and try to clear my brain again you wont mind i hear prescott  he met prescott in the doorway and walking past the few framehouses found jordan sitting cigar in hand upon a big firstump when jimmy stopped beside him he made a little sign of comprehension and sympathy  i guess i know what eleanor has told you he said in one way its not astonishing that she should feel what she does and i cant blame her though its a little rough on me this is a thing shell never quite get overwhile the other man lives prosperous anywayand of course im standing in with her  but its not your affair  its eleanors and that counts with me besides im not fond of merril either  jimmy was touched by the mans devotion but once more he could find nothing apposite to say and jordan went on  sometimes as i told you im a little afraid of eleanor and perhaps thats why i like her it seems to me you never quite understood your sister your mother made the wheelock fleet and its quite likely that eleanors going to make the shasta shipping company im no slouch but she has more brains than you and i and old leeson rolled together now you want to rouse yourself and she has prescott with her youll walk down to the steamer with me     chapter xvi  under restraint   austerly who was essentially english and a servant of the crown somewhat naturally lived outside the boundaries of vancouver he had the tastes and prejudices of his class and did not like the life most men lead in the western cities which is in some respects communistic and without privacy even those of some standing with a house of their own not infrequently use it only to sleep in and take their meals at a hotel while should they retire to their own dwelling in the evening they are scarcely likely to enjoy the quietness the insular englishman as a rule delights in people walk in and out casually until late at night and a certain proportion of them are chronically thirsty this in case of a business man has its advantages as well as its drawbacks but austerly only recognized the latter he said it was like living in the street and he did not appreciate being called on at eleven oclock at night by men of doubtful character whom he had met for the first time a few days before  he accordingly retired to a retreat that one of his predecessors had built outside the city which shades off on that side from stone and steel through gradations of framehouses and rickety shanties into a wilderness of blackened firstumps the western cities lie open and though the life in them is more suggestive of that of paris than the staidness of an english town they have neither gate nor barrier and are usually ready to welcome all who care to enter strongarmed men who limp in red with dust in dilapidated shoes as well as purchasers of land and commercial enterprise directors they have it frequently happens need of the one and a bonus instead of taxes to offer the other who may purpose to set up mills and workshops within their borders  austerly however was not altogether a recluse and it came about one evening that jimmy who had arrived there with a few other guests sat beside anthea merril in the garden of his house the sunlight still shone upon the struggling grass to which neither money nor labor could impart much resemblance to an english lawn but great pines and cedars walled it in and one caught entrancing vistas of shining water and coldly gleaming snow through the openings between their mighty trunks the evening was hot and still the air heavy with the ambrosial odors of the forest and the dying roar of a great freight train that came throbbing out of its dim recesses emphasized the silence the little house rose gay with painted scrollwork and relieved by its trellises and wooden pillars beneath the dark cedar branches across the lawn jimmy had seen valentine and miss austerly sitting on the veranda a few minutes earlier he was however just then looking at his companion and wondering whether in spite of the pleasure it afforded him he had been wise in coming there at all  anthea was dressed richly in a fashion which it seemed to him became her wonderfully well and he was quite aware that the few minutes he had now spent in her company would be sufficient to render him restless during the remainder of the week jimmy had discovered that while it was difficult to resolve that he would think no more of her it was considerably harder to carry out the prudent decision  it is some little time since i saw you last she said  four weeks said jimmy promptly that is it would be if this were tomorrow  anthea smiled though she naturally noticed that there was a certain significance in this accuracy jimmy realized it too for he added a trifle hastily the fact that it was just before the shasta went to sea fixed it in my mind  of course and anthea laughed that would no doubt account for it are your afterthoughts always as happy captain wheelock  jimmy felt a little uncomfortable her goodhumor in which there was nothing incisive was he felt in one way a sufficient rebuff though he could not tell whether she had meant it as such it was also disconcerting to discover that she had evidently followed the train of reasoning which had led to the remark though this was a thing she seemed addicted to doing after all there are men who fail to understand that in certain circumstances it is not insuperably difficult for a woman to tell their thoughts before they express them  im afraid i dont excel at that kind of thing he said its perhaps fortunate my friends realize it  anthea turned and looked at him with reposeful eyes well she said reflectively i almost fancied you were not particularly pleased to see me you had at least very little to say at dinner  jimmy to his annoyance felt the blood rise to his forehead he had sense enough to see that his companion did not intend this to be what in similar circumstances is sometimes called encouraging he was not a brilliant man but it is after all very seldom that an extramasters certificate or a naval reserve commission is held by a fool anthea had he felt merely asked him a question and he could not tell her that he would have avoided her only because he felt afraid that the delight he found in her company might prove too much for his selfrestraint  still he said somewhat inanely how could i you were talking to that englishman all the time  burnell said anthea yes i suppose i was he and his wife are rather old friends of mine they have just come from honolulu and talk about taking the yacht up to alaska in that case they want nellie and me to go with them  jimmy remembered the beautiful white steamyacht which had passed the shasta on her way to vancouver a day or two ago and was sensible of a vague relief that was at the same time not quite free from concern if anthea went to alaska it was certain that he would have no opportunity for meeting her for a considerable time that was in one way what he desired but it by no means afforded him the satisfaction he felt it should have done she did not however appear inclined to dwell upon the subject  i think i ought to congratulate you on what you did a few weeks ago she said i read the schoonermans narrative in the paper  jimmy laughed if i had known he was going to tell that tale i almost fancy i should have left him where he was but after all i scarcely think he did seas of the kind mentioned could exist only in a newspapermans imagination  the girl smiled for though what she thought did not appear she saw the shade of darker color in his face and jimmy was very likeable in his momentary confusion now and then his ingenuous nature revealed itself in spite of his restraint but nobody ever shrank from a glimpse of it for he had in him as anthea had seen something of the largeness and openness of the sea  still she said i heard one or two men who understand such things talking about it and they seemed to agree that it needed nerve and courage to take the schooner skipper off without wrecking your vessel but you are perhaps right about the imagination of the men who serve such papers  jimmy noticed the trace of halfcontemptuous anger in her face and voice and fancied he understood it he had of course seen the issue of the paper in question and had read close beneath the schoonermans account of his rescue a bitter and plainly worded attack upon his companions father merril was a political as well as a commercial influence and journalists in that country do not shrink from personalities he felt by the way she glanced at him that she knew he had done so  yes she said though he had not spoken you understand what i am alluding to still i suppose anybody who does all he can for the province must expect to be misrepresented  jimmys face grew a trifle hard he did not know exactly what she expected from him but even to please her he would not admit that the man who had seized the tyee could be misrepresented in any way unless indeed somebody held him up as a pattern of virtue  i suppose your father denied the statements he said i have of course been away  no replied anthea it was scarcely worth while after all very few people would consider the thing seriously  she turned to him again with an inquiring glance and there was a certain insistency in her tone of course that ought to be clear to anybody  jimmy met her glance steadily and set his lips as he usually did when he was stirred and he was stirred rather deeply then still nothing would have induced him to say a word in merrils favor then it seemed to him that the girls expression changed he could almost have fancied there was a suggestion of appeal in her eyes as though she would have liked him to constitute himself her ally and indeed had halfexpected it it set his heart beating and sent a little thrill through him for in that moment it was clear that she wished to believe altogether in her father and would value any support that he could offer her in other circumstances it would have been a delight to take up the cause of any of her kin whatever it might have cost him but just then he was conscious of a bitter hatred of the man in question and jimmy was in all things honest  im afraid i dont know how people are likely to regard it he said you see i am almost a stranger in the province i have been away so long  anthea appeared to assent to this but jimmy realized that she felt that he had failed her still the thing was done and he would not have done it differently had another opportunity been afforded him  well she said slowly there is something i want to mention i fancy mr burnell has a favor to ask of you this evening and it might perhaps be wise to oblige him he can be a very good friend as i have reason to know and though he may not mention this he is one understands rather a prominent figure in the directorate of the  mail company  for a few moments jimmy was troubled by an unpleasant sense of confusion the mans name was famous in the shipping world and there were a good many aspiring steamboat officers who sought his goodwill while since he could not have heard of jimmy until a day or two ago it was evident that somebody in vancouver city had spoken in his favor jimmy fancied he knew who this must be and it was but a minute or two since he had turned a deaf ear to the girls appeal then he roused himself as he saw her curious smile  so that is the famous man he said i should never have imagined it  anthea laughed as she rose but before she moved away she turned to him confidentially i really think she said you should do what he asks you  then she left him and it was some minutes later when a little quiet englishman strolled in that direction cigar in hand he sat down by jimmy  i dont know whether im presuming but i believe you are duly qualified to take command of a british steamer and are acquainted with the northwest coast he said  jimmy said he had not been far north and burnell appeared to reflect for a moment or two  after all he said i dont suppose that matters so very much im in rather a difficulty and you may be able to do something for me we lost our skipper and my mate and several of the crew have taken leave of me here unceremoniously i wish to ask if you would take the yacht up to alaska for me and afterward home again i should naturally be prepared to offer whatever salary is obtainable here by a duly qualified skipper and as several of my friends are also yours you would of course continue to meet them on that footing while you were on board  there is one point said jimmy the arrangement would necessarily be a temporary one  i fancied you would raise it well it would perhaps be a little premature to say very much just now but i did not come to vancouver entirely on pleasure in fact it is likely that we shall shortly attempt to cut into the american southsea trade in which case we should want commanders for a 4000ton boat or two from this city if not i almost think i can promise that you would not suffer from serving me i may mention that your friends speak of you very favorably  jimmy thought hard for a minute or two it was a very tempting offer and wages out of that port were excellent just then what was more to the purpose it promised to send him back to the liners where a commander was a person of some consequence and besides this anthea had told him that she was in all probability going to alaska then he reluctantly shook his head  im afraid i cant close with you sir he said the fact is i consider myself bound to the shasta company  ah said burnell their terms are still more favorable one would scarcely have fancied it  no said jimmy that is certainly not the case still they put me into the little boat out of friendlinessand im not quite sure anybody else could do as much for them or at least would make an equal effort in the somewhat curious circumstances of course that sounds a trifle egotistical but still  burnell signified comprehension it is not altogether a question of money  i couldnt come if you offered me treble the usual thing said jimmy gravely  the other man nodded well he said im sorry because after what you have told me i almost think we should have hit it tolerably well together at any time you think i could be of service you can write to me  he talked about other matters for a while and it was half an hour after he went away when jimmy once more came face to face with anthea merril she was walking slowly through the creeping shadow of the pines and stopped when she saw him beside a barberry bush among whose clustering blossoms jeweled hummingbirds flitted one of them that gleamed iridescent hovered on wings that moved invisibly close above her shoulder  so she said you have not done as i suggested  jimmy looked at her gravely and once more felt the blood creep into his face she had told him she was going to alaska on board the yacht and he almost ventured to fancy she had meant it as an inducement but there was no trace of resentment in her voice anthea was too proud for that  im sorry he said still you see i couldnt  there was no doubt that he was sorry and a look that left him almost bewildered crept into the girls eyes  why she asked quietly  it was a somewhat unfortunate question since it afforded an opening for two different answers and jimmy who fancied she wished to learn why the fact that he could not go should grieve him lost his head  why he said surely that cant be necessary i think there is only one thing that could have stopped my going if it hadnt been for that i would have walked barefoot across the province to join the ship  anthea looked up and met his eyes steadily it was clear that she understood him but there was no reproof in her gaze and for a moment the man felt the sudden passion seize and almost shake the selfrestraint from him the girl was very alluring and just then her pride had gone while it was vaguely borne in on him that he had but to ask or rather take her masterfully perhaps he was right for there are moments when wealth and station do not seem to count and an eager word or two or a sudden compelling seizure of the white hand that hung so close beside him might have been all that was needed he looked at her with gleaming eyes while a little quiver ran through him still he remembered suddenly whose daughter she was and the bitter grievance he had against her father the opposition merril would certainly offer and the stigma others might cast upon him if he wrested a promise from her then also counted for something and though neither of them made any sign both knew when she spoke again that the moment had passed  that she said was not what i meant why is it impossible for you to go  jimmy was himself again for her voice and look had swiftly changed i think it is only your due that i should tell you since i know why burnell put the offer before me well i was glad to get the shasta and it would hardly be the thing to leave her now jordan and the others put money they could very hardly spare into the ventureand when they did it they had confidence in me  ah said anthea and stood silent for a moment or two then she smiled at him gravely perhaps you are rightand at least one could fancy that jordan and the others were warranted  jimmy whose face once more grew a trifle flushed raised a hand in protest i feel i have to thank you for sending burnell to me it must have seemed very ungrateful that i didnt close with him but after all that is only part of what i mean you see  the girl looked at him still with the curious little smile you fancied i should feel hurt because you could not take a favor of that kind from me well perhaps i did but as you have said you couldnt help itand i dont think it matters after all  her voice was quietly even and there was certainly no suggestion in it that she resented what he had done but jimmy knew that he was now expected to put on his reserve again and he hastened to explain in conventional fashion that the way she might regard the matter was really a question of interest to him then anthea looked at him and they both laughed as they turned away which as it happened very nearly led to jimmys flinging prudence aside again and he felt relieved when he saw austerly and his daughter approaching them before the latter two joined them anthea however once more turned to her companion  there is still something i wish to say and perhaps i should have mentioned it earlier but in such cases one shrinks from causing pain she said i should like you to believe that i was very sorry when i heardabout your father  jimmy only made her a grave inclination for though he could not blame her for it his fathers death was the most formidable of the barriers between them and recognizing it he felt a little thrill of dismay as she turned off across the lawn toward where mrs burnell was apparently awaiting her it afterward cost him an effort to talk intelligently to austerly and his daughter but since they betrayed no astonishment at his observations he fancied that he had somehow accomplished it     chapter xvii  the ranchers answer   it was a saturday evening and barbison the fruittree drummer felt that he had chosen a fitting time to introduce the business which had brought him there as he sat amidst a cluster of bushranchers on the veranda of the little wooden hotel it stood beside a crystal river in a lonely settlement with the dark coniferous forest rolling close up to it there were however wide gaps in the firs in front of the veranda with tall split fences raised to keep the deer out straggling athwart them amidst the palegreen of the oats while here and there one could see an axebuilt loghouse embowered in young orchard trees a trail led past the hotel rutted by the wooden runners of jumpersleds and ploughed up by the feet of toiling oxen and packhorses it led back in one direction through shadowy forest to the dunsmore railroad thirty miles away and in the other to the deep inlet where the shasta lay the ranchers however usually reached the latter by canoe because the trail was as bad as most of the others are in that country  on the evening in question there was a little stir in the sleepy place for the mounted mailcarrier who accomplished the journey weekly had come in and hardhanded jeanclad men had plodded down from lonely clearings among the enfolding hills to inquire for letters purchase stores and ask each other whether the government meant to make a wagonroad or do anything at all for them the question was however not quite so important as usual just then for private enterprise had as not infrequently happens undertaken the governments responsibilities and the ranchers were conscious of a certain gratitude to the shasta shipping company thirty miles over mountains is rather a long way to convey ones produce and supplies  a select company of deeply bronzed and wiry men who had tried to do it with packhorses as well as oxen and jumpersledges sat listening to barbison apparently with grave attention while another entertainment was being prepared for them two of their comrades stripped to their blue shirts and old jean trousers were then engaged in grubbing a very big firstump in front of the verandathat is clearing out the soil from beneath it and cutting through the smaller roots with an instrument which much resembled a ship carpenters adze it is in general use on the pacific slope where the process of making a bushranch seldom varies greatly the rancher purchases the raw material thin red soil covered with tremendous forest as cheaply as he can and at the cost of several years strenuous toil hews down a few acres of the latter then he proceeds to burn up the logs and there are left rows of unsightly stumps rising four to six feet above the ground which he laboriously ploughs around when he has garnered a crop or two he usually attacks these in turnthat is if they show no sign of rotting and to grub out a big one and haul it clear with oxen frequently costs him at least a day  barbison who watched the proceedings with the rest was aware of this but he did not know that the man who sat smoking on a big mechanical appliance of the screwjack order was the shastas engineer it was also somewhat curious since he had contrived to mention her several times that his companions had not thought it worth while to acquaint him with the fact but left him to suppose the gentleman in question was traveling the country on behalf of the manufacturers of the american stumpgrubber in the meanwhile barbison discoursed glibly about fruittrees and produce prices and pointed now and then to a big tin case partly filled with desiccated fruits and pictures which lay on a chair beside him he was a little dapper man evidently from the cities and by no mean disingenuous though he was apparently young he turned when a big quiet rancher picked up and gravely munched a fine californian plum  oh let upthats the third he said how can i sell trees on my samples when the boys have eaten them  the man looked at him stolidly its highgrade fruit he said howd you start those plumtrees bearingtheyre quite a long while showing a flower or two cut them hard when the frost lets up in spring  quite hard said barbison for one must make a venture now and then and none of his companions showed any astonishment though fruit is freely raised in that country and the trees that grow the kind with stones in it resent the use of the pruning knife as everybody who has much to do with them knows  juss so said the rancher boys you cut themhard now those apples spose you had good parent stocks could you bud on to themand howd you do it guess that would suit some sorts better than whipgrafting  one might have fancied that barbison was for a moment a trifle disconcerted but he smiled airily just how youd bud on anything else id wax the thread  you hear him boys said the rancher what you want to do is to wax your thread  they were very quiet but perhaps not unusually so for the clearers of those forests are except on occasion generally silent men barbison looked at them reflectively  raising the fruits only half the trouble anyway he said the big question everywhere is how to put it on the market and if i can be of any use in that direction you have only to command me seems to me the governments tired of making roads  whats the matter with the steamboat asked somebody never had no trouble since we hauled our stuff down to the shasta  barbisons smile was sympathetic now i guess youre not going to haul your stuff down to her very much longer shes played out and run by little struggling men who cant get credit for the patching up that ought to be done on her and wholl have nothing to meet claims with if she breaks down and spoils your freight some day thats a sure thing from what i heard in vancouver the bottoms just ready to drop out of the concern you want to think of that creditors have a lien on freight too when a boats held up for debt  then if i sent down my potatoes or fat steers in her somebody could seize them for the money the company owed asked another rancher  thats the law said barbison and there was nothing in his companions manner to suggest that they did not in the least believe him now theres some talk about another firm putting a smart new boat on plenty money behind that crowd and when she comes round it might suit you considerably better to make a deal with them  whos running the thing  man called merril enterprising man when he takes hold he makes things hum if it were necessary to start a trade hed most carry your stuff for nothing  juss so said the big rancher kind of philanthropist ive heard of him  the mans face was vacantly expressionless but barbison who glanced at him sharply fancied that he had said enough on the subject he had visited most of the settlements that could be reached from the coast and had never neglected an opportunity for dropping a word about the shasta and the new boat  wheres that stumpgrubber fellow from he asked  dont quite know said one of the others strikes me as an ontario scotchman but the machines an american notion never saw one quite like it before  the man in question stood up just then he was big and gaunt and pale but he wore ordinary city clothes and when he and the others had inserted the screwjack contrivance on a strip of thick planking under the sawnoff tree he turned to the assembly  there are quite a few stumppullers and ive struck benighted men who used the chaintackle tripod he said im not saying its inefficient for when you put sufficient pressure upon the winch and it will not pull the stump up it will pull the tripod down upon your head this one pulls up all the time and something has got to come if you work hard enough then he raised his hand to his two companions you look fit and strong show them you can heave  they drew the sliding bar up to the head of the thing and pulled it toward them several times while their faces grew suffused and the veins rose gorged on their foreheads for men in that country are proud of their vigor there was a slow cracking and tearing of roots but the great stump still stood immovable then the shastas engineer inquired what they fed upon and their comrades flung them sardonic encouragement while as they gasped and strained their muscles the screw slid slowly turn by turn through its socket at last there was a sharp rending and a little murmur of applause as the big stump tilted and fell over on its side then the big rancher stood up on the veranda  its smart work but dave and charley are two of the smartest men round this settlement and we want to test the thing in every way he said theres another stump yonder and i guess mr fleming will put up a bottle of whisky for any three men who will knock five minutes off the record well put mr barbison and jasper in to show what men who dont grub stumps can do  there was a little laughter for if jasper who slowly took off his jacket was not accustomed to stumpgrubbing he was at least a man of splendid physique and barbison felt uneasy when he laid a great hand on his shoulder  come right along he said weve got to get that whisky  barbisons protests were not listened to and seeing no help for it he also flung off his jacket when the big rancher firmly led him down the stairway then they gave him a shovel and his two companions saw that he used it while they plied the grubhoe there are however probably very few men reared in the city who could work with the tireless axemen of the pacific slope and in ten minutes barbison was visibly distressed the perspiration dripped from his flushed face and he gasped for breath while his comrades inquired with ironical solicitude whether he were getting sleepy when he had excavated enough to satisfy them they made him crawl into the hole and claw out soil from among the roots with shortened shovel most of the contents of which fell all over him they kept him at it mercilessly for over half an hour and when he crept out his hands were raw and he was aching in every limb even then there was no respite for the rest insisted on his participating in their labors at the lever and contrived to allow him to do considerably more than his share at last however the great stump rose and tilted and he was escorted back to the hotel amidst acclamation  well said the big rancher if you can work like that why in the name of thunder do you want to be a fruittree peddler its quite hard to believe you are one you dont look like it anyway  barbison certainly did not for he had burst a seam of one of his garments during his efforts while the red soil that had smeared them freely was on his dripping face and in his ruffled hair he flung a swift glance at the man as he realized that his observation was apposite there was however nothing suspicious in the ranchers attitude and the others laughed in the soft fashion peculiar to the bushman  anyway he deserves the whisky said one of them  it was duly brought and though those ranchers are for the most part abstemious men other bottles made their appearance in turn and barbison braced himself for an effort to maintain his credit as one of the boys he had not found this very difficult in the city saloons but the bushman who lives with spartan simplicity and toils amidst the lifegiving fragrance of the pines twelve hours every day usually possesses a nerve and constitution that will withstand almost anything besides there was only one barbison and a good many of them it was therefore not altogether astonishing that by and by the drummers observations grew a trifle incoherent until at last his companions grinned at one another when with a visible effort he raised himself shakily to his feet  something wrong with that whisky boys i cant quite talk the way i want guess ill go to sleep he said anyway you stand by merril hell carry your freight for nothing and run the shasta men to  after that he said nothing further but lowered himself carefully into his chair and collapsed with his arms flung out before him across the table then the rest proceeded to hold a courtmartial over him  seems to me he knows a blame sight more about mr merril and the shasta than he does about fruittrees said the big rancher boys you cut those plumshardand always put wax on the string oh yes youre innocent bushmen being played for suckers by a smart city man guess one would wonder when they took the long clothes off him if that last advice he gave you wasnt quite enough i see a book in his pocket with a silverheaded pencil strapped to it  one of them promptly took it out and flicking over the pages read six fathoms right up to the old sawmill wharf worth while to tow the schooner in and leave her to load nothing to be had at trevor siwash deck passengers at tylers sprotson men have odds and ends but seem stuck on the shasta  he closed the book with a sharp snap and grinned at the rest well he said reflectively thats bout enough for me im stuck on the shasta too seems to me the men who run her mean to do the straight thing by us  the rest concurred with this and several of them instanced cases where carriers had in due time put the screw upon producers who had been supinely content to pocket a big rebate until there was no longer any competition the rancher with the notebook smiled at them  then weve no use round here for a man like mr barbison he said the one question iswhat were going to do with him before we start him back to the blame philanthropist who sent him  they made ingenious suggestions which varied from painting him with redlead to teaching him to swim but it was the one offered by fleming of the shasta that most pleased them  what he wants is exercise and if you will bring him off to the steamer ill see he gets it he said ive quite a few tons of coal to trim and theres a pile of old grease he could clean out of her bilges  the blame insect will offer to pay his passage when he comes round said one of the company  that is easily fixed said another who had been rummaging barbisons pockets see this wallet jake well youre going in to the railroad and youll express it to mr merril care of the fruit agency with a line to say the gentleman was sick and left it behind him that strike you all as workable then all we have to do is to decorate him  they did it as well as they were able and four of them afterward carried him to a siwash canoe they had some difficulty in doing it and fell down once or twice on the way but just before the shasta went to sea barbison was put aboard her with his face rouged with redlead and a garland of cedar sprays about his head it was almost dark then wheelock was on his bridge the deckhands were busy stowing the anchor and as the two ranchers who brought the drummer laid him beneath a boat where he tranquilly resumed his sleep some little time had passed before anybody concerned himself about him then a grinning seaman brought jimmy down from his bridge and held up a lantern while he gazed in blank astonishment at his prostrate passenger  tell mr fleming i want him he was ashore he said  the engineer came and smiled when jimmy turned to him  if you can tell me what the meaning of this is i should be obliged he said  well said fleming reflectively there are maybe two or three for one thing im thinking its a hint that the boys ashore are standing by you theres a note they sent off in your room  jimmy told the seaman to bring it and while the latter turned the light upon the strip of paper read hasnt a dollar on him and belongs to a man called merril whos on your trail we recommend a course of shoveling coal all you have to do is to play a straight game with the boys and theyll stand behind you all the time  then he turned to fleming i fancy you could give me an explanation and id like to have it  fleming told him as much as it appeared desirable that he should know and jimmy smiled grimly  wake him up he said theres a bucket yonder  the seaman made a vigorous use of it and barbison raised himself on one elbow drenched and spluttering  throw any more water and ill kill somebody im dangerous when im mad he said  get up said jimmy sharply what are you doing here  barbison who endeavored unsuccessfully to get up did not seem to know and apparently abandoned the attempt to think it out his scattered senses however came back to him after the application of more cold water  how much you wanttake me to victoria he gasped  one hundred dollars said jimmy dryly  the passenger expostulated in a halfcoherent fashion and then apparently realizing that it was useless fumbled for his wallet he clenched his fist when he could not find it  stole itand my tin case he said ate up all my samplesmust have ate the case too thehungry hogs  then youll have to work your passage and jimmy turned to fleming youll take care he earns it dont quite kill the man  barbison who seemed to understand this at last got on his feet and unloosed a flood of invective which had no effect on any of his listeners several deckhands were however needed before he was conveyed into the stokehold and left in front of a bunker with a shovel in his hand he assured fleming that nothing would induce him to work and the engineer only grinned because it was a long way to victoria and the shasta had several calls to make barbison seemed to fancy that his firmness had proved sufficient and coiling himself up amidst the coal once more went to sleep he awakened hungry and fleming smiled again when he demanded food  if youll lift those floorplates youll see the spaces between her frames choked with coalgrit and grease he said its possible youll get some breakfast when youve scraped them clean then it will depend on how much coal you trim out of that bunker whether you get any dinner  barbison looked hard at the man and saw he meant what he said then he pulled up a floorplate and looked at the filthy mass of coagulated grease that had drained from the engineroom  and howm i to get it out he asked  quite easy said fleming dryly whats the matter with your hands  then he went away and left barbison to his task it was a particularly repulsive one but he accomplished it and spent most of the next few days trimming coal waiting on the fireman and cleaning out an empty coalbunker on his hands and knees it is probable that the sight of victoria filled him with ineffable relief and it certainly was not flemings fault if this were not the case as they steamed into the harbor jimmy sent for him  i think you have earned your passage and were straight he said you can go ashore when we get in  barbison glanced down at his dilapidated attire can i go ashore this way ill ask you a favor let me stay until its dark  jimmy laughed well he said as i scarcely think mr merril will send you back again you may     chapter xviii  eleanor speaks her mind   the afternoon was hot and drowsily still when merril drove his daughter down the dusty road which runs from new westminster through the fraser meadows the team was a fast one and the man who had an appointment to keep in vancouver did not spare them there were also reasons why he found rapid motion and the attention the mettlesome horses required a welcome distraction for just then he was troubled with a certain sense of irritation which was unusual with him  merril was not a hottempered man in fact he owed his commercial success largely to the dispassionate coolness which rarely permitted his feelings to influence his actions and it was characteristic of him that while he had a finger in a good many schemes the man himself never figured prominently in connection with any of them his influence was felt but he was in one sense rather an abstract force than a dominant personality it was said of him that he always worked underground and he certainly never made political speeches or favored the newspapers with his views while when the results of his unostentatious efforts became apparent in disaster to somebody as they usually did it generally happened that other men incurred the odium there are of course financiers whose enterprises benefit the whole community since they create new cornfields and open mines and mills but merrils genius was rather of the destructive order and it was not to anybodys advantage that he knew how to choose his time and instruments well in person he was little somewhat portly and very neatly dressed a man who had never been known to lose his temper or force himself upon the citizens attention  still he was human after all and as he sat behind his costly team that afternoon he was thinking somewhat uneasily of the unexpected resistance certain landjobbers in new westminster had shown to his demands and the attack on him which had just appeared in a popular journal it was the second time the thing had happened and though he was not directly mentioned and the statements could scarcely be considered libelous it was evident that a continuance of them would have the effect of turning the attention of those who read them upon his doings which was just then about the last thing that he desired  it accordingly happened that he drove a little faster than he generally did until as the team swung out of a strip of shadowy bush he saw a jumpersled loaded high with splitrails on the road close in front of him he shouted to the man who walked beside the plodding oxen never doubting that way would be made for him especially as the teamster looked around the oxen however went straight on down the middle of the road and it was a trifle too late when merril laid both hands upon the reins in another moment there was a crash and anthea was almost shaken from her seat when merril swung himself down he saw that one wheel had driven hard against the jumper load then as he called to anthea to move the team a pace or two the patent bushing squeaked and groaned and the wheel after making part of a revolution skidded on the road the man who drove the oxen turned and favored him with a little sardonic grin  i hope the young ladys not shook too much he said  anthea who fancied it was with a purpose he confined this expression of regret if indeed it could be considered such to herself was as a matter of fact considerably shaken and very angry  why didnt you get out of the way when you heard my father shout she asked  it was merril at whom the man looked well he said reflectively i guess that load is heavy and the oxen have been hauling hard since sunup while theres no reason why a rancher shouldnt use the road as well as anybody from the city you should have pulled up sooner anyway youre not going far like that  merril said nothing though he could not very well have failed to notice the hint of satisfaction in the last remark he very seldom put himself in the wrong by any illconsidered utterance but anthea was a trifle puzzled when he quietly walked to the horses heads she knew that the small ranchers are for the most part goodhumored and kindly men while although she could not be certain that the one before them had contrived the mishap it was evident that he had done very little to avert it he made no further observation and when he led his oxen into a neighboring meadow merril told the girl to drive the horses slowly toward a ranch they could see ahead and walked beside the wagon watching the wheel it would turn once or twice and then stick fast and skid again but they contrived to reach the ranch and found a bronzed man in dusty jean leaning on the sliprails  have you a wagonjack and a spanner asked merril  i have said the man who made no sign of going for them  then i should be obliged if you would lend me them said merril  the man smiled dryly it cant be done if that wheel wont turn miss merril can come in and sit with my wife while you go somewhere and get it fixed thats the most i can do for you  i suppose the man who wouldnt let us pass back yonder is a friend of yours and merril looked hard at him  thats so runs this ranch with me guess youve seen me once before though it was your clerk i made the deal with thats why were here on rented land making bout enough to buy groceries and tobacco you know how much the ranch you bounced us out of was worth to you anyway you cant have that jack and spanner  anthea flushed with anger but she saw that her father was very quiet  well he said dryly they belong to you but im not sure it wouldnt have been as wise to let me have them  the rancher laughed you dont hold our mortgage now and if i could get hold of that newspaperman i could give him a pointer or two seems to me hes getting right down on to the trail of you are you coming in out of the sun miss merril  certainly not said anthea and the man took out his pipe and quietly filled it when merril told her to walk the horses on again  though she was a trifle perplexed by what she had heard it seemed to her that her fathers attitude was the correct one and she seldom asked unnecessary questions she had lived away from home a good deal since the death of her mother when she was very young but her father had always been indulgent and she had cherished an unquestioning confidence in him it was also pleasant to know that he was a man of mark and influence and one looked up to by the community of late however several circumstances besides the newspaper attacks on him had seemed to cast a doubt upon the latter point but she would not entertain it for a moment or ask herself whether there was anything to warrant them it was reassuring to remember her fathers little smile when she had ventured to offer him her sympathy but she could not help admitting that there must at least have been some cause for the ranchers rancor the man she felt would not have displayed such vindictive bitterness without any reason at all she however decided that he had no doubt made some imprudent bargain with her father and was unwarrantedly blaming the latter for the unfortunate result of it  they went on in silence and merril who walked beside the wagon shook the wheel loose now and then when the horses stopped until they reached forsters homestead the rancher greeted anthea pleasantly but she felt that there was a subtle change in his manner when he turned to her father who explained their difficulty  the trouble is that i have rather an important appointment in vancouver this afternoon said the latter  my wife is there now with our only driving wagon or i would offer to take you over said forster i can however lend you a saddlehorse and miss merril could stay with miss wheelock until we see what can be done with the wagon if necessary i will drive her across when my wife comes back  merril thanked him and presently moved away toward the stable with the hired man while forster led anthea to the house and left her in the big general room where as it happened eleanor wheelock sat sewing the green lattices outside the open windows were partly drawn to but the shadowy room was very hot and the little air that entered brought the smell of the pines with it it was not the aromatic scent they have at evening but the almost overpowering smell filled with the clogging sweetness of honey the afternoon sun calls forth from them the ranch was also very still and for no evident reason anthea felt the drowsy quietness weigh upon her her companion said nothing to break it but sat near the window sewing quietly and anthea became sensible of a faint shrinking from the girl though she would have liked to overcome it for reasons she was not altogether willing to confess to herself  eleanor wheelocks face looked almost colorless by contrast with her somber dress and there was a curious hardness in it while anthea who remembered leesons speech in the shastas cabin wondered whether she were making the very dainty garment for herself since it was suggestive of wedding finery  that should be very effective she said at length you intend to wear it  eleanor looked up from her sewing yes she said i believe i shall  something in her voice struck anthea as out of place in the circumstances for one does not sew bitterness into wedding attire while the suggestion of uncertainty which the speech conveyed was more curious still anthea felt there must be something more than the loss of her father to account for her companions attitude but that was naturally a thing she could not mention  i think i could venture to offer you my sympathy in what you have had to bear she said i was very distressed to see the brief account in the newspaper  eleanor laid down her sewing and looked at her steadily why should you be  it was a disconcerting question and asked with a still more disconcerting insistency anthea could not very well say that she did not know nor yet admit that the news had grieved her because of her sympathy with jimmy still though she shrank from her she desired this girls goodwill and she compelled herself to an effort  in any case i was sincerely sorry she said although i only met you that evening on board the shasta one could say as much without presuming besides when we were away in the sorata your brother did a good deal to make the cruise pleasant for nellie austerly and me  when he was valentines deckhand and eleanor looked at her with a little sardonic smile you no doubt allowed him to forget it occasionally and jimmy was grateful in fact he admitted as much to me he was always foolishly impressionable  anthea felt her face grow warm and though she was as a rule courageous she was glad that she sat in the shadow in several respects her companions last suggestion appeared almost insufferable  perhaps i laid myself open to this she said it is seldom wise to make advances until one is reasonably sure of ones ground but i do not understand why you should resent a few words spoken out of friendliness  the little hard glint grew plainer in eleanors eyes then i think you should do so there is a very convincing reason why friendlinessof any kindwould be very unfitting between you and meor for that matter between you and jimmy  anthea would not ask the question that suggested itself for it seemed to her as crushing down her anger she sat and watched her companion that the latter had been waiting for this opportunity there was no mistaking the meaning of the thrill in her voice or the spot of color in her cheek while the reference to jimmy had its significance she felt that the girl wished to hurt her  you admitted that you read the newspapers said eleanor abruptly  ah said anthea i think i know what you mean by that naturally i cannot discuss those libels with you  libels and eleanor laughed if you can believe them that one would almost envy your credulity presumably your father has never mentioned our name to you  anthea was somewhat startled for though merril certainly had not done so she remembered the momentary expression of his face when forster had mentioned miss wheelock she also remembered jimmys attitude on the evening she met him at austerlys and the suggestion of distance in forsters manner to her father it seemed that there were others as well as the rancher who did not believe the statements made in the paper to be libelous  he has not she said very quietly still as i said these are subjects i cannot discuss with everybody  and yet you were anxious to know why friendliness was out of the question between you and me well i admit that i find a certain pleasure in telling you and it isnt quite unnatural you read how my fatherjimmys fatherdied but you do not know how he came to be living in that sordid shanty an infirm and nerveless man your father slowly ruined him wringing his few dollars out of him one by one by practices no honorable man would condescend to until there was nothing more he could lay his grasping hands upon when that happened my father was broken in health and courage and only wished to hide what he felt most foolishly was shameful poverty there wore other thingsthings i cannot tell you ofbut they make it clear that your father is directly responsible for my fathers death  she stopped abruptly and took up her sewing but her face looked very grim and vindictive in its dead pallor for the spot of color had faded now and presently she flung the dainty fabric down again and looked steadily at her companion neither of them spoke for almost a minute and once more anthea felt the stillness of the ranchhouse and the heavy honeylike smell of the pines curiously oppressive she believed in her father or had made up her mind to do so which was however perhaps not quite the same thing but she could not doubt that eleanor wheelock was firmly persuaded of the accuracy of the indictment that she had made the passionate vindictive thrill in her voice had been absolutely genuine and anthea recognized that it could not have been so without some reason then eleanor spoke again  you may wonder why i have told you thisthough i am not quite sure that you do she said well you at least understand why i resent your sympathy and if i had any other purpose it may perhaps appear to you when you think over what you have heard  anthea rose at last and turned toward her quietly but with a certain rigidity of pose which had its significance she stood very straight and looked at her companion with big grave eyes  you have at least said all i care to listen to she said  and i think sufficient said eleanor with a bitter smile  then and it was a relief to anthea forster came in and dropped into a chair  i fancy jake will fix that wheel but he may be an hour yet and its very hot he said i dont want to break off your talk but perhaps you could make us some tea miss wheelock i dont feel like waiting until supper  eleanor went out and anthea found it cost her an effort to talk tranquilly to forster she liked the man but her mind was busy and had there been any means available she would gladly have escaped from him it was evident that eleanor wheelock believed what she had told her the rancher who had kept his jumper in the way was as clearly persuaded that merril had injured him and it was conceivable that the newspaperman also believed his statements warranted if they were right her father must have treated several people with considerable harshness but she could not bring herself to admit thatat least just then she naturally did not know eleanor wheelock had foreseen that once her doubts were aroused enlightenment would presently follow then there was the latters veiled suggestion that she was attracted by jimmy wheelock and had condescended to cajole or encourage him had she been alone her cheeks would have tingled at the thought of it for in one respect the notion was intolerable still though it cost her an effort she contrived to discourse with forster until at last the hired man announced that the wheel was fixed and thanking the rancher for his offer to accompany her she drove on to vancouver alone     chapter xix  wood pulp   the fresh northwest breeze that crisped the inlet swept in through the open ports and set the cigar smoke eddying about the table when jimmy sat with jordan and another man in the shastas little stern cabin looking forward through the hookedback door he could see the lower yards and serried shrouds of a big iron ship that was lying halfloaded on the shastas starboard side beyond her there rode a little schooner with reefed mainsail and boom foresail thrashing while the musical clinkettyclank of her windlass betokened that she was just going to sea jimmys face grew a trifle hard as he heard it for she was the tyee  jordan sprawled on a settee not far away and a burly redfaced briton who commanded the iron ship sat opposite to jimmy cigar in hand the latter had the faculty some people possess of making friends and though they had after all seen very little of him the shipmasters manner was confidential  if the canners who are loading me had kept their promise id be driving south with the royals on her before this breeze instead of lying here he said my broker doesnt know when they mean to send the rest of the cases down either and it seems its only now and then a mail goes up that coast in fact ive almost made up my mind to run round to the columbia i believe the packers would load me there  port charges and tugs are expensive items said jordan thoughtfully vancouver freights are tolerably good and it might pay you to wait a week or so you see that schooner on your quarter shes going up to the cannery now  the skipper made a little impatient gesture how longs she going to be getting there with a headwind besides all she could bring down would be nothing to me i wouldnt have stayed so long only that confounded broker told me a man called merril was sending a steamer up  then since the schooner belongs to him i guess he has changed his mind how long would you wait for a steamboat load  a week said the skippernot a day more i believe i could fill up on the columbia and as theres not another vessel offering for the united kingdom here it would please me to feel that the canners would have to keep their salmon  jordan flashed a warning glance at jimmy well he said it seems to me that if you will wait the week you are going to get your freight i cant tell you exactly why but i wouldnt break out my anchor for another eight days if i were you  i can take a hint as well as another man and the skipper rose in the meanwhile ill go ashore and stir up that broker again youll have a headwind if youre going north mr wheelock expect you to come off and feed with me when youre back again good luck  jordan went with him to the gangway and then came back and smiled at jimmy  its just as well you made the new cannery people a halfpromise youd call this trip he said now i guess youve got to keep it things fit in merril as usual hasnt played a straight game with those packers took their transport contract and when that headed off anybody else from going there he sends the tyee up instead of the steamboat youll be at the cannery two days ahead of her anyway and theres no reason why you shouldnt get every case they have on hand  jimmy made a sign of comprehension and jordan lighted another cigar before he opened the paper he had brought with him now and then the little man gets a show though its usually when the big one isnt quite awake he said you sit still there and listen to this the provincial legislature at length appears to recognize that its responsibilities are not confined to fostering the progress of the bush districts and one contemplates with satisfaction a change in the policy which has hitherto incurred a heavy expenditure upon roads and bridges for the exclusive benefit of the ranchers now that retrenchment in this direction appears to be contemplated there should be money to spare for equally desirable purposes  he threw down the paper i guess thats going to cost merril a pile especially as the member for the district in which he is starting his woodpulp mill shows signs of going back on him from what the boys are saying merril has a pull on the man but it seems his party has a stronger one  i dont quite understand said jimmy  jordan laughed softly its interesting shows how things are run merril bought up a mortgage on a halfbuilt woodpulp mill which the men who began it couldnt finish and fixed things so that by and by it belonged to him and two or three of his friends well that mill was put where it is because theyve a head of water that will give them power for nothing and spruce fit for making highgrade pulp but its not on the railroad and not near the coast the question is how to get their product out there are big mills between them and the lake they could put a steamer on and theyll have to lay down a wagonroad underpinning a good deal of it on the mountainside and cutting odd halfmiles of it out thats going to cost them more than putting up their mill  then how did they expect to hold their own with the mills now running  jordan chuckled by getting the province to make their road for them merril has influential friends and one of them who went up not long ago discovered that there was a highclass ranching district behind the mill it only wanted roads to bring the settlers in  then his face grew grave and he sat silent a minute or two before he spoke again  jimmy he said with a very unusual diffidence theres a thing that is worrying me it doesnt strike me as quite fitting that eleanor should see so much of that blame ontario man in merrils office he has been over twice in the last fortnight to forsters ranch  do you expect me to tell her so  i do not guess shed make you feel mean for a month after if you did i want you to remember all the time that im sure of your sisterbut i dont like the man he had to get out of torontoand theyre talking about him already in the saloons seems to me shes playing a dangerous game in fooling him  fooling him  thats so he put some money into merrils business and its quite likely he knows a little of his hand eleanor has made up her mind to know it too  jimmy flushed the thing must be stopped  well said jordan ruefully thats how i feel but the trouble is i dont quite know how it can be done for one thing im going to run up against that toronto man though i dont expect eleanor to be nice to me after it  you cant think she has any liking for him  jordan turned on him with a snap in his eyes i dont if i did i should not have mentioned it to you guess id stake my life any time on eleanors doing the straight thing by me its what thosehotel slouches will say about her i dont like to think of and you have to remember shed go through fire to bring down the man who ruined your father in one way thats naturalbut the thing has been worrying me  just then there was a splash of approaching oars and jordan rose thats the mate with your papers and i guess ill go he said get every case of that salmonand remember what ive told you if you hear of any trouble between eleanor and me it wont be due to jealousy but because ive spoiled her hand  he left jimmy who remembered what he had seen in eleanors face the night she had talked to him of merril thoughtful when he rowed away it appeared very probable that she would make things distinctly unpleasant for her suitor if he rashly ventured to interfere with any project she might have in view jimmy in fact felt tempted to sympathize with jordan  in a few minutes however he proceeded to take the shasta out and drove her hard all that night into a short headsea she had left the comparative shelter of vancouver island behind and was rolling out with whirling propeller flung clear every now and then head on to the big whitetopped combers when as he stood dripping on his bridge a schooner running hard materialized out of the rain and spray jimmy pulled the whistle lanyard and the man behind him hauled his wheel over a spoke or two but the schooner came on heading almost for him and rolling until her mastheads swung over the froth to weather her mainboom was down on her quarter and she had only her foresail set and a little streaming jib  she drove the latter into the back of a big grayandwhite sea as she went by and when she hove it high once more while the water sluiced along her deck jimmy who could look down at her from his bridge recognized her as a vessel that had once belonged to his father she drove past with a drenched object clinging desperately to her wheel and jimmy smiled as she vanished into the rain again for it seemed to him that as his comrade had said fortune favored the little man now and then merril had evidently sent two schooners up to the cannery but the tyee was some sixty miles astern of the shasta and it was clear that the skipper of the other vessel could no longer thrash her to windward in that weather there was he believed a good deal of salmon at the cannery and all he had to do was to take the shasta there  it was however not particularly easy the breeze freshened steadily until she put her forecastle under and hove her stern out at every plunge while her propeller shook her in every plate as it whirred in empty air a man could scarcely venture forward along her brineswept deck and at times when jimmy had to cling to the bridgerails for his life she rolled until all her rail was in the sea he was battered and blinded by flying spray and when the black night came he could not see an armslength in front of him but the telegraph still stood at fullspeed and the shasta resolutely butted the big foaming seas at last she ran in among the islands where there was smoother water and jimmy was rowed ashore redeyed halfasleep and aching in every limb when he had brought her up off a certain icy greenstained river as it happened the man in charge of the cannery on its bank was unusually pleased to see him though he did not say so he gave jimmy a cigar in his office and when they sat down looked at him thoughtfully  its rather a long way up here and it will cost you a little in coal if you mean to make your usual trip he said i dont think i made you any definite promise  jimmy smiled still i said i would call  then i wish some of the other people with whom we trade were as punctilious i suppose you expect something now youre here  i do said jimmy in fact i almost fancy its going to suit you to fill me up  i think i mentioned we had a standing arrangement with mr merril  you did said jimmy cheerfully hes sending you up two schooners it will be a week before they are here i passed one of them yesterday running back for shelter and the othersanywaysixty miles astern of her  the wind may change and they wouldnt be long getting here with sheets slacked away  it wont change said jimmy look at your glass that rise means northerly weather  the canner appeared to consider well he said i gave you a few cases once or twice and though we have an arrangement with merril i can fill you up one hatch now at the rate you fixed  i cant trade on those terms the rate in question was a special cut we made it to get in ahead of merril but when the time came you didnt give us an opportunity for tendering for your carrying in fact i hear hes getting more than i did that however does not directly concern me and you no doubt understand your own business but i should like to mention that the agapomenes skipper will not wait a day longer than next thursday  the canner looked hard at him you will excuse my asking if that is a sure thing  you mean am i talking quite straight and a suggestive dryness crept into jimmys tone i can only say that the man who did not know i was coming here assured me of it just before i went to sea it would of course be easy for you to wait and find out whether you could believe me only the fact that you had done so would naturally place you in a difficulty since the agapomene would have gone to sea and there isnt another vessel offering  well said the canner  jimmy smiled at him i want two thingsevery case you have ready and a rate equal to what youre giving merril it is not very much after all as you know since merrils schooners cant get here until there is a change of wind i could strike you for double  the canner sat silent a moment or two and then laughed goodhumoredly to be quite straight the last was what i expected now im not the only man in this concern and the people who have the most say are as usual in victoria i know why they made the deal with merril and while as you say that does not concern you it didnt quite please me anyway he hasnt kept his arrangement and has put the screw on us in several ways so if youll warp your boat in well heave the cases into her theres just another thing come back when you lighten her and if this run of fish lasts ill do what i can to make it worth your while  jimmy thanked him and went out to bring the shasta alongside the little wharf after which he went to sleep though almost every other man on board was kept busy stowing salmoncases all that night  it happened that during the earlier hours of it several irate gentlemen who had the control of a good deal of money sat in conclave in merrils house which stood just outside the city limits of vancouver it was a tastefully furnished room in which they sat and nobody could have found fault with the wine and cigars on the table but as it happened both these facts irritated one of the gentlemen  i feel tempted to talk quite straight and i expect youll understand me merril when i say that you dont seem to have had your usual luck over this woodpulp deal he said in a general way its the other people who take a hand in your ventures who feel the pinch when things dont quite work out right but in this case you have got to bear it with the rest of us  merril who lay in a big lounge chair little portly and immaculately dressed looked up at him quietly if its any consolation to you im holding as much stock as the rest of you put together the thing hits me rather hard but as you say we can only stand up under itthat is if the appropriation grants are thrown out by the house  they will be said another man anyway the roadmaking in which we are interested comes under a clause that will be struck off in committee its a sure thing i cant quite blame the legislature either after the admissions made by the district member he has gone back on you merril you told us you were sure of him  merril smiled curiously well he said its a little difficult to be sure of anything and as the man will be here very shortly you can talk to him yourself that however will not straighten anything out the question is what is to be done about the wagonroad  build it ourselves said another man its either that or let the mill go and considering the money ive put in im for holding on still it will practically mean doubling our capital  merril nodded quietly and nobody could have told that to raise the sum required would be singularly inconvenient to him at least he said you cant get it from outsiders either all the money in this province is in mines and mills and bank interests ruinous  well said one of the others i guess you dont expect us to feel obliged to you there isnt any probability of those roadmaking appropriations getting passed  youll know when shafleton comes said merril dryly somebody was to wire him as soon as the result was known in the house he came across from victoria this afternoon and should be on his way from westminster now  they discussed the wagonroad growing more and more impatient all the time while an hour dragged by and then two of them rose to their feet as a man who appeared somewhat ill at ease was shown in the rest including merril sat still and looked at him he waved one hand as though disclaiming all responsibility and laid a telegram on the table  thats all i can tell you gentlemen im sorry but it cant be helped he said  one of them took up the message and when he passed it to his comrades the storm broke  you practically asked them to vote no more money in your last speech said merril  played us forsuckers said another man while a third struck the table with his clenched fist  leslies right the straight fact is that were fooled he said  it was significant that nobody had asked the member of the provincial legislature to sit down and he leaned on the arm of a big lounge as though he required support and blinked at them  well he said when i first saw you about it i was willing to do what i could but on going further into the thing i found it couldnt be considered quite in line with the interests of the country  one of them laughed aloud sardonically and merrils face contorted into an unpleasant smile  its rather a pity you didnt make sure of that before you took what we offered you he said  the baited man turned to them appealingly you know what i promised i would support the bridgebuilding and roadmaking policy as long as i considered it in line with the interests of the country  the man who had struck the table shook his fist at him  the interests of the country you know what you meant and you got your price he said  that remark said merril is quite warranted mr shafleton made a perfectly understood bargainand he got his price it is also likely that he would never have been elected if we had not set certain influences to work owing to the governments finding a change of policy convenient he has not kept his bargain the question however is how  one of the men who was standing up looked around just then  i guess it might be as well to have that door shut he said  if you wish said merril still there is nobody in this part of the house  well said the other man who crossed the room i fancied i heard somebody a moment or two ago  he closed the door and when he sat down merril commenced again and the member of the provincial legislature had to listen to a good many things that did not please him the rest also spoke bitterly in lower tones now but it was in one respect unfortunate they had not displayed that caution earlier for the man who had fancied he heard a footstep was as it happened not mistaken     chapter xx  anthea makes a discovery   while merril discussed the prospects of the pulpmill with his companions anthea sat by the open window of an upper room there was an open book on her knee but it lay face downward and she leaned back in a cane chair looking out upon the inlet across the clustering roofs of the city the still water lay shining under the evening light with a broad smear of smoke trailing athwart it from the steamer which had just vanished behind the dark pines that overhang the narrows it drifted across the tall spars of the agapomene and through it a big passenger boats tier of deckhouses showed dimly white further up the inlet another dingy cloud drifted out from behind the piles of stacked lumber about the hastings mill while the clatter of an empress liners winches came up through the clear evening air with the tolling of locomotive bells and the grind of freightcar wheels  all this had a certain interest as well as a significance for anthea merril in england the business man as a rule endeavors to leave his commercial affairs behind him when he turns his back on the city but it is different in the west where he has no privacy and his calling is his life mills and mines freight rates and timber rights are seldom debarred as topics at social functions and anthea had acquired a considerable knowledge of these things though she had not lived very long in that city it was of course also evident to her that her father was regarded as a man of influence and one who had a share in directing the activities of the province and this afforded her a certain pleasure several expressions overheard and facts that had lately been forced on her attention might perhaps have rudely dissipated that satisfaction had she not resolutely endeavored to attach a more favorable meaning to them than a good many people would have considered justifiable she had spent most of her life with her mothers relatives in the east and it was not altogether astonishing that there was a good deal in her fathers character with which she was unacquainted merril had a desire to stand well with his daughter and he had sufficient ability to accomplish what he wished in most cases  by and by as she glanced at the shining inlet the fading smoketrail led antheas thoughts away to the man who was then doubtless standing on the shastas bridge and her eyes softened curiously she could now admit that she knew what he felt for her because although he had never told her there had been occasions when his face had perhaps against his will made it very plain what the result of it would be she did not know but she could wait and be sure of his steadfastness in the meanwhile for circumstances which were unpropitious now might change as indeed they were rather apt to do with almost disconcerting suddenness in that country then she tried to reconstruct the interview she had had with his sister an occupation in which she had indulged somewhat frequently of late although it troubled her and that by a natural transition once more led her thoughts back to her father  it was impossible to doubt that eleanor wheelock believed she had grounds for bitterness against him and a curious something in her brothers manner had once or twice suggested that he shared it too but anthea endeavored to assure herself that they had merely adopted their fathers views without sufficient investigation she was aware that men who failed were frequently apt to blame somebody else for it instead of their own supineness while it was clear that both parties could not always expect a bargain to be advantageous for all that the girls assertions had been startling and once more anthea wished that she had not heard them they vaguely troubled her since she would not have her fathers probity left open to doubt  then rising somewhat abruptly she flung the book aside and went down the wide cedar stairway to search for another that might perhaps hold her attention more firmly when she reached the foot of it she turned into a corridor and stopped a moment when she heard a murmur of angry voices she was aware that a member of the provincial legislature had reached the house not long ago and that the rest of her fathers guests had come there to discuss something with him while as the door of the room reserved for them had been left open a foot or so she could see within from where she stood  the house stood high and the sunlight still streamed into the room while there was something in the pose of the men that seized and held her attention she had heard nothing clearly yet but the strungup attitudes and intent faces had their dramatic suggestiveness and she lingered she could see her father sitting at the head of the table with one hand closed hard on the edge of it and a grim smile that was quite new to her in his eyes the member supporting himself by the big lounge and apparently shrinking from his gaze and one of the others leaning forward in his seat with his fist clenched in fact the scene burned itself into her memory and she never forgot the look in her fathers face  then the voices suddenly became intelligible and she heard merril say its rather a pity you didnt make sure of that before you took what we offered you  she caught the legislators answer and saw the man who leaned forward shake his fist at him while the latters exclamation sent a little thrill of dismay through her  you know what you meant and you got your price he said  this was sufficiently plain in connection with what had gone before it and she waited in tense suspense to see whether her father would discountenance it though she felt that he would not do so she saw him make a little sign of concurrence and once more was sensible of an enervating dismay when he flung his answer at the shrinking member of the legislature  a perfectly understood bargain and he got his price he said he would never have been elected if we had not set certain influences to work  then she roused herself with an effort and thinking no more of the book she had come for turned softly and flitted back up the stairway to the room she had left she made sure the door was fast with a vague instinctive feeling that she must be quite alone then sat down by the window again a trifle colorless in face with both hands clenched she was a woman of keen intelligence and realized that there was no room for doubt her father the man she had endeavored to look up to had openly condemned himself  it was perhaps strange considering that she was his daughter that she had wholesome thoughts as well as mental ability and that honesty formed a prominent part of her morality the fact made the blow more cruel for it was clear that her father and his associates had been engaged in an infamous conspiracy they had bought a member of the legislaturebribed him to betray the confidence the people had placed in him and though she did not know whether the bribe had been actual money that as she recognized scarcely affected the question he had at least promised to do something that was against the interests of the country for which as one had declared they cared nothing and would evidently have kept his promise if circumstances had not been too strong for him anthea had sense enough to attach as little credence to his assertions as the others had done  she supposed that things of the kind were sometimes done but only by men without morality and it was almost intolerable to realize that her father had been the instigator of one of them the fact seemed to bear out all the newspaper had charged him with and made it more than probable that eleanor wheelocks assertions too had been wellfounded it was with a little shiver that anthea realized that in such a case the father of the man who loved her had in all probability been ruined by a nefarious conspiracy his daughter had told her plainly that his death was the direct result of it and if that were so jimmy must hold her father accountable the thing was becoming altogether horrible  she did not know how long she sat there after she heard the guests take their leave but at last she realized that since she must meet him on the morrow there was little to be gained by keeping out of her fathers sight that night she was not deficient in courage but it was with an effort that she nerved herself to go down knowing that she could not meet him as though nothing unusual had come to her knowledge he was still sitting in the room where he had spoken with his guests with a litter of papers in front of him when she went in but on hearing the rustle of her dress he looked up the lamps were lighted now and he started slightly when he saw her face then he brushed aside the papers and sat still looking at her with a little grim smile anthea felt her heart beat for she saw that he understood  ah he said sprotson fancied he heard somebody it was you  anthea nodded standing very straight in the middle of the big room and wondering with a fierce desire that he should do so whether he would offer any explanation in which she could place a little credence almost a minute passed and the man never took his eyes off her she longed that he would speak for the tension was growing unendurable  you heardsomethingat least he said  yes replied anthea with a cold quietness at which she almost wondered enough i think to make me understand the rest  again merril said nothing for a while though he still kept his keen eyes fixed on her face and at last it was without any sign of anger and in a tone of grave inquiry he broke the silence  well he said  there was an appeal in antheas voice cant you say anything that will drive out what i think she asked i want to believe that i could not have heard or understood aright  merril raised one hand and for a moment she could have fancied that there was pain in his face i almost think you are too clever and perhaps i am too wise by and by you would not believe me i have known this moment would come since i brought you to vancouver andthough you may scarcely credit thisalmost dreaded it the thing has to be faced now  this time it was anthea who said nothing and merril went on again you might never have had to face it had you been a pretty fool but that could hardly have been expected you are my daughter still intelligence as other people have no doubt discovered is not always a blessing to a woman  again he made a little abrupt movement you see i offer no palliation the one question is simplydo you mean to turn your back on me  anthea looked at him steadily no she said i could never do that still must you continue what you are doing cant you give it up  sit down said merril quietly and rising drew her a chair i think we must understand each other now and altogether to commence with i should have liked you to continue to think well of me though considering what you are i knew the thing was hardly likely now you have made a discovery that hurts you  he stopped a moment and though there had been a certain elusive gentleness in his voice the girl was sensible that she shrank from him he was she realized without compunction and had no regret for what he had done indeed his passionless quietness conveyed the impression that some of the usual attributes of humanity had been left out of him a trace of confusion or anger would have appeared more natural and invective would have been easier to bear than this suggestive tranquillity  well he said you asked a very natural question what i am doingmy view of life in factdispleases you you ask cant i give it up i ask why can you offer me any reason  anthea said nothing reasons occurred to her but they were rather felt than concretely formulated and as she realized would suffer from being forced into shallow and inadequate expression she also naturally shrank from an unsuccessful attempt to play the teacher to her father and had sense enough to know that trite maxims and virtuous platitudes would have very small effect on such a man it was perhaps not an unusual feeling in one respect for the deep optimistic faith of the wise cannot be rashly formulated without its suffering in the process it is as a rule the people with shallow beliefs who have the ready tongues and the result of their wellmeaning efforts is seldom the one they desire anthea at least recognized her disabilities and kept silence she also saw that her father understood her for he nodded  it is clear that you are not a fool he said if you had been the thing would have been easier for both of us i allowed you to be brought up in the conventional morality knowing that you would grow above what was spurious in it and cling to what you felt was real if you felt that it would be sufficient for you still that morality was never mine i had to face life as i found it without the money that might have made it easier to regard it virtuously and scruples would have insufferably handicapped me as a matter of fact i do not think i ever had any this existence is a struggle as no doubt you have heard often without realizing it and it is the strong and cunning who get out of it what is worth having that at least is my point of view it may be the wrong one but i am satisfied with it and what is more to the purpose quite content to leave you yours  he broke off once more and smiled before he went on we have done with that subject i would not influence you against your beliefwhich is the prettier oneif i could and i do not think you could influence me in fact one feels diffident about having said so much well it is the days to come we have to consider i am not likely to change my code and you do not wish to leave me  again for just a moment the faint tenderness crept into his voice and the girls nature stirred in answer  no she said there is nothing that could make me wish to do that  well said the man with a dry smile we will try to avoid offending each other and i should have been sorry had you gone away in fact it is a relief to know that you will be with me my affairs have not been going well lately  this was sufficiently matteroffact but in spite of the vague shrinking from him of which she was still sensible anthea was touched she could not however concretely realize what she felt and wisely made no attempt to express it instead she spoke of something else seizing on an immaterial point that casually occurred to her  i fancied you were a prosperous man she said  so do many people said merril dryly it was by leading them to believe it that ive done what i have done my operations are for the most part conducted with other peoples money still one has to face reverses now and then and when two or three of them come together the people who support one commence to doubt their wisdom then they are apt to back down and become virtuously scrupulous while the men with a grudge against one waken up and fancy their turn has come in my case there are evidently quite a few of them  he laughed softly but in a fashion that jarred on the girl still it is very probable that i shall keep ahead of them after all in any case i wont offend you by suggesting that the odd chance of your having to dispense with what i have been able to offer you so far would count for very much  thank you for that said anthea softly  merril turned to the papers before him well he said now we understand and as you see i am busy  anthea went out not reassured but more tranquil she realized what her duty was and purposed to do it but while there was still a tenderness for the man in her there was also something about him besides his avowed point of view and the actions it led to that repelled her he had it seemed an intellect that was unhampered by the usual passions and affections of humanity     chapter xxi  jimmy grows restless   the city was almost insufferably hot and jimmy who had time on his hands that afternoon found it pleasant to saunter through the dim green shadow among the stanley pines which crowd close up to its western boundary they rose about him old and great of girth a tremendous colonnade of towering trunks two hundred feet above the narrow riband of driving road which was further walled in by tall green fern there was drowsy silence in those dim recesses and a solemnity which the occasional faint hoot of a whistle or tolling of a locomotive bell did not seem to dissipate for the civic authorities had up to that time at least with somewhat unusual wisdom made no attempt to improve on what nature had done for them here they cut a little footpath there a wavy driving road but except for that they left the stanley park a beautiful strip of primeval wilderness  jimmy had arrived in vancouver a few hours earlier with the shasta loaded deep but although affairs had been going tolerably well with the company this fact afforded him no very great satisfaction he liked the sea and had succeeded in making firm friends of most of the ranchers and salmonpackers whose produce he carried but there was ambition in him and of late he had been growing vaguely restless after all the command of a boat like the shasta with some two hundred and fifty odd tons of carrying capacity could not be expected to prove a very lucrative occupation and jimmy now and then remembered regretfully that he might have had a commission in the navy he had also an incentive for desiring advancement upon which however he seldom permitted himself to dwell since on two occasions he and anthea merril had read in each others eyes a fact that had a vital significance to both of them jimmy scarcely dared remember it but he felt that the girl would listen when he thought it fit to speak  that however was in the meanwhile out of the question he must by some means first make his mark and as happens not infrequently in similar circumstances to other men he did not know how it was to be done one thing at least was clear he could not expect to advance himself very much by commanding the shasta there was also in any case merrils opposition to count on while the bitterness eleanor had endued him with against the man she held responsible for the death of his father had its effect and it was in an unusually somber mood that jimmy strolled through the shadow of the pines that hot afternoon  by and by he heard a soft thud of hoofs and looking up felt the blood creep into his face he recognized the costly team that swung out of the shadow and the girl in the white dress who held the reins in the vehicle behind them he also recognized the lady beside her for her husband was an englishman who held high office under the crown in victoria the fact that she was sitting by anthea merrils side suggested how far circumstances held the latter apart from the shastas skipper silvermounted harness and splendid horses had the same effect and since these things also reminded him of something else jimmy unfortunately lost his head a sudden vindictive anger came upon him as he remembered that the money that provided them and stood as a barrier between him and the girl had been wrung from struggling men and that some of it at least was the result of his fathers ruin  it was of course not reasonable to blame anthea for this but jimmy was scarcely in a mood just then to make any very nice distinction and straightening himself a trifle he stood still a moment looking at the girl he saw the little friendly smile fade out of her face and a look of perplexity take its place and then while his heart thumped furiously he turned and stepped aside into a little trail that led into the shadow of the bush in another moment the team swept past and he was left uncomfortably conscious that he had made a fool of himself the feeling while far from pleasant is no doubt wholesome which is fortunate since there are probably very few men who are not now and then sensible of it  it was half an hour later when anthea came up with him again the road was narrow and crossed a little bridge near where he was standing as it happened another lady was then driving a pair of ponies over it anthea pulled up her team close behind jimmy and when the impatient horses moved and drew the vehicle partly across the road he turned and seized the head of the nearest he did not know much about horses but he contrived to back the team sufficiently to leave a passage and was unpleasantly sensible that anthea was watching him with a little smile it brought a tinge of darker color to her face and hurt him considerably more than if she had shown resentment of his previous attitude by any suggestion of distance there is after all a certain vague consolation in feeling that one is able to offend a person whose goodwill is valuable anthea perhaps realized this for when the other team had gone by she made a sign to him jimmy who felt far from comfortable approached the vehicle and the girl looked down at him with the twinkle still in her eyes  thank you that is permissible she said  jimmy flushed again in any case im not sure its exactly what i deserve  well said anthea reflectively i really was wondering whether you saw us a little while ago  i did said jimmy meeting her inquiring gaze still perhaps there were excuses for me  there was a scarcely perceptible change in antheas expression but jimmy noticed it though he did not know that she was thinking of what his sister had told her next moment she smiled at him again  i scarcely think it would be worth while to make them she said  then she shook the reins and left him standing in the road when they were out of earshot her companion turned to her  who is that young man she asked  captain wheelock of the shasta  ah said the other i remember hearing about him the man who took off the schooners skipper but what did he mean by saying that there were excuses for his not seeing you  i dont know said anthea who contrived to smile though she was rather more thoughtful than usual i dont mind admitting that the question has a certain interest still one cannot always demand an explanation  her companion flashed a keen glance at her well she said i almost fancy it would have been a sufficient one if you had heard it in fact i think i should like that man after all honesty is a quality that wears well but what is a man of his description doing in that very little and somewhat dirty shasta i made somebody point her out to me one day in victoria  i dont know said anthea that is i know why he went on board her in the first case but not why he seems content to stay there altogether still it naturally isnt a matter of any particular consequence  then they spoke of other things while jimmy who suddenly remembered that he was standing vacantly in the road turned toward the city wondering as anthea had done why he had remained so long the shastas skipper now that the trade jordan and his associates had inaugurated had been well established in spite of merrils opposition he felt that they had no longer any particular need of him  the city was unusually hot when he reached it but he fancied that alone did not account for the crowded state of the saloons he passed it also seemed to him that the groups of men who stood here and there on the sidewalks talking animatedly must have found some unusually interesting topic but he had his own affairs to think of and as they appeared sufficient for him just then he walked on quietly until he reached jordans office it was not elaborately furnished in fact there was very little in it besides a table a safe a chair or two and an american stumppuller standing against one wall jordan sat reading a newspaper with a cigar which had gone out in his hand but he looked up and threw the paper on the table when jimmy came in  read that theyve struck it rich at last he said guess there are men who have believed in that gold ever since we bought alaska from the russians ran across one of them most eight years ago commercial company man and he told me it was a sure thing there was gold up the yukon odd prospectors had struck a pocket here and there but though they brought a few ounces out nobody seemed inclined to take up the thing practically every white man in that country was connected with the indian trade in furs and im not sure they were anxious to see an army of diggers marching in anyway the few men who believed in the gold couldnt put up the money to prove their confidence warranted now as you see theyve found it and before long the whole slope will be humming from wrangel to lower california  jimmy read a column of the paper with almost breathless interest as many another man had done that day in every seaboard city and lonely wooden settlement to which the news had spread then he looked at jordan  the thing appears almost incredible he said  it isnt said his companion i know what the alaska commercial oldtimer told me quite a while ago its going leagues ahead of caribou theyll be going up in their thousands in a month or two now you sit still a minute and listen to me this is a thing i believe in and ill tell you what i know  he spoke for ten minutes with dark eyes snapping and jimmys blood tingled as he listened jordans faith the alldaring optimism of the pacific slope of which many men have died in the wilderness was infectious and something in jimmys nature responded he had fought with bitter gales and frothing seas and it seemed to him that the struggle with ice and frost rock and snow could not be harder he was also though he had not quite realized it until that moment one of those who are born to play their part in the forefront of the battle between man and natureand nature is not beneficent but very grim and terrible until she is subdued as everybody who has seen that strife knows  then jimmy stood up and slowly straightened himself with a quiet smile  youll have to get a new skipper for the shastaim going north he said  jordan gazed at him a moment in amazement and then laughed in a fashion which suggested that comprehension had dawned on him  sit down again he said i begin to understand how it is with you still you cant afford to do the thing you want to it quite often happens that way  i fancy that what i cant afford is to remain on board the shasta said jimmy dryly  sit down said jordan well talk out this thing now why do you want to go up there  jimmy did as he was bidden though there was a significant gleam in his eyes well he said perhaps its your due that i should tell you for one thing because i feel that i must im not sure youll understand me but i feel its what i was made for there are halffrozen swamps to be crossed leagues of forest cañons melting snow to be floundered through that kind of thing gets hold of some of us i feel i have to go secondly there seems to be gold up there i want the money  jordan noisily thrust back his chair and then took up a pen and apparently without recognizing what he was doing snapped it across  stop right there i cant stand too muchand theres eleanor he said and broke into a harsh laugh as he glanced down at the pen in one way its significant that ive broken thething  he said nothing for the next moment or two and appeared to be putting a restraint upon himself but there was longing in his voice when he went on again lord i guess its in us when wed only the wagons and axes we worried right across the continent there was always something that drew us to the place we didnt know the harder the way was the more the longing grew i was up in the selkirks on the goldtrail once and im never going to work something that life left behind right out of me  come said jimmy simply  the veins rose swollen on jordans forehead but he struck the table with a clenched fist and gazed at his comrade with hot anger in his eyes  will you stop youfool he said dont you know how i want to go stop or ill throw you out right now  he sat still looking at jimmy for perhaps half a minute and each was conscious of the same longing in his heart and the same tingling of his blood for that is a country where men still feel the lust of the primeval conflict and the allurements of the wilderness then jordan appeared to recover himself  i guess well be ashamed of this afterwards but i have got to talk he said anyway we cant all get right in with the axe and shovel my works here and ive just sense enough to stay with it besides its a sure thing that everybody who goes north wont rake out money now you want the snow and the cañons you cant have them but ill give you driftice blinding fog reefs and breaking surf instead you want money well well try to meet your views on that point and by and by well double what youre getting  jimmy gazed at him in evident bewilderment and his comrade waved his hand  youre going to take the first of the crowd to st michaels in the shasta and the man who can run a 250ton boat there and back again will have all the excitement he has any use for half the reefs arent charted the tides run any way and when the gale drops the fog shuts down thicker than a blanket you cant pound a rockdrill or swing the shovel but you can hold a steamers wheel get hold of that and try to understand it its the whole point of the thing  he stopped a moment as if for breath and then went on again hurling out his words incisively while his eyes snapped  its st michaels now but by and by theyll find a way in from the panhandle or over british soil the cpr will put big boats on and theyll run everything that will float up from frisco and portland but well be in first and take hold with the shasta the men youre going to carry would go in a canoe she has built up the coast trade enough to make it easy for us to raise the money to buy another boatim hanging right on to that trade tooand i know of a handy steamer ill get an option on her now shell be worth considerably more in a week or two you stand by the shasta company and do your part in the rush thats coming in the way you know and youll rake in more money than you ever would mining well put a thousandton boat on before long if you play our hand well i want your answer right off are you hanging on to us  yes said jimmy quietly after all your point of view is no doubt the right one if the boat were only fifty tons id start as soon as she was ready  jordan rose and grabbed his hat before he flung a letter across the table then im going for old leeson now hustle and wire those people that we want an option on that steamboat firm until tomorrow  he strode out of the office and when jimmy reached the street a minute later he saw him running hard in the direction of leesons house     chapter xxii  ashore   it was summer in the north and now that the bitter wind which had blown thick rain before it had dropped the clammy fog shut the shasta in like a wall she crept through it with engines pounding steadily swinging to the slow heave of the swell while jimmy stood chilled to the backbone on his bridge as he had done for most of the last fortyeight hours a chart in a glass case was clamped to the rail in front of him and lindstrom the mate stooped over it with the moisture trickling from his oilskins  this thing is not much good he said the stream moves a different way with the change of wind also there is discrepancy in the depth of water  there is if i knew how much to mark off for leeway in that last breeze id feel a good deal easier said jimmy who turned to fling a disgusted glance at the chart upon which little arrows that indicated the general drifts of the currents had apparently been scattered promiscuously then he raised his voice forward there see you have a good arming on your lead and stand by to let go when i take the way off her  he pressed down his telegraph and a curious silence followed the clang of the gong when the engines stopped the shasta lurched on more slowly into the fog and when jimmy swung up his hand a man on the halfseen forecastle loosed the deepsea lead while another perched in the mainmast shrouds stood intent with a coil of slack line in his hand there was a splash the line ran out and when a singsong cry came up jimmy made a little impatient gesture as he turned to the chart  a fathom less than we ought to have he said and raised his voice what bottom have you got  a couple of men were busy hauling in the ponderous lead and one of them who lifted it turned to the bridge mud sir he said soft at that  jimmy looked at lindstrom that at least is what this thing says i suppose one ought to bring her up and wait for a sight but we cant stay here a week on the odd chance of a blink of clear weather anyway theres plenty water under us and well try the lead again presently  the mate made a sign of concurrence as jimmy pressed down his telegraph i was at kenai four year ago for two weeks we see nothing how we get there i cannot tell you but i think it is by good fortune also the skipper come there often for the commercial company you do a thing several times then you shut your eye and perhaps you do it again  he went down the ladder and jimmy was left alone except for the silent shapeless figure in trickling oilskins at the steering wheel how he had groped his way to st michaels near the tremendous desolation of willow swamps about the yukon mouth he did not exactly know but he had accomplished it in spite of screaming gale and blinding fog and the treasureseekers he had taken up had duly presented him with a written testimonial which was all they had to give a few days of clear weather had permitted him to steam across to one of the commercial companys factories but since he left it he had held southward at a venture through thick rain and fog without a single glimpse of any celestial body that would not have mattered so much had the sea been still as a lake is for then he could have steered by dead reckoning but that sea is swept by currents which run for the most part in guessedat and variable directions and it was impossible to calculate how far they might have deflected his course for him in fact for all he knew they might have deflected it several times and set it right again he had cable enough to anchor but as he had said he could not stay there for a week or two on the odd chance of getting an hours clear weather  so since the chart suggested that he was clear of the shore he went on leisurely leaning on his bridgerails chilled in every limb with the damp trickling off him while the shasta bored her way through the woolly vapor until a little while after the lead had given him a reassuring depth of water she stopped suddenly jimmy was flung against the wheel with a violence that drove all the breath out of him but the next moment he had jumped for his telegraph while everything in the vessel banged and rattled and the gong clanged out his orders stop her and hard astern  then while the smooth swell lapped level with one depressed rail the shasta shook in every plate and the men who came scrambling to her slanted deck looked at him anxiously there was however no clamor or any sign of undue consternation the men had almost expected this and the energy which for want of direction now and then in such cases leads to purposeless and unreasoning scurry had been washed out of them jimmy leaned quietly on the rails and nodded in answer to their glances  yes he said were hard on if the propeller wont shake her loose in the next ten minutes well see about laying out an anchor mr lindstrom will you clear the two boats ready and ask fleming if theres any more water in his bilges  it was twenty minutes before the pounding engines stopped but the shasta had not moved an inch astern the lower side of her lifted as the long gray swell lapped gurgling to her rail and then came down again but that was all in the meanwhile the handlead armed with tallow had shown the bottom to be soft and fleming quietly reported that there was no sign of any water coming in then jimmy turned to lindstrom who once more had climbed to the bridge  if this fog lifts and the breeze gets up as usual shell certainly break up he said if it doesnt i dont think theres any reason why we shouldnt heave her off well try it first with the coal in its a long way to wellington and i dont want to dump a ton if i can help it  the big scandinavian went down the ladder and by and by half the men on board the shasta were engaged under his direction in lashing a platform of hatchplanks between the two boats that lay beneath the forecastle the long heave drove them banging against the shastas side and jerked the planks loose as they strove to lash them fast but at last they accomplished it and while the dimness that stands for the northern summer night crept into the fog the men on the forecastle head lowered the anchor down it was of the old stocked pattern and though the shasta was not a large vessel they found it and the cable which came down after it sufficiently difficult to handle upon a slippery platform that heaved and slanted under them still the thing was done because it was necessary and with oars splashing clumsily because there was little space for the men who pulled them they paddled off into the fog  when they came back the cable was unshackled and the end of it led in through the mooring halfmoon on the vessels stern and there then remained the second anchor to lay out the cable of this one was unshackled too but wirerope purchases were rigged to the end of it from the after winch and by the time all was ready it was six oclock in the morning the men were worn out and jimmys eyes were heavy with want of sleep but nobody made any demur about facing the further work before him they knew what would happen if the fog lifted and the breeze that rolled it back should find the shasta there  jimmy pressed down the telegraph on his bridge winch and windlass groaned and rattled the wirerope screamed and the clanking cable tightened suddenly then the thudding propeller shook the ship until she quivered like a thing in pain each time the smooth swell lifted one side of her steam drifted about her wire and cable were drawn rigid but she would not budge an inch in spite of them and jimmys face was a trifle grim when he flung up his hand the thud of the propeller slackened and there was a silence that was almost oppressive when winch and windlass stopped the gurgle of the gray swell about the steamers plates and the drip of moisture from the slanted shrouds emphasized it then jimmy signed to one of the men  send mr fleming here he said  the man disappeared and the engineer looked grave when he climbed to the bridge  youll be wanting to dump my coal now he asked how are you going to take her home without it  there is a good deal of heavy timber right down the west coast said jimmy dryly there are also quite a few inlets into which one could take a steamer  you cant feed a boiler furnace with fourfootdiameter pines  they can be sawn and split besides there are probably smaller ones among those fourfoot pines they dont grow that size in a year or two  the engineer made a last protest im aware that it wont be much use but its my duty to point out the difficulties you cant saw those trees without a big crosscut and im not sure what my boiler tubes will do under a stream of resinous flame  well said jimmy thoughtfully i think i could make some kind of crosscut out of a thin plate if i were an engineer in fact id make two and keep a man filing up one of them while i used the other then id pump my feedwater rather higher than usual about those tubes  you cant pump water round the backend said the engineer youre going to see that resin flame make a hole in the back plate of the combustion chamber  he stopped and smiled when jimmy looked at him well now that ive told you ill start every man to dumping the coal over  worn out as they were the men worked feverishly until noon some panted at the ashhoist some standing on slippery iron ladders passed the heavy baskets from one to another and the rest toiled amidst the stifling dust that streamed from the bunkers those who could see it were sincerely glad that the fog still hung about themclammy impenetrable and apparently as solid as a wall  then it commenced to stir a little and slide past the vessel in filmy wisps and it seemed to jimmy that the smooth gray swell which lapped about her was getting steeper once or twice indeed it overlapped her depressed rail and poured on board in a long green cascade he knew that meant the breeze had already awakened somewhere not far away and that when the sea that it was stirring up came down on them it would not take it very long to knock the bottom out of the shasta so did the men and they toiled the harder until when the bunkers were almost empty jimmy once more stopped them  stand by winch and windlass we have to heave her off inside the next hour he said tell mr fleming to shake her with the propeller and give you all the steam he can  the engines pounded the sea boiled white beneath the shastas stern and wire and studded cable screamed and groaned above the clamor of the winch and the thudding of the screw for thirty long minutes during which the uproar ceased for a moment or two once or twice the shasta did not move at all and jimmy felt his heart thump under the tension while a cold breeze whipped his face then he thrust down his telegraph and his voice reached the men on the forecastle harshly when the engines stopped  you have to do it now or tear the windlass out ill give you all the steam he said  the men understood why haste was necessary the fog no longer slid past them but whirled by in ragged streaks and the wind that drove it came up out of the wastes of the pacific already the long swell was flecked with little frothing ridges and there was no need to tell any of those who glanced at it anxiously that it would break across the stranded vessel in an hour or two some of them stood by clanking windlass and banging winch while the rest swabbed the creaking wire with grease and rubbed engine tallow on guide and block where it would ease the strain for five minutes they worked in silence and then a shout went up as the winchdrum that had spun beneath the wire took hold and reeled off a foot or two of it the shasta swung herself upright as a big gray heave capped with livid white rolled in and a curious quiver ran through her before she came down on one side again the roar of the jet of steam that rushed aloft from beside her funnel grew almost deafening but jimmys voice broke faintly through the din  lindstrom he said tell mr fleming he can turn the steam he darent bottle down on to his engines  then a sonorous pounding and the thud of the screw joined in and by the time the jet of steam had died away the shasta was quivering all through while her masts stood upright and did not slant back again her windlass was also slowly gathering the clanking cable in until at last it rattled furiously as she leaped astern then a hoarse shout of exultation went up and jimmy drew in a deep breath of relief as he strode across his bridge  heave right up to your kedge and break it out he said then well let her swing and get the stream anchor when she rides to it ahead  it meant an hours brutal labor overhauling hard wire tackles and leading forward ponderous chain but they undertook it lightheartedly with bleeding hands and broken nails while the shasta heaved and rolled viciously under them then when they broke out the stream anchor under her bows jimmy sighed from sheer satisfaction as he pressed down his telegraph to halfspeed ahead  we wouldnt have done it in another hour lindstrom he said well drive her west a while to make sure of things before we put her on her course again and in the meanwhile youll keep the handlead going  it gave them steadily deepening water until the sea piled up and the shasta rolled her rail under so that the man strapped outside the bridge could do no more than guess at the soundings and jimmy told him to come in then he turned to lindstrom  ill have to let up now he said i cant keep my eyes open  he lowered himself down the ladder circumspectly and found it somewhat difficult to reach the room beneath the bridge but five minutes after he got there he was sleeping heavily  they made some four knots in each of the next thirty hours with the gale on their starboard bow when at last it broke jimmy who got an observation headed the shasta southeastward and a day or two later ran her in behind an island then two boats pulled ashore across a sluice of tide and came back some hours later when it had slackened a little loaded rather deeper than was safe with sawnup pines fleming also brought two very rude saws with him and invited jimmys attention to one of them  saws he said are in a general way made of steel and you cant expect too much from soft plateiron the boys did well theres not a man among the crowd of them can get his back straight youd understand the reason if you had tried to cut down big trees with an instrument that has an edge like a nutmeggrater  jimmy smiled for he considered it very likely well he said what are you going to do to make them serviceable  sit up all night regulletting them with a file i want four loads of billets before we start again but well take another axe ashore in the morning  they went off early when the tide was slack taking an extra axe along while it was noon when they came back with one man who had badly cut his leg lying upon the billets fleming however insisted on his four loads and it was evening when he brought the last two off the men were almost too wearied to pull across the tide and only the handles attached to them suggested that the two worn strips of iron they passed up had been meant for saws  that said fleming who held one up before jimmy says a good deal for the boys but if i drove them the same way any longer there would be a mutiny  jimmy laughed and told him to raise steam enough to take the shasta to sea she made six knots most of that night and two days later the men went ashore again fleming at least never forgot the rest of that trip down the wild west coast he mixed his resinous billets with saturated coaldust and broken hemlock bark but in spite of it he stopped the shasta every now and then when his boilers gave him water instead of steam  still she crept on south and at last all of them were sincerely glad when the pithead gear of the dunsmore mines rose up against the forests of vancouver island over the starboard hand an hour or two later fleming stood blackened all over amidst a gritty cloud while the coal that was to free him from his cares clattered into the shastas bunkers and jimmy sat in the room beneath her bridge with one of the coaling clerks writing out a telegram  ill get it sent off for you right away said the coaling man guess it will be a big relief to somebody it seems theyve most given you up in vancouver  jimmy laughed well he said we have brought her here still i think there were times when my engineer felt that the contract was almost too big for him     chapter xxiii  anthea grows anxious   the afternoon was hot but jordan failed to notice it as he swung along as fast as he could go without actually running down a street in vancouver he walked in the glaring sunlight because there was more room there as everybody else was glad to seek the shadow cast across one sidewalk by the tall stores and offices and he appeared unconscious of the remarks flung after him by the irate driver of an express wagon which had almost run over him jordan was one of the men who are always desperately busy but there were reasons why his activity was a little more evident than usual just then his associates had contrived to raise sufficient money to purchase a boat to take up the shastas usual trip but the finances of the company were in a somewhat straitened condition as the result of it and he was beset with a good many other difficulties of the kind the struggling man has to grapple with  for all that he stopped abruptly when he saw forsters drivingwagon a light fourwheeled vehicle standing outside a big drygoods store he was aware that mrs forster seldom went to vancouver without taking eleanor with her which appeared sufficient reason for believing that the girl was then inside the store if anything further were needed to indicate the probability of this there was a wellfavored and very smartlydressed man standing beside the wagon and jordans face grew suddenly hard as he looked at him as it happened the man glanced in his direction just then and jordan found it difficult to keep a due restraint upon himself when he saw the sardonic twinkle in his eyes it was more expressive than a good many words would have been  jordan had for some time desired an interview with him but warmblooded and somewhat primitive in his notions upon certain points as he was he had sense enough to realize that he was not likely to gain anything by an altercation in a busy street which would certainly not advance him in eleanors favor besides this it was probable that somebody would interfere if he found it necessary to resort to physical force jordan who was by no means perfect in character had like a good many other men brought up as he had been in the forests of the pacific slope no great aversion to resorting to the latter when he considered that the occasion warranted it  still he held himself in hand and strode into the store where as it happened he came upon mrs forster there was a faint smile in her eyes when she turned to him for she was a lady of considerable discernment but she held out her hand graciously she liked the impulsive man  it is some time since we have seen anything of you she said  that said jordan is just what i was thinking though its quite likely there are people who wouldnt let it grieve them in fact i was wondering whether you would mind if i asked myself over to supper with your husband this evening  mrs forster laughed  i really dont think it would trouble me very much and i have no doubt that forster would enjoy a talk with you she said i wonder whether you know that mr carnforth is coming  i do and jordan looked at her steadily with a trace of concern in his manner in fact that was one of my reasons for asking you  the lady shook her head so i supposed she said still while everybody is expected to know his own business best im not sure youre wise you see i really dont think eleanor is very much denser than i am though you can tell her you have my invitation to supper  jordan who expressed his thanks strode across the store and came upon eleanor standing by a counter with several small parcels before her she turned at his approach and he found it difficult to believe that his appearance afforded her any great pleasure while he gathered up the parcels she made him a little imperious gesture and they moved away toward a quieter part of the big store then she turned to him again  charley she said sharply what are you doing here  i saw forsters wagon outside and that reminded me that it was at least a week since i had seen you  eleanor smiled somewhat curiously for it was of course clear to her that he could not have seen the wagon without seeing carnforth too  and she said  im coming over to supper with forster you dont look by any means as pleased as one would think you ought to be  the girl appeared disconcerted i should sooner you didnt come tonight  of course said jordan i can quite believe it  a tinge of color crept into eleanors face and there was now nothing that suggested a smile in the sparkle in her eyes pshaw she said charley dont be a fool  im not said jordan slowly that is i dont think i am in the way you mean in fact though it shouldnt be necessary i want to say right now that i have every confidence in you  thanks there are various ways of showing it you havent chosen one that appeals to me  jordan flung out one hand after all im humanand i dont like that man  you are now and then you are also a little crude which is probably what you mean still thats not the question i think i mentioned that i should sooner you didnt come to supper this evening  the gleam in her paleblue eyes grew plainer and it said a good deal for jordans courage that he persisted since most of eleanors acquaintances had discovered that it was not wise to thwart her when she looked as she did then  im afraid i cant allow that to influence me especially as mrs forster expects me  very well and eleanors tone was dry you may carry those parcels to the wagon  jordan did so and felt his blood tingle when carnforth favored him with a glance of unconcerned inquiry there was a suggestive complacency in his faint smile that was in the circumstances intensely provocative but jordan contrived to restrain himself then mrs forster and eleanor came out and the latter took the parcels from him  four of them she said you havent dropped any  jordan did not think he had and the girl pressed one or two of the parcels between her fingers then i wonder where the muslin is  i guess they can tell me in the store said jordan  he swung around and in a moment or two was back at the counter the clerk there however had to refer to one of her companions and as the latter was busy jordan had to wait a minute or two  i wrapped up the muslin with the trimming she said at last miss wheelock had four parcels and i saw you take up all of them  jordan turned away with an unpleasant thought in his mind and was out of the store in a moment there was however no wagon in the street and after running down most of it he stopped with a harsh laugh forsters team was a fast one and jordan realized that it was very unlikely that he could overtake it especially when eleanor who usually drove did not wish him to after all her quickness and resolution in one way appealed to him and he remembered that he had promised to dine with austerly that evening still he went back to his business feeling a trifle sore and one or two of the men who called on him noticed that his temper was considerably shorter than usual  he had in fact not altogether recovered his customary goodhumor when he sat on the veranda of austerlys house some hours later the meal which austerly insisted on calling dinner though he had found it impossible to get anybody to prepare it later than seven oclock in the evening was over and the rest of the few guests were scattered about the garden valentine who had arrived in the sorata a day or two earlier sat at the foot of the short veranda stairway close by the lounge chair where nellie austerly lay looking unusually fragile but listening to the bronzed man with a quiet smile austerly leaned on the balustrade and anthea sat not far from jordan she was as it happened looking out through a gap in the firs which afforded her a glimpse of the shining inlet a schooner crept slowly across the strip of water on her way to the frozen north with treasureseekers  she seems very little said anthea one wonders whether she will get there and whether the men on board her will ever come back again  the chances are against it said austerly it is a long way to st michaels and one understands that those northern waters are either wrapped in fog or swept by sudden gales besides that it must be a tremendous march or canoe trip inland and before they reach the gold region the summer will be over one would scarcely fancy that many of them could live out the winter in fact it seems to me scarcely probable that the yukon basin will ever become a mining district nature is apparently too much for the white man there what is your opinion jordan  jordan smiled though there was a snap in his eyes  it seems to me you dont quite understand what kind of men we raise on the slope he said once its made clear that the gold is there theres no snow and ice between st michaels and the pole that would stop their getting in when they take the trail those men will go right on in spite of everything you have heard what their fathers did here in british columbia when there was gold in caribou they hadnt the cpr then to take them up the fraser and there wasnt a wagonroad they made a trail through the wildest cañons there are on this earth and blazed a way afterward over range and through the rivers across the trackless wilderness it was too big a contract for some of them but they stayed with it going on until they died the others got the gold it was a sure thing that they would get it they had to  just so said austerly with a smile still if i remember correctly they were not all born on the pacific slope some of them i almost think came from england  they did said jordan who for no very evident reason glanced in antheas direction the ones who got there were for the most part sailormen they and our bushmen are much of a kind though im not quite sure that the hardest hoeing didnt fall to the sailor he hadnt been taught to face the forest with nothing but an axe build a fire of wet wood or make a packhorse bridge but he started with the oldtime prospectors and he went right in with them its much the same nowsteam cant spoil him when a big risky thing is to be done anywhere right down the slope thats where youll come across the man from the blue water  he stopped a moment as if for breath with a deprecatory gesture there are one or two things that sure start me talking its a kind of useless habit in a man whos shackled down to his work in the city but i cant help it anyway the men who are going north wont head for st michaels and the yukon marshes much longer theyll blaze a shorter trail in from somewhere farther south right over the coast range it wont matter that theyll have to face ten feet of snow  neither of the other two answered him but the fact that they watched the fading white sails of the little schooner had its significance there was scarcely a man on the pacific slope whose thoughts did not turn toward the golden north just then and one could notice signs of tense anticipation in all the wooden cities the army of treasureseekers had not set out yet but big detachments had started and the rest were making ready so far there was little certain news but rumors and surmises flew from mouth to mouth in busy streets and crowded saloons it was known that the way was perilous and many would leave their bones beside it and though as jordan had said that would not count if there were gold in the land to which it led men waited a little feverishly until they should feel more sure about the latter point  by and by austerly who spoke to valentine went down the stairway and anthea smiled when the latter after walking a few paces with him turned back again to where nellie austerly was lying  there are things it is a little difficult to understand she said valentine has perhaps seen nellie three or four times since she left the sorata and yet as no doubt you have noticed he will scarcely leave her she would evidently be quite content to have him beside her all evening too  you didnt say all you thought and jordan looked at her gravely you mean that the usual explanation wouldnt fit their case that of course is clear since both of them must realize that she cant expect to live more than another year or so i naturally dont know why she should take to valentine but i have a fancy from what jimmy said that she reminded him of somebody what is perhaps more curious still i think she recognizes it and doesnt in the least mind it  somebody he was fond of long ago  jordan appeared to consider that seems to make the thing more difficult to understand still im not sure it does in reality he is one of the men who remember always too he would not want to marry her if she were growing strong instead of slowly fading it would somehow spoil things if he did  of course said anthea slowly in any case as you mentioned it would be out of the question but how  jordan checked her with a smile this time how do i understand i dont think i do altogether i only guess a man who lived alone at sea or on a ranch in the shadowy bush might be capable of an attachment of that kind but not one who makes his living in the cities one cant get away from the material point of view there  he broke off and sat still for a minute or two for though it was clear that anthea had no wish to discuss that topic further he felt that she had something to say to him  mr jordan she asked at last have you had any news about the shasta  jordans face clouded but he did not turn in her direction for which the girl was grateful  no he said i have none as perhaps you know she should have turned up two or three weeks ago  it was a moment or two before he glanced around and then anthea met his gaze in which however there was no trace of inquiry  you are anxious about her she asked  i am a little it is a wild coast up yonder and they have wilder weather the charts dont tell you very much about those narrow seas one must trust to good fortune and ones nerve when the fog shuts down that and he smiled reassuringly was why i sent jimmy  anthea felt her face grow warm but she looked at him steadily  ah she said you believe in him still skill and nerve will not do everything  they will do a great deal and what flesh and blood can do one can count on getting from the shastas skipper i believeand he lowered his voice confidentiallyjimmy will bring her back again thats why i sent her up there less than halfinsured premiums were heavy and we wanted all our money still if he does not i know he will have made the toughest fightand that will be some relief to me you see im fond of jimmyand im talking quite straight with you  there was a hint of pain in the girls face and she realized that it was there but his frankness had had its effect on her it suggested a sympathy she did not resent and she smiled at him gravely  thank you she said there is another thing i want to ask mr jordan if you get any news of the shasta will you come and tell me  within the hour said jordan and anthea who thanked him rose and turned away  jordan however sat still gazing straight in front of him thoughtfully for though she had perhaps not intended this the girls manner had impressed him he fancied that he knew what she was feeling and that she had in a fashion taken him into her confidence it was also a confidence that he would at any cost have held inviolable then he rose with a little dry smile  she is clear grit all through he said and her father is the  rogue in all this province     chapter xxiv  jordan keeps his promise   right sunshine streamed down on the inlet and there was an exhilarating freshness in the morning air but anthea merril sat somewhat listlessly on the veranda outside her fathers house looking across the sparkling water toward the snows of the north she had done the same thing somewhat frequently of late and as had happened on each occasion her thoughts were fixed on the little vessel that had apparently vanished in the fogwrapped sea anthea had grown weary of waiting for news of her  hitherto very little that she desired had been denied her and though that had not been sufficient to pervert her nature it naturally made the suspense she had to face a little harder to bear since the money before which other difficulties had melted was in this case of no avail the commander of the shasta had passed far beyond her power to recall him and if he still lived of which she was far from certain it was only the primitive courage and stubborn endurance which are not confined to men of wealth and station that could bring him back to her in spite of blinding fog and icy seas anthea had no longer any hesitation in admitting that this was what she greatly desired now that he hadit appeared more than possiblesailed out of her life altogether into the unknown haven that awaits the souls of the sailormen she knew how she longed for him still the days had slipped by and there was no word from the silent north which has been for many a sailorman and sealer the fairway to the tideless sea  at last she started a little as a man came up the drive toward the house he appeared to be a city clerk but though merril had not yet gone out she did not recognize him as one of those in her fathers service he turned when he saw her and came straight across the lawn and anthea felt a thrill run through her as she noticed that he had an envelope in his hand  miss merril he said mr jordan sent this with his compliments  anthea thanked him but did not open the envelope until he turned away even then she almost felt her courage fail as she tore it apart and took out a strip of paper that appeared to be a telegraphic message addressed to jordan  held up by fog and got ashore but arrived here undamaged clearing again morning it read and the blood crept into her face as she saw that it was signed wheelock shasta  for the next five minutes she sat perfectly still conscious only of a great relief and then she roused herself with an effort as merril came out of the house  a telegram he said with a smile who has been wiring you have you been speculating  in that case dont you think i should have come to you for information asked anthea who was mistress of herself again  im not sure that you would have been wise if you had said merril with a whimsical grimace i dont seem to have been very successful with my own affairs of late anyway you havent told me what i asked  anthea was never quite sure why she placed the message in his hand she was aware that he was not interested in the subject and would certainly not have pressed her for an answer in fact he very seldom inquired as to what she did and had never attempted to place any restraint upon her he glanced at the message and then turned to her again  wheelock to jordan friends of yours he said you would probably meet them at austerlys  yes said anthea i think i may say they are  it was essentially characteristic of merril that he showed no displeasure he was indulgent to his daughter and one who very seldom allowed himself to be led away by either personal liking or rancor for a moment he stood still looking down at her with a dry smile and because no father and daughter can be wholly dissimilar anthea bore his scrutiny with perfect composure  well he said theyre both men of some ability with signs of grit in them though i dont know that it would have troubled me if i had heard no more of the shasta now im a little late and it will be tonight before im back from the city  he turned away and once more anthea became sensible of a faint repulsion for her father every word eleanor wheelock had uttered in forsters ranch had impressed itself on her memory and she knew now that his interests clashed with those of the shasta company it would not have astonished her if he had shown some sign of resentment but this complete indifference appeared unnatural and troubled her he was it seemed as devoid of anger as he was if eleanor wheelock and several others were to be believed of pity then she felt that she must to a certain extent at least confide in some one and she set out to call on nellie austerly  it happened that morning that jimmy stood on the shastas bridge as she steamed up the softly gleaming straits ahead a dingy smokecloud was moving on toward him and he took his glasses from the box when the black shape of a steamer grew out of it she rose rapidly higher and jimmy guessed that she was considerably larger than the shasta and steaming three or four knots faster then he made out that her deck was crowded with passengers and though the beaver ensign floated over her stern their destination was evident when he glanced at the flag at the fore the only american soil north of them was alaska  she drew abreast a beautiful vessel of old and almost obsolete model with the clear green water frothing high beneath her outward curve of prow there was no forecastle forward to break the sweeping line of rail and the broad quarterdeck that overhung her slender stern had also its suggestiveness to a seamans eye the smokecloud at her funnel further hinted that her speed was purchased by a consumption of coal that would have been considered intolerable in a modern boat then the strip of bunting at her mainmast head fixed jimmys attention  merrils hard on our trail he said shes taking a big crowd of miners north thats his flag  fleming who stood beneath the bridge looked up with a little nod i would not compliment him on his sense he said a beautiful boat but the man who runs her will want a coalmine of his own got her cheap i figure but its only at topfreights she could make a living guess merrils screwing all he can out of those miners but those rates wont last when the cpr and the americans cut in and if i had a boat of that kind id put up a big insurance and then scuttle her  then one of the two or three bronzed prospectors who had come down with the shasta approached the bridge  cant you let the boys who are going up know weve been there he said it might encourage them to see that somebody has come out alive  jimmy called to his quartermaster before he answered the man well he said in a general way the signal wouldnt quite mean that but its very likely theyll understand it  merrils boat was almost alongside when the quartermaster broke out the stars and stripes at the shastas masthead a roar of voices greeted the snapping flag and the heads grew thick as cedar twigs in the shadowy bush along the strangers rail while the men who stood higher aft upon her ample quarterdeck flung their hats and arms aloft jimmy could see them plainly and their faces and garments proclaimed that most of them were from the cities there were others whose skin was darkened and who wore older clothes but these did not shout for they were men who had been at close grips with savage nature already and had some notion of what was before them jimmy blew his whistle and dipped the beaver flag while a curious little thrill ran through him as the sonorous blast hurled his greeting across the clear green water he knew what these men would have to face who were going up the vanguard of a great army to grapple with the wilderness and it was clear that nature would prove too terrible for many of them who would never drag their bones out of it again  once more the voices answered him with a storm of hopeful cries for the softhanded men of the cities had also the courage of their breed it was the careless optimistic courage of the pacific slope and storeclerk and hotellounger cheered the shasta gaily as reckless of what was before them they went by when the time came to face screaming blizzard and awful cold they would for the most part do it willingly and go on unflinching in spite of flood and frost until they dropped beside the trail jimmy who realized this vaguely felt the thrill again and was glad that he had sped them on their way with a message of goodwill but there was no roar from their steamers whistle and the beaver flag blew out undipped at her stern then as she drew away from him his face hardened and the engineer looked at him with a grin  merrils skippers like him and thats most as mean as he could be he said  jimmy glanced toward his masthead if there were many of his kind among my countrymen id feel tempted to shift that flag aft and keep it there he said the boys from puget sound could cheer  one of the prospectors who stood below broke into a little soft laugh oh yes he said its in them and all the snow up yonder wont melt it out still its your quiet bushmen and ours wholl do the getting there guess they could raise a smile for youand they did but when it comes to shouting they havent breath to spare  he turned and looked after the steamer growing smaller to the northward amidst her smokecloud one in every twenty may bottom on paying gold and you might figure on three or four more making grub and a few ounces on a hired mans share the snow and the river will get the rest  then he strolled away and when jimmy looked around again there was only a smoketrail on the water for the steamer had sunk beneath the verge of the sea his attention also was occupied by other things that concerned him more than the steamer for another two or three hours would bring him to vancouver inlet which he duly reached that afternoon and found jordan and a crowd through which the latter could scarcely struggle awaiting him on the wharf still he got on board and poured out tumultuous questions while he wrung jimmys hand and it was twenty minutes at least before jimmy had supplied him with the information he desired then he sat down and smiled  well he said well go into the other points tomorrow and tonight youre coming to austerlys with me got word from miss nellie that i was to bring you sure she wanted me to send a team over for eleanor  then why didnt you asked jimmy  jordans manner became confidential nellie austerly contrived to mention that miss merril would be there too and it seemed to me that eleanor mightnt quite fit in she has her notions and when she gets her program fixed i just stand clear of her and let her go ahead its generally wiser anyway i felt that i could afford to do the straight thing by you and austerly  thanks said jimmy with a dry smile of course there is nothing to be gained by pretending that eleanor is fond of miss merril  jordan sighed well i guess other mens sisters have their little fancies now and then and though she has scared me once or twice eleanors probably not very different from the rest of them i was a trifle played outdriven too hard and anxiouswhile you were away and she was awfully good to megentle as an angel but for all that i feel one couldnt trust her alone with miss merril on a dark night if she had a sharp hatpin or anything of that kind and as for merril i believe she wouldnt raise any objections if it were in our power to have him skinned alive now i like a girl with grit in her  still eleanor goes a little further than you care about at times  jordan laid a hand on his companions arm jimmy he said theres a thing you havent mentioned to either of usand i didnt expect you tobut i feel that by and by your sister is going to make trouble for you  jimmy looked at him steadily and jordan smiled you neednt trouble about making any disclaimer i see how it is somehow youre going to get her merrils not likely to run us off i guess theres no reason to worry about him still i want you to understand that if i cant put a check on your sisterand thats quite likelyim going to stand by her i just have to  of course said jimmy gravely nobody would expect anything else from you i dont mind admitting that i have been a little anxious about what eleanor might dobut well change the subject you suggested that merril was getting into trouble  he is said jordan with evident relief theyre making the road to the pulpmill and i dont quite know where he raised his share of the money especially as he has just taken over a big oldtype steamer had to face a high figure played out as she is ships are in demand now there are men like merril whose money isnt their own that is they can get it from other people to make a profit on as a general thing but these arent ordinary times any man with money can make good interest on it himself just now and ive more than a fancy that merrils handing out instead of raking in he has been at the banks lately and when theres a demand for money everywhere you can figure what theyre going to charge him anyway we wont worry about him in the meanwhile get on your shoreclothes as soon as youre ready youre coming uptown with me     chapter xxv  an understanding   jimmy went to austerlys and during the evening related his adventures in the north to a sympathetic audience his companions insisted on this and though there was one fact he would rather not have mentioned he complied goodhumoredly with their request the narrative was essentially matteroffact but he had sufficient sense to avoid any affectation of undue diffidence and the others appeared to find it interesting indeed nellie austerly at least noticed the faint sparkle which now and then crept into antheas eyes as he told them how in order to keep his promise to the miners that there should be no delay he had come out of a snug anchorage and groped his way northward through a bewildering smother of unlifting fog he also told them simply but though he was not aware of the latter fact with a certain dramatic force how straining every nerve and muscle in tense suspense they hove the steamer off just before the gale broke and of the strenuous labor cutting wood for fuel on the southward voyage  when he stopped nellie austerly looked up with a little nod yes she said you took those miners in as you had promised in spite of the fog and you brought the shasta down all that way with only a few tons of coal still i dont think you should expect any particular commendation there are men who cant help doing things of that kind  jimmy laughed though his face grew slightly flushed im afraid i also put her ashore one cant get over that then he looked at jordan in fact i scarcely think im out of the wood yet there will be an inquiry  purely formal said his comrade theyll have a special whitewash brush made for you nautical assessors have some conscience after all besides it depends largely on the facts you supply them whether they consider it worth while to have one  austerly had a few questions to ask and then the conversation drifted away to other topics until some little time later jimmy found himself sitting alone beside nellie austerly she lay wrapped in fleecy shawls in a big chair near the foot of the veranda stairway looking very frail but she smiled at him benevolently  i am glad they have gone she said you see i wanted to talk to you but the dew is commencing to settle and i must go in soon that is insisted on though i dont think it matters  she smiled again it is a beautiful world jimmy isnt it  jimmy drew in his breath as he glanced about him for he guessed part of what she was thinking and it hurt him he could see the dark pines towering against the wondrous green transparency which follows hard upon the sunset splendors in that country the inlet shone in the gaps amid that stately colonnade and far off beyond it there was a faint ethereal gleam of snow to him filled as he was with the clean vigor of the sea it seemed too beautiful a world to leave  still said his companion it has had very little to offer me and perhaps that is why i feel one should never stand by and let any good thing it holds out go that is of course when one has the strength to grasp it it usually needs some courage too  im afraid it does and jimmy looked down at her gravely for since this was not quite the first time she had suggested the same thing he commenced to understand where she was leading him one might perhaps manage to muster enough if one could only be sure  he stopped somewhat awkwardly and the girl laughed one very seldom can you have to reach out boldly and clutch before the opportunity has gone  in the dark  of course one cant always expect to see ones way you were not afraid of the fog jimmy  i was it got hold of my nerves and shook all the stiffening out of me in fact in the sense you mean im afraid of it still  he checked himself for a moment and his face was furrowed when he turned to her again you understand of course the clogging smother of uncertainty now and then gets intolerable when a man wants to do the right thing he cant see where he is going there is nothing to steer by  if you had sat down and tried to think of every reef and shoal and what would become of the shasta if she struck them would you ever have reached your destination when the fog shut down  no said jimmy i should in all probability have turned her round and steamed south again  nellie austerly laughed instead of that you went onand got thereas they say in this country that as i think you will recognize is the point of it all  i also got ashore  in spite of the lead it wasnt much service jimmy it really seems that one is just as safe when going fullspeed ahead besides you got off again and brought the shasta back undamaged well perhaps it may occur to you by and by that there must always be a little uncertainty and in the meanwhile i dare say you wont mind giving me your arm i must go in and these steps seem to be getting steeper lately  jimmy gravely held out his arm and when he handed her one of the shawls as they reached the veranda she smiled at him again  now you are released and i see anthea is all alone she said  she disappeared into the house and jimmys heart beat a good deal faster than usual when he went down the stairway though he did not know what he would say to her he had been longing all evening for a word or two with anthea and now the desire was almost overwhelming he had of course seen the drift of nellie austerlys observations and it scarcely seemed likely that she would have offered him the veiled encouragement unless she had had some ground for believing that it was warranted he also remembered what he had twice seen in antheas face but he was a steamboat skipper with no means worth mentioning and she the daughter of a man who was in one sense responsible for his fathers death that was certainly not her fault but jimmy felt that even if she would listen to him of which he was far from certain he could not expose her to her fathers illwill and the scornful pity of her friends still nellie austerlys words had had their effect and he strode straight across the lawn with the same curious little thrill running through him of which he had been sensible when he drove the shasta fullspeed into the fog  anthea stood waiting for him beneath the dark firs very much as she had done when he had last seen her with a smile in her eyes  i suppose it is nellies fault but i was commencing to wonder whether you wished to avoid me she said  jimmy stood silent a moment trying to impose a due restraint upon himself until she lifted her eyes and looked at him then he knew the attempt was useless and abandoned it  the fault was not exactly mine he said with a faint hoarseness in his voice for one thing how could i know that you would be pleased to see me  still said anthea quietly i really think you did were your other reasons for staying away more convincing  then jimmy flung prudence to the winds the fog of which he had declared himself afraid was thicker than ever but that fact had suddenly ceased to trouble him again he felt as he had done when he crouched in the soratas cockpit one wild morning that he and anthea merril were merely man and woman and that she was the one he wanted for his wife that was sufficient for the time being to drive out every other consideration but he answered her quietly  a little while ago i believed they were but i cant quite think that now he said something seems to have happened in the meanwhileand they dont appear to count  they had as if by mutual consent turned and followed a path that led into the scented shadow of the firs but when a great columnar trunk hid them from the house jimmy stopped again  yes he said after that morning when we watched the big combers from the soratas cockpit i think i should have known you were glad to see the shasta back but the trouble was that i dared not let myself be sure of it there were as you said reasons for that i suppose i should be strong enough to recognize and yield to them still butwhile you may blame me afterward for not doing soi cant  he moved a pace forward and laid a hand on her shoulder holding her back from him unresisting while he looked down at her since i carried you through the creek that evening up in the bush i have thought of nothing longed for nothing but you it has been one long effort to hold the folly in check but it has suddenly grown too hard for mei cant keep it up now at least you know  he let his hand drop to his side and stood still with his eyes fixed on her anthea looked up at him with a smile  ah she said i knew it all long ago was it very hard jimmyand are you sure it was necessary  the blood surged to the mans forehead but there was trouble as well as exultation in his face for his senses were coming back and it seemed to him that he must somehow muster wisdom to choose for both of them  my dear he said a trifle hoarsely i think it was i am a struggling steamboat skipper and you a lady of station in this province that was a sufficient reason as things go  if you had been the director of a steamship company and i a girl without a dollar would that have influenced you  it would have made it easier i should have claimed you on board the sorata lordand jimmy made a little forceful gesturehow i wish you were  anthea smiled at him curiously well she said i may not have very much money after alland if i had is there any reason why you should be willing to give up more than i would does it matter so very much that i may perhaps be a little richer than you are  the veins showed swollen on the mans forehead and again he struggled with the impulses that had carried him away for the discrepancy in wealth was after all only a minor obstacle anthea too clearly realized that and she roused herself for an effort  jimmy she said while he stood silent would it hurt you very much if i admitted that you were right and sent you away after all you have scarcely said anything that could make one think you would feel it very keenly  the man stooped a little and seized one of her hands dear you are all i want and to go would be the hardest thing i ever did but there is your fathers opposition to consider and if to stay would bring you trouble i might compel myself  ah said anthea softly the trouble would come if you went away  then with a little resolute movement she drew herself away from him and looked up with a flush in her face and a quickening of her breath for there was something of moment to be said there is a reason you havent mentioned yet though your sister did does that count for so very much with you  eleanor said jimmy while a thrill of anger ran through him i might have known she would do this  he stood quite still for several moments with a hand clenched at his side and his face furrowed and when he spoke again it was hoarsely  what did she tell you he asked  i think she told me all that she knew about your fathers ruin and his death it was very hard to listen to jimmybut did it really happen that way  she stopped a moment and cast a little glance of appeal at him i have tried to think that she must have distorted things it would have been no more than natural if i had borne what she has i would have done the same one could not regard them correctly bitterness and grief must influence ones point of view  the man turned his face from her and moved away a pace or two as if in pain then once more he turned toward her with a compassionate gesture for he knew that the blow would be a heavy one to her and it was almost insufferable that his hand should be the one to deal it  then anything i could say would not be more reliable my views would as naturally be distorted too  still i should have an answer you must realize that and if it is one that hurts i should sooner it came from you than anybody else  jimmy drew in his breath then while i dont know exactly what eleanor has said or whether i can forgive her that cruelty i think you could believe every word of it  the color faded from antheas face and she looked at him with a faint horror in her eyes and her lips tight set she could not doubt him if there had been no other reason the pity she saw he had for her was proof enough and for a moment or two she forgot everything but the grim fact to which eleanor wheelock had forced her to listen she could make no excuses for her father now  she saw him suddenly as she felt that he was a creature of insatiable greed cunning unscrupulous and without pity and then she commenced to feel intolerably lonely it was almost as though he had died and the longing for the love of the man who stood watching her with grave sympathy in his eyes grew so strong that for the moment she was sensible of nothing else there was nobody but him to whom she could turn it was she felt his part to comfort her and then she shivered as she remembered that circumstances had placed that out of the question the injury her father had done him must it seemed always stand between them and she shrank back a pace from him  ah she said you must hate me for that jimmy  it was half an assertion and though she had perhaps not consciously intended the latter half a question and the man recognized the dismay in it he strode forward and seizing both her hands laid them on his shoulders and drew her to him masterfully for a moment he used compulsion and then she clung to him quivering with her head on his breast  dear he said it is not your fault you had no part in it and even had it been so i think i could not have helped loving you as it is there is nothing in this world could make me hate you  anthea made him no answer and jimmy drew her closer still he had flung prudence and restraint away what he had said and done was irrevocable and he was glad that it was so at last the girl looked up at him again  jimmy she said if you can thrust into the background all that eleanor told me you cannot let money come between us besides i havent any now could i lavish money that had been wrung from your father and other struggling men upon my pleasuresor dare to bring it to you cant you understand dear i am as poor as you are  then she suddenly shook herself free from his grasp and seemed to shiver but you cant forgive himit will be war between you  yes said jimmy slowly i am afraid that must be so if there were no other reason i cannot desert the men who befriended me and your father will do all he can to crush them  ah said the girl it is going to be very hard still i cannot turn against him he has at least been kind to me i have never had a wish he has not gratified  jimmy slowly shook his head no he said that is out of the questioni could not ask it of you there is also this to recognize your father is a man of station and would never permit you to marry a steamboat skipper he will make every effort to keep you away from me  just then austerlys voice reached them from the house and anthea turned to the man again jimmy she said i know that you belong to me and i to you but that must be sufficient in the meanwhile we can neither of us be a traitor you must wait and say nothing dear  then she turned and slipping by him swiftly moved across the lawn toward the house while jimmy stood where he was exultant but realizing that the struggle before them would tax all the courage that was in him and the girl  before he left the house nellie austerly contrived to draw him to her side when there was nobody else near the chair in which she lay  well she said inquiringly  jimmy looked at her with a little grave smile i have rung for fullspeed he said still the fog is thicker than ever and when i dare to listen i can hear breakers on the bow     chapter xxvi  eleanor holds the clue   mrs forster had gone out with her daughters and there was just then nobody else in the ranch when eleanor wheelock and carnforth sat talking in the big general room this was satisfactory to the girl for she desired to have the next halfhour free from interruption she was aware that mrs forster might come back before that time had elapsed but although she had a purpose to accomplish any appearance of haste would spoil everything for it was as she recognized advisable that carnforth should be permitted to take her into his confidence in his own time and way without her doing anything to suggest that she was encouraging him he had not been very long in vancouver and though he had placed a good deal of money in merrils hands and was associated with him in some of his business ventures she had reasons for believing that he did not know exactly what her relations with jordan were or that she had a brother in command of the shasta carnforth as it happened had also come there with a purpose in his mind indeed it was one he had been considering for some little time though he had at length decided that it would have to be modified this did not exactly please him but he was prepared to make a sacrifice in case of necessity  he was a tall wellfavored man and his tightfitting clothes displayed the straightness of his limbs as he leaned back in his chair with his eyes which had a suggestive sparkle in them fixed on the girl the fashion in which he regarded her would in different circumstances have aroused eleanors resentment but she was quite aware that there were certain defects in his character and she had taken some trouble to discover why he had left toronto somewhat hastily she sat in a canvas chair opposite him across the room and since she had expected him that afternoon she was conscious that everything she wore became her well  the long lighttinted skirt was no fuller than was necessary but eleanor could afford to wear it so for both in man and woman the average western figure is modeled in long sweeping lines and the soft fabric emphasized her dainty slenderness the paleblue blouse that hung in filmy lacelike folds heightened the color of her eyes and the clear pallor of her ivory complexion eleanor was in fact quite satisfied with her appearance and aware that it suggested a puritanical simplicity which was in one respect at least not altogether misleading there is a certain absence of grossness in the men and women of the west and even their vices are characterized rather by daring than by materialistic sensuality she felt that she loathed the man and the part circumstances had forced on her while she dressed herself in expectation of his visit but for all that she was prepared to undertake it  and you are really thinking of going away she asked  carnforth did not answer hastily but looked at her with the little sparkle growing plainer in his eyes while he appeared to reflect and though there was nothing to suggest that she was doing so eleanor listened intently as she marshaled all her forces for the task she had in hand the afternoon was hot and still and she could hear forster and his hired man chopping in the bush the thud of their axes came faintly out of the shadowy woods but there was no other sound and the house was very quiet this was reassuring for she had no wish to hear mrs forsters footsteps just then at last her companion spoke  yes he said i have been thinking over it for some time in fact i should have gone before only i couldnt quite nerve myself to it i guess i neednt tell you why i found that difficult  eleanor laughed then if you dont wish to why go away at all  i think it would be nicer to tell you why i wish to stay  well said eleanor thoughtfully i almost fancy you have suggested your reasons once or twice already still its evident they cant have very much weight with you or you wouldnt go  carnforth leaned forward anyway my reasons for going would have some weight with most men  then until i hear what they are you are on your defense said eleanor with a smile that set his blood tingling in the meanwhile i am far from pleased with you it is not flattering to find one of my friends so anxious to get away from me  that was by no means what i was contemplating said the man and there were signs of strain in his voice while a trace of darker color crept into his face i guess you know it too  ah said eleanor why should you expect me to it wouldnt be reasonable in the circumstances i was willing to allow you to excuse yourself for wishing to go away and you dont seem at all anxious to profit by my generosity  you mightnt find my reasonstheyre rather material onesinteresting  then you are still on your defense and far from being forgiven as a matter of fact i am interested in almost everything as you ought to know by this time  i believe you are and carnforth made her a little inclination i guess you understand almost everything too well it seems i have to tell you  eleanor displayed no eagerness though she was sensible of a little thrill of satisfaction for the thing was becoming easier than she had expected instead she moved with a slow gracefulness in her low chair so that the narrow ray of sunlight which shone in between the halfclosed shutters fell on one cheek and delicate ear she knew that the pose she had fallen into was one that became her well and would in all probability have its effect on her companion and she meant to make the utmost of her physical attractiveness though such a course was foreign to her nature eleanor wheelock was imperious and it pleased her to command instead of allure but she could on due occasion hold her pride in check and she would not have disdained to use any wile just then it was with perfect composure that she watched the little glow kindle in carnforths eyes though she could have struck him for it  there is no compulsion she said indifferently it rests with yourself  carnforth laughed in a fashion that jarred on her the fact that you wish it goes a long way with me well i am a man with somewhat luxurious tastes which the money i possess would unfortunately not continue to gratify unless i keep it earning something that is what induced me to take a share in one or two of merrils ventures and now makes it advisable for me to leave him if i elect to remain i must put more money into the concern than i consider wise  then merrils affairs are not prospering  no said the man with a keen glance at her i believe you are as aware of that as i am one way or another you have extracted a good deal of information out of methe kind in which women arent generally interested i dont know why you have done so  i think i told you that i am interested in everything you dont feel warranted in handing the money over to merril  carnforth shook his head the pulpmill hit us hard but before he quite knew that we would have to make the wagonroad he had bound himself to take over the steamer we are sending up with the miners he said she cost him a good deal  still freights and passage to the north are high  they wont continue to be when the cpr and other people put on modern and economical boats it is quite clear to me that merrils boat cant make a living when she has to run against them  eleanor decided to change the subject for a while though she had not done with it yet well she said languidly i really dont think it matters to me whether she does or not what i gave you permission to do was to defend yourself for wishing to go away  havent i done it asked the man when i break with merril i shall naturally have to discover a new field for my abilities i think it will be in california  you are going to break with him because he is saddled with an unprofitable vessel now there are tides and fogs and reefs up there in the north dont they sometimes lose a wellinsured steamer  carnforth laughed but the girl had seen him start well he said i dont mind admitting that if the one in question went north some day and didnt come back again it would be a relief to one or two of us still im most afraid thats too fortunate a thing to happen  of course there would always be a probability of the skippers demanding money afterward besides a mate or quartermaster or somebody who hadnt a hand in it might have his suspicions  the man gazed at her and this time his astonishment at her perspicacity was very evident for a moment a wise man wouldnt tamper with the skipper anyway the people who try to get their money back by means of that kind most always involve themselves in difficulties  it cost eleanor an effort to conceal her satisfaction little by little she had to an extent her companion did not realize extracted from him information that enabled her to understand the state of merrils affairs tolerably accurately and she had decided that he would attempt some daring and drastic remedy now her purpose was accomplished for she knew what that remedy would be and it only remained for her to determine whether carnforth could be used as a weapon against his associate or must be flung aside the latter course was the one she would prefer and she decided on it since he had practically answered the question  so you are going to leave him now that he is in difficulties she said with a sardonic smile it isnt very generous but i suppose its wise and i almost think you have cleared yourself would you mind looking whether you can see mrs forster  he had served his purpose and she was anxious to get rid of him but the man made no sign of moving  i would mind just now and i hope shell stay away he said the fact is i have something to say to you and dont know why i let you switch me off on to merril his affairs cant concern you  then why did you tell me so much about them  the man gazed hard at her in evident bewilderment and then rose to his feet with a little air of resolution im not to be driven away from the point again i told you why i have to go but that is less than half of it i cant go alone i want you to come with me  ah said the girl very quietly though a red spot which her brother and jordan would have recognized as a warning showed in each cheek this is unexpected  carnforth crossed the room and leaned on a table not far from her chair looking down at her with a look from which she shrank  no he said i dont think its unexpected you knew what i meant from the beginning  this was as a matter of fact correct but the color grew plainer in eleanors cheek she had known exactly what her companions advances were worth and at times it had cost her a strenuous effort to hold her anger in check it was however characteristic of her that she had made the effort  after that i think it would save both of us trouble if you understood once for all that i will not go she said  carnforth laughed harshly while his face flushed with illsuppressed passion pshaw you dont mean it for several months you have led me on and now that im yours altogether im not going to california without you you know that too you have to go  you have had your answer and eleanor rose and faced him with portentous quietness dont make me say anything more  the man moved forward suddenly and laid a hot grasp on her wrist there was as yet no dismay in his face and it was very evident that he would not believe her there were excuses for him and the fact that it was so roused the girl who remembered what her part had been to almost uncontrollable anger  you are going to say that you are willing and coming with me if i have to make you he said fiercely i mean just that and i am not afraid of you though at times one can see something in your eyes that would scare off most men its there now but its one of the things that make me want you eleanor put an end to this you know you have me altogetherisnt that enough do you want to drive me mad  he stopped a moment and broke into a harsh laugh as the girl with a strength he had not looked for shook off his grasp oh he said it seems ive gone on too fast ill fix about the wedding soon as i break with merril  there was certainly something in eleanor wheelocks eyes just then that few people would have cared to face the vindictive hatred she bore merril had for the time being driven every womanly attribute out of her but she remembered how she had loathed this mans advances and endured them to carry out her purpose she would indeed have stooped to anything for her hatred had possessed her wholly and altogether now it was momentarily turned on her companion  it would have been wiser if you had made that clear first she said with a slow incisiveness that made the words cut like the lash of a whip still i suppose the offer is generous in view of the trouble you would very probably bring on yourself by attempting to carry it out  the man appeared staggered for a moment but he recovered himself  well he said with a little forceful gesture there are parts of my record i cant boast about but there are points on which youd go way beyond me that i guess is what got hold of me and wont let me go by the lord eleanor nothing would be impossible to you and me if we pulled together  that will never happen said the girl still with a very significant quietness dont force me to speak too plainly  carnforth appeared bewildered for at last he was compelled to recognize that she meant what she said but there was anger in his eyes  well he said stupidly what in the name of wonder did you want you know you led me on  perhaps i did now that i know what you are i tell you to go had you been any other man i might have felt some slight compunction or at least a little kindliness toward you as it is i am only longing to shake off the contamination you have brought upon me  she broke off with a little gesture of relief and moving toward the window flung the shutters back  they have finished chopping and i hear the oxteam in the bush she said forster will be here in a minute or two  carnforth stood still irresolute though his face was darkly flushed and eleanor felt the silence become oppressive as she wondered whether the rancher would come back to the house or lead his team on into the bush then the trample of the slowly moving oxens feet apparently reached her companion for with a little abrupt movement he took up his wide hat from the table he waited a few moments however crumpling the brim of it in one hand while eleanor was conscious that her heart was beating unpleasantly fast as she watched for the first sign of forster or his hired man among the dark firtrunks at last she heard her companion move toward the door and when it swung to behind him she drew in her breath with a gasp of relief     chapter xxvii  jordans scheme   carnforth had been gone some twenty minutes when eleanor stood among the orchard grass from which the ranks of blackened firstumps rose outside the ranch she had recovered her composure and was looking toward the dusty road which wound a sinuous white ribbon between the somber firs jordan whom she had not expected to see just then was walking along it with forster and since it was evident that he must have met carnforth she was wondering with a somewhat natural shrinking from doing so how far it would be necessary to take him into her confidence this as she recognized must be done eventually but she was not sure that her legitimate lover would be in a mood to understand or appreciate her course of action when fresh from a meeting with the one she had discarded jordan had laid very little restraint upon her but he was after all human and had a temper  she lost sight of the two men for a few minutes when they passed behind a great colonnade of firtrunks that partly obscured her view of the road but she could see them plainly when they emerged again from the shadow instead of turning toward the house they came toward her and there was she noticed a curious red mark on jordans cheek as well as a broad smear of dust on his soft hat which appeared somewhat crushed his attire was also disordered and his face was darker in color than usual forster who walked a pace or two behind him because the path through the grass was narrow also appeared disturbed in mind and when they stopped close by the girl it was he who spoke first  i had gone down the road to see whether there was any sign of mrs forster when i came upon mr jordan and considering how he was engaged it is perhaps fortunate that i did he said although it is not exactly my business i cant help fancying that you have something to say to him  he went on but he had said enough to leave eleanor with a tolerably accurate notion of what had happened and to make it clear that he was not altogether pleased the rancher and his wife were easygoing kindly people with liberal views but it was evident that their toleration would not cover everything then she turned to jordan who stood looking at her steadily with a certain hardness in his face and the red mark showing very plainly on his cheek  well she said how did you get here  on my feet said jordan there was little to do this afternoon in the city and two or three things were worrying me it struck me that id walk it off and im glad i did  ah said eleanor wont you go on a little  its what i mean to do i met carnforth driving away from here and since the fact that he has been here quite often has been troubling me lately i invited him to pull up right away when he didnt do it i managed to get hold of the horses heads and went right across the road with them still i stopped the team and i was getting up to talk to carnforth when forster came along i hated to see him then  somewhat to his astonishment eleanor laughed softly forster persuaded you to abandon thediscussion  he did if theres a split up the back of my jacket as i believe there is he made it anyway he wasnt quite pleased and i dont blame him he and his wife have let you do most whatever you like but after all you couldnt expect them to put up with everything  or expect too much from you you feel you have borne a good deal charley well forster was right in one respect we have something to say to each other and it may take a little time there is a big fir he has just chopped yonder  she walked slowly toward the fallen tree and seated herself on a great branch before she turned to the man who was about to take a place beside her  no she said you can stand there charley where i can see you to commence with how much confidence have you in me  all that a man could have and there was no doubt about jordans sincerity still i dont like carnforth hes not fit for you to talk to and i cant have him coming here in fact ill see that he doesnt ive wanted to say this for quite a while but it would have pleased me better to say it first to him thats one reason why i feel its particularly unfortunate forster didnt stay away a minute or two longer  a faint tinge of color crept into eleanors cheek but she looked at him with a smile  charley she said i am a little sorry too that forster came along when he did i dont know that its what every girl would say but i think if you had thrashed that man to within an inch of his life it would have pleased me  she stopped for a moment and the color grew a trifle plainer in her face though there was no wavering in her gaze i want you to understand that i knew just what that man wasand still i led him on it is a little hard to speak of but one has to be honest and when it is necessary i think both of us can face an unpleasant thing well i encouraged him because i couldnt see how i was to attain my object any other way still you mustnt suppose it cost me nothing it hurt all the timehurt me horriblyand now i almost feel that i shall never shake off the contamination  the man who did not know yet what her purpose was realized that the task she had undertaken must have heavily taxed her strength and courage he knew that she was vindictive and one who was not addicted to counting the cost but he also knew that there was a certain puritanical pride in her which must have rendered the part she had played almost insufferably repulsive his face burned as he thought of it and he drew in his breath with a curious little gasp while he gazed at her with a look in his eyes that sent a thrill of dismay through her  oh she said dont ask charley i couldnt bear that from you ii kept him at a due distance all the time  jordans tense face relaxed i cant forgive forster for coming along when he did he said eleanor you have courage enough for anything in one way it isnt natural  you have felt that now and then  the man said nothing for almost a minute for he was still a little shaken by what she had told him it had roused him to fierce resentment and brought the blood to his face but he now recognized that there were respects in which the momentary dismay of which he had been sensible was groundless she had given him sympathy and encouragement freely and at times had shown him a certain halfreserved tenderness but very little more and he felt that it should have been quite clear to him that she had unbent no further toward the stranger then he straightened himself as he looked at her  my dear he said i neednt tell you there is nobody on this earth i would place beside you  eleanor smiled wistfully ah she said i like to hear you say that though it is of course foolish of you and perhaps i shall change and be gentler and more like other women some day still that wouldnt be advisable just now we must wait and in the meanwhile there are other things to think of listen for a minute and you will understand why i led carnforth on he is of course never coming here again  she told him quietly all she had heard respecting merrils affairs and when at last she stopped jordan made an abrupt gesture  its a pity i cant act upon what you have told me he said  you cant act upon it  no said jordan firmly you should never have done itit cost you too much oh i know the shame and humiliation it must have brought you you cant make things like these counters in a business deal  you must and eleanors eyes grew suddenly hard again is all i have gained by doing what i loathed to be thrown away listen charley i loved my father and looked up to him until merril laid a trap for him then he went downhill and i had to watch his courage and control being sapped away he lost it all and his manhood too and died crazed with rank whisky  she rose and stood very straight pale in face and quivering a little could anything ever drive out the memory of that horrible night you could hardly bear what had to be done and you can fancy what it must have been to mewho loved him can i forgive the man who brought that on him  jordan shivered a little with pity and horror as the scene in the room where the burned man gasped out his life in an extremity of pain rose up before him then he was conscious that eleanor had recovered herself and was looking at him steadily  charley she said you must stand by me in this or go away and never speak to me again there is no alternative only support me now and afterward i will obey you for the rest of our lives  the man realized that she meant it and though it cost him an effort he made a sign of resignation  then he said it must be as you wish and i guess after what you have told me we hold merril in our hand that is if jimmy and i can do our part  both of them had felt the tension and now that it had slackened they said nothing for several minutes as they walked toward the house then eleanor turned to her companion  i am glad i can depend on you she said when the pinch comes jimmy will fail us  jimmy said jordan quietly is your brother as well as my friend  ah said eleanor dont misunderstand jimmy would flinch from nothing on a steamers bridge still it isnt nerve of that kind that will be needed and miss merril has a hold on him  jordan saw the faint sparkle in her eyes after all you cant hold the girl responsible for her father  i do said eleanor with a curious bitter smile at least i would keep her away from jimmy  jordan said nothing but there was trouble in his face for he had seen how things were going and though he was eleanors lover he was jimmys friend when they reached the ranch they found that mrs forster had come back and she glanced at jordan with a smile in her eyes when he crossed the room  do you know that you have split your jacket up the back she asked  jordan looked reproachfully at forster well he said i almost think that your husband does  then he will lend you another one while i sew it for you  one would fancy that eleanor would prefer to do it said the rancher dryly  his wife pursed up her face it is possible that she may bring herself to do such things by and by still i cant quite imagine eleanor quietly sitting down and mending a mans clothes  jordan laughed its quite likely that shell have to it depends on how the shasta pleases the miners forster ill trouble you to lend me a jacket i guess you owe it to me  forster promised to get him the garment and when they went away together his wife asked eleanor a plain question or two it was some time before she said anything to her husband about that interview but she appeared somewhat thoughtful until supper was brought in shortly after it was over jordan who borrowed a horse from forster rode away and the rancher who was sitting on the veranda smiled at his wife when eleanor walked back from the sliprails toward the house  well he said reflectively though im rather fond of miss wheelock i cant help thinking that jordan is an unusually courageous man it is fortunate that he is so considering everything  mrs forster flashed a keen glance at him but it said a good deal for her capability of keeping a promise that she contented herself with a simple question  why she asked  he expects to marry her said forster dryly  in the meanwhile jordan was riding down the dusty road and thinking out a scheme which though he had been reluctant to adopt it in the first case was now commencing to compel his attention as the result of this he spent most of the evening in certain secondrate saloons where sailormen and wharfhands congregated which though he had been well acquainted with such places in his struggling days was a thing he had not done for several years however he came across one or two men there who while they were probably not aware of it gave him a little useful information and he had a project in his mind when he went on board the shasta on the following morning she was then in the hands of the shipcarpenters for although the treasureseekers in their haste to reach the auriferous north would if necessary have gone in a canoe it was evident that the shasta company must offer them at least some kind of shelter in view of the opposition of larger vessels jordan also knew that niggardliness is not always profitable and the new passenger deck that was being laid along the beams was well planned and comfortable he drew jimmy into the room beneath the bridge and taking out his cigarcase laid it on the table  take one we have got to talk he said now the shastas out after money and it most seems to me that merril is going to have an opportunity for providing some of it you dont know any reason why you shouldnt get what he screwed out of your father and perhaps a little more out of him  no said jimmy grimly though there was a shadow on his face i could find a certain pleasure in making him feel the screw in turn  then ill show you how it can be done but first of all well go back a little merril has had to make the road to his pulpmill and its costing him and the other men a lot of money his particular share is quite a big one then hes saddled with an oldtype steamer that cant be run economically and as you know well have to come down in freight and passage rates now that the other people are putting on new boats besides carnforth who was to take a big share in the concern is going to leave him  how do you know that  jordan hesitated for a moment well he said i do and thats about all i mean to tell you anyway ive cause for believing that merril is tightly fixed for money and cant lay his hands on it there are reasons why he couldnt let up on the pulpmill if he wanted still there is one way he could get the money and that is by making the underwriters who hold the steamboat covered provide it  ah said jimmy it wouldnt be very difficult either  his companion smiled dryly i have a notion how she is insured and so far as i can gather its under an economical policy underwriters face total constructive loss but dont stand in for minor damage or salvage well ive ground for believing the thing is to be done by the engineer and he is a man who has to do just what merril tells him you and fleming could figure out how he will probably manage but one thing is clear when that steamboats engines give out you have got to be somewhere round to salve her  you are sure of this asked jimmy what makes you so  jordan did not answer him for a moment and once more there was hesitation in his manner  well he said that is my affair and ive been worrying over it quite a while now anyway i think its a sure thing  what do you purpose if i salve that steamer and we find anything wrong on board her  in that case im not sure the salvage will content the shasta company its admissible to break your trading opponent as i tried to show you merrils tightly fixed and while the mans quite clever enough to wriggle loose it will be our business to see that he doesnt  jimmy sat still for a few moments with trouble in his face which was hard and grim until his comrade turned to him again  jimmy he said quietly that man had no pity on your father the thing has to be done and the shasta company stood by you we have got to have that salvage and youre not going to go back on us now  jimmy stood up and straightened himself in a curious slow fashion no he said im with you as you say the thing has to be doneand it naturally falls to me well though itll probably cost me a good deal im ready when do you expect him to try it  i dont quite knowyou couldnt expect me to still i should figure it wont be until she goes north after the layoff in spring guess hell hold on as long as he can freights wont drop much before then  he rose and laid his hand on his comrades shoulder as they went out i think i understand how you are fixed but you have to face it he went on theres another thing i want to mention if you can get hold of merrils engineer and scare him into some admission     chapter xxviii  disabled engines   spring had come and all down the wild west coast the tall pines had shaken off their load of snow and the rivers were thundering in their misty cañons but there was very little sign of it at sea when one bitter morning a cluster of deeply bronzed men hung about the adelaides engineroom skylights they were lean and somewhat grim of face as well as ragged and suggestively spare of frame for they had borne all that man may bear and live through during the winter they had spent in the icebound wilderness now they were going back to civilization with many ounces of gold and papers relating to auriferous claims to invoke the aid of capital before they once more turned their faces toward the frozen north  it was noticeable that although they were of widely different birth and upbringing there was the same stamp which revealed itself in a certain quietness of manner and steadiness of gaze upon them all for these were the pick of the mining community men who had grappled with the wilderness in its most savage moods long before they blazed a new trail south from the wilds of the yukon they had proved their manhood by coming back at all for that winter the unfit had died still though they had endured things beyond the comprehension of the average city man they were glad of the shelter of the tall skylights because the adelaides flush deck was swept by a stinging wind and little showers of bitter spray blew all over it she was rolling viciously across a waste of grayblue sea which was flecked by livid froth and her mastheads swung in a wide sweep athwart a sky of curious dingy blue there was no warmth anywhere in the picture and apparently very little light but for all that every sea stood out from its fellows and those back in the clear distance were etched upon the indented horizon with harsh distinctness one of the men shook his head as he gazed at them  they look like the pines on the ridge did the day the blizzard struck us down on the assiniboia creek he said it was a fullpowered one the boys whod camped ahead of us were frozen stiff by morning the two we scraped the snow off were sitting there like statues and we didnt worry bout the others there was ten feet over them anyway ive no use for this kind of weather  one of his companions swept his glance astern toward the smear of smoke on the serrated skyline which was blotted out next moment when the adelaide swung her stern aloft  if youre right in your figuring im glad i came along in this boat he said anyway shes bigger though i most took my berth in the shasta seems to me were quite a long while getting away from her  the others agreed with him for they had seen that smear of smoke on the skyline since early morning then they turned to watch the engineer who came out of a door close by and glanced up to weather blinking in the bitter wind he was a big looselybuilt man in dungarees with the pallid face of one accustomed to the halflight and heat of the engineroom but in his case it was also unhealthily puffy then he slouched right aft and stood still again looking down at the dial of the taffrail log which records the distance run while he fumbled in a curious aimless fashion with the blackened rag in his hand  that said one of the miners is a man im no way stuck on now youll most times find hard grit in an engineer but this one kind of strikes me as feeling that there was something after him he was scared of  well said one of the others reflectively its not an uncommon thing there was a man down on the flat where we struck it who had a kind of notion that there were three big timber wolves on his trail kept his rifle clean with the magazine ram full for them but one night they got him a sure thing tom was there  the man at whom he glanced nodded now and then i wish i hadnt been he said lister was sitting very sick beside his fire that night said he heard those wolves pattering in the bushthere were thick pines all round usmost made me think i did  well said one of his companions  the miner made a little expressive grimace longest night i ever put in sat there and kept them off him anyway i tried but he was dead at sunup  none of the others showed any astonishment and the man who had asked the question glanced back toward the engineer  guess the man who runs this steamboat should be getting rich by the way they strike you for a drink he said im bringing down most two hundred ounces but i wouldnt like to fill that engineer up at the tariff  never saw him making a traverse anyway he walks quite straight said a comrade  well said the other ive seen his eyes  just then the man they were discussing turned toward the bridge from which the skipper was beckoning him a minute or two later they went into the room beneath it and the engineer sat down looking at the man in front of him with narrow halfopen eyes the latter was young and spruce in trim uniform a man of no great education who had a favorable opinion of himself  cant you shove her along a little faster robertson he said well be thirty knots behind our usual run at noon  no said the engineer in a curious listless drawl ive been letting the revolutions down that highpressure pistons getting on my nerves again  shouldnt have thought you had any worth speaking of said the skipper with a quick sign of impatience you give one the impression that theyve gone to pieces long ago take a drink and tone them up  he flung a bottle on the table and watched his companions long greasy fingers fumble at it with a look of disgust robertson halffilled his glass with the yellow spirit and drained it with slow enjoyment then he breathed hard and leaning his elbows on the table looked at the skipper heavily  well he said you want something  i do said the skipper and taking down a chart unrolled one part of it i want to shake her up until we get away from the shasta for one thing wheelock has been hanging on to us as far as his boats speed will allow it the last two or three runs i cant quite figure what hes after  robertson looked almost startled for a moment as though an unpleasant thought had occurred to him but his heavy puffy face sank into its usual lethargicness again  wants to scoop your passengers done it once or twice he said well  for another thing i want to get round this nest of islands before the breeze thats brewing comes down on us it will be a snorter if i were surer of yourold engines id try the inside passage though the tides run strong now if i head her up well clear of the islands im throwing miles away and letting the shasta in ahead of me wheelock has apparently an engineer who will stand by him  again a curious furtive look that suggested uneasiness crept into robertsons eyes  hes always just ahead or just astern and weve altered our sailing bill twice he said as if communing with himself  i guess you dropped on the reason anyway if you can give me a little more steam well be clear of this unhallowed conglomeration of reefs and tides by this time tomorrow if its necessary you can run her easier afterward  robertson laid a grimy finger on the chart shell be feeling the indraught nowits running ebb he said if i can read the weather youll soon have the breeze strong on your starboard bow  the skipper flung a swift glance at him in which there was a trace of astonishment howd you come to know just where she is  taffrail log said robertson i generally run a rough reckoning in my head well you want another knot or two out of her until you have the big bight to lee of you see what i can do though id sooner take a knot off her that highpress pistons worrying me  he jerked himself heavily to his feet and when he shambled out of the room the skipper who made a little gesture of relief took up his dividers and laid their points on the chart one of them rested in the middle of the mark left by the engineers greasy finger after that he rolled the chart up and stowed it away from the others in a drawer beneath his berth and the look of annoyance in his face had its significance he did not like his engineer and although he had no particular reason for distrusting him he remembered that when the latter had found it necessary to stop his engines at sea as he had done once or twice during the last trip or two it had generally been in the last spot a nervous skipper would have desired then he went out and climbed to his bridge  you can head her out two points more to westward he said to the mate  very good said the latter still we decided that the course she was on would keep her off the land  we did said the skipper dryly anyway youll head her out were going to have a wicked breeze from the west before this time tonight  in the meanwhile the second engineer was leaning out from a slippery platform that swung and slanted as the adelaide lurched over the long gray seas listening to the dull pounding of the highpressure engine his face was as near as he could get it to the big cylinder and after glancing at a little glass tube he looked down at a man with a tallow swab who clung to the iron ladder beneath him  i dont like the way shes slamming jake he said theres mighty little oil going into her either whos been throttling up the feed  the chief said the man on the ladder he was slinging it redhot at charley bout heaving oil away guess id have fed it to her by the gallon after seeing that new pistonring sprung on  the second pursed up his face for there is an etiquette in these affairs at sea which the man who had come there fresh from a sawmill apparently did not understand well he said i guess mr robertson bossed the putting in of that ring and he knows his business anyway if he tells you you will run her dry  then a big looselyhung figure came shambling down the ladder and the second withdrew however he stood among the columns below and watched his superior stop and glance at the tube through which the oil flowed before he went about his work again robertson was apparently satisfied and after slouching round the engineroom and unscrewing a little further the throttle valve which turns steam on to the engines he crawled back to his greasy room he sloughed off his jacket and boots and drawing a bottle from beneath the mattress of his bunk poured himself a stiff drink of whisky before he stretched himself out  he slept soundly and did not hear the roar of the engines below him when the adelaide flung her stern out and the lifted screw whirred madly in the air the thud of green water on her deck passed unheeded too though the second heard it as he watched the maze of clanking banging steel until the young third relieved him the latter came down dripping and shook a little shower of brine off him when he stopped beside his superior  its blowing quite fresh and she seems to be plugging it mighty hard since you shook her up he said the chief must have given up worrying about that piston or he wouldnt have had you take the extra knot or two out of her  keep your eye on thething said the second its going to make us trouble yet if i were boss of this job id slow her down right now instead of pressing her  he went up and also went to sleep and since the telegraph stood at fullspeed ahead the young third clung to a greasy rail all eyes and ears with one hand on the gear that would throttle down the steam while the rolling grew more vicious and the plunges steeper quick as he was there was a thunderous clamor every now and then as the big compound engines which were twice the size of those of a modern boat of equal tonnage ran away and he commenced to long for the close of his watch while the perspiration dripped from him he had not been very long at sea and there is a responsibility upon the man on watch when the whirring screw swings clear at last there was a heavier plunge than usual and though the third did all he could the big engines span and clamored furiously as the stern went up then there was a harsh grinding scream and a crash after that came sudden stillness and the third frantically span the wheel that cut off the steam while grimy men went sliding and floundering over the slippery plates and platforms toward the highpressure engine  the sudden portentous silence and the roar of blownoff steam that followed it roused every man on board the ship and robertson crawled sluggishly out of his berth he had reasons for knowing exactly what had happened and he showed no sign of haste but there was a furtive look in his eyes and he sat on the ledge of the bunk shivering a little while he thrust his hand beneath the mattress again he felt that he needed bracing for he had once spent several anxious hours in a halfswamped lifeboat after the steamer to which it belonged had gone ashore and he was aware that somebody is usually held accountable for mishaps at sea there was not very much left in the whiskeybottle when he thrust it out of sight again and shambled out of his room the adelaide was rolling viciously and when he reached the engineroom he came near falling down the slippery ladder indeed most men would have gone down it headlong if they had braced themselves as he had done but habitual caution made him feel for a good hold and he descended safely to where his subordinates were clustered beneath the highpressure cylinder their faces showed tense and anxious in the flickering light of the lamps which swung wildly as the steamer rolled and the young third engineer hastily related what had brought about the stoppage  rig the lifting tackles while she cools said robertson get the studnuts loose well have the cover off soon as we can  then he turned and saw as he had partly expected a quartermaster standing just inside the door above him and with a word or two to his second he crawled back up the ladder and went with the man to the room beneath the bridge the young skipper who stood there with a furrowed face regarded him grimly  how long are you going to be before you start her again he asked  robertson blinked at him with furtive halfopen eyes i dont quite knowits a heavy job we have to heave the piston up he said besides that she has knocked things loose below  the skipper appeared to have some difficulty in restraining himself  unless you can get steam on her in the next few hours shell be breaking up by morning the reefs to lee of us are not the kind of ones id like to put a steamer ashore on either  then he took a bottle from a drawer with a little grimace of disgust for he remembered that skippers are comparatively plentiful and the man he could scarcely keep his hands off was for some reason apparently a favorite with his employer  oh take a drink and hump yourself he said i guess thats the only thing to put a move on you  robertson hesitated for a moment for he realized that he had still a part to play then it occurred to him that his companion might draw his own conclusions as to his reasons for any unusual abstemiousness and he helped himself liberally  well he said when he had drained his glass ill be getting back again do what i canbut its a heavy job  he shuffled out but his potations were commencing to have their effect and when he reached the top platform in the engineroom he felt carefully for the rail that sloped as a guide to the ladder it was as usual greasy and robertsons grip not particularly sure while the adelaide rolled wickedly to lee just then as the result of it her engineer went down the ladder much as a sack of coal would have done and fell in a limp heap on the floorplates with a red gash on his head the second stooped down and shook him before he turned to the other men  heave him on to the tool locker one or two of you he said we cant pack him up to his room with this job in front of us see if you can fix that cut for him varney and then go up and tell the skipper  a man went up the ladder and the skipper who sent an urgent message back with him turned to the little cluster of miners who were waiting about his room  something wrong with the engines asked one  there is said the skipper who knew his men and would not have admitted to the ordinary run of passengers what he did to them it will probably be some hours before they start again and the shores not very far away to lee if you feel inclined to lend a hand at getting sail on her i guess it would be advisable  the miners were willing and set about it cheerfully though it was blowing hard now and the long deck heaved and slanted under them there is very seldom an unnecessary man on board a steamer and the adelaides mate was glad of a few extra strong arms just then that they were drenched with bitter spray and occasionally flung against winch and bulwarks did not greatly trouble them things of that kind did not count after facing the wild turmoil of northern rivers and living through destroying hazes of blizzarddriven snow so they got the canvas on her forestaysail gaffheaded foresail mainstaysail and a blackened threecornered strip abaft the mainmast and the skipper felt a trifle easier when he found that he could steer her she crawled through the water at perhaps two knots an hour dragging her idle screw but she also drove to leeward nearer the deadly reefs     chapter xxix  under compulsion   it was in the gray of the morning when jimmy saw her a dim patch of hull and four strips of sail that heaved and dipped between the seas he also saw the faint loom of land behind her and turned to lindstrom who stood beside him with a grim smile  i think we can make our own terms today he said she wouldnt be there with those reefs to lee of her if her engines hadnt broken down will you ask the bosn to have a board ready and a brushful of white lead  then he turned to the man in oilskins who held the steering wheel hard over run her right down on them  the shastas bows came round and the light was growing clearer when she lay with engines stopped as close to windward of the adelaide as jimmy dared venture the latter crawled ahead sluggishly heaving her bows up streaming out of the long seas that fell away beneath a high wall of slanted iron hull until the blackened strips of sailcloth swung wildly back again then her tall side sank down until the line of rail was level with the brine a couple of shapeless oilskinned figures clung to her slanted bridge with the spray whirling about them and ragged wisps of cloud drove fast across the low and dingy sky overhead  jimmy watched her with eyes halfclosed to keep the spray out which had a portentous glint in them this was a moment for which he had waited long months and now his turn had come if jordan were rightand the fact that the adelaide was there to leeward of him with engines useless certainly suggested ithe had only to play his cards well and deal the man who had ruined his father a crushing blow he set his lips tight as he remembered that when it fell the mans daughter must bear it too for he was bound by every honorable tie to do what he could for the men who had entrusted him with the shasta that fact he felt must stand first with him but he was also a seaman and could not stand by while a costly vessel drove ashore as the result of an infamous conspiracy while he waited grimfaced with his wet hand clenched on the telegraph a string of flags fluttered up between the other steamers masts and he laughed harshly as he turned to lindstrom who had come up again with a brush and a strip of board  thats quite plain without the code he said engines given out and hes open for a tow well he shall have it on conditions closer quartermaster lindstrom hold the board for me  he painted his answer neatly in big bold letters and when he had pressed down his telegraph flung up an arm for a sign to the cluster of very wet men below  look at this thing and remember it he shouted hold it up before you hang it out lindstrom  the mate did as he was bidden and one or two of the men made a sign of comprehension for as all on board share in salvage they were keenly interested too then the quartermaster pulled over his wheel and the shasta crept ahead a little with a message hung outside her bridge rails  half your appraised value or the courts award  there was no answer for several minutes though the flags came fluttering down and then a thing happened that apparently strengthened jimmys hand which was as he alone knew a particularly strong one already a white streak appeared to leeward perhaps two miles away beneath the gray loom of land and it was evident that the adelaides skipper knew it was the filmy spray flung up by crumbling breakers two or three colored strips ran up between her masts again and the hard smile crept back into jimmys eyes  seems to fancy hell get off easier through the court he said to lindstrom well hes wrong but the first thing is to get their rope on board strip your lifeboat and get her clear  lindstrom bustled down the ladder and a handful of drenched men set about getting the boat out it was not an easy task for there were times when the shasta rolled her rail in and the boat swung in upon her deck as often as over the sea then she drove against the streaming plates with a crash and a big gray comber that swept round the shastas stern halffilled her as they lowered her with a run but the men dropped into her and she reeled clear with the oars splashing any way on the back of the next one jimmy set his lips as he watched her and pressing down his telegraph sent the shasta halfspeed ahead in a big sweep until she came up steaming dead slow once more under the adelaides lee he waited there ten anxious minutes until the boat drove down on him bringing a line with her  somehow they hove her in not greatly damaged and the rattling winch afterward hauled a big steel hawser across but the land was clearly visible a dark streak of rock that rose above a haze of flying spray when jimmy rang for fullspeed again he knew by the chart that it was an island of some extent with a wide sound between it and the next one where he might find shelter provided he could hold the adelaide off the rocks that long this however appeared very doubtful in the meanwhile for it was evident that the larger vessel was rapidly dragging him to leeward it was simply a question whether she would drive ashore before he towed her around the point he could dimly see on the contracted horizon but it was a somewhat momentous one if he failed the sea that spouted on the shoals would make short work of her  it became evident that there was a capable helmsman at the adelaides wheel for she crawled along well in line astern with but little of the wild sheering from the course which in such cases is apt to part the stoutest hawser but jimmy grew tensely anxious as the next hour slipped by the beach was rapidly growing plainer but the head beyond which there was shelter was still apparently a long way off and it was not an inviting prospect that unrolled itself to lee the gray rock smeared by the whiteness of flungup spray dropped sharply to the wide line of tumbling foam and above it lowflying shreds of cloud blurred the wisps of climbing trees still the head was rising all the time and the shastas engines pounding steadily except when her screw shot clear as it frequently did another hour went by and the tension grew worse to bear when a jagged and fissured slope of rock rose under their leebow scarcely half a mile away beyond it stretched a dim vista of more rock and reedy pines that shut in the sound  we could swing her in if there were no tide said jimmy harshly as it is the stream is setting us down on the point together but ill hold on until she strikes theres no use worrying fleming he cant do any more  lindstrom who glanced at the streak of flame in the dingy cloud that blew down from the slanted funnel made a sign of concurrence and jimmy gripped the bridge rails hard as he gazed ahead he could see the white smear of tideway that streamed around the head and the gray wall of rock seemed forging back toward him through the midst of it the sea hurled itself against its feet and crumbled into a white spouting and streaky wisps of foam that the stream swept away then he signed to the quartermaster and gripping the whistlelanyard flung out a sonorous blast of warning  the shastas bows swung seaward a little further and both vessels swept up the tideway toward the deadly slope of stone it crept a trifle aft from the leebow while a narrow strip of water opened up ahead and then jimmy held his breath as the adelaide took a sheer she swung off at a tangent rolling until a great slanted slope of rusty iron was clear on that side of her while the shastas poop was held down by the strain on the hawser a sea smote her on the weather side and veiled her in a cloud of flying spray but jimmy could dimly see a man flounder aft up to his knees in water with an axe on his shoulder it was not the instrument an engineer would have chosen for cutting hard steel wire but the axe is wonderfully effective in the hands of a canadian and the strain would part the rope if one strand were nicked this was also in accordance with lindstroms instructions but jimmy flung up a restraining hand  hold on he hurled his voice through hollowed hands drop thething if we cant swing her clear were going ashore with her  he forgot what he owed the shasta company and what anthea merril had said to him for the primitive man had come uppermost under the stress of conflict twining his hands in the whistlelanyard he hurled out a great blast that the rocks flung back through the turmoil of the tide and then once more gripped the bridge rails hard standing rigidly still with grim wet face and a light in his eyes for two more minutes the issue hung in the balance and then while a wider gap of water opened up ahead the adelaide swung back astern in a few moments there was a hoarse exultant clamor from both vessels and the frothswept rock slid away behind her in front lay a stretch of less troubled water half an hour later the shasta came around again in a big sweep and when the anchors went down the two vessels lay rolling uneasily in comparative shelter  another hour had passed when jimmy went off in the lifeboat and was greeted by a cluster of bronzed men who stood about the adelaides gangway and insisted on shaking hands with him some of them also pounded his shoulders with hard fists and though none of them expressed themselves very artistically jimmy understood what was implied by the offers of whisky that were thrust upon him the genuine prospector the man who as they say in that country gets there when he takes the goldtrail is as a matter of fact usually a somewhat abstemious person and particular as to whom he drinks with but these miners had made the shastas commander one of them and presented him with the freedom of the guild it was in some respects as great a cause for gratification as if he had been made companion of an ancient order for no man is admitted to that one who cannot prove that he possesses among other qualifications high courage and stubborn endurance their codes are not nicely formulated in the frozen wastes and the silent woods of the north but it is as a rule the great primitive essentials that advance a man in his comrades estimation there jimmy however waved the miners back  it ought to be quite clear boys that i cant drink with you all especially as ive business with the skipper he said anyway im pleased to feel i have your goodwill  they still hovered about him until the adelaides skipper drew him into his room and gravely shook hands with him  its not often boys of their kind make a fuss over any one but in this case the things quite natural he said i want to say first of all that were much obliged  then he emptied the contents of a locker on the table and they included a cigarcase and a couple of glasses which he filled well in one way you made a hard bargain with us but im not going to complain of that it was made and though i felt tolerably sure we were both going up on the head yonder you carried it out we owe you a little for hanging on to us  jimmy who sat down and took a cigar regarded him thoughtfully the man was he fancied opinionated and somewhat assertive but there was something in his manner which suggested that he was honest and therefore likely to resent having been unwittingly made merrils accomplice jimmy was far from being a genius but like a good many other quiet men whose conversation contains no hint of brilliancy he was at least as far from being a fool  how did you come to be where you were when we fell in with you he asked  that is very much the same thing as i meant to ask you  well said jimmy dryly i can account for it but ill hear what happened to you first  his companion told him and jimmy who watched him closely made up his mind as to the course he should adopt has it struck you that your engines couldnt well have given out at a more inconvenient time he asked  it naturally has and the skippers disgust and bitterness against his engineer were stronger than his prudence still what could you expect with a whiskytank of the kind ive got in charge below the thing has happened before  when there was a reef or a shoal close to lee  the sudden change in his companions expression had its significance and jimmy smiled suggestively now you were a little astonished to see me turn up just when i was wanted and you have probably noticed that i have been on your trail lately well supposing we put the two together what do you make of it  it had been little more than a chance shot for jimmy had clearly recognized that there was a certain probability of merrils skipper having acted in collusion with him but it reached its mark his companions face flushed darkly and he laid a clenched hand on the table  now he said sharply you have got to talk quite straight  i think i have done so do you suppose i should have lost a day or two every now and then and gone to sea before i was quite ready to keep close on your track without a reason  jimmys last uncertainty vanished as he watched his companion and he saw that the course he had taken was fully warranted merril it was evident had considered it safer not to tamper with his skipper perhaps because he shrank from giving two men a hold on him when the thing could be done by one who was in all probability to some extent already in his hands in any case the skippers face was hard with vindictiveness and a very unpleasant look crept into his eyes he was young and opinionated and he saw the pitfall that had been dug for him  i guess youre right he said hoarsely its not the first time my engineer has tried it he and the otherhog would have broken me  its scarcely likely they could have blamedyouat the inquiry in fact i fancy merril would have liked you held clear it would have made the thing look straighter  the skippers laugh was very grim it wouldnt have counted if they hadnt one thing would have been certaini was in command and that would have been quite enough to stop my getting another steamer its always somebody elses fault when you get a boat ashore  jimmy knew that his companion had reached the point to which he had been leading him well he said quietly the question is what do you purpose to do now  i mean to get even with the man who meant to break me back you up in all you say when you send in your salvage claim and in the meanwhile wring the whole thing out of thatwhiskytank below  he stopped a moment first of all i want to say im sorry i went by that day without answering your whistle merril had worked me up against you and since i get a bonus on results every dollars worth of freight you picked up was so much out of my pocket still youre not going to remember that against me now we both earn our bread at sea and you have to stand by me  jimmy nodded im willing he said hadnt you better send for your engineer  the skipper rose and opening the door called to a man outside i want mr robertson here he said if he isnt willing or fit to come you can drag him  the engineer arrived on his own feet and stood still leaning somewhat heavily on the table with one hand when the skipper closed the door behind him a curious furtive look of apprehension crept into his eyes when he heard the snap and jimmy glanced at him with a sense of disgust there was a dirty bandage around his head and his face showed baggy and pallid under it while his looselyhung figure draped in greasy serge seemed disproportionately large and clumsy in the little trim room there was also something in his attitude that vaguely suggested the viciousness of a rat in a trap and it was evident that he had been drinking hard of late  well he asked harshly what do you want  the adelaides skipper turned to jimmy this is captain wheelock of the shasta he and i have been comparing notes and the game you have been playing is quite clear to me if youre wise youll own up to it before we go any further in the first place what were you to get for casting this ship away  the man showed more courage than jimmy had expected from his appearance though it was clearly the courage of desperation he braced himself stiffly and his laugh was contemptuous i guess youre going to be sorry for this youve said it before a third party  ill say it before a magistrate in vancouver broke in the skipper but jimmy stopped him with a sign  i dont think what you asked him is very material he said reflectively in any case he wouldnt get very much mr merril is not the man to hand over money when it isnt necessary  he watched the man closely and it became evident to him that jordan had been warranted in the construction he had put on certain scraps of information picked up on the wharf and in the saloons of vancouver  i dont quite understand said the skipper  i think mr robertson does of course he couldnt well drop his name without invalidating his papers and after all it was probably safe to keep it since there are a good many robertsons and everybody would expect him to change it still i scarcely fancy he is aware that there are two men in vancouver who would swear to him with pleasure theyre firing sawmill boilers  the engineers jaw dropped and there was craven fear in his face but he seemed to pull himself together though jimmy noticed his glance toward the door  i dare say you can recall the oleander case he said she was a british ship and i dont know how mr robertson was able to slip out of portland quietly though since the fireman who was done to death on board her belonged to that city the boys along the wharves would have drowned him if they had got their hands on him  good lord said the skipper with a little gasp the man was slowly roasted then he swung around toward the engineer this is thebrute who did it  if youre not sure you can look at him  a glance was sufficient and the skipper had no time for another robertson turned swiftly in a frenzy of drinkbegotten rage and crazing fear and flung open the door then he stooped and before they quite realized his purpose whipped up the poker from the little stove and struck furiously at jimmys head jimmy throwing himself backward flung up his forearm and broke the full weight of the blow but it left him dazed and sick for a second or two and before the skipper could get around the little table robertson had swung out of the door a clamor broke out and men ran aft along the deck as he headed for the rail but as he laid his hands on it jimmy reeled out of the room beneath the bridge with the blood trickling down his face the engineer swung himself over and jimmy who shook off the skippers grasp sped aft with uneven strides and leaped from the taffrail  the cold of that icy water steadied him when he came up again and he saw that the stream of tide was carrying the other man down toward the shasta and strained every muscle to come up with him it was however five or six minutes before he did it and when robertson grappled with him they both went under jimmy waited knowing that they must come up again and when that happened there was a splash of oars close by then he struck with all his strength at a livid face and just as he felt himself being drawn down once more an oar grazed his head and a hand grabbed his shoulder  lay hold of him he gasped and the boat swayed down level with the water while he and robertson were dragged on board  keep still said somebody who struck the latter hard with the pommel of an oar  then jimmy scrambled to his feet with the water draining from him back to the adelaide he said as fast as you can  it was however half an hour later when robertson was once more thrust into the skippers room and collapsed with all the fight gone out of him on a settee he seemed to have fallen to pieces physically but it was evident that his mind was clear though there was now only abject fear in his eyes  well he said what do you want from me  jimmy still felt a trifle dazed and his head was throbbing painfully but he roused himself with an effort  ill tell you in a minute but first of all i should like you to realize how you stand he said the oleander is a british ship vancouver is a canadian town and if i put the police on to the two men i mentioned they will have a tolerably clear case against you you neednt expect anything from merril he will certainly go back on you  robertsons face grew vindictive he held the thing over me but we never meant to kill the man he tried to knife one of us and anyway it was his heart that made an end of him we didnt know until afterward that it was wrong but go on  well said jimmy dryly im not going to make a bargain with you but at the same time im not quite sure how far its my duty to work the case up for the police in the meanwhile i want a plain written statement as to your connection with merril  the man made a sign of acquiescence though there was malice in his eyes i can get even with him anyway and its a sure thing hed have sent me up out of the way if he could get me some paper  jimmy turned to the skipper call one of the prospectors we want an outsider to hear the thing  a miner was led in and robertson who had been handed pen and paper commenced to write the skipper read aloud what he had written and all of them signed it then jimmy put the document into his pocket and two seamen led the engineer to his room early next morning when the breeze had fallen a steward roused the skipper  i took in mr robertsons coffee but his room was empty he said  the skipper was on deck in a few minutes but there was nothing to show what had become of the engineer the adelaide had however now swung with her stern somewhat near the shore and a man who had kept anchor watch remembered having seen a big siwash canoe slipping out to sea a few hours earlier  there was a man in her who didnt look quite like an indian he said  well said the skipper dryly if hes drowned it wont matter anyway im not going to worry     chapter xxx  an eye for an eye   the shasta lay safely tied up to a buoy in vancouver inlet and a quartermaster stood at her gangway with instructions to see that no stranger got on board when jimmy sat talking to his sister and jordan in the room beneath her bridge it was an hour since she had steamed in and except for an occasional clinking in her engineroom where fleming was still busy there was silence on board her though the scream of saws and the rattle of freightcar wheels came off faintly across the still water the two ports were open wide but none of those who sat in the little room noticed that the light was fading jordan and eleanor were listening with close attention while jimmy concisely related how he had fallen in with and towed merrils steamer at last he broke off with an abrupt movement when a splash of oars grew louder  another boat he said well have every curious loafer in the city pulling off by and by  then the voice of the quartermaster reached them as he answered somebody who called to him from the approaching boat  no he said you cant see captain wheelockhes busy keep her off that ladder  there was evidently another question asked and the man answered impatiently i cant tell you anything about the adelaide cept that shes coming along under easy steam should be here in a day or two  jordan glanced at jimmy the men you brought down are talking already and we havent much time for fixing our program when do you expect her  i dont exactly know we came away before she did when the breeze fell but her second engineer seemed quite confident he could bring her along at seven or eight knots he wasnt sure whether his highpressure engine would stand anything more  then it was significant that both of them looked at eleanor who had insisted on coming with jordan and who was apparently waiting to take her part in the discussion one could have fancied from their faces that they would have preferred to be alone just then and were a trifle uneasy concerning the course their companion might think fit to pursue she leaned back in her chair watching them with a little hard smile which seemed to suggest that she knew what they were thinking still she said nothing and jordan spoke again  you are sure of the adelaides skipper and that miner fellow he asked they wouldnt go back on you if merril tried to buy them off  i think i can be sure of them said jimmy reflectively the skipper is not the kind of man i would take to but in some respects at least hes straight and anyway hes bitter enough against merril to back us in anything we may decide to do you see the man who gets his boat ashore is practically done for nowadays whether its his own fault or not and i fancy we can count on the miner too after what those fellows had to go through to get the gold they were bringing home theyre not likely to have much sympathy with merril in fact if the others understood how near they came to seeing it go down in the adelaide it would be a little difficult to keep them from laying hands on him in any case theres the engineers statementone cant get over that  eleanor stretched out her hand for the paper and there was a vindictive sparkle in her eyes as she glanced at it  charley she said with portentous quietness it seems to me that the possession of this document places merril absolutely in your hands you are not afraid to make the utmost use of it  jordan glanced at jimmy in a fashion the latter understood there was something deprecatory in it and it appeared to suggest that he wished his comrade to realize that he was under compulsion and could not help himself then he turned to the girl with a certain air of resolution  no he said i dont think i am afraid but i want you to understand that i am manager of the shasta company and have first of all to consider the interests of my associates the men who put their money into the concern there is jimmy too  jimmy and eleanor laughed a little bitter laugh which had a trace of contempt in it pshaw jimmys love affairs dont count now i think he feels that too after all there is a trace of our mothers temper in him if one can awaken it  she turned and looked at her brother who closed one hand tightly oh i know the girl has graciously condescended to smile on you and no doubt you are almost astonished as well as grateful that she should go so far still where did the money that made her a dainty lady of station come from must i tell you that a second time jimmy  she stopped a moment and gripped the paper hard in firm white fingers this is mine i bought it you know what it cost me charley and what has jimmy done in comparison with that do you think anything would induce me to spare merril now that i have this in my hands  jimmy looked up sharply and saw the flush of color in her cheek and that the blood had crept into his comrades face his own grew suddenly hot  ah he said with a thrill of anger in his voice i begin to understand she got the information you acted on out of that brute carnforth you knew that charley and youyou countenanced it  he half rose from his seat with a brown hand stretched out as if to tear the paper from the girl but while jordan swung around toward him eleanor laughed  sit down she said imperiously you simpleminded fool do you think i would let charleys opinion influence me in an affair of this kind  jordan made a gesture of resignation she would not he said thats the simple fact but go on eleanoror shall i tell him anyway it must be done  the girl silenced him and though the next two or three minutes were perhaps as unpleasant as any jimmy had ever spent in his life it was with a certain deep relief that he heard his sister out before she stopped she held up a white hand  once she said once only he held my wrist that was all jimmy but i feel it left a mark if it could be removed that way i would burn it out now you know what the thing cost mebut i did it  the men would not look at each other and if eleanor had left them then it would have been a relief to both her suppressed passion had stirred and shaken them and they realized that the efforts they had made were after all not to be counted in comparison with what the girl had done  it was jordan who spoke first well he said with the air of one anxious to get away from a painful subject we have got to be practical the question is how are we to strike merril seems to me in the first case well hand him a salvage claim ill fix it at half her value anyway and hell never fight us when he hears of the engineers statement so far as i know he cant recover under his policy and we could head him off from going to the underwriters if he can the next point isare the miner fellow and the adelaides skipper likely to take any independent action on their own account i dont think thats very probable  nor do i said jimmy it isnt wise of a skipper to turn around on a man like merril unless its in a court where he has the law behind him and the prospector would scarcely attempt to do anything alone besides without the document to produce they would have very little to go uponand what is more to the purpose both of them promised to let me handle the thing  jordan nodded as if satisfied that he said makes it easier were going to collect our money on the salvage claim and when merril has raised it hell have strained his resources so he wont count very much as an opponent of the shasta company the mans crippled already  the fact that his comrade was apparently not desirous of proceeding to extremities afforded jimmy a vast relief but it vanished suddenly when eleanor broke in  cant you understand that the affair must be looked at from another point of view as well as the commercial one she asked  it was a difficult question and when neither of them answered her the girl went on  it doesnt seem to occur to you that what you suggest amounts to covering up a conspiracy and allowing a scoundrel to escape his deserts she said there is another point too you will have to inform the police about the robertson affair jimmy and his connection with merril is bound to appear when they lay hands on him  that said jimmy with a trace of dryness is hardly likely the man will be heading for the diggings by this time if he isnt drowned and theres very little probability of the police getting hold of him there  eleanor laughed a very bitter laugh as she fixed her eyes on him  so you are quite content with charleys planto extort so many dollars from merril she said it has one fatal defect it does not satisfy me  now commenced jordan but the girl checked him with a gesture  i want him crushed disgraced imprisoned ruined altogether  anyway i owe it to my associates to make sure of the money first  and after that you feel you have to stand by jimmy  the man winced when she flung the question at him but when he did not answer she appeared to rouse herself for an effort leaning forward a trifle with a gleam in her eyes and the red flush plainer in her cheek  still she said if jimmy is what i think him he will not ask it of you i want him to go back six years to the time he came homefrom portland wasnt it jimmyand stayed a few weeks with us was there any shadow upon us then though your father was getting old i want you to remember him as he was when you went away a simple kindly abstemious and fearless man it surely cant be very hard  jimmy face grew furrowed and he set his lips tight but he said nothing and the girl went on  it was not so the next time you came back something had happened in the meanwhile the bondholder had laid his grasp on him he was weakening under it and the lust of drink was crushing the courage out of him still you must remember that it was his one consolation then came the awful climax of the closing scene i had to face it with charleyyou were awaybut you must realize the horror it brought me  jordan turned toward her abruptly eleanor he said with a trace of hoarseness in his voice let it drop you cant bear the thing a second time  she stopped him with a frown i want you to picture him deluding prescott with one of the pitiful cunning excuses that drunkards make wasnt it horrible in itself that he should have sunk to that then it shouldnt be very hard to imagine him bribing a lounger outside to buy him the whisky and the carousal afterward with a stranger a deadbeat and outcast low enough to profit by his evident weakness still he was your father jimmy then there was the groping for matches and the upsetting of the lamp somebody brought charley and when he came your father lay with the clothes charred upon his burned limbs still halfcrazed with drink and mad with pain must i tell you once more what i saw when charley brought me i am willing if there is nothing else that will rouse you you have heard it before but i want to burn it into your brain so that however hard you try you cant blot out that scene  jimmys face was grim and white but while he sat very still his comrade rose resolutely  eleanor he said if you attempt to recall another incident of that horrible night i shall carry you by main force out of the room  the girl turned to him with a little gesture then i suppose i must submit you have a mans strength and courage in youor i think you would be afraid to marry me but one could fancy that jimmy has none the daughter of the man who ruined his father has condescended to be gracious to him still i have a little more to say she is his daughter his flesh and blood jimmy and his pitiless hateful nature is in her that is the woman you wish to marry the mere notion of it is horrible still you cant marry her jimmy you must crush her father and drag him to his ruin after all there is a little manhood somewhere in you you will take the engineers statement to the underwriters and the police you mustyou have to  jimmy stood up slowly with the veins swollen on his forehead and a gray patch in his cheek eleanor he said hoarsely i believe there is a devil in you but i think you are right in this jordan will you hand me that paper  he stood still for at least a minute when his comrade passed it to him and the girl watched him with a little gleam in her eyes his face was furrowed and looked worn as well as very hard there was not a sound in the little room and the splash of the ripples on the shastas plates outside came in through the open ports with a startling distinctness jordan felt that the tension was becoming almost unendurable then jimmy turned slowly toward his sister and though the pain was still in his face it had curiously changed there was a look in his blue eyes that sent a thrill of consternation through her they were very steady and she knew that she had failed  i cant do it it was not the girls fault and she shall not be dragged through the mire he said then he looked at his comrade what i am going to do may cost you a good deal of money and my appointment to the shasta is of course in your hands i am going straight from here to merrils house  well said jordan simply it may cost us both a good deal but i guess i must face it if i were fixed as you are that is just what i should do  jimmy said nothing but he went out swiftly and eleanor turned to her companion with a very bitter smile when the door closed behind him  ah she said has that girl beguiled you too you had merril in your hands and instead of crushing him you are going to smooth his troubles away  no said jordan dryly i dont quite think jimmy will do that in some respects i understand him better than you do he wants to save the girl all the sorrow and disgrace he can but he is going to run her father out of this city jimmys not exactly clever and its quite likely hell mix up things when he meets merril but for all that i guess hell carry out just what he means to do somehow he generally does thats the kind of man he is  he stopped a moment and a smile crept into his eyes i dont know what the result will be and it may be the breakup of the shasta company but i cant blame jimmy  ah said eleanor you the man i counted on are turning against me as well as my brother  then the sustaining purpose seemed to die out of her and she sank back suddenly in her chair with her face hidden from him jordan crossed the little room and stooping beside her slipped an arm about her  my dear he said you can count on me always and in everything but this its because of what you are to me that im standing by jimmy     chapter xxxi  merril capitulates   merril was not in his house when jimmy reached it but it appeared that he was expected shortly and the latter who resolved to wait for him was shown into a big artistically furnished room he sat there at least ten minutes alone and grim in face with a growing disquietude for his surroundings had their effect on him the house was built of wood but expense had not been spared and those who have visited the western cities know how beautiful a wooden dwelling can be made jimmy looked out through the open windows on to a wide veranda framed with a slender colonnade of wooden pillars supporting fretted arches of lacelike delicacy the floor of the room which was choicely parquetted in cunningly contrasted wood also caught his eye and there were indiansewn rugs of furs on it of a kind that he knew was rarely purchased in the north except on behalf of russian princes and american railroad kings the furniture he fancied by the timber was canadianmade but it had evidently been copied from artistic european models and though he was far from being a connoisseur in such things they had all a painful significance to him just then  they suggested wealth and taste and luxury and it seemed only fitting that the woman he loved should have such a dwelling while he realized that it was his hand which must deprive her of all the artistic daintiness to which she had grown accustomed and no doubt valued he a steamboat skipper of low degree had like blind samson laid a brutal grasp upon the pillars of the house and he could feel the trembling of the beautiful edifice this would have afforded him a certain grim satisfaction had it not been for the fact that it was impossible to tell whether the woman he would have spared every pain might not be overwhelmed amid the ruin when he exerted his strength it must be exerted in that he could not help himself  while he sat there with a hard set face she came in dressed as he realized in harmony with her surroundings her gracious patrician quietness and her rich attire troubled him and he felt in spite of all eleanor had said that it would be a vast relief if he could abandon altogether the purpose that had brought him there though to do so would it was evident set the girl further apart from him than ever since her fathers station naturally stood as a barrier between them still he remembered what he owed the men who had sent him on board the shastajordan forster old leeson and two or three more he could not turn against them now  anthea stood still just inside the door looking at him halfexpectant but with something that was suggestive of apprehension in her manner and jimmy felt the hot blood creep into his face when he moved quietly forward and kissed her in view of what he had to do it would he felt have been more natural if she had shrunk from him in place of submitting to his caress she appeared to recognize the constraint that was upon him for she turned away and sat down a little distance from him  jimmy she said im glad to see you back i have been lonely without youand a little uneasy indeed though i dont know exactly why i am anxious now  then she looked at him steadily it is the first time you have been here something unusual must have brought you jimmy is it war  the man made a deprecatory gesture im afraid it is he said i dont think there can be any compromise  ah said the girl with a start you dont look like a man who has come to offer terms  jimmy was still standing and he leaned somewhat heavily on the back of a chair i have to do something that i shrink from but it must be done if there were no other reason i darent go back on the men who have confidence in me that isnot altogether though in a wayi am now betraying them anthea you will not let this thing stand between us  no and the girls voice was steady though a trifle strained at least not always still i have felt that some day i should have to choose whom i should hold tomy father or you it is very hard to face that question jimmy  yes said jimmy gravely i am afraid you must choose tonight you know how much i want you but i have sense enough to recognize that i may bring trouble on both of us if i urge you to do what you might afterward regret  anthea said nothing for almost a minute and because of the restraint he had laid upon himself jimmy understood the cost of her quietness it seemed necessary that both should hold themselves in hand then she turned to him again  you are quite sure there can be no compromise  it is for many reasons out of the question in fact i think the decisive battle will be fought tonight i have strained every point to make it easier for you or i should not have come at all and it is very likely that my comrades will discard me when they hear what i have done i am willing to face their anger but to some extent at least i must keep my bargain with them  he moved a pace or two and stood close by her chair looking down at her if you understood everything you would not blame me  anthea glanced at him a moment and he fancied that a shiver ran through her i do not blame you now though it is all a little horrible i cannot plead with you and if i did i see that you would not listen you must do what you feel you have to  neither of them spoke for a while though jimmy felt the tension was almost unendurable it was evident that the girl felt it too for he could see the signs of strain in her face so intent were they that neither heard the door open and jimmy turned with a little start when the sound of a footstep reached them merril was standing not far away little portly and immaculately dressed regarding them with an inscrutable face  i understand you wish to see me mr wheelock he said anthea you will no doubt allow us a few minutes  the girl rose and moved toward the door but before she went out she turned for a moment and glanced at jimmy then it closed softly and he saw that merril was regarding him with a sardonic smile  i heard that you had made my daughters acquaintance but i was not aware that it had gone as far as i have some grounds for supposing now he said  that said jimmy quietly is a subject i may mention by and by in the meanwhile i have something to say that concerns you at least as closely as it has a bearing on the other question we might discuss it first  i am at your service for ten minutes and merril pointed to a chair  jimmy sat down but said nothing for a few moments apart from the trouble that he must bring upon anthea he felt that it was a big and difficult thing he had undertaken he was a steamboat skipper and the man in front of him one skilled in every art of commercial trickery whose ability was recognized in that city still he felt curiously steady and sure of himself for jimmy like other simpleminded men as a rule appeared to advantage when forced suddenly to face a crisis he felt in fact much as he had done when he stood grimly resolute on the shastas bridge while the adelaide sheering wildly dragged her toward the spouting surf then he turned to merril  i called on you once before to make a request he said  and your errand is much the same now though one could fancy that you feel you have something to back it his companion suggested dryly  no said jimmy i have nothing to ask you for this time instead i am simply going to mention certain facts and leave you to act on the information in the only way open to you that is to get out of vancouver as soon as possible i am giving you the opportunity in order to save miss merril the pain of seeing you prosecuted you are in our hands now  merril scarcely moved a muscle you are prepared to make that assurance good  i am and jimmys voice had a little ring in it if you will give me your attention ill try to do it you have no news of the adelaide yet and to commence with you will have to face the fact that she is not on the rocks she was just ready to steam south with a derangement of her highpressure engine when i last saw her  though his companions face was almost expressionless jimmy fancied that this shot had reached its mark and he proceeded to relate what had happened since he fell in with the adelaide he did it with some skill for this was a subject with which he was at home and he made the feelings of her skipper and second engineer perfectly clear then though he had not mentioned robertsons confession he sat still wondering at merrils composure  it sounds probable said the latter with a little smile you expect the skipper and the second engineer to bear you out no doubt they promised but when they get here the thing will wear another aspect in fact in all probability it will look too big for them you see they have merely put a certain construction upon one or two occurrences its quite likely they will be willing to admit that it is after all the wrong one  since we intend to claim half the value of the adelaide they would have to answer on their oath in court  merril shook his head half her value i commence to understand he said an appeal to the court is as a rule expensive as i guess you know it is generally wiser to be reasonable and make a compromise  the suggestion was so characteristic of the man that jimmy lost a little of his selfrestraint  there will be no compromise in this case he said if it were necessary we would drag you through every court in the land but as a matter of fact there will be no need for that you made a mistake in your opinion of the courage of your skipper and your second engineer you also made a more serious one in putting the screw too hard on robertson  ah said merril sharply at last there is something more  jimmy took a paper from his pocket and gravely handed it to him i am quite safe in allowing you to look at it it wouldnt be advisable for you to make any attempt to destroy it you will excuse my mentioning that  merril unfolded the document and jimmy noticed that the halfcontemptuous toleration died out of his face as he read it then he quietly handed it back and sat very still for at least a minute before he turned to his companion again  that rather alters the case you have something to go upon do you mind telling me what course you purpose to take  as i mentioned i dont purpose to take any still the shasta company will send in a claim for salvage tomorrow and afterward sue youor whoever you entrust with your affairsunless it is met the adelaide should also be here in the course of the next day or two and you will have your skipper and second engineer as well as the miner who witnessed the statement to face they appear determined on raising as much unpleasantness as possible though they were willing to hold back until i had taken the first steps  he stopped a moment and then leaned forward in his chair with a little forceful gesture though it would please me to see you prosecuted and disgraced i will at least take no steps to prevent your getting out of this city quietly  ah said merril you no doubt expect something for that concession  no and jimmy stood up i expect nothing it would hurt me to make a bargain of any kind with you and it would i think be illegal still i have the honor of informing you that i purpose to marry miss merril as soon as it appears convenient to her in spite of any opposition that you may think fit to offer  merril showed neither astonishment nor anger instead he smiled quietly and his companion surmised that he had already with characteristic promptness decided on his course of action  you have no objections to my sending for her  jimmy said he had none and five minutes later anthea appeared she stood near the door looking at the men and saw that jimmys face was darkly flushed her father however appeared almost as composed as usual jimmy felt that he dare not look at her and the tense silence which lasted a few moments tried his courage hard it cost him an effort to hold himself in hand when merril turned to the girl  i understand from mr wheelock that you are willing to marry him is that the case he said  yes replied anthea simply while the blood crept into her cheeks that is i shall be willing when circumstances permit  then in the meanwhile at least you would consider my wishes  anthea glanced at jimmy i think he understands that  merril said nothing for almost half a minute and sat still regarding them with a sardonic smile though his eyes were gentler than usual  well he said at last that is no more than one would have expected from you mr wheelock is however quite prepared to disregard my opposition in fact one could almost fancy that he will be a little grieved when i say that i do not mean to offer any  jimmy was certainly astonished for he had at least expected that the man would make an attempt to play upon the girls feelings however he said nothing and merril turned to her again  well i fancy that he has shown himself capable of looking after you and there is a certain forceful simplicity in his character that when i consider him as my daughters husband somewhat pleases me with moderate good fortune it may carry him a long way  it seemed an almost incomprehensible thing to jimmy that the man should show no trace of vindictiveness and perhaps the latter guessed it for he laughed softly  mr wheelock he said as you have no doubt guessed i never had much faith in the conventional code of morality but since you seem determined to marry anthea i am in one respect glad that you evidently have though that is perhaps not a very logical admission i was out after money and allowed no other consideration to influence me it is probable that i should have accumulated a good deal of it had not everything gone against me lately well if i showed no pity i at least seldom allowed any rancor to betray me into injudicious action when other people treated me as i should have treated them but after all that is not the question and we will be practical you will not see or write to anthea for six months from today and then if neither of you has changed your mind you can understand that you have my goodwill she will advise you of her addressin torontoin the meanwhile it is not a great deal to promise  jimmy glanced at the girl and turned again to merril when she nodded  i pledge myself to that he said  then said merril you will leave us now i have a good deal to say to anthea  jimmy moved away without a word and went down the corridor with every nerve in him tingling     chapter xxxii  eleanor relents   jordan who waited some time on board the shasta saw no more of jimmy that night this was however in one respect a relief to him since eleanor who was evidently very angry with her brother insisted on remaining as long as possible in the expectation that he would come back again it was in fact only when the hour at which she had arranged to meet mrs forster arrived that she very reluctantly permitted jordan to take her ashore and he felt easier when he handed her into forsters wagon it did not seem to him that a further meeting between her and her brother would be likely to afford much pleasure to anybody he had been at work some little time in his office next morning when jimmy walked in and sitting down looked at him quietly  i have no doubt that you know why i have kept out of your way so long he said  well replied jordan dryly i can guess what did you say to merril  i told him what had happened and left him to act upon it now im quite prepared to resign the command of the shasta  if its necessary well talk about that later in the meanwhile well get our salvage claim in leeson should be here at any moment i saw him last night  he set to work but there were two or three points it was necessary to discuss with jimmy and he was still busy when there was a rattle of wheels in the street outside which was followed by the sound of voices on the stairway jordan laid down his pen with a gesture of embarrassment and dismay  its forster and he has brought eleanor along he said im most afraid youre going to have trouble jimmy  its more than probable and jimmy smiled somewhat grimly im quite prepared for it  then the door opened and eleanor forster and leeson came in the girl sat down without a glance at her brother and the rancher turned to jordan  miss wheelock has acquainted me with the substance of what jimmy told you yesterday and i came to ask what course you expect to take he said i may say that she seems as anxious to hear it as i am  eleanor smiled it is not exactly mr forsters fault that i am here she said the fact is i insisted on coming he was perfectly willing to leave me behind  jordans face was more expressive of resignation than pleasure but he took up his pen again  this is a statement of the services rendered the adelaide and a claim in respect of them he said i am going to take it along to merrils office in a few minutes and one or more of you can come with me  they went out together but when they reached merrils office jordan and jimmy alone went in they found a good many other people waiting there and had some little difficulty in securing attention while the clerk to whom jordan spoke appeared anxious and embarrassed  mr merril is not here he said he went out of town last night and executed a trust deed before he left mr cathcart one of the trustees is now inside  jordan looked at jimmy i dont mind admitting that i expected this he said then he turned to the clerk take our names in  they were shown into the inner office where a grayhaired gentleman listened gravely to what they had to say then he took the salvage claim from jordan and laid it beneath a pile of other papers  it will be considered in its turn he said i do not know whether we shall attempt to contest it or whether there will be funds to meet it but i may be able to tell you more tomorrow and would ask you to take no further steps until you have seen me i am at liberty to say that mr merrils affairs appear to be considerably involved  jordan promised to wait and when he turned toward the door the trustee who took up an envelope made a sign to jimmy  i was instructed to hand you this captain wheelock and to tell you that miss merril leaves for toronto by todays express on the understanding that you make no attempt to communicate with her it contains her address  jimmy went out with his thoughts confused all that had come about was he felt the result of his action but he realized that in any case the crisis could not have been much longer delayed they found the others awaiting them and when forster had quietly but firmly insisted on escorting eleanor into a drygoods store and leaving her there they went back together to jordans office where the latter related what he had heard  to be quite straight i must admit that i had a notion of what jimmy meant to do last night and took no steps to restrain him he said if i had done so merril would not have got away we are both in your hands but while you may think differently i am not sure that what has happened is a serious misfortune from a business point of view  forster said nothing and there was a few moments awkward silence until old leeson spoke  considering everything i guess youre right he said cathcarts a straight man and as they cant sell the adelaide without permission from us well get some of our money although its hardly likely the estate will realize enough to go around seems to me thats more than we should have done if merril had kept hold well its not my proposition that we turn you out  he stopped a moment and glanced at jimmy with a little dry smile captain wheelock has gone way further than he should have done without our sanction but i guess it will meet the case if we leave him to his sister its a sure thing miss wheelock is far from pleased with him now theres a point or two i want to mention  the others seemed relieved at this and when leeson had said his say forster went away with him then jordan glanced at jimmy with apprehension in his eyes as eleanor came in she stood still looking at them with the portentous red flush burning in her cheek  what i foresaw all along has happened jimmy has betrayed you to save that girl she said  then she turned to jimmy flicking her glove in her hand as though she would have struck him with it jimmy she said incisively you are no longer a brother of mine neither charley nor i will speak to you again  jordan straightened himself resolutely stop there eleanor he said if you wont speak to him i cant compel you to but in this one thing at least you cant compel me jimmy was my friend before i met you and im standing by him now anyway what has he done  ah said the girl with an audible indrawing of her breath he has spoiled everything if he hadnt played the traitor merril would never have got away oh and her anger shook her i can never forgive him  once more she turned to her brother there is no longer any tie between us you have broken it and that is the last and only thing i have to say to you  jimmy rose and quietly reached for his hat then he said there is nothing to be gained by pointing out what my views are we can only wait until you see things differently  he went out and eleanor sank somewhat limply into a chair  charley she said its a little horrible but he is a weak coward and i hate him you had better break off our engagement im not fit to marry anybody  thats the one thing that holds in spite of everything and jordan looked at her gravely with trouble in his face go quietly eleanor it will straighten out in time  the girl sat still for a while saying nothing and then she rose with a little shiver find forster and if he is not going back get a team she said i want mrs forster i cant stay in the city  jordan went out with her and though he had a good deal to do was not sorry when he failed to find forster and it became necessary for him to drive her back to the ranch eleanor however said very little to him during the journey and he had sense enough to confine his attention to his team he had also little time to think of anything that did not concern his business when he returned to the city for the shasta had to be got ready to go back to sea and the adelaide arrived early on the following day the skipper went with him to interview merrils trustee and the latter announced that no steps would be taken to contest the salvage claim when he heard what he had to say however he added dryly that it would probably be advisable for the shasta company to consider the compromise proposition he would shortly make jordan who fancied he was right in this went away without having found it necessary to hand him the engineers confession and was glad he had not offered to produce it when he ransacked his office for it a few days later  i certainly had the thing the morning forster and eleanor were here he said jimmy laid it down and i dont remember having seen him take it up again still i suppose he must have done so  jimmy had however gone north again by that time and the compromise had been agreed to before he came back again the shasta had also made several other successful trips when he had occasion to call at victoria on his southward run and seeing the sorata in the harbor rowed off to her he spent that evening in her little forecastle with valentine who was busy with deepwater fishinglines the latter wore an old blue shirt and canvas trousers stained with paint and grease and he laid down a big hank of line when at length jimmy who had been whipping on hooks for him inquired what plans he had  so youre not going back to the west coast to drum up cargo for us he said  no said valentine although they didnt intimate it i dont think your people have any more use for me they have the trade in their hands and the boat they put on instead of yours is coming down full every time in fact i believe theyre buying another one as well as a big passenger carrier for your northern trip  jimmy looked astonished its the first ive heard of itbut of course its a little while since i was in vancouver where did they raise the money  i believe they got some of it from cathcart on the salvage claim and leeson and two or three of his friends raised the rest the adelaide and merrils house were sold at auction i heard it from jordan who was over here a week ago and its scarcely necessary to say that hes going to send you in the new boat he seems to have some notion of trying to get into the south sea trade too and i shouldnt wonder if eventually youre made general supervisor of the shasta companys growing fleet  jimmy was sensible of a thrill of satisfaction but he changed the subject you have given up your chartering  i have said valentine with a curious smile the people who hired my boat had an unsettling effect on me and now im going to try the halibut fishing with a couple of siwash hands austerlys was my last charteri dont think i shall ever take another  jimmy nodded for he felt that he understood well he said in one way it wouldnt be nice to see anybody else occupying that aftercabin of course the notion is a fanciful one but i shouldnt like to think of it myself  again the curious little smile flickered into valentines eyes it is scarcely likely to happen i think you will understand my views when i show you the room  jimmy went aft with him through the saloon and valentine unlocking a door beneath the companion slide opened it gently the fashion in which he did it had its significance and jimmy understood altogether as he looked into the little room it was immaculate bulkhead and paneling gleamed with snowy paint the berths with their varnished ledges were filled with spotless linen and there was not a speck on the deck beneath a few fresh sprays of balsam that hung beneath the beams diffused a faint aromatic fragrance  those said valentine gravely are to keep out the smell of the halibut i shouldnt like it to come in here she had the lower berth the top one was miss merrils  jimmy felt the blood rise to his face valentines manner was very quiet and there was not the slightest trace of sentimentality in it but jimmy felt that he knew what he was thinking besides anthea had slept in that little snowy berth they turned away without a word when valentine carefully fastened the door and the latter had sat down again in the forecastle before jimmy spoke  have you heard anything of miss austerly lately he asked  valentine lighted the lamp beneath the beams for it was growing dark and taking something from a box in the upper berth stood still a moment with it in his hands they were scarred and hardened by physical toil and the man was big and bronzed and very quiet though every line of his face and figure was stamped with the wholesome vigor of the sea  i see you do not know he said this is the letter austerly sent me as you will notice it was at her request she would not have minded your reading it  jimmy started as he saw that the envelope had a broad black edge and his companion nodded gravely  yes he said there is neither tide nor fog where she has gone there at least we are told the sea is glassy  jimmy took the letter out of the envelope and once or twice his eyes grew a trifle hazy as he read then he handed it back to valentine almost reverently  i am sorry was all he said  valentine looked at him with the little grave smile still in his eyes i do not think there is any need for that what had this world but pain to offer her she has slipped away but she has left something behindsomething one can hold on by what there is out yonder we do not knowbut perhaps we shall not be sorry when we slip out beyond the shrouding mists some day  neither of them said much more and shortly afterward jimmy went back to the shasta next morning he stood on his bridge watching the sorata slide out of harbor valentine sitting at her tiller waved his hat to him and jimmy was glad that he had hurled a blast of the whistle after him when some months later he heard that the sorata and her skipper had gone down together in a wild westerly gale  in the meanwhile he proceeded to vancouver and after an interview with jordan who formally offered him command of the big new boat took the first eastgoing train and reached toronto five days later an hour after he got there he hired a pulling skiff at the waterfront and drove her out with sturdy strokes into the blue lake across which a little cutter was creeping a mile or so away he came up with her hot and breathless and the girl at the tiller rose quietly when he swung himself on deck though there was a depth of tenderness in her eyes  jimmy she said why didnt you tell me  jimmy laughed you should have expected me he said the six months are up  anthea turned to the young man and the girl who were sitting in the cockpit captain wheelock my cousin muriel and graham hoyle  the young man smiled at jimmy who was however conscious that the girl was surveying him with critical curiosity then she asked him a question concerning his journey and they discussed the canadian railroads for the next ten minutes until she flashed a suggestive glance at the young man  what a beautiful morning for a row she said  hoyle rose to his feet i dare say i could pull you ashore in captain wheelocks boat he said theres just wind enough to bring the yacht after us if he gets the topsail up  jimmy did not get the topsail up when they rowed away but sat down on the coaming with his arm around antheas shoulder  i have just two weeks before i go north in our big new boat he said it isnt very long but i want to take you with me  he was some little time overruling antheas objections one by one and then she turned and looked up at him with a flush in her face  jimmy she said i suppose you realize that i havent a dollar some provision was to have been made for mebut i felt i couldnt profit by the arrangement  jimmy laughed if its any consolation to you i havent very much either still i think im going to get it i was creeping through the blinding fog six months ago but the mists have blown away and the sky is brightening to windward now  then he turned and pointed to the strip of dusky blue that moved across the gleaming lake if anything more is wanted theres the fair wind  they ran back before it under a blaze of sunshine with the little frothy ripples splashing merrily after them and then jimmy had to exert himself again before he could induce antheas aunt to believe that it was possible for her niece to be married at two weeks notice still he accomplished it and on the fifteenth day he and anthea wheelock stood on the platform of a big dusty car as the pacific express ran slowly into the station at vancouver  leeson stood waiting with forster and jordan was already running toward the car but jimmys lips set tight when he saw eleanor with mrs forster in a moment or two jordan handed anthea down and then stood aside as eleanor came impulsively forward to her brothers astonishment she laid her hand on antheas shoulder and kissed her on each cheek  now she said you will have to forgive me  jimmy did not hear what his wife said for mrs forster was greeting him and then leeson and the rancher seized him but five minutes later eleanor stood at his side  yes she said anthea and i are going to be friends and you darent be angry any longer jimmy  they had dropped a little behind the others who were moving along the wharf and jimmy looked at her with a dry smile  im not he said in fact i dont think it was my temper that made things unpleasant all the time still  you didnt expect me to change  her brother said nothing and she looked up at him with a softness in her eyes he never remembered seeing there  im going to marry charley very soon she said i couldnt have done that while i hated anybody and after all it was merril who rousedthe wild catin me and we have done with him altogether they wouldnt have him back in vancouver but theres a landboom somewhere in california and charley hears that he is already piling up money  she stopped a moment and thrust a folded paper into his hand thats yours but anthea must never see it charley didnt know i had it and i meant to keep it in case merril got rich again but i dont want it now please destroy it jimmy  jimmy glanced at the paper and his expression changed when he saw that it was the engineers confession but he laid his hand on his sisters arm and pressed it for he understood what the fact that she had parted with that document signified then leeson who was a few paces in front of them turned and pointed to a big steamer with a tier of white deckhouses lying out in the inlet  the boats waiting at the landing and well go off he said theres a kind of weddinglunch ready on board her  jimmy said they had purposed going straight to the house he had commissioned jordan to take for him but the latter laughed and leeson chuckled dryly  we held a meeting over the question and fixed it up that the house you wanted hadnt quite tone enough for the man whos to be commodore of the shasta fleet very soon he said thats why we decided to put you into my big one on the rise guess theres not a prettier house around this city but it has never been really lived in im out most of every day and only want two rooms now theres no use protesting its all fixed ready and youre going right in  he turned and touched antheas arm youll stand by me you cant afford to have your husband kick against the man with the most money in the shasta company  jimmys protests were very feeble it had been his one trouble that anthea would have to live in a very different fashion from the one she had been accustomed to and he was relieved when she thanked the old man  leeson smiled at her in a very kindly fashion well he said ive been lonely for the last eight years since the boy who should have had that house went down with my smartest boat and i want to feel that theres somebody under the same roof with me who will keep me from growing too hard and old  then he stopped and chuckled in his usual dry manner i was going to make jordan the propositiononly i got to thinking and my nerve failed me guess i made my money hard in the free sealing days when we had trouble with everybody all the time but i felt id sooner not offend mrs jordan and i might do it if i didnt fix things just as she told me shes a clever womanbut i dont want to have her on my trail  eleanor only glanced at him in whimsical reproach and they moved on laughing toward the waiting boat   end
