48005261	peter pan in kensington gardens  by j m barrie     contents       peter pan      the thrushs nest      the little house      lockout time     peter pan  if you ask your mother whether she knew about peter pan when she was a little girl she will say why of course i did child and if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she will say what a foolish question to ask certainly he did then if you ask your grandmother whether she knew about peter pan when she was a girl she also says why of course i did child but if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she says she never heard of his having a goat perhaps she has forgotten just as she sometimes forgets your name and calls you mildred which is your mothers name still she could hardly forget such an important thing as the goat therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl this shows that in telling the story of peter pan to begin with the goat as most people do is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest  of course it also shows that peter is ever so old but he is really always the same age so that does not matter in the least his age is one week and though he was born so long ago he has never had a birthday nor is there the slightest chance of his ever having one the reason is that he escaped from being a human when he was seven days old he escaped by the window and flew back to the kensington gardens  if you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape it shows how completely you have forgotten your own young days when david heard this story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to escape but i told him to think back hard pressing his hands to his temples and when he had done this hard and even harder he distinctly remembered a youthful desire to return to the treetops and with that memory came others as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as soon as his mother was asleep and how she had once caught him halfway up the chimney all children could have such recollections if they would press their hands hard to their temples for having been birds before they were human they are naturally a little wild during the first few weeks and very itchy at the shoulders where their wings used to be so david tells me  i ought to mention here that the following is our way with a story first i tell it to him and then he tells it to me the understanding being that it is quite a different story and then i retell it with his additions and so we go on until no one could say whether it is more his story or mine in this story of peter pan for instance the bald narrative and most of the moral reflections are mine though not all for this boy can be a stern moralist but the interesting bits about the ways and customs of babies in the birdstage are mostly reminiscences of davids recalled by pressing his hands to his temples and thinking hard  well peter pan got out by the window which had no bars standing on the ledge he could see trees far away which were doubtless the kensington gardens and the moment he saw them he entirely forgot that he was now a little boy in a nightgown and away he flew right over the houses to the gardens it is wonderful that he could fly without wings but the place itched tremendously and perhaps we could all fly if we were as deadconfidentsure of our capacity to do it as was bold peter pan that evening  he alighted gaily on the open sward between the babys palace and the serpentine and the first thing he did was to lie on his back and kick he was quite unaware already that he had ever been human and thought he was a bird even in appearance just the same as in his early days and when he tried to catch a fly he did not understand that the reason he missed it was because he had attempted to seize it with his hand which of course a bird never does he saw however that it must be past lockout time for there were a good many fairies about all too busy to notice him they were getting breakfast ready milking their cows drawing water and so on and the sight of the waterpails made him thirsty so he flew over to the round pond to have a drink he stooped and dipped his beak in the pond he thought it was his beak but of course it was only his nose and therefore very little water came up and that not so refreshing as usual so next he tried a puddle and he fell flop into it when a real bird falls in flop he spreads out his feathers and pecks them dry but peter could not remember what was the thing to do and he decided rather sulkily to go to sleep on the weeping beech in the baby walk  at first he found some difficulty in balancing himself on a branch but presently he remembered the way and fell asleep he awoke long before morning shivering and saying to himself i never was out in such a cold night he had really been out in colder nights when he was a bird but of course as everybody knows what seems a warm night to a bird is a cold night to a boy in a nightgown peter also felt strangely uncomfortable as if his head was stuffy he heard loud noises that made him look round sharply though they were really himself sneezing there was something he wanted very much but though he knew he wanted it he could not think what it was what he wanted so much was his mother to blow his nose but that never struck him so he decided to appeal to the fairies for enlightenment they are reputed to know a good deal  there were two of them strolling along the baby walk with their arms round each others waists and he hopped down to address them the fairies have their tiffs with the birds but they usually give a civil answer to a civil question and he was quite angry when these two ran away the moment they saw him another was lolling on a gardenchair reading a postagestamp which some human had let fall and when he heard peters voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip  to peters bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from him a band of workmen who were sawing down a toadstool rushed away leaving their tools behind them a milkmaid turned her pail upside down and hid in it soon the gardens were in an uproar crowds of fairies were running this way and that asking each other stoutly who was afraid lights were extinguished doors barricaded and from the grounds of queen mabs palace came the rubadub of drums showing that the royal guard had been called out  a regiment of lancers came charging down the broad walk armed with hollyleaves with which they jog the enemy horribly in passing peter heard the little people crying everywhere that there was a human in the gardens after lockout time but he never thought for a moment that he was the human he was feeling stuffier and stuffier and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose but he pursued them with the vital question in vain the timid creatures ran from him and even the lancers when he approached them up the hump turned swiftly into a sidewalk on the pretence that they saw him there  despairing of the fairies he resolved to consult the birds but now he remembered as an odd thing that all the birds on the weeping beech had flown away when he alighted on it and though that had not troubled him at the time he saw its meaning now every living thing was shunning him poor little peter pan he sat down and cried and even then he did not know that for a bird he was sitting on his wrong part it is a blessing that he did not know for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly and the moment you doubt whether you can fly you cease forever to be able to do it the reason birds can fly and we cant is simply that they have perfect faith for to have faith is to have wings  now except by flying no one can reach the island in the serpentine for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there and there are stakes round it standing up in the water on each of which a birdsentinel sits by day and night it was to the island that peter now flew to put his strange case before old solomon caw and he alighted on it with relief much heartened to find himself at last at home as the birds call the island all of them were asleep including the sentinels except solomon who was wide awake on one side and he listened quietly to peters adventures and then told him their true meaning  look at your nightgown if you dont believe me solomon said and with staring eyes peter looked at his nightgown and then at the sleeping birds not one of them wore anything  how many of your toes are thumbs said solomon a little cruelly and peter saw to his consternation that all his toes were fingers the shock was so great that it drove away his cold  ruffle your feathers said that grim old solomon and peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers but he had none then he rose up quaking and for the first time since he stood on the windowledge he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him  i think i shall go back to mother he said timidly  goodbye replied solomon caw with a queer look  but peter hesitated why dont you go the old one asked politely  i suppose said peter huskily i suppose i can still fly  you see he had lost faith  poor little halfandhalf said solomon who was not really hardhearted you will never be able to fly again not even on windy days you must live here on the island always  and never even go to the kensington gardens peter asked tragically  how could you get across said solomon he promised very kindly however to teach peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape  then i shant be exactly a human peter asked  no  nor exactly a bird  no  what shall i be  you will be a betwixtandbetween solomon said and certainly he was a wise old fellow for that is exactly how it turned out  the birds on the island never got used to him his oddities tickled them every day as if they were quite new though it was really the birds that were new they came out of the eggs daily and laughed at him at once then off they soon flew to be humans and other birds came out of other eggs and so it went on forever the crafty motherbirds when they tired of sitting on their eggs used to get the young one to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see peter washing or drinking or eating thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things just as you watch the peacocks and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth all his food was brought to him from the gardens at solomons orders by the birds he would not eat worms or insects which they thought very silly of him so they brought him bread in their beaks thus when you cry out greedy greedy to the bird that flies away with the big crust you know now that you ought not to do this for he is very likely taking it to peter pan  peter wore no nightgown now you see the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with and being very goodnatured he could not refuse so by solomons advice he had hidden what was left of it but though he was now quite naked you must not think that he was cold or unhappy he was usually very happy and gay and the reason was that solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways to be easily pleased for instance and always to be really doing something and to think that whatever he was doing was a thing of vast importance peter became very clever at helping the birds to build their nests soon he could build better than a woodpigeon and nearly as well as a blackbird though never did he satisfy the finches and he made nice little watertroughs near the nests and dug up worms for the young ones with his fingers he also became very learned in birdlore and knew an eastwind from a westwind by its smell and he could see the grass growing and hear the insects walking about inside the treetrunks but the best thing solomon had done was to teach him to have a glad heart all birds have glad hearts unless you rob their nests and so as they were the only kind of heart solomon knew about it was easy to him to teach peter how to have one  peters heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long just as the birds sing for joy but being partly human he needed in instrument so he made a pipe of reeds and he used to sit by the shore of the island of an evening practising the sough of the wind and the ripple of the water and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon and he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived and they would say to each other was that a fish leaping in the water or was it peter playing leaping fish on his pipe and sometimes he played the birth of birds and then the mothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg if you are a child of the gardens you must know the chestnuttree near the bridge which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts but perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way it is because peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come and the chestnut being so near hears him and is cheated  but as peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he sometimes fell into sad thoughts and then the music became sad also and the reason of all this sadness was that he could not reach the gardens though he could see them through the arch of the bridge he knew he could never be a real human again and scarcely wanted to be one but oh how he longed to play as other children play and of course there is no such lovely place to play in as the gardens the birds brought him news of how boys and girls play and wistful tears started in peters eyes  perhaps you wonder why he did not swim across the reason was that he could not swim he wanted to know how to swim but no one on the island knew the way except the ducks and they are so stupid they were quite willing to teach him but all they could say about it was you sit down on the top of the water in this way and then you kick out like that peter tried it often but always before he could kick out he sank what he really needed to know was how you sit on the water without sinking and they said it was quite impossible to explain such an easy thing as that occasionally swans touched on the island and he would give them all his days food and then ask them how they sat on the water but as soon as he had no more to give them the hateful things hissed at him and sailed away  once he really thought he had discovered a way of reaching the gardens a wonderful white thing like a runaway newspaper floated high over the island and then tumbled rolling over and over after the manner of a bird that has broken its wing peter was so frightened that he hid but the birds told him it was only a kite and what a kite is and that it must have tugged its string out of a boys hand and soared away after that they laughed at peter for being so fond of the kite he loved it so much that he even slept with one hand on it and i think this was pathetic and pretty for the reason he loved it was because it had belonged to a real boy  to the birds this was a very poor reason but the older ones felt grateful to him at this time because he had nursed a number of fledglings through the german measles and they offered to show him how birds fly a kite so six of them took the end of the string in their beaks and flew away with it and to his amazement it flew after them and went even higher than they  peter screamed out do it again and with great good nature they did it several times and always instead of thanking them he cried do it again which shows that even now he had not quite forgotten what it was to be a boy  at last with a grand design burning within his brave heart he begged them to do it once more with him clinging to the tail and now a hundred flew off with the string and peter clung to the tail meaning to drop off when he was over the gardens but the kite broke to pieces in the air and he would have drowned in the serpentine had he not caught hold of two indignant swans and made them carry him to the island after this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise  nevertheless peter did reach the gardens at last by the help of shelleys boat as i am now to tell you     the thrushs nest  shelley was a young gentleman and as grownup as he need ever expect to be he was a poet and they are never exactly grownup they are people who despise money except what you need for today and he had all that and five pounds over so when he was walking in the kensington gardens he made a paper boat of his banknote and sent it sailing on the serpentine  it reached the island at night and the lookout brought it to solomon caw who thought at first that it was the usual thing a message from a lady saying she would be obliged if he could let her have a good one they always ask for the best one he has and if he likes the letter he sends one from class a but if it ruffles him he sends very funny ones indeed sometimes he sends none at all and at another time he sends a nestful it all depends on the mood you catch him in he likes you to leave it all to him and if you mention particularly that you hope he will see his way to making it a boy this time he is almost sure to send another girl and whether you are a lady or only a little boy who wants a babysister always take pains to write your address clearly you cant think what a lot of babies solomon has sent to the wrong house  shelleys boat when opened completely puzzled solomon and he took counsel of his assistants who having walked over it twice first with their toes pointed out and then with their toes pointed in decided that it came from some greedy person who wanted five they thought this because there was a large five printed on it preposterous cried solomon in a rage and he presented it to peter anything useless which drifted upon the island was usually given to peter as a plaything  but he did not play with his precious banknote for he knew what it was at once having been very observant during the week when he was an ordinary boy with so much money he reflected he could surely at last contrive to reach the gardens and he considered all the possible ways and decided wisely i think to choose the best way but first he had to tell the birds of the value of shelleys boat and though they were too honest to demand it back he saw that they were galled and they cast such black looks at solomon who was rather vain of his cleverness that he flew away to the end of the island and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings now peter knew that unless solomon was on your side you never got anything done for you in the island so he followed him and tried to hearten him  nor was this all that peter did to pin the powerful old fellows good will you must know that solomon had no intention of remaining in office all his life he looked forward to retiring byandby and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yewstump in the figs which had taken his fancy and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking it was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had been cast upon the island and at the time i speak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs thirtyfour nuts sixteen crusts a penwiper and a bootlace when his stocking was full solomon calculated that he would be able to retire on a competency peter now gave him a pound he cut it off his banknote with a sharp stick  this made solomon his friend for ever and after the two had consulted together they called a meeting of the thrushes you will see presently why thrushes only were invited  the scheme to be put before them was really peters but solomon did most of the talking because he soon became irritable if other people talked he began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nestbuilding and this put them into goodhumour at once as it was meant to do for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests other birds said solomon omitted to line their nests with mud and as a result they did not hold water here he cocked his head as if he had used an unanswerable argument but unfortunately a mrs finch had come to the meeting uninvited and she squeaked out we dont build nests to hold water but to hold eggs and then the thrushes stopped cheering and solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water  consider he said at last how warm the mud makes the nest  consider cried mrs finch that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned  the thrushes begged solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this but again he was perplexed  try another drink suggested mrs finch pertly kate was her name and all kates are saucy  solomon did try another drink and it inspired him if said he a finchs nest is placed on the serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces but a thrushs nest is still as dry as the cup of a swans back  how the thrushes applauded now they knew why they lined their nests with mud and when mrs finch called out we dont place our nests on the serpentine they did what they should have done at first chased her from the meeting after this it was most orderly what they had been brought together to hear said solomon was this their young friend peter pan as they well knew wanted very much to be able to cross to the gardens and he now proposed with their help to build a boat  at this the thrushes began to fidget which made peter tremble for his scheme  solomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the cumbrous boats that humans use the proposed boat was to be simply a thrushs nest large enough to hold peter  but still to peters agony the thrushes were sulky we are very busy people they grumbled and this would be a big job  quite so said solomon and of course peter would not allow you to work for nothing you must remember that he is now in comfortable circumstances and he will pay you such wages as you have never been paid before peter pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid sixpence a day  then all the thrushes hopped for joy and that very day was begun the celebrated building of the boat all their ordinary business fell into arrears it was the time of year when they should have been pairing but not a thrushs nest was built except this big one and so solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland the stout rather greedy children who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk were all young thrushes once and ladies often ask specially for them what do you think solomon did he sent over to the housetops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes nests and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes it was known afterward on the island as the sparrows year and so when you meet as you doubtless sometimes do grownup people who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are very likely they belong to that year you ask them  peter was a just master and paid his workpeople every evening they stood in rows on the branches waiting politely while he cut the paper sixpences out of his banknote and presently he called the roll and then each bird as the names were mentioned flew down and got sixpence it must have been a fine sight  and at last after months of labor the boat was finished oh the deportment of peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great thrushs nest from the very beginning of the building of it he slept by its side and often woke up to say sweet things to it and after it was lined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it he sleeps in his nest still and has a fascinating way of curling round in it for it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a kitten it is brown inside of course but outside it is mostly green being woven of grass and twigs and when these wither or snap the walls are thatched afresh there are also a few feathers here and there which came off the thrushes while they were building  the other birds were extremely jealous and said that the boat would not balance on the water but it lay most beautifully steady they said the water would come into it but no water came into it next they said that peter had no oars and this caused the thrushes to look at each other in dismay but peter replied that he had no need of oars for he had a sail and with such a proud happy face he produced a sail which he had fashioned out of this nightgown and though it was still rather like a nightgown it made a lovely sail and that night the moon being full and all the birds asleep he did enter his coracle as master francis pretty would have said and depart out of the island and first he knew not why he looked upward with his hands clasped and from that moment his eyes were pinned to the west  he had promised the thrushes to begin by making short voyages with them to his guides but far away he saw the kensington gardens beckoning to him beneath the bridge and he could not wait his face was flushed but he never looked back there was an exultation in his little breast that drove out fear was peter the least gallant of the english mariners who have sailed westward to meet the unknown  at first his boat turned round and round and he was driven back to the place of his starting whereupon he shortened sail by removing one of the sleeves and was forthwith carried backward by a contrary breeze to his no small peril he now let go the sail with the result that he was drifted toward the far shore where are black shadows he knew not the dangers of but suspected them and so once more hoisted his nightgown and went roomer of the shadows until he caught a favouring wind which bore him westward but at so great a speed that he was like to be broke against the bridge which having avoided he passed under the bridge and came to his great rejoicing within full sight of the delectable gardens but having tried to cast anchor which was a stone at the end of a piece of the kitestring he found no bottom and was fain to hold off seeking for moorage and feeling his way he buffeted against a sunken reef that cast him overboard by the greatness of the shock and he was near to being drowned but clambered back into the vessel there now arose a mighty storm accompanied by roaring of waters such as he had never heard the like and he was tossed this way and that and his hands so numbed with the cold that he could not close them having escaped the danger of which he was mercifully carried into a small bay where his boat rode at peace  nevertheless he was not yet in safety for on pretending to disembark he found a multitude of small people drawn up on the shore to contest his landing and shouting shrilly to him to be off for it was long past lockout time this with much brandishing of their hollyleaves and also a company of them carried an arrow which some boy had left in the gardens and this they were prepared to use as a batteringram  then peter who knew them for the fairies called out that he was not an ordinary human and had no desire to do them displeasure but to be their friend nevertheless having found a jolly harbour he was in no temper to draw off therefrom and he warned them if they sought to mischief him to stand to their harms  so saying he boldly leapt ashore and they gathered around him with intent to slay him but there then arose a great cry among the women and it was because they had now observed that his sail was a babys nightgown whereupon they straightway loved him and grieved that their laps were too small the which i cannot explain except by saying that such is the way of women the menfairies now sheathed their weapons on observing the behaviour of their women on whose intelligence they set great store and they led him civilly to their queen who conferred upon him the courtesy of the gardens after lockout time and henceforth peter could go whither he chose and the fairies had orders to put him in comfort  such was his first voyage to the gardens and you may gather from the antiquity of the language that it took place a long time ago but peter never grows any older and if we could be watching for him under the bridge tonight but of course we cant i daresay we should see him hoisting his nightgown and sailing or paddling toward us in the thrushs nest when he sails he sits down but he stands up to paddle i shall tell you presently how he got his paddle  long before the time for the opening of the gates comes he steals back to the island for people must not see him he is not so human as all that but this gives him hours for play and he plays exactly as real children play at least he thinks so and it is one of the pathetic things about him that he often plays quite wrongly  you see he had no one to tell him how children really play for the fairies were all more or less in hiding until dusk and so know nothing and though the buds pretended that they could tell him a great deal when the time for telling came it was wonderful how little they really knew they told him the truth about hideandseek and he often plays it by himself but even the ducks on the round pond could not explain to him what it is that makes the pond so fascinating to boys every night the ducks have forgotten all the events of the day except the number of pieces of cake thrown to them they are gloomy creatures and say that cake is not what it was in their young days  so peter had to find out many things for himself he often played ships at the round pond but his ship was only a hoop which he had found on the grass of course he had never seen a hoop and he wondered what you play at with them and decided that you play at pretending they are boats this hoop always sank at once but he waded in for it and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops  another time when he found a childs pail he thought it was for sitting in and he sat so hard in it that he could scarcely get out of it also he found a balloon it was bobbing about on the hump quite as if it was having a game by itself and he caught it after an exciting chase but he thought it was a ball and jenny wren had told him that boys kick balls so he kicked it and after that he could not find it anywhere  perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator it was under a limetree near the entrance to the fairy queens winter palace which is within the circle of the seven spanish chestnuts and peter approached it warily for the birds had never mentioned such things to him lest it was alive he addressed it politely and then as it gave no answer he went nearer and felt it cautiously he gave it a little push and it ran from him which made him think it must be alive after all but as it had run from him he was not afraid so he stretched out his hand to pull it to him but this time it ran at him and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat you must not think however that he was a coward for he came back next night with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other but the perambulator had gone and he never saw another one i have promised to tell you also about his paddle it was a childs spade which he had found near st govors well and he thought it was a paddle  do you pity peter pan for making these mistakes if so i think it rather silly of you what i mean is that of course one must pity him now and then but to pity him all the time would be impertinence he thought he had the most splendid time in the gardens and to think you have it is almost quite as good as really to have it he played without ceasing while you often waste time by being maddog or maryannish he could be neither of these things for he had never heard of them but do you think he is to be pitied for that  oh he was merry he was as much merrier than you for instance as you are merrier than your father sometimes he fell like a spinningtop from sheer merriment have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the gardens that is how peter leaps them  and think of the music of his pipe gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the gardens but it is really peters pipe they hear of course he had no motherat least what use was she to him you can be sorry for him for that but dont be too sorry for the next thing i mean to tell you is how he revisited her it was the fairies who gave him the chance     the little house  everybody has heard of the little house in the kensington gardens which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans but no one has really seen it except just three or four and they have not only seen it but slept in it and unless you sleep in it you never see it this is because it is not there when you lie down but it is there when you wake up and step outside  in a kind of way everyone may see it but what you see is not really it but only the light in the windows you see the light after lockout time david for instance saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime and oliver bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the temple which is the name of his fathers office angela clare who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop saw more than one light she saw hundreds of them all together and this must have been the fairies building the house for they build it every night and always in a different part of the gardens she thought one of the lights was bigger than the others though she was not quite sure for they jumped about so and it might have been another one that was bigger but if it was the same one it was peter pans light heaps of children have seen the fight so that is nothing but maimie mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built  maimie was always rather a strange girl and it was at night that she was strange she was four years of age and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind she was pleased when her brother tony who was a magnificent fellow of six took notice of her and she looked up to him in the right way and tried in vain to imitate him and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about also when she was batting she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes she was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime  but as the shades of night fell tony the swaggerer lost his contempt for maimie and eyed her fearfully and no wonder for with dark there came into her face a look that i can describe only as a leary look it was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with tonys uneasy glances then he would make her presents of his favourite toys which he always took away from her next morning and she accepted them with a disturbing smile the reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was in brief that they knew they were about to be sent to bed it was then that maimie was terrible tony entreated her not to do it tonight and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her but maimie merely smiled her agitating smile and byandby when they were alone with their nightlight she would start up in bed crying hsh what was that tony beseeches her it was nothingdont maimie dont and pulls the sheet over his head it is coming nearer she cries oh look at it tony it is feeling your bed with its hornsit is boring for you oh tony oh and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations screeching when they came up to whip maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly not shamming you know but really sleeping and looking like the sweetest little angel which seems to me to make it almost worse  but of course it was daytime when they were in the gardens and then tony did most of the talking you could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy and no one was so proud of it as maimie she would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister and at no time did she admire him more than when he told her as he often did with splendid firmness that one day he meant to remain behind in the gardens after the gates were closed  oh tony she would say with awful respect but the fairies will be so angry  i daresay replied tony carelessly  perhaps she said thrilling peter pan will give you a sail in his boat  i shall make him replied tony no wonder she was proud of him  but they should not have talked so loudly for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves from which the little people weave their summer curtains and after that tony was a marked boy they loosened the rails before he sat on them so that down he came on the back of his head they tripped him up by catching his bootlace and bribed the ducks to sink his boat nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the gardens occur because the fairies have taken an illwill to you and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them  maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things but tony was not that kind and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the gardens after lockout he merely replied just some day he was quite vague about which day except when she asked will it be today and then he could always say for certain that it would not be today so she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance  this brings us to an afternoon when the gardens were white with snow and there was ice on the round pond not thick enough to skate on but at least you could spoil it for tomorrow by flinging stones and many bright little boys and girls were doing that  when tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first and as she said this she glanced at the timeboard to see when the gardens closed that night it read halfpast five poor ayah she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world but she was not to laugh much more that day  well they went up the baby walk and back and when they returned to the timeboard she was surprised to see that it now read five oclock for closing time but she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies and so did not see as maimie and tony saw at once that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball tonight she said there was only time now to walk to the top of the hump and back and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts you see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball never tony felt could he hope for a better chance  he had to feel this for maimie so plainly felt it for him her eager eyes asked the question is it today and he gasped and then nodded maimie slipped her hand into tonys and hers was hot but his was cold she did a very kind thing she took off her scarf and gave it to him in case you should feel cold she whispered her face was aglow but tonys was very gloomy  as they turned on the top of the hump he whispered to her im afraid nurse would see me so i shant be able to do it  maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah when there were so many unknown terrors to fear and she said aloud tony i shall race you to the gate and in a whisper then you can hide and off they ran  tony could always outdistance her easily but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide brave brave her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock instead of hiding her hero had run out at the gate at this bitter sight maimie stopped blankly as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled and then for very disdain she could not sob in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to st govors well and hid in tonys stead  when the ayah reached the gate and saw tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out twilight came on and scores and hundreds of people passed out including the last one who always has to run for it but maimie saw them not she had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears when she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart it was the stillness of the gardens then she heard clang then from another part clang then clang clang far away it was the closing of the gates  immediately the last clang had died away maimie distinctly heard a voice say so thats all right it had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above and she looked up in time to see an elm tree stretching out its arms and yawning  she was about to say i never knew you could speak when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm i suppose it is a bit coldish up there and the elm replied not particularly but you do get numb standing so long on one leg and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing and she stole away to the baby walk and crouched observantly under a minorca holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her  she was not in the least cold she was wearing a russetcoloured pelisse and had the hood over her head so that nothing of her showed except her dear little face and her curls the rest of her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a ball she was about forty round the waist  there was a good deal going on in the baby walk when maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk they moved in a jerky sort of way certainly but that was because they used crutches an elderberry hobbled across the walk and stood chatting with some young quinces and they all had crutches the crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs they were quite familiar objects to maimie but she had never known what they were for until tonight  she peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy he was a street boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees the way he did it was this he pressed a spring in the trunk and they shut like umbrellas deluging the little plants beneath with snow oh you naughty naughty child maimie cried indignantly for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears  fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot but the chrysanthemums heard her and they all said so pointedly hoitytoity what is this that she had to come out and show herself then the whole vegetable kingdom was rather puzzled what to do  of course it is no affair of ours a spindle tree said after they had whispered together but you know quite well you ought not to be here and perhaps our duty is to report you to the fairies what do you think yourself  i think you should not maimie replied which so perplexed them that they said petulantly there was no arguing with her i wouldnt ask it of you she assured them if i thought it was wrong and of course after this they could not well carry tales they then said welladay and such is life for they can be frightfully sarcastic but she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches and she said goodnaturedly before i go to the fairies ball i should like to take you for a walk one at a time you can lean on me you know  at this they clapped their hands and she escorted them up to the baby walk and back again one at a time putting an arm or a finger round the very frail setting their leg right when it got too ridiculous and treating the foreign ones quite as courteously as the english though she could not understand a word they said  they behaved well on the whole though some whimpered that she had not taken them as far as she took nancy or grace or dorothy and others jagged her but it was quite unintentional and she was too much of a lady to cry out so much walking tired her and she was anxious to be off to the ball but she no longer felt afraid the reason she felt no more fear was that it was now nighttime and in the dark you remember maimie was always rather strange  they were now loath to let her go for if the fairies see you they warned her they will mischief you stab you to death or compel you to nurse their children or turn you into something tedious like an evergreen oak as they said this they looked with affected pity at an evergreen oak for in winter they are very envious of the evergreens  oh la replied the oak bitingly how deliciously cosy it is to stand here buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked creatures shivering  this made them sulky though they had really brought it on themselves and they drew for maimie a very gloomy picture of the perils that faced her if she insisted on going to the ball  she learned from a purple filbert that the court was not in its usual good temper at present the cause being the tantalising heart of the duke of christmas daisies he was an oriental fairy very poorly of a dreadful complaint namely inability to love and though he had tried many ladies in many lands he could not fall in love with one of them queen mab who rules in the gardens had been confident that her girls would bewitch him but alas his heart the doctor said remained cold this rather irritating doctor who was his private physician felt the dukes heart immediately after any lady was presented and then always shook his bald head and murmured cold quite cold naturally queen mab felt disgraced and first she tried the effect of ordering the court into tears for nine minutes and then she blamed the cupids and decreed that they should wear fools caps until they thawed the dukes frozen heart  how i should love to see the cupids in their dear little fools caps maimie cried and away she ran to look for them very recklessly for the cupids hate to be laughed at  it is always easy to discover where a fairies ball is being held as ribbons are stretched between it and all the populous parts of the gardens on which those invited may walk to the dance without wetting their pumps this night the ribbons were red and looked very pretty on the snow  maimie walked alongside one of them for some distance without meeting anybody but at last she saw a fairy cavalcade approaching to her surprise they seemed to be returning from the ball and she had just time to hide from them by bending her knees and holding out her arms and pretending to be a garden chair there were six horsemen in front and six behind in the middle walked a prim lady wearing a long train held up by two pages and on the train as if it were a couch reclined a lovely girl for in this way do aristocratic fairies travel about she was dressed in golden rain but the most enviable part of her was her neck which was blue in colour and of a velvet texture and of course showed off her diamond necklace as no white throat could have glorified it the highborn fairies obtain this admired effect by pricking their skin which lets the blue blood come through and dye them and you cannot imagine anything so dazzling unless you have seen the ladies busts in the jewellers windows  maimie also noticed that the whole cavalcade seemed to be in a passion tilting their noses higher than it can be safe for even fairies to tilt them and she concluded that this must be another case in which the doctor had said cold quite cold  well she followed the ribbon to a place where it became a bridge over a dry puddle into which another fairy had fallen and been unable to climb out at first this little damsel was afraid of maimie who most kindly went to her aid but soon she sat in her hand chatting gaily and explaining that her name was brownie and that though only a poor street singer she was on her way to the ball to see if the duke would have her  of course she said i am rather plain and this made maimie uncomfortable for indeed the simple little creature was almost quite plain for a fairy  it was difficult to know what to reply  i see you think i have no chance brownie said falteringly  i dont say that maimie answered politely of course your face is just a tiny bit homely but really it was quite awkward for her  fortunately she remembered about her father and the bazaar he had gone to a fashionable bazaar where all the most beautiful ladies in london were on view for halfacrown the second day but on his return home instead of being dissatisfied with maimies mother he had said you cant think my dear what a relief it is to see a homely face again  maimie repeated this story and it fortified brownie tremendously indeed she had no longer the slightest doubt that the duke would choose her so she scudded away up the ribbon calling out to maimie not to follow lest the queen should mischief her  but maimies curiosity tugged her forward and presently at the seven spanish chestnuts she saw a wonderful light she crept forward until she was quite near it and then she peeped from behind a tree  the light which was as high as your head above the ground was composed of myriads of glowworms all holding on to each other and so forming a dazzling canopy over the fairy ring there were thousands of little people looking on but they were in shadow and drab in colour compared to the glorious creatures within that luminous circle who were so bewilderingly bright that maimie had to wink hard all the time she looked at them  it was amazing and even irritating to her that the duke of christmas daisies should be able to keep out of love for a moment yet out of love his dusky grace still was you could see it by the shamed looks of the queen and court though they pretended not to care by the way darling ladies brought forward for his approval burst into tears as they were told to pass on and by his own most dreary face  maimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the dukes heart and hear him give utterance to his parrot cry and she was particularly sorry for the cupids who stood in their fools caps in obscure places and every time they heard that cold quite cold bowed their disgraced little heads  she was disappointed not to see peter pan and i may as well tell you now why he was so late that night it was because his boat had got wedged on the serpentine between fields of floating ice through which he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle  the fairies had as yet scarcely missed him for they could not dance so heavy were their hearts they forget all the steps when they are sad and remember them again when they are merry david tells me that fairies never say we feel happy what they say is we feel dancey  well they were looking very undancy indeed when sudden laughter broke out among the onlookers caused by brownie who had just arrived and was insisting on her right to be presented to the duke  maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared though she had really no hope no one seemed to have the least hope except brownie herself who however was absolutely confident she was led before his grace and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart which for convenience sake was reached by a little trapdoor in his diamond shirt had begun to say mechanically cold qui when he stopped abruptly  whats this he cried and first he shook the heart like a watch and then put his ear to it  bless my soul cried the doctor and by this time of course the excitement among the spectators was tremendous fairies fainting right and left  everybody stared breathlessly at the duke who was very much startled and looked as if he would like to run away good gracious me the doctor was heard muttering and now the heart was evidently on fire for he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth  the suspense was awful  then in a loud voice and bowing low my lord duke said the physician elatedly i have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love  you cant conceive the effect of it brownie held out her arms to the duke and he flung himself into them the queen leapt into the arms of the lord chamberlain and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place for if you leap into each others arms it is a fairy wedding of course a clergyman has to be present  how the crowd cheered and leapt trumpets brayed the moon came out and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a may dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring most gladsome sight of all the cupids plucked the hated fools caps from their heads and cast them high in the air and then maimie went and spoiled everything she couldnt help it she was crazy with delight over her little friends good fortune so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy oh brownie how splendid  everybody stood still the music ceased the lights went out and all in the time you may take to say oh dear an awful sense of her peril came upon maimie too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates she heard the murmur of an angry multitude she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood and she uttered a cry of terror and fled  how she ran and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head many times she lay down and then quickly jumped up and ran on again her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the gardens the one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the figs and gone to sleep she thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her goodnight she thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket and tried to pull it over her head and when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept but it was the fairies  i am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her when she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as slay her turn her into something extremely unpleasant and so on but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front and this gave duchess brownie time to cast herself before the queen and demand a boon  every bride has a right to a boon and what she asked for was maimies life anything except that replied queen mab sternly and all the fairies chanted anything except that but when they learned how maimie had befriended brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown they gave three huzzas for the little human and set off like an army to thank her the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it they traced maimie easily by her footprints in the snow  but though they found her deep in snow in the figs it seemed impossible to thank maimie for they could not waken her they went through the form of thanking her that is to say the new king stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome but she heard not a word of it they also cleared the snow off her but soon she was covered again and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold  turn her into something that does not mind the cold seemed a good suggestion of the doctors but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake and it might melt the queen pointed out so that idea had to be given up  a magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot but though there were so many of them she was too heavy by this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs but presently the cupids had a lovely idea build a house round her they cried and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches architects were running round maimie measuring her a bricklayers yard sprang up at her feet seventyfive masons rushed up with the foundation stone and the queen laid it overseers were appointed to keep the boys off scaffoldings were run up the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning lathes and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows  the house was exactly the size of maimie and perfectly lovely one of her arms was extended and this had bothered them for a second but they built a verandah round it leading to the front door the windows were the size of a coloured picturebook and the door rather smaller but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof the fairies as is their custom clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness and they were all so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it so they gave it ever so many little extra touches and even then they added more extra touches  for instance two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney  now we fear it is quite finished they sighed  but no for another two ran up the ladder and tied some smoke to the chimney  that certainly finishes it they cried reluctantly  not at all cried a glowworm if she were to wake without seeing a nightlight she might be frightened so i shall be her nightlight  wait one moment said a china merchant and i shall make you a saucer  now alas it was absolutely finished  oh dear no  gracious me cried a brass manufacturer theres no handle on the door and he put one on  an ironmonger added a scraper and an old lady ran up with a doormat carpenters arrived with a waterbutt and the painters insisted on painting it  finished at last  finished how can it be finished the plumber demanded scornfully before hot and cold are put in and he put in hot and cold then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcinghouses and soon they had a flower garden to the right of the verandah and a vegetable garden to the left and roses and clematis on the walls of the house and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom  oh how beautiful the little house was now but it was at last finished true as true and they had to leave it and return to the dance they all kissed their hands to it as they went away and the last to go was brownie she stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney  all through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the figs taking care of maimie and she never knew she slept until the dream was quite finished and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg and then she almost fell asleep again and then she called out  tony for she thought she was at home in the nursery as tony made no answer she sat up whereupon her head hit the roof and it opened like the lid of a box and to her bewilderment she saw all around her the kensington gardens lying deep in snow as she was not in the nursery she wondered whether this was really herself so she pinched her cheeks and then she knew it was herself and this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great adventure she remembered now everything that had happened to her from the closing of the gates up to her running away from the fairies but however she asked herself had she got into this funny place she stepped out by the roof right over the garden and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night it so entranced her that she could think of nothing else  oh you darling oh you sweet oh you love she cried  perhaps a human voice frightened the little house or maybe it now knew that its work was done for no sooner had maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now it always remained as complete as ever but it became smaller and smaller and the garden dwindled at the same time and the snow crept closer lapping house and garden up now the house was the size of a little dogs kennel and now of a noahs ark but still you could see the smoke and the doorhandle and the roses on the wall every one complete the glowworm fight was waning too but it was still there darling loveliest dont go maimie cried falling on her knees for the little house was now the size of a reel of thread but still quite complete but as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse of snow  maimie stamped her foot naughtily and was putting her fingers to her eyes when she heard a kind voice say dont cry pretty human dont cry and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully she knew at once that he must be peter pan     lockout time  it is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies and almost the only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever there are children long ago children were forbidden the gardens and at that time there was not a fairy in the place then the children were admitted and the fairies came trooping in that very evening they cant resist following the children but you seldom see them partly because they live in the daytime behind the railings where you are not allowed to go and also partly because they are so cunning they are not a bit cunning after lockout but until lockout my word  when you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well and you remember a good deal about them in your babyhood which it is a great pity you cant write down for gradually you forget and i have heard of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy very likely if they said this in the kensington gardens they were standing looking at a fairy all the time the reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else this is one of their best tricks they usually pretend to be flowers because the court sits in the fairies basin and there are so many flowers there and all along the baby walk that a flower is the thing least likely to attract attention they dress exactly like flowers and change with the seasons putting on white when lilies are in and blue for bluebells and so on they like crocus and hyacinth time best of all as they are partial to a bit of colour but tulips except white ones which are the fairycradles they consider garish and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips for days so that the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time to catch them  when they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively but if you look and they fear there is no time to hide they stand quite still pretending to be flowers then after you have passed without knowing that they were fairies they rush home and tell their mothers they have had such an adventure the fairy basin you remember is all covered with groundivy from which they make their castoroil with flowers growing in it here and there most of them really are flowers but some of them are fairies you never can be sure of them but a good plan is to walk by looking the other way and then turn round sharply another good plan which david and i sometimes follow is to stare them down after a long time they cant help winking and then you know for certain that they are fairies  there are also numbers of them along the baby walk which is a famous gentle place as spots frequented by fairies are called once twentyfour of them had an extraordinary adventure they were a girls school out for a walk with the governess and all wearing hyacinth gowns when she suddenly put her finger to her mouth and then they all stood still on an empty bed and pretended to be hyacinths unfortunately what the governess had heard was two gardeners coming to plant new flowers in that very bed they were wheeling a handcart with flowers in it and were quite surprised to find the bed occupied pity to lift them hyacinths said the one man dukes orders replied the other and having emptied the cart they dug up the boardingschool and put the poor terrified things in it in five rows of course neither the governess nor the girls dare let on that they were fairies so they were carted far away to a pottingshed out of which they escaped in the night without their shoes but there was a great row about it among the parents and the school was ruined  as for their houses it is no use looking for them because they are the exact opposite of our houses you can see our houses by day but you cant see them by dark well you can see their houses by dark but you cant see them by day for they are the colour of night and i never heard of anyone yet who could see night in the daytime this does not mean that they are black for night has its colours just as day has but ever so much brighter their blues and reds and greens are like ours with a light behind them the palace is entirely built of manycoloured glasses and is quite the loveliest of all royal residences but the queen sometimes complains because the common people will peep in to see what she is doing they are very inquisitive folk and press quite hard against the glass and that is why their noses are mostly snubby the streets are miles long and very twisty and have paths on each side made of bright worsted the birds used to steal the worsted for their nests but a policeman has been appointed to hold on at the other end  one of the great differences between the fairies and us is that they never do anything useful when the first baby laughed for the first time his laugh broke into a million pieces and they all went skipping about that was the beginning of fairies they look tremendously busy you know as if they had not a moment to spare but if you were to ask them what they are doing they could not tell you in the least they are frightfully ignorant and everything they do is makebelieve they have a postman but he never calls except at christmas with his little box and though they have beautiful schools nothing is taught in them the youngest child being chief person is always elected mistress and when she has called the roll they all go out for a walk and never come back it is a very noticeable thing that in fairy families the youngest is always chief person and usually becomes a prince or princess and children remember this and think it must be so among humans also and that is why they are often made uneasy when they come upon their mother furtively putting new frills on the basinette  you have probably observed that your babysister wants to do all sorts of things that your mother and her nurse want her not to do to stand up at sittingdown time and to sit down at standingup time for instance or to wake up when she should fall asleep or to crawl on the floor when she is wearing her best frock and so on and perhaps you put this down to naughtiness but it is not it simply means that she is doing as she has seen the fairies do she begins by following their ways and it takes about two years to get her into the human ways her fits of passion which are awful to behold and are usually called teething are no such thing they are her natural exasperation because we dont understand her though she is talking an intelligible language she is talking fairy the reason mothers and nurses know what her remarks mean before other people know as that guch means give it to me at once while wa is why do you wear such a funny hat is because mixing so much with babies they have picked up a little of the fairy language  of late david has been thinking back hard about the fairy tongue with his hands clutching his temples and he has remembered a number of their phrases which i shall tell you some day if i dont forget he had heard them in the days when he was a thrush and though i suggested to him that perhaps it is really bird language he is remembering he says not for these phrases are about fun and adventures and the birds talked of nothing but nestbuilding he distinctly remembers that the birds used to go from spot to spot like ladies at shopwindows looking at the different nests and saying not my colour my dear and how would that do with a soft lining and but will it wear and what hideous trimming and so on  the fairies are exquisite dancers and that is why one of the first things the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry when you do it they hold their great balls in the open air in what is called a fairyring for weeks afterward you can see the ring on the grass it is not there when they begin but they make it by waltzing round and round sometimes you will find mushrooms inside the ring and these are fairy chairs that the servants have forgotten to clear away the chairs and the rings are the only telltale marks these little people leave behind them and they would remove even these were they not so fond of dancing that they toe it till the very moment of the opening of the gates david and i once found a fairyring quite warm  but there is also a way of finding out about the ball before it takes place you know the boards which tell at what time the gardens are to close today well these tricky fairies sometimes slyly change the board on a ball night so that it says the gardens are to close at sixthirty for instance instead of at seven this enables them to get begun half an hour earlier  if on such a night we could remain behind in the gardens as the famous maimie mannering did we might see delicious sights hundreds of lovely fairies hastening to the ball the married ones wearing their weddingrings round their waists the gentlemen all in uniform holding up the ladies trains and linkmen running in front carrying winter cherries which are the fairylanterns the cloakroom where they put on their silver slippers and get a ticket for their wraps the flowers streaming up from the baby walk to look on and always welcome because they can lend a pin the suppertable with queen mab at the head of it and behind her chair the lord chamberlain who carries a dandelion on which he blows when her majesty wants to know the time  the tablecloth varies according to the seasons and in may it is made of chestnutblossom the way the fairyservants do is this the men scores of them climb up the trees and shake the branches and the blossom falls like snow then the lady servants sweep it together by whisking their skirts until it is exactly like a tablecloth and that is how they get their tablecloth  they have real glasses and real wine of three kinds namely blackthorn wine berberris wine and cowslip wine and the queen pours out but the bottles are so heavy that she just pretends to pour out there is bread and butter to begin with of the size of a threepenny bit and cakes to end with and they are so small that they have no crumbs the fairies sit round on mushrooms and at first they are very wellbehaved and always cough off the table and so on but after a bit they are not so wellbehaved and stick their fingers into the butter which is got from the roots of old trees and the really horrid ones crawl over the tablecloth chasing sugar or other delicacies with their tongues when the queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and put away and then everybody adjourns to the dance the queen walking in front while the lord chamberlain walks behind her carrying two little pots one of which contains the juice of wallflower and the other the juice of solomons seals wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit and solomons seals juice is for bruises they bruise very easily and when peter plays faster and faster they foot it till they fall down in fits for as you know without my telling you peter pan is the fairies orchestra he sits in the middle of the ring and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays without him p p is written on the corner of the invitationcards sent out by all really good families they are grateful little people too and at the princesss comingofage ball they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every month they gave him the wish of his heart  the way it was done was this the queen ordered him to kneel and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart then they all gathered round peter to hear what was the wish of his heart but for a long time he hesitated not being certain what it was himself  if i chose to go back to mother he asked at last could you give me that wish  now this question vexed them for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music so the queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said pooh ask for a much bigger wish than that  is that quite a little wish he inquired  as little as this the queen answered putting her hands near each other  what size is a big wish he asked  she measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length  then peter reflected and said well then i think i shall have two little wishes instead of one big one  of course the fairies had to agree though his cleverness rather shocked them and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother but with the right to return to the gardens if he found her disappointing his second wish he would hold in reserve  they tried to dissuade him and even put obstacles in the way  i can give you the power to fly to her house the queen said but i cant open the door for you  the window i flew out at will be open peter said confidently mother always keeps it open in the hope that i may fly back  how do you know they asked quite surprised and really peter could not explain how he knew  i just do know he said  so as he persisted in his wish they had to grant it the way they gave him power to fly was this they all tickled him on the shoulder and soon he felt a funny itching in that part and then up he rose higher and higher and flew away out of the gardens and over the housetops  it was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his old home he skimmed away over st pauls to the crystal palace and back by the river and regents park and by the time he reached his mothers window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird  the window was wide open just as he knew it would be and in he fluttered and there was his mother lying asleep  peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her she lay with her head on her hand and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair he remembered though he had long forgotten it that she always gave her hair a holiday at night  how sweet the frills of her nightgown were he was very glad she was such a pretty mother  but she looked sad and he knew why she looked sad one of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something and he knew what it wanted to go round  oh mother said peter to himself if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed  very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made and he could see by her face that she liked it he knew he had but to say mother ever so softly and she would wake up they always wake up at once if it is you that says their name then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight how nice that would be to him but oh how exquisitely delicious it would be to her that i am afraid is how peter regarded it in returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have nothing can be more splendid he thought than to have a little boy of your own how proud of him they are and very right and proper too  but why does peter sit so long on the rail why does he not tell his mother that he has come back  i quite shrink from the truth which is that he sat there in two minds sometimes he looked longingly at his mother and sometimes he looked longingly at the window certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again but on the other hand what times those had been in the gardens was he so sure that he would enjoy wearing clothes again he popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments they were still there but he could not remember how you put them on the socks for instance were they worn on the hands or on the feet he was about to try one of them on his hand when he had a great adventure perhaps the drawer had creaked at any rate his mother woke up for he heard her say peter as if it was the most lovely word in the language he remained sitting on the floor and held his breath wondering how she knew that he had come back if she said peter again he meant to cry mother and run to her but she spoke no more she made little moans only and when next he peeped at her she was once more asleep with tears on her face  it made peter very miserable and what do you think was the first thing he did sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe he had made it up himself out of the way she said peter and he never stopped playing until she looked happy  he thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say oh peter how exquisitely you play however as she now seemed comfortable he again cast looks at the window you must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back he had quite decided to be his mothers boy but hesitated about beginning tonight it was the second wish which troubled him he no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful and of course he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies also if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad he asked himself if he had not been hardhearted to fly away without saying goodbye to solomon i should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more he said wistfully to his sleeping mother he quite argued with her as if she could hear him it would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure he said coaxingly i promise to come back he said solemnly and meant it too  and in the end you know he flew away twice he came back from the window wanting to kiss his mother but he feared the delight of it might waken her so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe and then he flew back to the gardens  many nights and even months passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish and i am not sure that i quite know why he delayed so long one reason was that he had so many goodbyes to say not only to his particular friends but to a hundred favourite spots then he had his last sail and his very last sail and his last sail of all and so on again a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour and another comfortable reason was that after all there was no hurry for his mother would never weary of waiting for him this last reason displeased old solomon for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work such as never put off laying today because you can lay tomorrow and in this world there are no second chances and yet here was peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it the birds pointed this out to each other and fell into lazy habits  but mind you though peter was so slow in going back to his mother he was quite decided to go back the best proof of this was his caution with the fairies they were most anxious that he should remain in the gardens to play to them and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as i wish the grass was not so wet and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry i do wish you would keep time then they would have said that this was his second wish but he smoked their design and though on occasions he began i wish he always stopped in time so when at last he said to them bravely i wish now to go back to mother for ever and always they had to tickle his shoulder and let him go  he went in a hurry in the end because he had dreamt that his mother was crying and he knew what was the great thing she cried for and that a hug from her splendid peter would quickly make her to smile oh he felt sure of it and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window which was always to be open for him  but the window was closed and there were iron bars on it and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy  peter called mother mother but she heard him not in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars he had to fly back sobbing to the gardens and he never saw his dear again what a glorious boy he had meant to be to her ah peter we who have made the great mistake how differently we should all act at the second chance but solomon was right there is no second chance not for most of us when we reach the window it is lockout time the iron bars are up for life
