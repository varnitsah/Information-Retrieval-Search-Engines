shapes and shrieks and sights   unholy   find out some uncouth cell   where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings   and the nightraven sings   there under ebon shades and lowbrowed rocks   as ragged as thy locks   in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell   but come thou goddess fair and free   in heaven yclept euphrosyne   and by men hearteasing mirth   whom lovely venus at a birth   with two sister graces more   to ivycrowned bacchus bore   or whether as some sager sing   the frolic wind that breathes the spring   zephyr with aurora playing   as he met her once amaying   there on beds of violets blue   and freshblown roses washed in dew   filled her with thee a daughter fair   so buxom blithe and debonair   haste thee nymph and bring with thee   jest and youthful jollity   quips and cranks and wanton wiles   nods and becks and wreathed smiles   such as hang on hebes cheek   and love to live in dimple sleek   sport that wrinkled care derides   and laughter holding both his sides   come and trip it as you go   on the light fantastic toe   and in thy right hand lead with thee   the mountainnymph sweet liberty   and if i give thee honour due   mirth admit me of thy crew   to live with her and live with thee   in unreproved pleasures free   to hear the lark begin his flight   and singing startle the dull night   from his watchtower in the skies   till the dappled dawn doth rise   then to come in spite of sorrow   and at my window bid goodmorrow   through the sweetbriar or the vine   or the twisted eglantine   while the cock with lively din   scatters the rear of darkness thin   and to the stack or the barndoor   stoutly struts his dames before   oft listening how the hounds and horn   cheerly rouse the slumbering morn   from the side of some hoar hill   through the high wood echoing shrill   sometime walking not unseen   by hedgerow elms on hillocks green   right against the eastern gate   where the great sun begins his state   robed in flames and amber light   the clouds in thousand liveries dight   while the ploughman near at hand   whistles oer the furrowed land   and the milkmaid singeth blithe   and the mower whets his scythe   and every shepherd tells his tale   under the hawthorn in the dale   straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures   whilst the landskip round it measures   russet lawns and fallows grey   where the nibbling flocks do stray   mountains on whose barren breast   the labouring clouds do often rest   meadows trim with daisies pied   shallow brooks and rivers wide   towers and battlements it sees   bosomed high in tufted trees   where perhaps some beauty lies   the cynosure of neighbouring eyes   hard by a cottage chimney smokes   from betwixt two aged oaks   where corydon and thyrsis met   are at their savoury dinner set   of herbs and other country messes   which the neathanded phyllis dresses   and then in haste her bower she leaves   with thestylis to bind the sheaves   or if the earlier season lead   to the tanned haycock in the mead   sometimes with secure delight   the upland hamlets will invite   when the merry bells ring round   and the jocund rebecks sound   to many a youth and many a maid   dancing in the chequered shade   and young and old come forth to play   on a sunshine holiday   till the livelong daylight fail   then to the spicy nutbrown ale   with stories told of many a feat   how faery mab the junkets eat   she was pinched and pulled she said   and he by friars lantern led   tells how the drudging goblin sweat   to earn his creambowl duly set   when in one night ere glimpse of morn   his shadowy flail hath threshed the corn   that ten daylabourers could not end   then lies him down the lubber fiend   and stretched out all the chimneys length   basks at the fire his hairy strength   and cropfull out of doors he flings   ere the first cock his matin rings   thus done the tales to bed they creep   by whispering winds soon lulled asleep   towered cities please us then   and the busy hum of men   where throngs of knights and barons bold   in weeds of peace high triumphs hold   with store of ladies whose bright eyes   rain influence and judge the prize   of wit or arms while both contend   to win her grace whom all commend   there let hymen oft appear   in saffron robe with taper clear   and pomp and feast and revelry   with mask and antique pageantry   such sights as youthful

wanton heed and giddy cunning   the melting voice through mazes running   untwisting all the chains that tie   the hidden soul of harmony   that orpheus self may heave his head   from golden slumber on a bed   of heaped elysian flowers and hear   such strains as would have won the ear   of pluto to have quite set free   his halfregained eurydice   these delights if thou canst give   mirth with

hunt   but kerchieft in a comely cloud   while rocking winds are piping loud   or ushered with a shower still   when the gust hath blown his fill   ending on the rustling leaves   with minutedrops from off the eaves   and when the sun begins to fling   his flaring beams me goddess bring   to arched walks of twilight groves   and shadows brown that sylvan loves   of pine or monumental oak   where the rude axe with heaved stroke   was never heard the nymphs to daunt   or fright them from their hallowed haunt   there in close covert by some brook   where no profaner eye may look   hide me from days garish eye   while the bee with honeyed thigh   that at her flowery work doth sing   and the waters murmuring   with such consort as they keep   entice the dewyfeathered sleep   and let some strange mysterious dream   wave at his wings in airy stream   of lively portraiture displayed   softly on my eyelids laid   and as i wake sweet music breathe   above about or underneath   sent by some

and storied windows richly dight   casting a dim religious light   there let the pealing organ blow   to the fullvoiced quire below   in service high and anthems clear   as may with sweetness through mine ear   dissolve me into ecstasies   and bring all heaven before mine eyes   and may at last my weary age   find out the peaceful hermitage   the hairy gown and mossy cell   where i may sit and rightly spell   of every star that heaven doth shew   and every herb that sips the dew   till old experience do attain   to something like prophetic strain   these pleasures melancholy give   and i

those immortal shapes   of bright aerial spirits live insphered   in regions mild of calm and serene air   above the smoke and stir of this dim spot   which men call earth and with lowthoughted care   confined and pestered in this pinfold here   strive to keep up a frail and feverish being   unmindful of the crown that virtue gives   after this mortal change to her true servants   amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats   yet some there be that by due steps aspire   to lay their just hands on that golden key   that opes the palace of eternity   to such my errand is and but for such   i would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds   with the rank vapours of this sinworn mould            but to my task neptune besides the sway   of every salt flood and each ebbing stream   took in by lot twixt high and nether jove   imperial rule of all the seagirt isles   that like to rich and various gems inlay   the unadorned bosom of the deep   which he to grace his tributary gods   by course commits to several government   and gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns   and wield their little tridents but this isle   the greatest and the best of all the main   he quarters to his bluehaired deities   and all this tract that fronts the falling sun   a noble peer of mickle trust and power   has in his charge with tempered awe to guide   an old and haughty nation proud in arms   where his fair offspring nursed in princely lore   are coming to attend their fathers state   and newintrusted sceptre but their way   lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood   the nodding horror of whose shady brows   threats the forlorn and wandering passenger   and here their tender age might suffer peril   but that by quick command from sovran jove   i was despatched for their defence and guard   and listen why for i will tell you now   what never yet was heard in tale or song   from old or modern bard in hall or bower            bacchus that first from out the purple grape   crushed the sweet poison of misused wine   after the tuscan mariners transformed   coasting the tyrrhene shore as the winds listed   on circes island fell who knows not circe   the daughter of the sun whose charmed cup   whoever tasted lost his upright shape   and downward fell into a grovelling swine   this nymph that gazed upon his clustering locks   with ivy berries wreathed and his blithe youth   had by him ere he parted thence a son   much like his father but his mother more   whom therefore she brought up and comus named   who ripe and frolic of his fullgrown age   roving the celtic and iberian fields   at last betakes him to this ominous wood   and in thick shelter of black shades imbowered   excels his mother at her mighty art   offering to every weary traveller   his orient liquor in a crystal glass   to quench the drouth of phoebus which as they taste   for most do taste through fond intemperate thirst   soon as the potion works their human countnance   the express resemblance of the gods is changed   into some brutish form of wolf or bear   or ounce or tiger hog or bearded goat   all other parts remaining as they were   and they so perfect is their misery   not once perceive their foul disfigurement   but boast themselves more comely than before   and all their friends and native home forget   to roll with pleasure in a sensual sty   therefore when any favoured of high jove   chances to pass through this adventurous glade   swift as the sparkle of a glancing star   i shoot from heaven to give him safe convoy   as now i do but first i must put off   these my skyrobes spun out of iris woof   and take the weeds and likeness of a swain   that to the service of this house belongs   who with his soft pipe and smoothdittied song   well knows to still the wild winds when they roar   and hush the waving woods nor of less faith   and in this office of his mountain watch   likeliest and nearest to the present aid   of this occasion but i hear the

top of heaven doth hold   and the gilded car of day   his glowing axle doth allay   in the steep atlantic stream   and the slope sun his upward beam   shoots against the dusky pole   pacing toward the

be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed   about my mother circe thus i hurl   my dazzling spells into the spongy air   of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion   and give it false presentments lest the place   and my quaint habits breed astonishment   and put the damsel to suspicious flight   which must not be for thats against my course   i under fair pretence of friendly ends   and wellplaced words of glozing courtesy   baited with reasons not unplausible   wind me into the easyhearted man   and hug him into snares when once her eye   hath met the virtue of this magic dust   i shall appear some harmless villager   whom thrift keeps up about his country gear   but here she comes i fairly step aside   and hearken if i may her business hear    the lady enters             lady this way the noise was if mine ear be true   my best guide now methought it was the sound   of riot and illmanaged merriment   such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe   stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds   when for their teeming flocks and granges full   in wanton dance they praise the bounteous pan   and thank the gods amiss i should be loth   to meet the rudeness and swilled insolence   of such late wassailers yet oh where else   shall i inform my unacquainted feet   in the blind mazes of this tangled wood   my brothers when they saw me wearied out   with this long way resolving here to lodge   under the spreading favour of these pines   stepped as they said to the next thicketside   to bring me berries or such cooling fruit   as the kind hospitable woods provide   they left me then when the greyhooded even   like a sad votarist in palmers weed   rose from the hindmost wheels of phoebus wain   but where they are and why they came not back   is now the labour of my thoughts tis likeliest   they had engaged their wandering steps too far   and envious darkness ere they could return   had stole them from me else o thievish night   why shouldst thou but for some felonious end   in thy dark lantern thus close up the stars   that nature hung in heaven and filled their lamps   with everlasting oil to give due light   to the misled and lonely traveller   this is the place as well as i may guess   whence even now the tumult of loud mirth   was rife and perfect in my listening ear   yet nought but single darkness do i find   what might this be a thousand fantasies   begin to throng into my memory   of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire   and airy tongues that syllable mens names   on sands and shores and desert wildernesses   these thoughts may startle well but not astound   the virtuous mind that ever walks attended   by a strong siding champion conscience   o welcome pureeyed faith whitehanded hope   thou hovering angel girt with golden wings   and thou unblemished form of chastity   i see ye visibly and now believe   that he the supreme good to whom all things ill   are but as slavish officers of vengeance   would send a glistering guardian if need were   to keep my life and honour unassailed      was i deceived or did a sable cloud   turn forth her silver lining on the night   i did not err there does a sable cloud   turn forth her silver lining on the night   and casts a gleam over this tufted grove   i cannot hallo to my brothers but   such noise as i can make to be heard farthest   ill venture for my newenlivened spirits

that breast   and with these raptures moves the vocal air   to testify his hidden residence   how sweetly did they float upon the wings   of silence through the emptyvaulted night   at every fall smoothing the raven down   of darkness till it smiled i have oft heard   my mother circe with the sirens three   amidst the flowerykirtled naiades   culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs   who as they sung would take the prisoned soul   and lap it in elysium scylla wept   and chid her barking waves into attention   and fell charybdis murmured soft applause   yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense   and in sweet madness robbed it of itself   but such a sacred and homefelt delight   such sober certainty of waking bliss   i never heard till now ill speak to her   and she shall be

green   shall now no more be seen   fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays   as killing as the canker to the rose   or taintworm to the weanling herds that graze   or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear   when first the whitethorn blows   such lycidas thy loss to shepherds ear            where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep   closed oer the head of your loved lycidas   for neither were ye playing on the steep   where your old bards the famous druids lie   nor on the shaggy top of mona high   nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream   ay me i fondly dream   rhad ye been there s    for what could that have done   what could the muse herself that orpheus bore   the muse herself for her enchanting son   whom universal nature did lament   when by the rout that made the hideous roar   his gory visage down the stream was sent   down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore            alas what boots it with uncessant care   to tend the homely slighted shepherds trade   and strictly meditate the thankless muse   were it not better done as others use   to sport with amaryllis in the shade   or with the tangles of neaeras hair   fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise   that last infirmity of noble mind   to scorn delights and live laborious days   but the fair guerdon when we hope to find   and think to burst out into sudden blaze   comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears   and slits the thinspun life but not the praise   phoebus replied and touched my trembling ears   fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil   nor in the glistering foil   set off to the world nor in broad rumour lies   but lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes   and perfect witness of alljudging jove   as he pronounces lastly on each deed   of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed            o fountain arethuse and thou honoured flood   smoothsliding mincius crowned with vocal reeds   that strain i heard was of a higher mood   but now my oat proceeds   and listens to the herald of the sea   that came in neptunes plea   he asked the waves and asked the felon winds   what hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain   and questioned every gust of rugged wings   that blows from off each beaked promontory   they knew not of his story   and sage hippotades their answer brings   that not a blast was from his dungeon strayed   the air was calm and on the level brine   sleek panope with all her sisters played   it was that fatal and perfidious bark   built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark   that sunk so low that sacred head of thine            next camus reverend sire went footing slow   his mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge   inwrought with figures dim and on the edge   like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe   ah who hath reft quoth he my dearest pledge   last came and last did go   the pilot of the galilean lake   two massy keys he bore of metals twain   the golden opes the iron shuts amain   he shook his mitred locks and stern bespake   how well could i have spared for thee young swain   enow of such as for their bellies sake   creep and intrude and climb into the fold   of other care they little reckoning make   than how to scramble at the shearers feast   and shove away the worthy bidden guest   blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold    a sheephook or have learnt aught else the least   that to the faithful herdmans art belongs   what recks it them what need they they are sped   and when they list their lean and flashy songs   grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw   the hungry sheep look up and are not fed   but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw   rot inwardly and foul contagion spread   besides what the grim wolf with privy paw   daily devours apace and nothing said   but that twohanded engine at the door   stands ready to smite once and smite no more            return alpheus the dread voice is past   that shrunk thy streams return sicilian muse   and call the vales and bid them hither cast   their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues   ye valleys low where the mild whispers use   of shades and wanton winds and gushing brooks   on whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks   throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes   that on the green turf suck the honeyed showers   and purple all the ground with vernal flowers   bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies   the tufted crowtoe and pale jessamine   the white pink and the pansy freaked with jet   the glowing violet   the muskrose and the wellattired woodbine   with cowslips wan that hang the pensive head   and every flower that sad embroidery wears   bid amaranthus all his beauty shed   and daffadillies fill their cups with tears   to strew the laureate hearse where lycid lies   for so to interpose a little ease   let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise   ay me whilst thee the shores and sounding seas   wash far away whereer thy bones are hurled   whether beyond the stormy hebrides   where thou perhaps under the whelming tide   visitst the bottom of the monstrous world   or whether thou to our moist vows denied   sleepst by the fable of bellerus old   where the great vision of the guarded mount   looks toward namancos and bayonas hold   look homeward angel now and melt with ruth   and o ye dolphins waft the hapless youth            weep no more woeful shepherds weep no more   for lycidas your sorrow is not dead   sunk though he be beneath the watery floor   so sinks the daystar in the ocean bed   and yet anon repairs his drooping head   and tricks his beams and with newspangled ore   flames in the forehead of the morning sky   so lycidas sunk low but mounted high   through the dear might of him that walked the waves   where other groves and other streams along   with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves   and hears the unexpressive nuptial song   in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love   there entertain him all the saints above   in solemn troops and sweet societies   that sing and singing in their glory move   and wipe the tears for ever from his eyes   now lycidas the shepherds weep no more   henceforth thou art the genius of the shore   in thy large recompense and shalt be good   to all that wander in that perilous flood            thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills   while the still morn went out with sandals grey   he touched the tender stops of various quills   with eager thought warbling his doric lay   and now the sun had stretched out all the hills   and now was dropt into the western bay   at last he rose and twitched his mantle blue   tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new
